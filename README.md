# Edgar Alan Turing
Text Generation with LSTM Neural Networks using [Keras](https://keras.io/) running on top of [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/).

# Training
By using the Amazon Web Services infrastructure, we were able to access GPUs to speed up the training of our deep learning models.
A Community Amazon Machine Image was used (ami-125b2c72), which was made for the Stanford CS231n class.
The following are the specifications for the GPU Graphics Instance that was used:
```
g2.2xlarge:
  15 GiB memory,
  1 x NVIDIA GRID GPU (Kepler GK104),
  60 GB of local instance storage,
  64-bit platform
```
