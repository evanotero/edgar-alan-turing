 INTRODUCTION
 
 
 It might seem that about Blaise Pascal, and about the two works on which
 his fame is founded, everything that there is to say had been said. The
 details of his life are as fully known as we can expect to know them;
 his mathematical and physical discoveries have been treated many times;
 his religious sentiment and his theological views have been discussed
 again and again; and his prose style has been analysed by French critics
 down to the finest particular. But Pascal is one of those writers who
 will be and who must be studied afresh by men in every generation. It is
 not he who changes, but we who change. It is not our knowledge of him
 that increases, but our world that alters and our attitudes towards it.
 The history of human opinions of Pascal and of men of his stature is a
 part of the history of humanity. That indicates his permanent
 importance.
 
 The facts of Pascal's life, so far as they are necessary for this brief
 introduction to the _Pensees_, are as follows. He was born at Clermont,
 in Auvergne, in 1623. His family were people of substance of the upper
 middle class. His father was a government official, who was able to
 leave, when he died, a sufficient patrimony to his one son and his two
 daughters. In 1631 the father moved to Paris, and a few years later took
 up another government post at Rouen. Wherever he lived, the elder Pascal
 seems to have mingled with some of the best society, and with men of
 eminence in science and the arts. Blaise was educated entirely by his
 father at home. He was exceedingly precocious, indeed excessively
 precocious, for his application to studies in childhood and adolescence
 impaired his health, and is held responsible for his death at
 thirty-nine. Prodigious, though not incredible stories are preserved,
 especially of his precocity in mathematics. His mind was active rather
 than accumulative; he showed from his earliest years that disposition to
 find things out for himself, which has characterised the infancy of
 Clerk-Maxwell and other scientists. Of his later discoveries in physics
 there is no need for mention here; it must only be remembered that he
 counts as one of the greatest physicists and mathematicians of all time;
 and that his discoveries were made during the years when most scientists
 are still apprentices.
 
 The elder Pascal, Etienne, was a sincere Christian. About 1646 he fell
 in with some representatives of the religious revival within the Church
 which has become known as Jansenism--after Jansenius, Bishop of Ypres,
 whose theological work is taken as the origin of the movement. This
 period is usually spoken of as the moment of Pascal's "first
 conversion." The word "conversion," however, is too forcible to be
 applied at this point to Blaise Pascal himself. The family had always
 been devout, and the younger Pascal, though absorbed in his scientific
 work, never seems to have been afflicted with infidelity. His attention
 was then directed, certainly, to religious and theological matters; but
 the term "conversion" can only be applied to his sisters--the elder,
 already Madame Perier, and particularly the younger, Jacqueline, who at
 that time conceived a vocation for the religious life. Pascal himself
 was by no means disposed to renounce the world. After the death of the
 father in 1650 Jacqueline, a young woman of remarkable strength and
 beauty of character, wished to take her vows as a sister of Port-Royal,
 and for some time her wish remained unfulfilled owing to the opposition
 of her brother. His objection was on the purely worldly ground that she
 wished to make over her patrimony to the Order; whereas while she lived
 with him, their combined resources made it possible for him to live more
 nearly on a scale of expense congenial to his tastes. He liked, in fact,
 not only to mix with the best society, but to keep a coach and
 horses--six horses is the number at one time attributed to his carriage.
 Though he had no legal power to prevent his sister from disposing of her
 property as she elected, the amiable Jacqueline shrank from doing so
 without her brother's willing approval. The Mother Superior, Mere
 Angelique--herself an eminent personage in the history of this religious
 movement--finally persuaded the young novice to enter the order without
 the satisfaction of bringing her patrimony with her; but Jacqueline
 remained so distressed by this situation that her brother finally
 relented.
 
 So far as is known, the worldly life enjoyed by Pascal during this
 period can hardly be qualified as "dissipation," and certainly not as
 "debauchery." Even gambling may have appealed to him chiefly as
 affording a study of mathematical probabilities. He appears to have led
 such a life as any cultivated intellectual man of good position and
 independent means might lead and consider himself a model of probity and
 virtue. Not even a love-affair is laid at his door, though he is said to
 have contemplated marriage. But Jansenism, as represented by the
 religious society of Port-Royal, was morally a Puritan movement within
 the Church, and its standards of conduct were at least as severe as
 those of any Puritanism in England or America. The period of fashionable
 society, in Pascal's life, is however, of great importance in his
 development. It enlarged his knowledge of men and refined his tastes; he
 became a man of the world and never lost what he had learnt; and when he
 turned his thoughts wholly towards religion, his worldly knowledge was a
 part of his composition which is essential to the value of his work.
 
 Pascal's interest in society did not distract him from scientific
 research; nor did this period occupy much space in what is a very short
 and crowded life. Partly his natural dissatisfaction with such a life,
 once he had learned all it had to teach him, partly the influence of his
 saintly sister Jacqueline, partly increasing suffering as his health
 declined, directed him more and more out of the world and to thoughts of
 eternity. And in 1654 occurs what is called his "second conversion," but
 which might be called his conversion simply.
 
 He made a note of his mystical experience, which he kept always about
 him, and which was found, after his death, sewn into the coat which he
 was wearing. The experience occurred on 23 November, 1654, and there is
 no reason to doubt its genuineness unless we choose to deny all mystical
 experience. Now, Pascal was not a mystic, and his works are not to be
 classified amongst mystical writings; but what can only be called
 mystical experience happens to many men who do not become mystics. The
 work which he undertook soon after, the _Lettres ecrites a un
 provincial_, is a masterpiece of religious controversy at the opposite
 pole from mysticism. We know quite well that he was at the time when he
 received his illumination from God in extremely poor health; but it is a
 commonplace that some forms of illness are extremely favourable, not
 only to religious illumination, but to artistic and literary
 composition. A piece of writing meditated, apparently without progress,
 for months or years, may suddenly take shape and word; and in this state
 long passages may be produced which require little or no retouch. I have
 no good word to say for the cultivation of automatic writing as the
 model of literary composition; I doubt whether these moments _can_ be
 cultivated by the writer; but he to whom this happens assuredly has the
 sensation of being a vehicle rather than a maker. No masterpiece can be
 produced whole by such means; but neither does even the higher form of
 religious inspiration suffice for the religious life; even the most
 exalted mystic must return to the world, and use his reason to employ
 the results of his experience in daily life. You may call it communion
 with the Divine, or you may call it a temporary crystallisation of the
 mind. Until science can teach us to reproduce such phenomena at will,
 science cannot claim to have explained them; and they can be judged only
 by their fruits.
 
 From that time until his death, Pascal was closely associated with the
 society of Port-Royal which his sister Jacqueline, who predeceased him,
 had joined as a _religieuse_; the society was then fighting for its life
 against the Jesuits. Five propositions, judged by a committee of
 cardinals and theologians at Rome to be heretical, were found to be put
 forward in the work of Jansenius; and the society of Port-Royal, the
 representative of Jansenism among devotional communities, suffered a
 blow from which it never revived. It is not the place here to review the
 bitter controversy and conflict; the best account, from the point of
 view of a critic of genius who took no side, who was neither Jansenist
 nor Jesuit, Christian nor infidel, is that in the great book of
 Sainte-Beuve, _Port-Royal_. And in this book the parts devoted to Pascal
 himself are among the most brilliant pages of criticism that
 Sainte-Beuve ever wrote. It is sufficient to notice that the next
 occupation of Pascal, after his conversion, was to write these eighteen
 "Letters," which as prose are of capital importance in the foundation of
 French classical style, and which as polemic are surpassed by none, not
 by Demosthenes, or Cicero, or Swift. They have the limitation of all
 polemic and forensic: they persuade, they seduce, they are unfair. But
 it is also unfair to assert that, in these _Letters to a Provincial_,
 Pascal was attacking the Society of Jesus in itself. He was attacking
 rather a particular school of casuistry which relaxed the requirements
 of the Confessional; a school which certainly flourished amongst the
 Society of Jesus at that time, and of which the Spaniards Escobar and
 Molina are the most eminent authorities. He undoubtedly abused the art
 of quotation, as a polemical writer can hardly help but do; but there
 were abuses for him to abuse; and he did the job thoroughly. His
 _Letters_ must not be called theology. Academic theology was not a
 department in which Pascal was versed; when necessary, the fathers of
 Port-Royal came to his aid. The _Letters_ are the work of one of the
 finest mathematical minds of any time, and of a man of the world who
 addressed, not theologians, but the world in general--all of the
 cultivated and many of the less cultivated of the French laity; and with
 this public they made an astonishing success.
 
 During this time Pascal never wholly abandoned his scientific interests.
 Though in his religious writings he composed slowly and painfully, and
 revised often, in matters of mathematics his mind seemed to move with
 consummate natural ease and grace. Discoveries and inventions sprang
 from his brain without effort; among the minor devices of this later
 period, the first omnibus service in Paris is said to owe its origin to
 his inventiveness. But rapidly failing health, and absorption in the
 great work he had in mind, left him little time and energy during the
 last two years of his life.
 
 The plan of what we call the _Pensees_ formed itself about 1660. The
 completed book was to have been a carefully constructed defence of
 Christianity, a true Apology and a kind of Grammar of Assent, setting
 forth the reasons which will convince the intellect. As I have indicated
 before, Pascal was not a theologian, and on dogmatic theology had
 recourse to his spiritual advisers. Nor was he indeed a systematic
 philosopher. He was a man with an immense genius for science, and at the
 same time a natural psychologist and moralist. As he was a great
 literary artist, his book would have been also his own spiritual
 autobiography; his style, free from all diminishing idiosyncrasies, was
 yet very personal. Above all, he was a man of strong passions; and his
 intellectual passion for truth was reinforced by his passionate
 dissatisfaction with human life unless a spiritual explanation could be
 found.
 
 We must regard the _Pensees_ as merely the first notes for a work which
 he left far from completion; we have, in Sainte-Beuve's words, a tower
 of which the stones have been laid on each other, but not cemented, and
 the structure unfinished. In early years his memory had been amazingly
 retentive of anything that he wished to remember; and had it not been
 impaired by increasing illness and pain, he probably would not have been
 obliged to set down these notes at all. But taking the book as it is
 left to us, we still find that it occupies a unique place in the history
 of French literature and in the history of religious meditation.
 
 To understand the method which Pascal employs, the reader must be
 prepared to follow the process of the mind of the intelligent believer.
 The Christian thinker--and I mean the man who is trying consciously and
 conscientiously to explain to himself the sequence which culminated in
 faith, rather than the public apologist--proceeds by rejection and
 elimination. He finds the world to be so and so; he finds its character
 inexplicable by any non-religious theory; among religions he finds
 Christianity, and Catholic Christianity, to account most satisfactorily
 for the world and especially for the moral world within; and thus, by
 what Newman calls "powerful and concurrent" reasons, he finds himself
 inexorably committed to the dogma of the Incarnation. To the unbeliever,
 this method seems disingenuous and perverse; for the unbeliever is, as a
 rule, not so greatly troubled to explain the world to himself, nor so
 greatly distressed by its disorder; nor is he generally concerned (in
 modern terms) to "preserve values." He does not consider that if certain
 emotional states, certain developments of character, and what in the
 highest sense can be called "saintliness" are inherently and by
 inspection known to be good, then the satisfactory explanation of the
 world must be an explanation which will admit the "reality" of these
 values. Nor does he consider such reasoning admissible; he would, so to
 speak, trim his values according to his cloth, because to him such
 values are of no great value. The unbeliever starts from the other end,
 and as likely as not with the question: Is a case of human
 parthenogenesis credible? and this he would call going straight to the
 heart of the matter. Now Pascal's method is, on the whole, the method
 natural and right for the Christian; and the opposite method is that
 taken by Voltaire. It is worth while to remember that Voltaire, in his
 attempt to refute Pascal, has given once and for all the type of such
 refutation; and that later opponents of Pascal's Apology for the
 Christian Faith have contributed little beyond psychological
 irrelevancies. For Voltaire has presented, better than any one since,
 what is the unbelieving point of view; and in the end we must all choose
 for ourselves between one point of view and another.
 
 I have said above that Pascal's method is "on the whole" that of the
 typical Christian apologist; and this reservation was directed at
 Pascal's belief in miracles, which plays a larger part in his
 construction than it would in that, at least, of the modern liberal
 Catholic. It would seem fantastic to accept Christianity because we
 first believe the Gospel miracles to be true, and it would seem impious
 to accept it primarily because we believe more recent miracles to be
 true; we accept the miracles, or some miracles, to be true because we
 believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ: we found our belief in the miracles
 on the Gospel, not our belief in the Gospel on the miracles. But it must
 be remembered that Pascal had been deeply impressed by a contemporary
 miracle, known as the miracle of the Holy Thorn: a thorn reputed to have
 been preserved from the Crown of Our Lord was pressed upon an ulcer
 which quickly healed. Sainte-Beuve, who as a medical man felt himself on
 solid ground, discusses fully the possible explanation of this apparent
 miracle. It is true that the miracle happened at Port-Royal, and that it
 arrived opportunely to revive the depressed spirits of the community in
 its political afflictions; and it is likely that Pascal was the more
 inclined to believe a miracle which was performed upon his beloved
 sister. In any case, it probably led him to assign a place to miracles,
 in his study of faith, which is not quite that which we should give to
 them ourselves.
 
 Now the great adversary against whom Pascal set himself, from the time
 of his first conversations with M. de Saci at Port-Royal, was Montaigne.
 One cannot destroy Pascal, certainly; but of all authors Montaigne is
 one of the least destructible. You could as well dissipate a fog by
 flinging hand-grenades into it. For Montaigne is a fog, a gas, a fluid,
 insidious element. He does not reason, he insinuates, charms, and
 influences; or if he reasons, you must be prepared for his having some
 other design upon you than to convince you by his argument. It is
 hardly too much to say that Montaigne is the most essential author to
 know, if we would understand the course of French thought during the
 last three hundred years. In every way, the influence of Montaigne was
 repugnant to the men of Port-Royal. Pascal studied him with the
 intention of demolishing him. Yet, in the _Pensees_, at the very end of
 his life, we find passage after passage, and the slighter they are the
 more significant, almost "lifted" out of Montaigne, down to a figure of
 speech or a word. The parallels[A] are most often with the long essay of
 Montaigne called _Apologie de Raymond Sebond_--an astonishing piece of
 writing upon which Shakespeare also probably drew in _Hamlet_. Indeed,
 by the time a man knew Montaigne well enough to attack him, he would
 already be thoroughly infected by him.
 
     [A] Cf. the use of the simile of the _couvreur_. For comparing
     parallel passages, the edition of the _Pensees_ by Henri Massis (_A
     la cite des livres_) is better than the two-volume edition of
     Jacques Chevalier (Gabalda). It seems just possible that in the
     latter edition, and also in his biographical study (_Pascal_; by
     Jacques Chevalier, English translation, published by Sheed & Ward),
     M. Chevalier is a little over-zealous to demonstrate the perfect
     orthodoxy of Pascal.
 
 It would, however, be grossly unfair to Pascal, to Montaigne, and indeed
 to French literature, to leave the matter at that. It is no diminution
 of Pascal, but only an aggrandisement of Montaigne. Had Montaigne been
 an ordinary life-sized sceptic, a small man like Anatole France, or even
 a greater man like Renan, or even like the greatest sceptic of all,
 Voltaire, this "influence" would be to the discredit of Pascal; but if
 Montaigne had been no more than Voltaire, he could not have affected
 Pascal at all. The picture of Montaigne which offers itself first to our
 eyes, that of the original and independent solitary "personality,"
 absorbed in amused analysis of himself, is deceptive. Montaigne's is no
 _limited_ Pyrrhonism, like that of Voltaire, Renan, or France. He
 exists, so to speak, on a plan of numerous concentric circles, the most
 apparent of which is the small inmost circle, a personal puckish
 scepticism which can be easily aped if not imitated. But what makes
 Montaigne a very great figure is that he succeeded, God knows how--for
 Montaigne very likely did not know that he had done it--it is not the
 sort of thing that men _can_ observe about themselves, for it is
 essentially bigger than the individual's consciousness--he succeeded in
 giving expression to the scepticism of _every_ human being. For every
 man who thinks and lives by thought must have his own scepticism, that
 which stops at the question, that which ends in denial, or that which
 leads to faith and which is somehow integrated into the faith which
 transcends it. And Pascal, as the type of one kind of religious
 believer, which is highly passionate and ardent, but passionate only
 through a powerful and regulated intellect, is in the first sections of
 his unfinished Apology for Christianity facing unflinchingly the demon
 of doubt which is inseparable from the spirit of belief.
 
 There is accordingly something quite different from an influence which
 would prove Pascal's weakness; there is a real affinity between his
 doubt and that of Montaigne; and through the common kinship with
 Montaigne Pascal is related to the noble and distinguished line of
 French moralists, from La Rochefoucauld down. In the honesty with which
 they face the _donnees_ of the actual world this French tradition has a
 unique quality in European literature, and in the seventeenth century
 Hobbes is crude and uncivilised in comparison.
 
 Pascal is a man of the world among ascetics, and an ascetic among men of
 the world; he had the knowledge of worldliness and the passion of
 asceticism, and in him the two are fused into an individual whole. The
 majority of mankind is lazy-minded, incurious, absorbed in vanities, and
 tepid in emotion, and is therefore incapable of either much doubt or
 much faith; and when the ordinary man calls himself a sceptic or an
 unbeliever, that is ordinarily a simple pose, cloaking a disinclination
 to think anything out to a conclusion. Pascal's disillusioned analysis
 of human bondage is sometimes interpreted to mean that Pascal was really
 and finally an unbeliever, who, in his despair, was incapable of
 enduring reality and enjoying the heroic satisfaction of the free man's
 worship of nothing. His despair, his disillusion, are, however, no
 illustration of personal weakness; they are perfectly objective, because
 they are essential moments in the progress of the intellectual soul; and
 for the type of Pascal they are the analogue of the drought, the dark
 night, which is an essential stage in the progress of the Christian
 mystic. A similar despair, when it is arrived at by a diseased character
 or an impure soul, may issue in the most disastrous consequences though
 with the most superb manifestations; and thus we get _Gulliver's
 Travels_; but in Pascal we find no such distortion; his despair is in
 itself more terrible than Swift's, because our heart tells us that it
 corresponds exactly to the facts and cannot be dismissed as mental
 disease; but it was also a despair which was a necessary prelude to, and
 element in, the joy of faith.
 
 I do not wish to enter any further than necessary upon the question of
 the heterodoxy of Jansenism; and it is no concern of this essay, whether
 the Five Propositions condemned at Rome were really maintained by
 Jansenius in his book _Augustinus_; or whether we should deplore or
 approve the consequent decay (indeed with some persecution) of
 Port-Royal. It is impossible to discuss the matter without becoming
 involved as a controversialist either for or against Rome. But in a man
 of the type of Pascal--and the type always exists--there is, I think, an
 ingredient of what may be called Jansenism of temperament, without
 identifying it with the Jansenism of Jansenius and of other devout and
 sincere, but not immensely gifted doctors.[B] It is accordingly needful
 to state in brief what the dangerous doctrine of Jansenius was, without
 advancing too far into theological refinements. It is recognised in
 Christian theology--and indeed on a lower plane it is recognised by all
 men in affairs of daily life--that freewill or the natural effort and
 ability of the individual man, and also supernatural _grace_, a gift
 accorded we know not quite how, are both required, in co-operation, for
 salvation. Though numerous theologians have set their wits at the
 problem, it ends in a mystery which we can perceive but not finally
 decipher. At least, it is obvious that, like any doctrine, a slight
 excess or deviation to one side or the other will precipitate a heresy.
 The Pelagians, who were refuted by St. Augustine, emphasised the
 efficacy of human effort and belittled the importance of supernatural
 grace. The Calvinists emphasised the degradation of man through Original
 Sin, and considered mankind so corrupt that the will was of no avail;
 and thus fell into the doctrine of predestination. It was upon the
 doctrine of grace according to St. Augustine that the Jansenists relied;
 and the _Augustinus_ of Jansenius was presented as a sound exposition of
 the Augustinian views.
 
     [B] The great man of Port-Royal was of course Saint-Cyran, but any
     one who is interested will certainly consult, first of all, the book
     of Sainte-Beuve mentioned.
 
 Such heresies are never antiquated, because they forever assume new
 forms. For instance, the insistence upon good works and "service" which
 is preached from many quarters, or the simple faith that any one who
 lives a good and useful life need have no "morbid" anxieties about
 salvation, is a form of Pelagianism. On the other hand, one sometimes
 hears enounced the view that it will make no real difference if all the
 traditional religious sanctions for moral behaviour break down, because
 those who are born and bred to be nice people will always prefer to
 behave nicely, and those who are not will behave otherwise in any case:
 and this is surely a form of predestination--for the hazard of being
 born a nice person or not is as uncertain as the gift of grace.
 
 It is likely that Pascal was attracted as much by the fruits of
 Jansenism in the life of Port-Royal as by the doctrine itself. This
 devout, ascetic, thoroughgoing society, striving heroically in the midst
 of a relaxed and easy-going Christianity, was formed to attract a nature
 so concentrated, so passionate, and so thoroughgoing as Pascal's. But
 the insistence upon the degraded and helpless state of man, in
 Jansenism, is something also to which we must be grateful, for to it we
 owe the magnificent analysis of human motives and occupations which was
 to have constituted the early part of his book. And apart from the
 Jansenism which is the work of a not very eminent bishop who wrote a
 Latin treatise which is now unread, there is also, so to speak, a
 Jansenism of the individual biography. A moment of Jansenism may
 naturally take place, and take place rightly, in the individual;
 particularly in the life of a man of great and intense intellectual
 powers, who cannot avoid seeing through human beings and observing the
 vanity of their thoughts and of their avocations, their dishonesty and
 self-deceptions, the insincerity of their emotions, their cowardice, the
 pettiness of their real ambitions. Actually, considering that Pascal
 died at the age of thirty-nine, one must be amazed at the balance and
 justice of his observations; much greater maturity is required for these
 qualities, than for any mathematical or scientific greatness. How easily
 his brooding on _the misery of man without God_ might have encouraged in
 him the sin of spiritual pride, the _concupiscence de l'esprit_, and how
 fast a hold he has of humility!
 
 And although Pascal brings to his work the same powers which he exerted
 in science, it is not as a scientist that he presents himself. He does
 not seem to say to the reader: I am one of the most distinguished
 scientists of the day; I understand many matters which will always be
 mysteries to you, and through science I have come to the Faith; you
 therefore who are not initiated into science ought to have faith if I
 have it. He is fully aware of the difference of subject-matter; and his
 famous distinction between the _esprit de geometrie_ and the _esprit de
 finesse_ is one to ponder over. It is the just combination of the
 scientist, the _honnete homme_, and the religious nature with a
 passionate craving for God, that makes Pascal unique. He succeeds where
 Descartes fails; for in Descartes the element of _esprit de geometrie_
 is excessive.[C] And in a few phrases about Descartes, in the present
 book, Pascal laid his finger on the place of weakness.
 
     [C] For a brilliant criticism of the errors of Descartes from a
     theological point of view the reader is referred to _Three
     Reformers_ by Jacques Maritain (translation published by Sheed &
     Ward).
 
 He who reads this book will observe at once its fragmentary nature; but
 only after some study will perceive that the fragmentariness lies in the
 expression more than in the thought. The "thoughts" cannot be detached
 from each other and quoted as if each were complete in itself. _Le coeur
 a ses raisons que la raison ne connait point_: how often one has heard
 that quoted, and quoted often to the wrong purpose! For this is by no
 means an exaltation of the "heart" over the "head," a defence of
 unreason. The heart, in Pascal's terminology, is itself truly rational
 if it is truly the heart. For him, in theological matters, which seemed
 to him much larger, more difficult, and more important than scientific
 matters, the whole personality is involved.
 
 We cannot quite understand any of the parts, fragmentary as they are,
 without some understanding of the whole. Capital, for instance, is his
 analysis of the _three orders_: the order of nature, the order of mind,
 and the order of charity. These three are _discontinuous_; the higher is
 not implicit in the lower as in an evolutionary doctrine it would be.[D]
 In this distinction Pascal offers much about which the modern world
 would do well to think. And indeed, because of his unique combination
 and balance of qualities, I know of no religious writer more pertinent
 to our time. The great mystics like St. John of the Cross, are
 primarily for readers with a special determination of purpose; the
 devotional writers, such as St. Francois de Sales, are primarily for
 those who already feel consciously desirous of the love of God; the
 great theologians are for those interested in theology. But I can think
 of no Christian writer, not Newman even, more to be commended than
 Pascal to those who doubt, but who have the mind to conceive, and the
 sensibility to feel, the disorder, the futility, the meaninglessness,
 the mystery of life and suffering, and who can only find peace through a
 satisfaction of the whole being.
 
     [D] An important modern theory of discontinuity, suggested partly by
     Pascal, is sketched in the collected fragments of _Speculations_ by
     T. E. Hulme (Kegan Paul).

 SECTION I
 
 THOUGHTS ON MIND AND ON STYLE
 
 
 1
 
 
 _The difference between the mathematical and the intuitive mind._[1]--In
 the one the principles are palpable, but removed from ordinary use; so
 that for want of habit it is difficult to turn one's mind in that
 direction: but if one turns it thither ever so little, one sees the
 principles fully, and one must have a quite inaccurate mind who reasons
 wrongly from principles so plain that it is almost impossible they
 should escape notice.
 
 But in the intuitive mind the principles are found in common use, and
 are before the eyes of everybody. One has only to look, and no effort is
 necessary; it is only a question of good eyesight, but it must be good,
 for the principles are so subtle and so numerous, that it is almost
 impossible but that some escape notice. Now the omission of one
 principle leads to error; thus one must have very clear sight to see all
 the principles, and in the next place an accurate mind not to draw false
 deductions from known principles.
 
 All mathematicians would then be intuitive if they had clear sight, for
 they do not reason incorrectly from principles known to them; and
 intuitive minds would be mathematical if they could turn their eyes to
 the principles of mathematics to which they are unused.
 
 The reason, therefore, that some intuitive minds are not mathematical is
 that they cannot at all turn their attention to the principles of
 mathematics. But the reason that mathematicians are not intuitive is
 that they do not see what is before them, and that, accustomed to the
 exact and plain principles of mathematics, and not reasoning till they
 have well inspected and arranged their principles, they are lost in
 matters of intuition where the principles do not allow of such
 arrangement. They are scarcely seen; they are felt rather than seen;
 there is the greatest difficulty in making them felt by those who do
 not of themselves perceive them. These principles are so fine and so
 numerous that a very delicate and very clear sense is needed to perceive
 them, and to judge rightly and justly when they are perceived, without
 for the most part being able to demonstrate them in order as in
 mathematics; because the principles are not known to us in the same way,
 and because it would be an endless matter to undertake it. We must see
 the matter at once, at one glance, and not by a process of reasoning, at
 least to a certain degree. And thus it is rare that mathematicians are
 intuitive, and that men of intuition are mathematicians, because
 mathematicians wish to treat matters of intuition mathematically, and
 make themselves ridiculous, wishing to begin with definitions and then
 with axioms, which is not the way to proceed in this kind of reasoning.
 Not that the mind does not do so, but it does it tacitly, naturally, and
 without technical rules; for the expression of it is beyond all men, and
 only a few can feel it.
 
 Intuitive minds, on the contrary, being thus accustomed to judge at a
 single glance, are so astonished when they are presented with
 propositions of which they understand nothing, and the way to which is
 through definitions and axioms so sterile, and which they are not
 accustomed to see thus in detail, that they are repelled and
 disheartened.
 
 But dull minds are never either intuitive or mathematical.
 
 Mathematicians who are only mathematicians have exact minds, provided
 all things are explained to them by means of definitions and axioms;
 otherwise they are inaccurate and insufferable, for they are only right
 when the principles are quite clear.
 
 And men of intuition who are only intuitive cannot have the patience to
 reach to first principles of things speculative and conceptual, which
 they have never seen in the world, and which are altogether out of the
 common.
 
 
 2
 
 There are different kinds of right understanding;[2] some have right
 understanding in a certain order of things, and not in others, where
 they go astray. Some draw conclusions well from a few premises, and this
 displays an acute judgment.
 
 Others draw conclusions well where there are many premises.
 
 For example, the former easily learn hydrostatics, where the premises
 are few, but the conclusions are so fine that only the greatest
 acuteness can reach them.
 
 And in spite of that these persons would perhaps not be great
 mathematicians, because mathematics contain a great number of premises,
 and there is perhaps a kind of intellect that can search with ease a few
 premises to the bottom, and cannot in the least penetrate those matters
 in which there are many premises.
 
 There are then two kinds of intellect: the one able to penetrate acutely
 and deeply into the conclusions of given premises, and this is the
 precise intellect; the other able to comprehend a great number of
 premises without confusing them, and this is the mathematical intellect.
 The one has force and exactness, the other comprehension. Now the one
 quality can exist without the other; the intellect can be strong and
 narrow, and can also be comprehensive and weak.
 
 
 3
 
 Those who are accustomed to judge by feeling do not understand the
 process of reasoning, for they would understand at first sight, and are
 not used to seek for principles. And others, on the contrary, who are
 accustomed to reason from principles, do not at all understand matters
 of feeling, seeking principles, and being unable to see at a glance.
 
 
 4
 
 _Mathematics, intuition._--True eloquence makes light of eloquence, true
 morality makes light of morality; that is to say, the morality of the
 judgment, which has no rules, makes light of the morality of the
 intellect.
 
 For it is to judgment that perception belongs, as science belongs to
 intellect. Intuition is the part of judgment, mathematics of intellect.
 
 To make light of philosophy is to be a true philosopher.
 
 
 5
 
 Those who judge of a work by rule[3] are in regard to others as those
 who have a watch are in regard to others. One says, "It is two hours
 ago"; the other says, "It is only three-quarters of an hour." I look at
 my watch, and say to the one, "You are weary," and to the other, "Time
 gallops with you"; for it is only an hour and a half ago, and I laugh
 at those who tell me that time goes slowly with me, and that I judge by
 imagination. They do not know that I judge by my watch.[4]
 
 
 6
 
 Just as we harm the understanding, we harm the feelings also.
 
 The understanding and the feelings are moulded by intercourse; the
 understanding and feelings are corrupted by intercourse. Thus good or
 bad society improves or corrupts them. It is, then, all-important to
 know how to choose in order to improve and not to corrupt them; and we
 cannot make this choice, if they be not already improved and not
 corrupted. Thus a circle is formed, and those are fortunate who escape
 it.
 
 
 7
 
 The greater intellect one has, the more originality one finds in men.
 Ordinary persons find no difference between men.
 
 
 8
 
 There are many people who listen to a sermon in the same way as they
 listen to vespers.
 
 
 9
 
 When we wish to correct with advantage, and to show another that he
 errs, we must notice from what side he views the matter, for on that
 side it is usually true, and admit that truth to him, but reveal to him
 the side on which it is false. He is satisfied with that, for he sees
 that he was not mistaken, and that he only failed to see all sides. Now,
 no one is offended at not seeing everything; but one does not like to be
 mistaken, and that perhaps arises from the fact that man naturally
 cannot see everything, and that naturally he cannot err in the side he
 looks at, since the perceptions of our senses are always true.
 
 
 10
 
 People are generally better persuaded by the reasons which they have
 themselves discovered than by those which have come into the mind of
 others.
 
 
 11
 
 All great amusements are dangerous to the Christian life; but among all
 those which the world has invented there is none more to be feared than
 the theatre. It is a representation of the passions so natural and so
 delicate that it excites them and gives birth to them in our hearts,
 and, above all, to that of love, principally when it is represented as
 very chaste and virtuous. For the more innocent it appears to innocent
 souls, the more they are likely to be touched by it. Its violence
 pleases our self-love, which immediately forms a desire to produce the
 same effects which are seen so well represented; and, at the same time,
 we make ourselves a conscience founded on the propriety of the feelings
 which we see there, by which the fear of pure souls is removed, since
 they imagine that it cannot hurt their purity to love with a love which
 seems to them so reasonable.
 
 So we depart from the theatre with our heart so filled with all the
 beauty and tenderness of love, the soul and the mind so persuaded of its
 innocence, that we are quite ready to receive its first impressions, or
 rather to seek an opportunity of awakening them in the heart of another,
 in order that we may receive the same pleasures and the same sacrifices
 which we have seen so well represented in the theatre.
 
 
 12
 
 Scaramouch,[5] who only thinks of one thing.
 
 The doctor,[6] who speaks for a quarter of an hour after he has said
 everything, so full is he of the desire of talking.
 
 
 13
 
 One likes to see the error, the passion of Cleobuline,[7] because she is
 unconscious of it. She would be displeasing, if she were not deceived.
 
 
 14
 
 When a natural discourse paints a passion or an effect, one feels within
 oneself the truth of what one reads, which was there before, although
 one did not know it. Hence one is inclined to love him who makes us feel
 it, for he has not shown us his own riches, but ours. And thus this
 benefit renders him pleasing to us, besides that such community of
 intellect as we have with him necessarily inclines the heart to love.
 
 
 15
 
 Eloquence, which persuades by sweetness, not by authority; as a tyrant,
 not as a king.
 
 
 16
 
 Eloquence is an art of saying things in such a way--(1) that those to
 whom we speak may listen to them without pain and with pleasure; (2)
 that they feel themselves interested, so that self-love leads them more
 willingly to reflection upon it.
 
 It consists, then, in a correspondence which we seek to establish
 between the head and the heart of those to whom we speak on the one
 hand, and, on the other, between the thoughts and the expressions which
 we employ. This assumes that we have studied well the heart of man so as
 to know all its powers, and then to find the just proportions of the
 discourse which we wish to adapt to them. We must put ourselves in the
 place of those who are to hear us, and make trial on our own heart of
 the turn which we give to our discourse in order to see whether one is
 made for the other, and whether we can assure ourselves that the hearer
 will be, as it were, forced to surrender. We ought to restrict
 ourselves, so far as possible, to the simple and natural, and not to
 magnify that which is little, or belittle that which is great. It is not
 enough that a thing be beautiful; it must be suitable to the subject,
 and there must be in it nothing of excess or defect.
 
 
 17
 
 Rivers are roads which move,[8] and which carry us whither we desire to
 go.
 
 
 18
 
 When we do not know the truth of a thing, it is of advantage that there
 should exist a common error which determines the mind of man, as, for
 example, the moon, to which is attributed the change of seasons, the
 progress of diseases, etc. For the chief malady of man is restless
 curiosity about things which he cannot understand; and it is not so bad
 for him to be in error as to be curious to no purpose.
 
 The manner in which Epictetus, Montaigne, and Salomon de Tultie[9]
 wrote, is the most usual, the most suggestive, the most remembered, and
 the oftenest quoted; because it is entirely composed of thoughts born
 from the common talk of life. As when we speak of the common error which
 exists among men that the moon is the cause of everything, we never fail
 to say that Salomon de Tultie says that when we do not know the truth
 of a thing, it is of advantage that there should exist a common error,
 etc.; which is the thought above.
 
 
 19
 
 The last thing one settles in writing a book is what one should put in
 first.
 
 
 20
 
 _Order._--Why should I undertake to divide my virtues into four rather
 than into six? Why should I rather establish virtue in four, in two, in
 one? Why into _Abstine et sustine_[10] rather than into "Follow
 Nature,"[11] or, "Conduct your private affairs without injustice," as
 Plato,[12] or anything else? But there, you will say, everything is
 contained in one word. Yes, but it is useless without explanation, and
 when we come to explain it, as soon as we unfold this maxim which
 contains all the rest, they emerge in that first confusion which you
 desired to avoid. So, when they are all included in one, they are hidden
 and useless, as in a chest, and never appear save in their natural
 confusion. Nature has established them all without including one in the
 other.
 
 
 21
 
 Nature has made all her truths independent of one another. Our art makes
 one dependent on the other. But this is not natural. Each keeps its own
 place.
 
 
 22
 
 Let no one say that I have said nothing new; the arrangement of the
 subject is new. When we play tennis, we both play with the same ball,
 but one of us places it better.
 
 I had as soon it said that I used words employed before. And in the same
 way if the same thoughts in a different arrangement do not form a
 different discourse, no more do the same words in their different
 arrangement form different thoughts!
 
 
 23
 
 Words differently arranged have a different meaning, and meanings
 differently arranged have different effects.
 
 
 24
 
 _Language._--We should not turn the mind from one thing to another,
 except for relaxation, and that when it is necessary and the time
 suitable, and not otherwise. For he that relaxes out of season wearies,
 and he who wearies us out of season makes us languid, since we turn
 quite away. So much does our perverse lust like to do the contrary of
 what those wish to obtain from us without giving us pleasure, the coin
 for which we will do whatever is wanted.
 
 
 25
 
 _Eloquence._--It requires the pleasant and the real; but the pleasant
 must itself be drawn from the true.
 
 
 26
 
 Eloquence is a painting of thought; and thus those who, after having
 painted it, add something more, make a picture instead of a portrait.
 
 
 27
 
 _Miscellaneous. Language._--Those who make antitheses by forcing words
 are like those who make false windows for symmetry. Their rule is not to
 speak accurately, but to make apt figures of speech.
 
 
 28
 
 Symmetry is what we see at a glance; based on the fact that there is no
 reason for any difference, and based also on the face of man; whence it
 happens that symmetry is only wanted in breadth, not in height or depth.
 
 
 29
 
 When we see a natural style, we are astonished and delighted; for we
 expected to see an author, and we find a man. Whereas those who have
 good taste, and who seeing a book expect to find a man, are quite
 surprised to find an author. _Plus poetice quam humane locutus es._
 Those honour Nature well, who teach that she can speak on everything,
 even on theology.
 
 
 30
 
 We only consult the ear because the heart is wanting. The rule is
 uprightness.
 
 Beauty of omission, of judgment.
 
 
 31
 
 All the false beauties which we blame in Cicero have their admirers, and
 in great number.
 
 
 32
 
 There is a certain standard of grace and beauty which consists in a
 certain relation between our nature, such as it is, weak or strong, and
 the thing which pleases us.
 
 Whatever is formed according to this standard pleases us, be it house,
 song, discourse, verse, prose, woman, birds, rivers, trees, rooms,
 dress, etc. Whatever is not made according to this standard displeases
 those who have good taste.
 
 And as there is a perfect relation between a song and a house which are
 made after a good model, because they are like this good model, though
 each after its kind; even so there is a perfect relation between things
 made after a bad model. Not that the bad model is unique, for there are
 many; but each bad sonnet, for example, on whatever false model it is
 formed, is just like a woman dressed after that model.
 
 Nothing makes us understand better the ridiculousness of a false sonnet
 than to consider nature and the standard, and then to imagine a woman or
 a house made according to that standard.
 
 
 33
 
 _Poetical beauty._--As we speak of poetical beauty, so ought we to speak
 of mathematical beauty and medical beauty. But we do not do so; and the
 reason is that we know well what is the object of mathematics, and that
 it consists in proofs, and what is the object of medicine, and that it
 consists in healing. But we do not know in what grace consists, which is
 the object of poetry. We do not know the natural model which we ought to
 imitate; and through lack of this knowledge, we have coined fantastic
 terms, "The golden age," "The wonder of our times," "Fatal," etc., and
 call this jargon poetical beauty.[13]
 
 But whoever imagines a woman after this model, which consists in saying
 little things in big words, will see a pretty girl adorned with mirrors
 and chains, at whom he will smile; because we know better wherein
 consists the charm of woman than the charm of verse. But those who are
 ignorant would admire her in this dress, and there are many villages in
 which she would be taken for the queen; hence we call sonnets made after
 this model "Village Queens."
 
 
 34
 
 No one passes in the world as skilled in verse unless he has put up the
 sign of a poet, a mathematician, etc. But educated people do not want a
 sign, and draw little distinction between the trade of a poet and that
 of an embroiderer.
 
 People of education are not called poets or mathematicians, etc.; but
 they are all these, and judges of all these. No one guesses what they
 are. When they come into society, they talk on matters about which the
 rest are talking. We do not observe in them one quality rather than
 another, save when they have to make use of it. But then we remember it,
 for it is characteristic of such persons that we do not say of them that
 they are fine speakers, when it is not a question of oratory, and that
 we say of them that they are fine speakers, when it is such a question.
 
 It is therefore false praise to give a man when we say of him, on his
 entry, that he is a very clever poet; and it is a bad sign when a man is
 not asked to give his judgment on some verses.
 
 
 35
 
 We should not be able to say of a man, "He is a mathematician," or "a
 preacher," or "eloquent"; but that he is "a gentleman." That universal
 quality alone pleases me. It is a bad sign when, on seeing a person, you
 remember his book. I would prefer you to see no quality till you meet it
 and have occasion to use it (_Ne quid nimis_[14]), for fear some one
 quality prevail and designate the man. Let none think him a fine
 speaker, unless oratory be in question, and then let them think it.
 
 
 36
 
 Man is full of wants: he loves only those who can satisfy them all.
 "This one is a good mathematician," one will say. But I have nothing to
 do with mathematics; he would take me for a proposition. "That one is a
 good soldier." He would take me for a besieged town. I need, then, an
 upright man who can accommodate himself generally to all my wants.
 
 
 37
 
 [Since we cannot be universal and know all that is to be known of
 everything, we ought to know a little about everything. For it is far
 better to know something about everything than to know all about one
 thing. This universality is the best. If we can have both, still better;
 but if we must choose, we ought to choose the former. And the world
 feels this and does so; for the world is often a good judge.]
 
 
 38
 
 A poet and not an honest man.
 
 
 39
 
 If lightning fell on low places, etc., poets, and those who can only
 reason about things of that kind, would lack proofs.
 
 
 40
 
 If we wished to prove the examples which we take to prove other things,
 we should have to take those other things to be examples; for, as we
 always believe the difficulty is in what we wish to prove, we find the
 examples clearer and a help to demonstration.
 
 Thus when we wish to demonstrate a general theorem, we must give the
 rule as applied to a particular case; but if we wish to demonstrate a
 particular case, we must begin with the general rule. For we always find
 the thing obscure which we wish to prove, and that clear which we use
 for the proof; for, when a thing is put forward to be proved, we first
 fill ourselves with the imagination that it is therefore obscure, and on
 the contrary that what is to prove it is clear, and so we understand it
 easily.
 
 
 41
 
 _Epigrams of Martial._--Man loves malice, but not against one-eyed men
 nor the unfortunate, but against the fortunate and proud. People are
 mistaken in thinking otherwise.
 
 For lust is the source of all our actions, and humanity, etc. We must
 please those who have humane and tender feelings. That epigram about two
 one-eyed people is worthless,[15] for it does not console them, and only
 gives a point to the author's glory. All that is only for the sake of
 the author is worthless. _Ambitiosa recident ornamenta_.[16]
 
 
 42
 
 To call a king "Prince" is pleasing, because it diminishes his rank.
 
 
 43
 
 Certain authors, speaking of their works, say, "My book," "My
 commentary," "My history," etc. They resemble middle-class people who
 have a house of their own, and always have "My house" on their tongue.
 They would do better to say, "Our book," "Our commentary," "Our
 history," etc., because there is in them usually more of other people's
 than their own.
 
 
 44
 
 Do you wish people to believe good of you? Don't speak.
 
 
 45
 
 Languages are ciphers, wherein letters are not changed into letters, but
 words into words, so that an unknown language is decipherable.
 
 
 46
 
 A maker of witticisms, a bad character.
 
 
 47
 
 There are some who speak well and write badly. For the place and the
 audience warm them, and draw from their minds more than they think of
 without that warmth.
 
 
 48
 
 When we find words repeated in a discourse, and, in trying to correct
 them, discover that they are so appropriate that we would spoil the
 discourse, we must leave them alone. This is the test; and our attempt
 is the work of envy, which is blind, and does not see that repetition is
 not in this place a fault; for there is no general rule.
 
 
 49
 
 To mask nature and disguise her. No more king, pope, bishop--but _august
 monarch_, etc.; not Paris--_the capital of the kingdom_. There are
 places in which we ought to call Paris, Paris, and others in which we
 ought to call it the capital of the kingdom.
 
 
 50
 
 The same meaning changes with the words which express it. Meanings
 receive their dignity from words instead of giving it to them. Examples
 should be sought....
 
 
 51
 
 Sceptic, for obstinate.
 
 
 52
 
 No one calls another a Cartesian[17] but he who is one himself, a pedant
 but a pedant, a provincial but a provincial; and I would wager it was
 the printer who put it on the title of _Letters to a Provincial_.
 
 
 53
 
 A carriage _upset_ or _overturned_, according to the meaning _To spread
 abroad_ or _upset_, according to the meaning. (The argument by force of
 M. le Maitre[18] over the friar.)
 
 
 54
 
 _Miscellaneous._--A form of speech, "I should have liked to apply myself
 to that."
 
 
 55
 
 The _aperitive_ virtue of a key, the _attractive_ virtue of a hook.
 
 
 56
 
 To guess: "The part that I take in your trouble." The Cardinal[19] did
 not want to be guessed.
 
 "My mind is disquieted." _I am disquieted_ is better.
 
 
 57
 
 I always feel uncomfortable under such compliments as these: "I have
 given you a great deal of trouble," "I am afraid I am boring you," "I
 fear this is too long." We either carry our audience with us, or
 irritate them.
 
 
 58
 
 You are ungraceful: "Excuse me, pray." Without that excuse I would not
 have known there was anything amiss. "With reverence be it spoken...."
 The only thing bad is their excuse.
 
 
 59
 
 "To extinguish the torch of sedition"; too luxuriant. "The restlessness
 of his genius"; two superfluous grand words.
 
 
 
 
 SECTION II
 
 THE MISERY OF MAN WITHOUT GOD
 
 
 60
 
 _First part_: Misery of man without God.
 
 _Second part_: Happiness of man with God.
 
 Or, _First part_: That nature is corrupt. Proved by nature itself.
 
 _Second part_: That there is a Redeemer. Proved by Scripture.
 
 
 61
 
 _Order._--I might well have taken this discourse in an order like this:
 to show the vanity of all conditions of men, to show the vanity of
 ordinary lives, and then the vanity of philosophic lives, sceptics,
 stoics; but the order would not have been kept. I know a little what it
 is, and how few people understand it. No human science can keep it.
 Saint Thomas[20] did not keep it. Mathematics keep it, but they are
 useless on account of their depth.
 
 
 62
 
 _Preface to the first part._--To speak of those who have treated of the
 knowledge of self; of the divisions of Charron,[21] which sadden and
 weary us; of the confusion of Montaigne;[22] that he was quite aware of
 his want of method, and shunned it by jumping from subject to subject;
 that he sought to be fashionable.
 
 His foolish project of describing himself! And this not casually and
 against his maxims, since every one makes mistakes, but by his maxims
 themselves, and by first and chief design. For to say silly things by
 chance and weakness is a common misfortune; but to say them
 intentionally is intolerable, and to say such as that ...
 
 
 63
 
 _Montaigne._--Montaigne's faults are great. Lewd words; this is bad,
 notwithstanding Mademoiselle de Gournay.[23] Credulous; _people without
 eyes_.[24] Ignorant; _squaring the circle,[25] a greater world_.[26] His
 opinions on suicide, on death.[27] He suggests an indifference about
 salvation, _without fear and without repentance_.[28] As his book was
 not written with a religious purpose, he was not bound to mention
 religion; but it is always our duty not to turn men from it. One can
 excuse his rather free and licentious opinions on some relations of life
 (730,231)[29]; but one cannot excuse his thoroughly pagan views on
 death, for a man must renounce piety altogether, if he does not at least
 wish to die like a Christian. Now, through the whole of his book his
 only conception of death is a cowardly and effeminate one.

 What good there is in Montaigne can only have been acquired with
 difficulty. The evil that is in him, I mean apart from his morality,
 could have been corrected in a moment, if he had been informed that he
 made too much of trifles and spoke too much of himself.

 _Man's disproportion._--[This is where our innate knowledge leads us. If
 it be not true, there is no truth in man; and if it be true, he finds
 therein great cause for humiliation, being compelled to abase himself in
 one way or another. And since he cannot exist without this knowledge, I
 wish that, before entering on deeper researches into nature, he would
 consider her both seriously and at leisure, that he would reflect upon
 himself also, and knowing what proportion there is....] Let man then
 contemplate the whole of nature in her full and grand majesty, and turn
 his vision from the low objects which surround him. Let him gaze on that
 brilliant light, set like an eternal lamp to illumine the universe; let
 the earth appear to him a point in comparison with the vast circle
 described by the sun; and let him wonder at the fact that this vast
 circle is itself but a very fine point in comparison with that described
 by the stars in their revolution round the firmament. But if our view be
 arrested there, let our imagination pass beyond; it will sooner exhaust
 the power of conception than nature that of supplying material for
 conception. The whole visible world is only an imperceptible atom in the
 ample bosom of nature. No idea approaches it. We may enlarge our
 conceptions beyond all imaginable space; we only produce atoms in
 comparison with the reality of things. It is an infinite sphere, the
 centre of which is everywhere, the circumference nowhere.[30] In short
 it is the greatest sensible mark of the almighty power of God, that
 imagination loses itself in that thought.
 
 Returning to himself, let man consider what he is in comparison with all
 existence; let him regard himself as lost in this remote corner of
 nature; and from the little cell in which he finds himself lodged, I
 mean the universe, let him estimate at their true value the earth,
 kingdoms, cities, and himself. What is a man in the Infinite?
 
 But to show him another prodigy equally astonishing, let him examine the
 most delicate things he knows. Let a mite be given him, with its minute
 body and parts incomparably more minute, limbs with their joints, veins
 in the limbs, blood in the veins, humours in the blood, drops in the
 humours, vapours in the drops. Dividing these last things again, let him
 exhaust his powers of conception, and let the last object at which he
 can arrive be now that of our discourse. Perhaps he will think that here
 is the smallest point in nature. I will let him see therein a new abyss.
 I will paint for him not only the visible universe, but all that he can
 conceive of nature's immensity in the womb of this abridged atom. Let
 him see therein an infinity of universes, each of which has its
 firmament, its planets, its earth, in the same proportion as in the
 visible world; in each earth animals, and in the last mites, in which he
 will find again all that the first had, finding still in these others
 the same thing without end and without cessation. Let him lose himself
 in wonders as amazing in their littleness as the others in their
 vastness. For who will not be astounded at the fact that our body, which
 a little while ago was imperceptible in the universe, itself
 imperceptible in the bosom of the whole, is now a colossus, a world, or
 rather a whole, in respect of the nothingness which we cannot reach? He
 who regards himself in this light will be afraid of himself, and
 observing himself sustained in the body given him by nature between
 those two abysses of the Infinite and Nothing, will tremble at the sight
 of these marvels; and I think that, as his curiosity changes into
 admiration, he will be more disposed to contemplate them in silence than
 to examine them with presumption.
 
 For in fact what is man in nature? A Nothing in comparison with the
 Infinite, an All in comparison with the Nothing, a mean between nothing
 and everything. Since he is infinitely removed from comprehending the
 extremes, the end of things and their beginning are hopelessly hidden
 from him in an impenetrable secret, he is equally incapable of seeing
 the Nothing from which he was made, and the Infinite in which he is
 swallowed up.
 
 What will he do then, but perceive the appearance of the middle of
 things, in an eternal despair of knowing either their beginning or their
 end. All things proceed from the Nothing, and are borne towards the
 Infinite. Who will follow these marvellous processes? The Author of
 these wonders understands them. None other can do so.
 
 Through failure to contemplate these Infinites, men have rashly rushed
 into the examination of nature, as though they bore some proportion to
 her. It is strange that they have wished to understand the beginnings of
 things, and thence to arrive at the knowledge of the whole, with a
 presumption as infinite as their object. For surely this design cannot
 be formed without presumption or without a capacity infinite like
 nature.
 
 If we are well informed, we understand that, as nature has graven her
 image and that of her Author on all things, they almost all partake of
 her double infinity. Thus we see that all the sciences are infinite in
 the extent of their researches. For who doubts that geometry, for
 instance, has an infinite infinity of problems to solve? They are also
 infinite in the multitude and fineness of their premises; for it is
 clear that those which are put forward as ultimate are not
 self-supporting, but are based on others which, again having others for
 their support, do not permit of finality. But we represent some as
 ultimate for reason, in the same way as in regard to material objects we
 call that an indivisible point beyond which our senses can no longer
 perceive anything, although by its nature it is infinitely divisible.
 
 Of these two Infinites of science, that of greatness is the most
 palpable, and hence a few persons have pretended to know all things. "I
 will speak of the whole,"[31] said Democritus.
 
 But the infinitely little is the least obvious. Philosophers have much
 oftener claimed to have reached it, and it is here they have all
 stumbled. This has given rise to such common titles as _First
 Principles_, _Principles of Philosophy_,[32] and the like, as
 ostentatious in fact, though not in appearance, as that one which blinds
 us, _De omni scibili_.[33]
 
 We naturally believe ourselves far more capable of reaching the centre
 of things than of embracing their circumference. The visible extent of
 the world visibly exceeds us; but as we exceed little things, we think
 ourselves more capable of knowing them. And yet we need no less capacity
 for attaining the Nothing than the All. Infinite capacity is required
 for both, and it seems to me that whoever shall have understood the
 ultimate principles of being might also attain to the knowledge of the
 Infinite. The one depends on the other, and one leads to the other.
 These extremes meet and reunite by force of distance, and find each
 other in God, and in God alone.
 
 Let us then take our compass; we are something, and we are not
 everything. The nature of our existence hides from us the knowledge of
 first beginnings which are born of the Nothing; and the littleness of
 our being conceals from us the sight of the Infinite.
 
 Our intellect holds the same position in the world of thought as our
 body occupies in the expanse of nature.
 
 Limited as we are in every way, this state which holds the mean between
 two extremes is present in all our impotence. Our senses perceive no
 extreme. Too much sound deafens us; too much light dazzles us; too great
 distance or proximity hinders our view. Too great length and too great
 brevity of discourse tend to obscurity; too much truth is paralysing (I
 know some who cannot understand that to take four from nothing leaves
 nothing). First principles are too self-evident for us; too much
 pleasure disagrees with us. Too many concords are annoying in music; too
 many benefits irritate us; we wish to have the wherewithal to over-pay
 our debts. _Beneficia eo usque laeta sunt dum videntur exsolvi posse; ubi
 multum antevenere, pro gratia odium redditur._[34] We feel neither
 extreme heat nor extreme cold. Excessive qualities are prejudicial to us
 and not perceptible by the senses; we do not feel but suffer them.
 Extreme youth and extreme age hinder the mind, as also too much and too
 little education. In short, extremes are for us as though they were not,
 and we are not within their notice. They escape us, or we them.
 
 This is our true state; this is what makes us incapable of certain
 knowledge and of absolute ignorance. We sail within a vast sphere, ever
 drifting in uncertainty, driven from end to end. When we think to attach
 ourselves to any point and to fasten to it, it wavers and leaves us; and
 if we follow it, it eludes our grasp, slips past us, and vanishes for
 ever. Nothing stays for us. This is our natural condition, and yet most
 contrary to our inclination; we burn with desire to find solid ground
 and an ultimate sure foundation whereon to build a tower reaching to the
 Infinite. But our whole groundwork cracks, and the earth opens to
 abysses.
 
 Let us therefore not look for certainty and stability. Our reason is
 always deceived by fickle shadows; nothing can fix the finite between
 the two Infinites, which both enclose and fly from it.
 
 If this be well understood, I think that we shall remain at rest, each
 in the state wherein nature has placed him. As this sphere which has
 fallen to us as our lot is always distant from either extreme, what
 matters it that man should have a little more knowledge of the universe?
 If he has it, he but gets a little higher. Is he not always infinitely
 removed from the end, and is not the duration of our life equally
 removed from eternity, even if it lasts ten years longer?
 
 In comparison with these Infinites all finites are equal, and I see no
 reason for fixing our imagination on one more than on another. The only
 comparison which we make of ourselves to the finite is painful to us.
 
 If man made himself the first object of study, he would see how
 incapable he is of going further. How can a part know the whole? But he
 may perhaps aspire to know at least the parts to which he bears some
 proportion. But the parts of the world are all so related and linked to
 one another, that I believe it impossible to know one without the other
 and without the whole.
 
 Man, for instance, is related to all he knows. He needs a place wherein
 to abide, time through which to live, motion in order to live, elements
 to compose him, warmth and food to nourish him, air to breathe. He sees
 light; he feels bodies; in short, he is in a dependent alliance with
 everything. To know man, then, it is necessary to know how it happens
 that he needs air to live, and, to know the air, we must know how it is
 thus related to the life of man, etc. Flame cannot exist without air;
 therefore to understand the one, we must understand the other.
 
 Since everything then is cause and effect, dependent and supporting,
 mediate and immediate, and all is held together by a natural though
 imperceptible chain, which binds together things most distant and most
 different, I hold it equally impossible to know the parts without
 knowing the whole, and to know the whole without knowing the parts in
 detail.
 
 [The eternity of things in itself or in God must also astonish our
 brief duration. The fixed and constant immobility of nature, in
 comparison with the continual change which goes on within us, must have
 the same effect.]
 
 And what completes our incapability of knowing things, is the fact that
 they are simple, and that we are composed of two opposite natures,
 different in kind, soul and body. For it is impossible that our rational
 part should be other than spiritual; and if any one maintain that we are
 simply corporeal, this would far more exclude us from the knowledge of
 things, there being nothing so inconceivable as to say that matter knows
 itself. It is impossible to imagine how it should know itself.
 
 So if we are simply material, we can know nothing at all; and if we are
 composed of mind and matter, we cannot know perfectly things which are
 simple, whether spiritual or corporeal. Hence it comes that almost all
 philosophers have confused ideas of things, and speak of material things
 in spiritual terms, and of spiritual things in material terms. For they
 say boldly that bodies have a tendency to fall, that they seek after
 their centre, that they fly from destruction, that they fear the void,
 that they have inclinations, sympathies, antipathies, all of which
 attributes pertain only to mind. And in speaking of minds, they consider
 them as in a place, and attribute to them movement from one place to
 another; and these are qualities which belong only to bodies.
 
 Instead of receiving the ideas of these things in their purity, we
 colour them with our own qualities, and stamp with our composite being
 all the simple things which we contemplate.
 
 Who would not think, seeing us compose all things of mind and body, but
 that this mixture would be quite intelligible to us? Yet it is the very
 thing we least understand. Man is to himself the most wonderful object
 in nature; for he cannot conceive what the body is, still less what the
 mind is, and least of all how a body should be united to a mind. This is
 the consummation of his difficulties, and yet it is his very being.
 _Modus quo corporibus adhaerent spiritus comprehendi ab hominibus non
 potest, et hoc tamen homo est_.[35] Finally, to complete the proof of
 our weakness, I shall conclude with these two considerations....

 [But perhaps this subject goes beyond the capacity of reason. Let us
 therefore examine her solutions to problems within her powers. If there
 be anything to which her own interest must have made her apply herself
 most seriously, it is the inquiry into her own sovereign good. Let us
 see, then, wherein these strong and clear-sighted souls have placed it,
 and whether they agree.
 
 One says that the sovereign good consists in virtue, another in
 pleasure, another in the knowledge of nature, another in truth, _Felix
 qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas_,[36] another in total ignorance,
 another in indolence, others in disregarding appearances, another in
 wondering at nothing, _nihil admirari prope res una quae possit facere et
 servare beatum_,[37] and the true sceptics in their indifference, doubt,
 and perpetual suspense, and others, wiser, think to find a better
 definition. We are well satisfied.
 
 _To transpose after the laws to the following title._
 
 We must see if this fine philosophy have gained nothing certain from so
 long and so intent study; perhaps at least the soul will know itself.
 Let us hear the rulers of the world on this subject. What have they
 thought of her substance? 394.[38] Have they been more fortunate in
 locating her? 395.[39] What have they found out about her origin,
 duration, and departure? 399.[40]
 
 Is then the soul too noble a subject for their feeble lights? Let us
 then abase her to matter and see if she knows whereof is made the very
 body which she animates, and those others which she contemplates and
 moves at her will. What have those great dogmatists, who are ignorant of
 nothing, known of this matter? _Harum sententiarum_,[41] 393.
 
 This would doubtless suffice, if reason were reasonable. She is
 reasonable enough to admit that she has been unable to find anything
 durable, but she does not yet despair of reaching it; she is as ardent
 as ever in this search, and is confident she has within her the
 necessary powers for this conquest. We must therefore conclude, and,
 after having examined her powers in their effects, observe them in
 themselves, and see if she has a nature and a grasp capable of laying
 hold of the truth.]

 [_Probability._--It will not be difficult to put the case a stage lower,
 and make it appear ridiculous. To begin at the very beginning.] What is
 more absurd than to say that lifeless bodies have passions, fears,
 hatreds--that insensible bodies, lifeless and incapable of life, have
 passions which presuppose at least a sensitive soul to feel them, nay
 more, that the object of their dread is the void? What is there in the
 void that could make them afraid? Nothing is more shallow and
 ridiculous. This is not all; it is said that they have in themselves a
 source of movement to shun the void. Have they arms, legs, muscles,
 nerves?

 I cannot forgive Descartes. In all his philosophy he would have been

 to set the world in motion; beyond this, he has no further need of God.

 79
 
 [_Descartes._--We must say summarily: "This is made by figure and
 motion," for it is true. But to say what these are, and to compose the
 machine, is ridiculous. For it is useless, uncertain, and painful. And
 were it true, we do not think all philosophy is worth one hour of pain.]

 How comes it that a cripple does not offend us, but that a fool
 does?[45] Because a cripple recognises that we walk straight, whereas a
 fool declares that it is we who are silly; if it were not so, we should
 feel pity and not anger.
 
 Epictetus[46] asks still more strongly: "Why are we not angry if we are
 told that we have a headache, and why are we angry if we are told that
 we reason badly, or choose wrongly?" The reason is that we are quite
 certain that we have not a headache, or are not lame, but we are not so
 sure that we make a true choice. So having assurance only because we see
 with our whole sight, it puts us into suspense and surprise when another
 with his whole sight sees the opposite, and still more so when a
 thousand others deride our choice. For we must prefer our own lights to
 those of so many others, and that is bold and difficult. There is never
 this contradiction in the feelings towards a cripple.
 
 
 81
 
 It is natural for the mind to believe, and for the will to love;[47] so
 that, for want of true objects, they must attach themselves to false.
 
 
 82
 
 _Imagination._[48]--It is that deceitful part in man, that mistress of
 error and falsity, the more deceptive that she is not always so; for she
 would be an infallible rule of truth, if she were an infallible rule of
 falsehood. But being most generally false, she gives no sign of her
 nature, impressing the same character on the true and the false.
 
 I do not speak of fools, I speak of the wisest men; and it is among them
 that the imagination has the great gift of persuasion. Reason protests
 in vain; it cannot set a true value on things.
 
 This arrogant power, the enemy of reason, who likes to rule and dominate
 it, has established in man a second nature to show how all-powerful she
 is. She makes men happy and sad, healthy and sick, rich and poor; she
 compels reason to believe, doubt, and deny; she blunts the senses, or
 quickens them; she has her fools and sages; and nothing vexes us more
 than to see that she fills her devotees with a satisfaction far more
 full and entire than does reason. Those who have a lively imagination
 are a great deal more pleased with themselves than the wise can
 reasonably be. They look down upon men with haughtiness; they argue with
 boldness and confidence, others with fear and diffidence; and this
 gaiety of countenance often gives them the advantage in the opinion of
 the hearers, such favour have the imaginary wise in the eyes of judges
 of like nature. Imagination cannot make fools wise; but she can make
 them happy, to the envy of reason which can only make its friends
 miserable; the one covers them with glory, the other with shame.
 
 What but this faculty of imagination dispenses reputation, awards
 respect and veneration to persons, works, laws, and the great? How
 insufficient are all the riches of the earth without her consent!
 
 Would you not say that this magistrate, whose venerable age commands the
 respect of a whole people, is governed by pure and lofty reason, and
 that he judges causes according to their true nature without considering
 those mere trifles which only affect the imagination of the weak? See
 him go to sermon, full of devout zeal, strengthening his reason with the
 ardour of his love. He is ready to listen with exemplary respect. Let
 the preacher appear, and let nature have given him a hoarse voice or a
 comical cast of countenance, or let his barber have given him a bad
 shave, or let by chance his dress be more dirtied than usual, then
 however great the truths he announces. I wager our senator loses his
 gravity.
 
 If the greatest philosopher in the world find himself upon a plank wider
 than actually necessary, but hanging over a precipice, his imagination
 will prevail, though his reason convince him of his safety.[49] Many
 cannot bear the thought without a cold sweat. I will not state all its
 effects.
 
 Every one knows that the sight of cats or rats, the crushing of a coal,
 etc. may unhinge the reason. The tone of voice affects the wisest, and
 changes the force of a discourse or a poem.
 
 Love or hate alters the aspect of justice. How much greater confidence
 has an advocate, retained with a large fee, in the justice of his cause!
 How much better does his bold manner make his case appear to the judges,
 deceived as they are by appearances! How ludicrous is reason, blown with
 a breath in every direction!
 
 I should have to enumerate almost every action of men who scarce waver
 save under her assaults. For reason has been obliged to yield, and the
 wisest reason takes as her own principles those which the imagination of
 man has everywhere rashly introduced. [He who would follow reason only
 would be deemed foolish by the generality of men. We must judge by the
 opinion of the majority of mankind. Because it has pleased them, we must
 work all day for pleasures seen to be imaginary; and after sleep has
 refreshed our tired reason, we must forthwith start up and rush after
 phantoms, and suffer the impressions of this mistress of the world. This
 is one of the sources of error, but it is not the only one.]
 
 Our magistrates have known well this mystery. Their red robes, the
 ermine in which they wrap themselves like furry cats,[50] the courts in
 which they administer justice, the _fleurs-de-lis_, and all such august
 apparel were necessary; if the physicians had not their cassocks and
 their mules, if the doctors had not their square caps and their robes
 four times too wide, they would never have duped the world, which cannot
 resist so original an appearance. If magistrates had true justice, and
 if physicians had the true art of healing, they would have no occasion
 for square caps; the majesty of these sciences would of itself be
 venerable enough. But having only imaginary knowledge, they must employ
 those silly tools that strike the imagination with which they have to
 deal; and thereby in fact they inspire respect. Soldiers alone are not
 disguised in this manner, because indeed their part is the most
 essential; they establish themselves by force, the others by show.
 
 Therefore our kings seek out no disguises. They do not mask themselves
 in extraordinary costumes to appear such; but they are accompanied by
 guards and halberdiers. Those armed and red-faced puppets who have hands
 and power for them alone, those trumpets and drums which go before them,
 and those legions round about them, make the stoutest tremble. They have
 not dress only, they have might. A very refined reason is required to
 regard as an ordinary man the Grand Turk, in his superb seraglio,
 surrounded by forty thousand janissaries.
 
 We cannot even see an advocate in his robe and with his cap on his head,
 without a favourable opinion of his ability. The imagination disposes of
 everything; it makes beauty, justice, and happiness, which is everything
 in the world. I should much like to see an Italian work, of which I only
 know the title, which alone is worth many books, _Della opinione regina
 del mondo_.[51] I approve of the book without knowing it, save the evil
 in it, if any. These are pretty much the effects of that deceptive
 faculty, which seems to have been expressly given us to lead us into
 necessary error. We have, however, many other sources of error.
 
 Not only are old impressions capable of misleading us; the charms of
 novelty have the same power. Hence arise all the disputes of men, who
 taunt each other either with following the false impressions of
 childhood or with running rashly after the new. Who keeps the due mean?
 Let him appear and prove it. There is no principle, however natural to
 us from infancy, which may not be made to pass for a false impression
 either of education or of sense.
 
 "Because," say some, "you have believed from childhood that a box was
 empty when you saw nothing in it, you have believed in the possibility
 of a vacuum. This is an illusion of your senses, strengthened by custom,
 which science must correct." "Because," say others, "you have been
 taught at school that there is no vacuum, you have perverted your common
 sense which clearly comprehended it, and you must correct this by
 returning to your first state." Which has deceived you, your senses or
 your education?
 
 We have another source of error in diseases.[52] They spoil the judgment
 and the senses; and if the more serious produce a sensible change, I do
 not doubt that slighter ills produce a proportionate impression.
 
 Our own interest is again a marvellous instrument for nicely putting out
 our eyes. The justest man in the world is not allowed to be judge in his
 own cause; I know some who, in order not to fall into this self-love,
 have been perfectly unjust out of opposition. The sure way of losing a
 just cause has been to get it recommended to these men by their near
 relatives.
 
 Justice and truth are two such subtle points, that our tools are too
 blunt to touch them accurately. If they reach the point, they either
 crush it, or lean all round, more on the false than on the true.
 
 [Man is so happily formed that he has no ... good of the true, and
 several excellent of the false. Let us now see how much.... But the most
 powerful cause of error is the war existing between the senses and
 reason.]
 
 
 83
 
 _We must thus begin the chapter on the deceptive powers._ Man is only a
 subject full of error, natural and ineffaceable, without grace. Nothing
 shows him the truth. Everything deceives him. These two sources of
 truth, reason and the senses, besides being both wanting in sincerity,
 deceive each other in turn. The senses mislead the reason with false
 appearances, and receive from reason in their turn the same trickery
 which they apply to her; reason has her revenge. The passions of the
 soul trouble the senses, and make false impressions upon them. They
 rival each other in falsehood and deception.[53]
 
 But besides those errors which arise accidentally and through lack of
 intelligence, with these heterogeneous faculties ...
 
 
 84
 
 The imagination enlarges little objects so as to fill our souls with a
 fantastic estimate; and, with rash insolence, it belittles the great to
 its own measure, as when talking of God.
 
 
 85
 
 Things which have most hold on us, as the concealment of our few
 possessions, are often a mere nothing. It is a nothing which our
 imagination magnifies into a mountain. Another turn of the imagination
 would make us discover this without difficulty.

 Children who are frightened at the face they have blackened are but

 weak can never become absolutely strong. We say in vain, "He has grown,
 he has changed"; he is also the same.

 Custom is our nature. He who is accustomed to the faith believes in it,
 can no longer fear hell, and believes in nothing else. He who is

 that and nothing else?

 What are our natural principles but principles of custom? In children
 they are those which they have received from the habits of their
 fathers, as hunting in animals. A different custom will cause different
 natural principles. This is seen in experience; and if there are some
 natural principles ineradicable by custom, there are also some customs
 opposed to nature, ineradicable by nature, or by a second custom. This
 depends on disposition.
 
 
 93
 
 Parents fear lest the natural love of their children may fade away. What
 kind of nature is that which is subject to decay? Custom is a second
 nature which destroys the former.[58] But what is nature? For is custom
 not natural? I am much afraid that nature is itself only a first custom,
 as custom is a second nature.
 
 
 94
 
 The nature of man is wholly natural, _omne animal_.[59]
 
 There is nothing he may not make natural; there is nothing natural he
 may not lose.
 
 
 95
 
 Memory, joy, are intuitions; and even mathematical propositions become
 intuitions, for education produces natural intuitions, and natural
 intuitions are erased by education.
 
 
 96
 
 When we are accustomed to use bad reasons for proving natural effects,
 we are not willing to receive good reasons when they are discovered. An
 example may be given from the circulation of the blood as a reason why
 the vein swells below the ligature.
 
 
 97
 
 The most important affair in life is the choice of a calling; chance
 decides it. Custom makes men masons, soldiers, slaters. "He is a good
 slater," says one, and, speaking of soldiers, remarks, "They are perfect
 fools." But others affirm, "There is nothing great but war, the rest of
 men are good for nothing." We choose our callings according as we hear
 this or that praised or despised in our childhood, for we naturally love
 truth and hate folly. These words move us; the only error is in their
 application. So great is the force of custom that out of those whom
 nature has only made men, are created all conditions of men. For some
 districts are full of masons, others of soldiers, etc. Certainly nature
 is not so uniform. It is custom then which does this, for it constrains
 nature. But sometimes nature gains the ascendancy, and preserves man's
 instinct, in spite of all custom, good or bad.
 
 
 98
 
 _Bias leading to error._--It is a deplorable thing to see all men
 deliberating on means alone, and not on the end. Each thinks how he will
 acquit himself in his condition; but as for the choice of condition, or
 of country, chance gives them to us.
 
 It is a pitiable thing to see so many Turks, heretics, and infidels
 follow the way of their fathers for the sole reason that each has been
 imbued with the prejudice that it is the best. And that fixes for each
 man his conditions of locksmith, soldier, etc.
 
 Hence savages care nothing for Providence.[60]
 
 
 99
 
 There is an universal and essential difference between the actions of
 the will and all other actions.
 
 The will is one of the chief factors in belief, not that it creates
 belief, but because things are true or false according to the aspect in
 which we look at them. The will, which prefers one aspect to another,
 turns away the mind from considering the qualities of all that it does
 not like to see; and thus the mind, moving in accord with the will,
 stops to consider the aspect which it likes, and so judges by what it
 sees.
 
 
 100
 
 _Self-love._--The nature of self-love and of this human Ego is to love
 self only and consider self only. But what will man do? He cannot
 prevent this object that he loves from being full of faults and wants.
 He wants to be great, and he sees himself small. He wants to be happy,
 and he sees himself miserable. He wants to be perfect, and he sees
 himself full of imperfections. He wants to be the object of love and
 esteem among men, and he sees that his faults merit only their hatred
 and contempt. This embarrassment in which he finds himself produces in
 him the most unrighteous and criminal passion that can be imagined; for
 he conceives a mortal enmity against that truth which reproves him, and
 which convinces him of his faults. He would annihilate it, but, unable
 to destroy it in its essence, he destroys it as far as possible in his
 own knowledge and in that of others; that is to say, he devotes all his
 attention to hiding his faults both from others and from himself, and he
 cannot endure either that others should point them out to him, or that
 they should see them.
 
 Truly it is an evil to be full of faults; but it is a still greater evil
 to be full of them, and to be unwilling to recognise them, since that is
 to add the further fault of a voluntary illusion. We do not like others
 to deceive us; we do not think it fair that they should be held in
 higher esteem by us than they deserve; it is not then fair that we
 should deceive them, and should wish them to esteem us more highly than
 we deserve.
 
 Thus, when they discover only the imperfections and vices which we
 really have, it is plain they do us no wrong, since it is not they who
 cause them; they rather do us good, since they help us to free ourselves
 from an evil, namely, the ignorance of these imperfections. We ought not
 to be angry at their knowing our faults and despising us; it is but
 right that they should know us for what we are, and should despise us,
 if we are contemptible.
 
 Such are the feelings that would arise in a heart full of equity and
 justice. What must we say then of our own heart, when we see in it a
 wholly different disposition? For is it not true that we hate truth and
 those who tell it us, and that we like them to be deceived in our
 favour, and prefer to be esteemed by them as being other than what we
 are in fact? One proof of this makes me shudder. The Catholic religion
 does not bind us to confess our sins indiscriminately to everybody; it
 allows them to remain hidden from all other men save one, to whom she
 bids us reveal the innermost recesses of our heart, and show ourselves
 as we are. There is only this one man in the world whom she orders us to
 undeceive, and she binds him to an inviolable secrecy, which makes this
 knowledge to him as if it were not. Can we imagine anything more
 charitable and pleasant? And yet the corruption of man is such that he
 finds even this law harsh; and it is one of the main reasons which has
 caused a great part of Europe to rebel against the Church.[61]
 
 How unjust and unreasonable is the heart of man, which feels it
 disagreeable to be obliged to do in regard to one man what in some
 measure it were right to do to all men! For is it right that we should
 deceive men?
 
 There are different degrees in this aversion to truth; but all may
 perhaps be said to have it in some degree, because it is inseparable
 from self-love. It is this false delicacy which makes those who are
 under the necessity of reproving others choose so many windings and
 middle courses to avoid offence. They must lessen our faults, appear to
 excuse them, intersperse praises and evidence of love and esteem.
 Despite all this, the medicine does not cease to be bitter to self-love.
 It takes as little as it can, always with disgust, and often with a
 secret spite against those who administer it.
 
 Hence it happens that if any have some interest in being loved by us,
 they are averse to render us a service which they know to be
 disagreeable. They treat us as we wish to be treated. We hate the truth,
 and they hide it from us. We desire flattery, and they flatter us. We
 like to be deceived, and they deceive us.
 
 So each degree of good fortune which raises us in the world removes us
 farther from truth, because we are most afraid of wounding those whose
 affection is most useful and whose dislike is most dangerous. A prince
 may be the byword of all Europe, and he alone will know nothing of it. I
 am not astonished. To tell the truth is useful to those to whom it is
 spoken, but disadvantageous to those who tell it, because it makes them
 disliked. Now those who live with princes love their own interests more
 than that of the prince whom they serve; and so they take care not to
 confer on him a benefit so as to injure themselves.
 
 This evil is no doubt greater and more common among the higher classes;
 but the lower are not exempt from it, since there is always some
 advantage in making men love us. Human life is thus only a perpetual
 illusion; men deceive and flatter each other. No one speaks of us in our
 presence as he does of us in our absence. Human society is founded on
 mutual deceit; few friendships would endure if each knew what his friend
 said of him in his absence, although he then spoke in sincerity and
 without passion.
 
 Man is then only disguise, falsehood, and hypocrisy, both in himself and
 in regard to others. He does not wish any one to tell him the truth; he
 avoids telling it to others, and all these dispositions, so removed from
 justice and reason, have a natural root in his heart.
 
 
 101
 
 I set it down as a fact that if all men knew what each said of the
 other, there would not be four friends in the world. This is apparent
 from the quarrels which arise from the indiscreet tales told from time
 to time. [I say, further, all men would be ...]
 
 
 102
 
 Some vices only lay hold of us by means of others, and these, like
 branches, fall on removal of the trunk.
 
 
 103
 
 The example of Alexander's chastity[62] has not made so many continent
 as that of his drunkenness has made intemperate. It is not shameful not
 to be as virtuous as he, and it seems excusable to be no more vicious.
 We do not believe ourselves to be exactly sharing in the vices of the
 vulgar, when we see that we are sharing in those of great men; and yet
 we do not observe that in these matters they are ordinary men. We hold
 on to them by the same end by which they hold on to the rabble; for,
 however exalted they are, they are still united at some point to the
 lowest of men. They are not suspended in the air, quite removed from our
 society. No, no; if they are greater than we, it is because their heads
 are higher; but their feet are as low as ours. They are all on the same
 level, and rest on the same earth; and by that extremity they are as low
 as we are, as the meanest folk, as infants, and as the beasts.
 
 
 104
 
 When our passion leads us to do something, we forget our duty; for
 example, we like a book and read it, when we ought to be doing something
 else. Now, to remind ourselves of our duty, we must set ourselves a task
 we dislike; we then plead that we have something else to do, and by this
 means remember our duty.
 
 
 105
 
 How difficult it is to submit anything to the judgment of another,
 without prejudicing his judgment by the manner in which we submit it!
 If we say, "I think it beautiful," "I think it obscure," or the like, we
 either entice the imagination into that view, or irritate it to the
 contrary. It is better to say nothing; and then the other judges
 according to what really is, that is to say, according as it then is,
 and according as the other circumstances, not of our making, have placed
 it. But we at least shall have added nothing, unless it be that silence
 also produces an effect, according to the turn and the interpretation
 which the other will be disposed to give it, or as he will guess it from
 gestures or countenance, or from the tone of the voice, if he is a
 physiognomist. So difficult is it not to upset a judgment from its
 natural place, or, rather, so rarely is it firm and stable!
 
 
 106
 
 By knowing each man's ruling passion, we are sure of pleasing him; and
 yet each has his fancies, opposed to his true good, in the very idea
 which he has of the good. It is a singularly puzzling fact.
 
 
 107
 
 _Lustravit lampade terras._[63]--The weather and my mood have little
 connection. I have my foggy and my fine days within me; my prosperity or
 misfortune has little to do with the matter. I sometimes struggle
 against luck, the glory of mastering it makes me master it gaily;
 whereas I am sometimes surfeited in the midst of good fortune.
 
 
 108
 
 Although people may have no interest in what they are saying, we must
 not absolutely conclude from this that they are not lying; for there are
 some people who lie for the mere sake of lying.
 
 
 109
 
 When we are well we wonder what we would do if we were ill, but when we
 are ill we take medicine cheerfully; the illness persuades us to do so.
 We have no longer the passions and desires for amusements and promenades
 which health gave to us, but which are incompatible with the necessities
 of illness. Nature gives us, then, passions and desires suitable to our
 present state.[64] We are only troubled by the fears which we, and not
 nature, give ourselves, for they add to the state in which we are the
 passions of the state in which we are not.
 
 As nature makes us always unhappy in every state, our desires picture to
 us a happy state; because they add to the state in which we are the
 pleasures of the state in which we are not. And if we attained to these
 pleasures, we should not be happy after all; because we should have
 other desires natural to this new state.
 
 We must particularise this general proposition....
 
 
 110
 
 The consciousness of the falsity of present pleasures, and the ignorance
 of the vanity of absent pleasures, cause inconstancy.
 
 
 111
 
 _Inconstancy._--We think we are playing on ordinary organs when playing
 upon man. Men are organs, it is true, but, odd, changeable, variable
 [with pipes not arranged in proper order. Those who only know how to
 play on ordinary organs] will not produce harmonies on these. We must
 know where [_the keys_] are.
 
 
 112
 
 _Inconstancy._--Things have different qualities, and the soul different
 inclinations; for nothing is simple which is presented to the soul, and
 the soul never presents itself simply to any object. Hence it comes that
 we weep and laugh at the same thing.
 
 
 113
 
 _Inconstancy and oddity._--To live only by work, and to rule over the
 most powerful State in the world, are very opposite things. They are
 united in the person of the great Sultan of the Turks.
 
 
 114
 
 Variety is as abundant as all tones of the voice, all ways of walking,
 coughing, blowing the nose, sneezing. We distinguish vines by their
 fruit, and call them the Condrien, the Desargues, and such and such a
 stock. Is this all? Has a vine ever produced two bunches exactly the
 same, and has a bunch two grapes alike? etc.
 
 I can never judge of the same thing exactly in the same way. I cannot
 judge of my work, while doing it. I must do as the artists, stand at a
 distance, but not too far. How far, then? Guess.
 
 
 115
 
 _Variety._--Theology is a science, but at the same time how many
 sciences? A man is a whole; but if we dissect him, will he be the head,
 the heart, the stomach, the veins, each vein, each portion of a vein,
 the blood, each humour in the blood?
 
 A town, a country-place, is from afar a town and a country-place. But,
 as we draw near, there are houses, trees, tiles, leaves, grass, ants,
 limbs of ants, in infinity. All this is contained under the name of
 country-place.
 
 
 116
 
 _Thoughts._--All is one, all is different. How many natures exist in
 man? How many vocations? And by what chance does each man ordinarily
 choose what he has heard praised? A well-turned heel.
 
 
 117
 
 _The heel of a slipper._--"Ah! How well this is turned! Here is a clever
 workman! How brave is this soldier!" This is the source of our
 inclinations, and of the choice of conditions. "How much this man
 drinks! How little that one!" This makes people sober or drunk,
 soldiers, cowards, etc.
 
 
 118
 
 Chief talent, that which rules the rest.
 
 
 119
 
 Nature imitates herself. A seed sown in good ground brings forth fruit.
 A principle, instilled into a good mind, brings forth fruit. Numbers
 imitate space, which is of a different nature.
 
 All is made and led by the same master, root, branches, and fruits;
 principles and consequences.
 
 
 120
 
 [Nature diversifies and imitates; art imitates and diversifies.]
 
 
 121
 
 Nature always begins the same things again, the years, the days, the
 hours; in like manner spaces and numbers follow each other from
 beginning to end. Thus is made a kind of infinity and eternity. Not that
 anything in all this is infinite and eternal, but these finite realities
 are infinitely multiplied. Thus it seems to me to be only the number
 which multiplies them that is infinite.
 
 
 122
 
 Time heals griefs and quarrels, for we change and are no longer the same
 persons. Neither the offender nor the offended are any more themselves.
 It is like a nation which we have provoked, but meet again after two
 generations. They are still Frenchmen, but not the same.
 
 
 123
 
 He no longer loves the person whom he loved ten years ago. I quite
 believe it. She is no longer the same, nor is he. He was young, and she
 also; she is quite different. He would perhaps love her yet, if she were
 what she was then.
 
 
 124
 
 We view things not only from different sides, but with different eyes;
 we have no wish to find them alike.
 
 
 125
 
 _Contraries._--Man is naturally credulous and incredulous, timid and
 rash.
 
 
 126
 
 Description of man: dependency, desire of independence, need.
 
 
 127
 
 Condition of man: inconstancy, weariness, unrest.
 
 
 128
 
 The weariness which is felt by us in leaving pursuits to which we are
 attached. A man dwells at home with pleasure; but if he sees a woman who
 charms him, or if he enjoys himself in play for five or six days, he is
 miserable if he returns to his former way of living. Nothing is more
 common than that.
 
 
 129
 
 Our nature consists in motion; complete rest is death.[65]
 
 
 130
 
 _Restlessness._--If a soldier, or labourer, complain of the hardship of
 his lot, set him to do nothing.
 
 
 131
 
 _Weariness._[66]--Nothing is so insufferable to man as to be completely
 at rest, without passions, without business, without diversion, without
 study. He then feels his nothingness, his forlornness, his
 insufficiency, his dependence, his weakness, his emptiness. There will
 immediately arise from the depth of his heart weariness, gloom, sadness,
 fretfulness, vexation, despair.
 
 
 132
 
 Methinks Caesar was too old to set about amusing himself with conquering
 the world.[67] Such sport was good for Augustus or Alexander. They were
 still young men, and thus difficult to restrain. But Caesar should have
 been more mature.
 
 
 133
 
 Two faces which resemble each other, make us laugh, when together, by
 their resemblance, though neither of them by itself makes us laugh.
 
 
 134
 
 How useless is painting, which attracts admiration by the resemblance of
 things, the originals of which we do not admire!
 
 
 135
 
 The struggle alone pleases us, not the victory. We love to see animals
 fighting, not the victor infuriated over the vanquished. We would only
 see the victorious end; and, as soon as it comes, we are satiated. It is
 the same in play, and the same in the search for truth. In disputes we
 like to see the clash of opinions, but not at all to contemplate truth
 when found. To observe it with pleasure, we have to see it emerge out of
 strife. So in the passions, there is pleasure in seeing the collision of
 two contraries; but when one acquires the mastery, it becomes only
 brutality. We never seek things for themselves, but for the search.
 Likewise in plays, scenes which do not rouse the emotion of fear are
 worthless, so are extreme and hopeless misery, brutal lust, and extreme
 cruelty.
 
 
 136
 
 A mere trifle consoles us, for a mere trifle distresses us.[68]
 
 
 137
 
 Without examining every particular pursuit, it is enough to comprehend
 them under diversion.
 
 
 138
 
 Men naturally slaters and of all callings, save in their own rooms.
 
 
 139
 
 _Diversion._--When I have occasionally set myself to consider the
 different distractions of men, the pains and perils to which they expose
 themselves at court or in war, whence arise so many quarrels, passions,
 bold and often bad ventures, etc., I have discovered that all the
 unhappiness of men arises from one single fact, that they cannot stay
 quietly in their own chamber. A man who has enough to live on, if he
 knew how to stay with pleasure at home, would not leave it to go to sea
 or to besiege a town. A commission in the army would not be bought so
 dearly, but that it is found insufferable not to budge from the town;
 and men only seek conversation and entering games, because they cannot
 remain with pleasure at home.
 
 But on further consideration, when, after finding the cause of all our
 ills, I have sought to discover the reason of it, I have found that
 there is one very real reason, namely, the natural poverty of our feeble
 and mortal condition, so miserable that nothing can comfort us when we
 think of it closely.
 
 Whatever condition we picture to ourselves, if we muster all the good
 things which it is possible to possess, royalty is the finest position
 in the world. Yet, when we imagine a king attended with every pleasure
 he can feel, if he be without diversion, and be left to consider and
 reflect on what he is, this feeble happiness will not sustain him; he
 will necessarily fall into forebodings of dangers, of revolutions which
 may happen, and, finally, of death and inevitable disease; so that if he
 be without what is called diversion, he is unhappy, and more unhappy
 than the least of his subjects who plays and diverts himself.
 
 Hence it comes that play and the society of women, war, and high posts,
 are so sought after. Not that there is in fact any happiness in them, or
 that men imagine true bliss to consist in money won at play, or in the
 hare which they hunt; we would not take these as a gift. We do not seek
 that easy and peaceful lot which permits us to think of our unhappy
 condition, nor the dangers of war, nor the labour of office, but the
 bustle which averts these thoughts of ours, and amuses us.
 
 Reasons why we like the chase better than the quarry.
 
 Hence it comes that men so much love noise and stir; hence it comes that
 the prison is so horrible a punishment; hence it comes that the pleasure
 of solitude is a thing incomprehensible. And it is in fact the greatest
 source of happiness in the condition of kings, that men try incessantly
 to divert them, and to procure for them all kinds of pleasures.
 
 The king is surrounded by persons whose only thought is to divert the
 king, and to prevent his thinking of self. For he is unhappy, king
 though he be, if he think of himself.
 
 This is all that men have been able to discover to make themselves
 happy. And those who philosophise on the matter, and who think men
 unreasonable for spending a whole day in chasing a hare which they would
 not have bought, scarce know our nature. The hare in itself would not
 screen us from the sight of death and calamities; but the chase which
 turns away our attention from these, does screen us.
 
 The advice given to Pyrrhus to take the rest which he was about to seek
 with so much labour, was full of difficulties.[69]
 
 [To bid a man live quietly is to bid him live happily. It is to advise
 him to be in a state perfectly happy, in which he can think at leisure
 without finding therein a cause of distress. This is to misunderstand
 nature.
 
 As men who naturally understand their own condition avoid nothing so
 much as rest, so there is nothing they leave undone in seeking turmoil.
 Not that they have an instinctive knowledge of true happiness ...
 
 So we are wrong in blaming them. Their error does not lie in seeking
 excitement, if they seek it only as a diversion; the evil is that they
 seek it as if the possession of the objects of their quest would make
 them really happy. In this respect it is right to call their quest a
 vain one. Hence in all this both the censurers and the censured do not
 understand man's true nature.]
 
 And thus, when we take the exception against them, that what they seek
 with such fervour cannot satisfy them, if they replied--as they should
 do if they considered the matter thoroughly--that they sought in it only
 a violent and impetuous occupation which turned their thoughts from
 self, and that they therefore chose an attractive object to charm and
 ardently attract them, they would leave their opponents without a
 reply. But they do not make this reply, because they do not know
 themselves.[70] They do not know that it is the chase, and not the
 quarry, which they seek.
 
 Dancing: we must consider rightly where to place our feet.--A gentleman
 sincerely believes that hunting is great and royal sport; but a beater
 is not of this opinion.
 
 They imagine that if they obtained such a post, they would then rest
 with pleasure, and are insensible of the insatiable nature of their
 desire. They think they are truly seeking quiet, and they are only
 seeking excitement.
 
 They have a secret instinct which impels them to seek amusement and
 occupation abroad, and which arises from the sense of their constant
 unhappiness. They have another secret instinct, a remnant of the
 greatness of our original nature, which teaches them that happiness in
 reality consists only in rest, and not in stir. And of these two
 contrary instincts they form within themselves a confused idea, which
 hides itself from their view in the depths of their soul, inciting them
 to aim at rest through excitement, and always to fancy that the
 satisfaction which they have not will come to them, if, by surmounting
 whatever difficulties confront them, they can thereby open the door to
 rest.
 
 Thus passes away all man's life. Men seek rest in a struggle against
 difficulties; and when they have conquered these, rest becomes
 insufferable. For we think either of the misfortunes we have or of those
 which threaten us. And even if we should see ourselves sufficiently
 sheltered on all sides, weariness of its own accord would not fail to
 arise from the depths of the heart wherein it has its natural roots, and
 to fill the mind with its poison.
 
 Thus so wretched is man that he would weary even without any cause for
 weariness from the peculiar state of his disposition; and so frivolous
 is he, that, though full of a thousand reasons for weariness, the least
 thing, such as playing billiards or hitting a ball, is sufficient to
 amuse him.
 
 But will you say what object has he in all this? The pleasure of
 bragging to-morrow among his friends that he has played better than
 another. So others sweat in their own rooms to show to the learned that
 they have solved a problem in algebra, which no one had hitherto been
 able to solve. Many more expose themselves to extreme perils, in my
 opinion as foolishly, in order to boast afterwards that they have
 captured a town. Lastly, others wear themselves out in studying all
 these things, not in order to become wiser, but only in order to prove
 that they know them; and these are the most senseless of the band, since
 they are so knowingly, whereas one may suppose of the others, that if
 they knew it, they would no longer be foolish.
 
 This man spends his life without weariness in playing every day for a
 small stake. Give him each morning the money he can win each day, on
 condition he does not play; you make him miserable. It will perhaps be
 said that he seeks the amusement of play and not the winnings. Make him
 then play for nothing; he will not become excited over it, and will feel
 bored. It is then not the amusement alone that he seeks; a languid and
 passionless amusement will weary him. He must get excited over it, and
 deceive himself by the fancy that he will be happy to win what he would
 not have as a gift on condition of not playing; and he must make for
 himself an object of passion, and excite over it his desire, his anger,
 his fear, to obtain his imagined end, as children are frightened at the
 face they have blackened.
 
 Whence comes it that this man, who lost his only son a few months ago,
 or who this morning was in such trouble through being distressed by
 lawsuits and quarrels, now no longer thinks of them? Do not wonder; he
 is quite taken up in looking out for the boar which his dogs have been
 hunting so hotly for the last six hours. He requires nothing more.
 However full of sadness a man may be, he is happy for the time, if you
 can prevail upon him to enter into some amusement; and however happy a
 man may be, he will soon be discontented and wretched, if he be not
 diverted and occupied by some passion or pursuit which prevents
 weariness from overcoming him. Without amusement there is no joy; with
 amusement there is no sadness. And this also constitutes the happiness
 of persons in high position, that they have a number of people to amuse
 them, and have the power to keep themselves in this state.
 
 Consider this. What is it to be superintendent, chancellor, first
 president, but to be in a condition wherein from early morning a large
 number of people come from all quarters to see them, so as not to leave
 them an hour in the day in which they can think of themselves? And when
 they are in disgrace and sent back to their country houses, where they
 lack neither wealth nor servants to help them on occasion, they do not
 fail to be wretched and desolate, because no one prevents them from
 thinking of themselves.

 [How does it happen that this man, so distressed at the death of his
 wife and his only son, or who has some great lawsuit which annoys him,
 is not at this moment sad, and that he seems so free from all painful
 and disquieting thoughts? We need not wonder; for a ball has been served
 him, and he must return it to his companion. He is occupied in catching
 it in its fall from the roof, to win a game. How can he think of his own
 affairs, pray, when he has this other matter in hand? Here is a care
 worthy of occupying this great soul, and taking away from him every
 other thought of the mind. This man, born to know the universe, to judge
 all causes, to govern a whole state, is altogether occupied and taken up
 with the business of catching a hare. And if he does not lower himself
 to this, and wants always to be on the strain, he will be more foolish
 still, because he would raise himself above humanity; and after all he
 is only a man, that is to say capable of little and of much, of all and
 of nothing; he is neither angel nor brute, but man.]
 
 
 141
 
 Men spend their time in following a ball or a hare; it is the pleasure
 even of kings.
 
 
 142
 
 _Diversion._--Is not the royal dignity sufficiently great in itself to
 make its possessor happy by the mere contemplation of what he is? Must
 he be diverted from this thought like ordinary folk? I see well that a
 man is made happy by diverting him from the view of his domestic sorrows
 so as to occupy all his thoughts with the care of dancing well. But will
 it be the same with a king, and will he be happier in the pursuit of
 these idle amusements than in the contemplation of his greatness? And
 what more satisfactory object could be presented to his mind? Would it
 not be a deprivation of his delight for him to occupy his soul with the
 thought of how to adjust his steps to the cadence of an air, or of how
 to throw a [ball] skilfully, instead of leaving it to enjoy quietly the
 contemplation of the majestic glory which encompasses him? Let us make
 the trial; let us leave a king all alone to reflect on himself quite at
 leisure, without any gratification of the senses, without any care in
 his mind, without society; and we will see that a king without
 diversion is a man full of wretchedness. So this is carefully avoided,
 and near the persons of kings there never fail to be a great number of
 people who see to it that amusement follows business, and who watch all
 the time of their leisure to supply them with delights and games, so
 that there is no blank in it. In fact, kings are surrounded with persons
 who are wonderfully attentive in taking care that the king be not alone
 and in a state to think of himself, knowing well that he will be
 miserable, king though he be, if he meditate on self.
 
 In all this I am not talking of Christian kings as Christians, but only
 as kings.
 
 
 143
 
 _Diversion._--Men are entrusted from infancy with the care of their
 honour, their property, their friends, and even with the property and
 the honour of their friends. They are overwhelmed with business, with
 the study of languages, and with physical exercise;[71] and they are
 made to understand that they cannot be happy unless their health, their
 honour, their fortune and that of their friends be in good condition,
 and that a single thing wanting will make them unhappy. Thus they are
 given cares and business which make them bustle about from break of
 day.--It is, you will exclaim, a strange way to make them happy! What
 more could be done to make them miserable?--Indeed! what could be done?
 We should only have to relieve them from all these cares; for then they
 would see themselves: they would reflect on what they are, whence they
 came, whither they go, and thus we cannot employ and divert them too
 much. And this is why, after having given them so much business, we
 advise them, if they have some time for relaxation, to employ it in
 amusement, in play, and to be always fully occupied.
 
 How hollow and full of ribaldry is the heart of man!
 
 
 144
 
 I spent a long time in the study of the abstract sciences, and was
 disheartened by the small number of fellow-students in them. When I
 commenced the study of man, I saw that these abstract sciences are not
 suited to man, and that I was wandering farther from my own state in
 examining them, than others in not knowing them. I pardoned their little
 knowledge; but I thought at least to find many companions in the study
 of man, and that it was the true study which is suited to him. I have
 been deceived; still fewer study it than geometry. It is only from the
 want of knowing how to study this that we seek the other studies. But is
 it not that even here is not the knowledge which man should have, and
 that for the purpose of happiness it is better for him not to know
 himself?
 
 
 145
 
 [One thought alone occupies us; we cannot think of two things at the
 same time. This is lucky for us according to the world, not according to
 God.]
 
 
 146
 
 Man is obviously made to think. It is his whole dignity and his whole
 merit; and his whole duty is to think as he ought. Now, the order of
 thought is to begin with self, and with its Author and its end.
 
 Now, of what does the world think? Never of this, but of dancing,
 playing the lute, singing, making verses, running at the ring, etc.,
 fighting, making oneself king, without thinking what it is to be a king
 and what to be a man.
 
 
 147
 
 We do not content ourselves with the life we have in ourselves and in
 our own being; we desire to live an imaginary life in the mind of
 others, and for this purpose we endeavour to shine. We labour
 unceasingly to adorn and preserve this imaginary existence, and neglect
 the real. And if we possess calmness, or generosity, or truthfulness, we
 are eager to make it known, so as to attach these virtues to that
 imaginary existence. We would rather separate them from ourselves to
 join them to it; and we would willingly be cowards in order to acquire
 the reputation of being brave. A great proof of the nothingness of our
 being, not to be satisfied with the one without the other, and to
 renounce the one for the other! For he would be infamous who would not
 die to preserve his honour.
 
 
 148
 
 We are so presumptuous that we would wish to be known by all the world,
 even by people who shall come after, when we shall be no more; and we
 are so vain that the esteem of five or six neighbours delights and
 contents us.
 
 
 149
 
 We do not trouble ourselves about being esteemed in the towns through
 which we pass. But if we are to remain a little while there, we are so
 concerned. How long is necessary? A time commensurate with our vain and
 paltry life.
 
 
 150
 
 Vanity is so anchored in the heart of man that a soldier, a soldier's
 servant, a cook, a porter brags, and wishes to have his admirers. Even
 philosophers wish for them. Those who write against it want to have the
 glory of having written well;[72] and those who read it desire the glory
 of having read it. I who write this have perhaps this desire, and
 perhaps those who will read it ...
 
 
 151
 
 _Glory._--Admiration spoils all from infancy. Ah! How well said! Ah! How
 well done! How well-behaved he is! etc.
 
 The children of Port-Royal, who do not receive this stimulus of envy and
 glory, fall into carelessness.
 
 
 152
 
 _Pride._--Curiosity is only vanity. Most frequently we wish to know but
 to talk. Otherwise we would not take a sea voyage in order never to talk
 of it, and for the sole pleasure of seeing without hope of ever
 communicating it.
 
 
 153
 
 _Of the desire of being esteemed by those with whom we are._--Pride
 takes such natural possession of us in the midst of our woes, errors,
 etc. We even lose our life with joy, provided people talk of it.
 
 Vanity: play, hunting, visiting, false shame, a lasting name.
 
 
 154
 
 [I have no friends] to your advantage].
 
 
 155
 
 A true friend is so great an advantage, even for the greatest lords, in
 order that he may speak well of them, and back them in their absence,
 that they should do all to have one. But they should choose well; for,
 if they spend all their efforts in the interests of fools, it will be of
 no use, however well these may speak of them; and these will not even
 speak well of them if they find themselves on the weakest side, for
 they have no influence; and thus they will speak ill of them in company.
 
 
 156
 
 _Ferox gens, nullam esse vitam sine armis rati._[73]--They prefer death
 to peace; others prefer death to war.
 
 Every opinion may be held preferable to life, the love of which is so
 strong and so natural.[74]
 
 
 157
 
 Contradiction: contempt for our existence, to die for nothing, hatred of
 our existence.
 
 
 158
 
 _Pursuits._--The charm of fame is so great, that we like every object to
 which it is attached, even death.
 
 
 159
 
 Noble deeds are most estimable when hidden. When I see some of these in
 history (as p. 184)[75], they please me greatly. But after all they have
 not been quite hidden, since they have been known; and though people
 have done what they could to hide them, the little publication of them
 spoils all, for what was best in them was the wish to hide them.
 
 
 160
 
 Sneezing absorbs all the functions of the soul, as well as work does;
 but we do not draw therefrom the same conclusions against the greatness
 of man, because it is against his will. And although we bring it on
 ourselves, it is nevertheless against our will that we sneeze. It is not
 in view of the act itself; it is for another end. And thus it is not a
 proof of the weakness of man, and of his slavery under that action.
 
 It is not disgraceful for man to yield to pain, and it is disgraceful to
 yield to pleasure. This is not because pain comes to us from without,
 and we ourselves seek pleasure; for it is possible to seek pain, and
 yield to it purposely, without this kind of baseness. Whence comes it,
 then, that reason thinks it honourable to succumb under stress of pain,
 and disgraceful to yield to the attack of pleasure? It is because pain
 does not tempt and attract us. It is we ourselves who choose it
 voluntarily, and will it to prevail over us. So that we are masters of
 the situation; and in this man yields to himself. But in pleasure it is
 man who yields to pleasure. Now only mastery and sovereignty bring
 glory, and only slavery brings shame.
 
 
 161
 
 _Vanity._--How wonderful it is that a thing so evident as the vanity of
 the world is so little known, that it is a strange and surprising thing
 to say that it is foolish to seek greatness!
 
 
 162
 
 He who will know fully the vanity of man has only to consider the causes
 and effects of love. The cause is a _je ne sais quoi_ (Corneille),[76]
 and the effects are dreadful. This _je ne sais quoi_, so small an object
 that we cannot recognise it, agitates a whole country, princes, armies,
 the entire world.
 
 Cleopatra's nose: had it been shorter, the whole aspect of the world
 would have been altered.
 
 
 163
 
 _Vanity._--The cause and the effects of love: Cleopatra.
 
 
 164
 
 He who does not see the vanity of the world is himself very vain. Indeed
 who do not see it but youths who are absorbed in fame, diversion, and
 the thought of the future? But take away diversion, and you will see
 them dried up with weariness. They feel then their nothingness without
 knowing it; for it is indeed to be unhappy to be in insufferable sadness
 as soon as we are reduced to thinking of self, and have no diversion.
 
 
 165
 
 _Thoughts._--_In omnibus requiem quaesivi._[77] If our condition were
 truly happy, we would not need diversion from thinking of it in order to
 make ourselves happy.
 
 
 166
 
 _Diversion._--Death is easier to bear without thinking of it, than is
 the thought of death without peril.
 
 
 167
 
 The miseries of human life have established all this: as men have seen
 this, they have taken up diversion.
 
 
 168
 
 _Diversion._--As men are not able to fight against death, misery,
 ignorance, they have taken it into their heads, in order to be happy,
 not to think of them at all.
 
 
 169
 
 Despite these miseries, man wishes to be happy, and only wishes to be
 happy, and cannot wish not to be so. But how will he set about it? To be
 happy he would have to make himself immortal; but, not being able to do
 so, it has occurred to him to prevent himself from thinking of death.
 
 
 170
 
 _Diversion._--If man were happy, he would be the more so, the less he
 was diverted, like the Saints and God.--Yes; but is it not to be happy
 to have a faculty of being amused by diversion?--No; for that comes from
 elsewhere and from without, and thus is dependent, and therefore subject
 to be disturbed by a thousand accidents, which bring inevitable griefs.
 
 
 171
 
 _Misery._--The only thing which consoles us for our miseries is
 diversion, and yet this it the greatest of our miseries. For it is this
 which principally hinders us from reflecting upon ourselves, and which
 makes us insensibly ruin ourselves. Without this we should be in a state
 of weariness, and this weariness would spur us to seek a more solid
 means of escaping from it. But diversion amuses us, and leads us
 unconsciously to death.
 
 
 172
 
 We do not rest satisfied with the present. We anticipate the future as
 too slow in coming, as if in order to hasten its course; or we recall
 the past, to stop its too rapid flight. So imprudent are we that we
 wander in the times which are not ours, and do not think of the only one
 which belongs to us; and so idle are we that we dream of those times
 which are no more, and thoughtlessly overlook that which alone exists.
 For the present is generally painful to us. We conceal it from our
 sight, because it troubles us; and if it be delightful to us, we regret
 to see it pass away. We try to sustain it by the future, and think of
 arranging matters which are not in our power, for a time which we have
 no certainty of reaching.
 
 Let each one examine his thoughts, and he will find them all occupied
 with the past and the future. We scarcely ever think of the present; and
 if we think of it, it is only to take light from it to arrange the
 future. The present is never our end. The past and the present are our
 means; the future alone is our end.[78] So we never live, but we hope to
 live; and, as we are always preparing to be happy, it is inevitable we
 should never be so.
 
 
 173
 
 They say that eclipses foretoken misfortune, because misfortunes are
 common, so that, as evil happens so often, they often foretell it;
 whereas if they said that they predict good fortune, they would often be
 wrong. They attribute good fortune only to rare conjunctions of the
 heavens; so they seldom fail in prediction.
 
 
 174
 
 _Misery._--Solomon[79] and Job have best known and best spoken of the
 misery of man; the former the most fortunate, and the latter the most
 unfortunate of men; the former knowing the vanity of pleasures from
 experience, the latter the reality of evils.

 We know ourselves so little, that many think they are about to die when
 they are well, and many think they are well when they are near death,
 unconscious of approaching fever,[80] or of the abscess ready to form
 itself.

 Cromwell[81] was about to ravage all Christendom; the royal family was
 undone, and his own for ever established, save for a little grain of
 sand which formed in his ureter. Rome herself was trembling under him;

 family cast down, all is peaceful, and the king is restored.

 The great and the humble have the same misfortunes, the same griefs, the
 same passions;[84] but the one is at the top of the wheel, and the other
 near the centre, and so less disturbed by the same revolutions.

 We are so unfortunate that we can only take pleasure in a thing on
 condition of being annoyed if it turn out ill, as a thousand things can
 do, and do every hour. He who should find the secret of rejoicing in the
 good, without troubling himself with its contrary evil, would have hit
 the mark. It is perpetual motion.
 
 
 182
 
 Those who have always good hope in the midst of misfortunes, and who are
 delighted with good luck, are suspected of being very pleased with the
 ill success of the affair, if they are not equally distressed by bad
 luck; and they are overjoyed to find these pretexts of hope, in order to
 show that they are concerned and to conceal by the joy which they feign
 to feel that which they have at seeing the failure of the matter.

 We run carelessly to the precipice, after we have put something before
 us to prevent us seeing it.
 
 
 
 
 SECTION III
 
 OF THE NECESSITY OF THE WAGER
 
 
 184
 
 A letter to incite to the search after God.
 
 And then to make people seek Him among the philosophers, sceptics, and
 dogmatists, who disquiet him who inquires of them.
 
 
 185
 
 The conduct of God, who disposes all things kindly, is to put religion
 into the mind by reason, and into the heart by grace. But to will to put
 it into the mind and heart by force and threats is not to put religion
 there, but terror, _terorrem potius quam religionem_.
 
 
 186
 
 _Nisi terrerentur et non docerentur, improba quasi dominatio videretur_
 (Aug., Ep. 48 or 49), _Contra Mendacium ad Consentium_.
 
 
 187
 
 _Order._--Men despise religion; they hate it, and fear it is true. To
 remedy this, we must begin by showing that religion is not contrary to
 reason; that it is venerable, to inspire respect for it; then we must
 make it lovable, to make good men hope it is true; finally, we must
 prove it is true.
 
 Venerable, because it has perfect knowledge of man; lovable, because it
 promises the true good.
 
 
 188
 
 In every dialogue and discourse, we must be able to say to those who
 take offence, "Of what do you complain?"
 
 
 189
 
 To begin by pitying unbelievers; they are wretched enough by their
 condition. We ought only to revile them where it is beneficial; but this
 does them harm.
 
 
 190
 
 To pity atheists who seek, for are they not unhappy enough? To inveigh
 against those who make a boast of it.
 
 
 191
 
 And will this one scoff at the other? Who ought to scoff? And yet, the
 latter does not scoff at the other, but pities him.
 
 
 192
 
 To reproach Miton[85] with not being troubled, since God will reproach
 him.
 
 
 193
 
 _Quid fiet hominibus qui minima contemnunt, majora non credunt?_
 
 
 194
 
 ... Let them at least learn what is the religion they attack, before
 attacking it. If this religion boasted of having a clear view of God,
 and of possessing it open and unveiled, it would be attacking it to say
 that we see nothing in the world which shows it with this clearness. But
 since, on the contrary, it says that men are in darkness and estranged
 from God, that He has hidden Himself from their knowledge, that this is
 in fact the name which He gives Himself in the Scriptures, _Deus
 absconditus_;[86] and finally, if it endeavours equally to establish
 these two things: that God has set up in the Church visible signs to
 make Himself known to those who should seek Him sincerely, and that He
 has nevertheless so disguised them that He will only be perceived by
 those who seek Him with all their heart; what advantage can they obtain,
 when, in the negligence with which they make profession of being in
 search of the truth, they cry out that nothing reveals it to them; and
 since that darkness in which they are, and with which they upbraid the
 Church, establishes only one of the things which she affirms, without
 touching the other, and, very far from destroying, proves her doctrine?
 
 In order to attack it, they should have protested that they had made
 every effort to seek Him everywhere, and even in that which the Church
 proposes for their instruction, but without satisfaction. If they talked
 in this manner, they would in truth be attacking one of her pretensions.
 But I hope here to show that no reasonable person can speak thus, and I
 venture even to say that no one has ever done so. We know well enough
 how those who are of this mind behave. They believe they have made great
 efforts for their instruction, when they have spent a few hours in
 reading some book of Scripture, and have questioned some priest on the
 truths of the faith. After that, they boast of having made vain search
 in books and among men. But, verily, I will tell them what I have often
 said, that this negligence is insufferable. We are not here concerned
 with the trifling interests of some stranger, that we should treat it in
 this fashion; the matter concerns ourselves and our all.
 
 The immortality of the soul is a matter which is of so great consequence
 to us, and which touches us so profoundly, that we must have lost all
 feeling to be indifferent as to knowing what it is. All our actions and
 thoughts must take such different courses, according as there are or are
 not eternal joys to hope for, that it is impossible to take one step
 with sense and judgment, unless we regulate our course by our view of
 this point which ought to be our ultimate end.
 
 Thus our first interest and our first duty is to enlighten ourselves on
 this subject, whereon depends all our conduct. Therefore among those who
 do not believe, I make a vast difference between those who strive with
 all their power to inform themselves, and those who live without
 troubling or thinking about it.
 
 I can have only compassion for those who sincerely bewail their doubt,
 who regard it as the greatest of misfortunes, and who, sparing no effort
 to escape it, make of this inquiry their principal and most serious
 occupations.
 
 But as for those who pass their life without thinking of this ultimate
 end of life, and who, for this sole reason that they do not find within
 themselves the lights which convince them of it, neglect to seek them
 elsewhere, and to examine thoroughly whether this opinion is one of
 those which people receive with credulous simplicity, or one of those
 which, although obscure in themselves, have nevertheless a solid and
 immovable foundation, I look upon them in a manner quite different.
 
 This carelessness in a matter which concerns themselves, their eternity,
 their all, moves me more to anger than pity; it astonishes and shocks
 me; it is to me monstrous. I do not say this out of the pious zeal of a
 spiritual devotion. I expect, on the contrary, that we ought to have
 this feeling from principles of human interest and self-love; for this
 we need only see what the least enlightened persons see.
 
 We do not require great education of the mind to understand that here is
 no real and lasting satisfaction; that our pleasures are only vanity;
 that our evils are infinite; and, lastly, that death, which threatens us
 every moment, must infallibly place us within a few years under the
 dreadful necessity of being for ever either annihilated or unhappy.
 
 There is nothing more real than this, nothing more terrible. Be we as
 heroic as we like, that is the end which awaits the noblest life in the
 world. Let us reflect on this, and then say whether it is not beyond
 doubt that there is no good in this life but in the hope of another;
 that we are happy only in proportion as we draw near it; and that, as
 there are no more woes for those who have complete assurance of
 eternity, so there is no more happiness for those who have no insight
 into it.
 
 Surely then it is a great evil thus to be in doubt, but it is at least
 an indispensable duty to seek when we are in such doubt; and thus the
 doubter who does not seek is altogether completely unhappy and
 completely wrong. And if besides this he is easy and content, professes
 to be so, and indeed boasts of it; if it is this state itself which is
 the subject of his joy and vanity, I have no words to describe so silly
 a creature.
 
 How can people hold these opinions? What joy can we find in the
 expectation of nothing but hopeless misery? What reason for boasting
 that we are in impenetrable darkness? And how can it happen that the
 following argument occurs to a reasonable man?
 
 "I know not who put me into the world, nor what the world is, nor what I
 myself am. I am in terrible ignorance of everything. I know not what my
 body is, nor my senses, nor my soul, not even that part of me which
 thinks what I say, which reflects on all and on itself, and knows itself
 no more than the rest. I see those frightful spaces of the universe
 which surround me, and I find myself tied to one corner of this vast
 expanse, without knowing why I am put in this place rather than in
 another, nor why the short time which is given me to live is assigned to
 me at this point rather than at another of the whole eternity which was
 before me or which shall come after me. I see nothing but infinites on
 all sides, which surround me as an atom, and as a shadow which endures
 only for an instant and returns no more. All I know is that I must soon
 die, but what I know least is this very death which I cannot escape.
 
 "As I know not whence I come, so I know not whither I go. I know only
 that, in leaving this world, I fall for ever either into annihilation or
 into the hands of an angry God, without knowing to which of these two
 states I shall be for ever assigned. Such is my state, full of weakness
 and uncertainty. And from all this I conclude that I ought to spend all
 the days of my life without caring to inquire into what must happen to
 me. Perhaps I might find some solution to my doubts, but I will not take
 the trouble, nor take a step to seek it; and after treating with scorn
 those who are concerned with this care, I will go without foresight and
 without fear to try the great event, and let myself be led carelessly to
 death, uncertain of the eternity of my future state."
 
 Who would desire to have for a friend a man who talks in this fashion?
 Who would choose him out from others to tell him of his affairs? Who
 would have recourse to him in affliction? And indeed to what use in life
 could one put him?
 
 In truth, it is the glory of religion to have for enemies men so
 unreasonable: and their opposition to it is so little dangerous that it
 serves on the contrary to establish its truths. For the Christian faith
 goes mainly to establish these two facts, the corruption of nature, and
 redemption by Jesus Christ. Now I contend that if these men do not serve
 to prove the truth of the redemption by the holiness of their behaviour,
 they at least serve admirably to show the corruption of nature by
 sentiments so unnatural.
 
 Nothing is so important to man as his own state, nothing is so
 formidable to him as eternity; and thus it is not natural that there
 should be men indifferent to the loss of their existence, and to the
 perils of everlasting suffering. They are quite different with regard to
 all other things. They are afraid of mere trifles; they foresee them;
 they feel them. And this same man who spends so many days and nights in
 rage and despair for the loss of office, or for some imaginary insult to
 his honour, is the very one who knows without anxiety and without
 emotion that he will lose all by death. It is a monstrous thing to see
 in the same heart and at the same time this sensibility to trifles and
 this strange insensibility to the greatest objects. It is an
 incomprehensible enchantment, and a supernatural slumber, which
 indicates as its cause an all-powerful force.
 
 There must be a strange confusion in the nature of man, that he should
 boast of being in that state in which it seems incredible that a single
 individual should be. However, experience has shown me so great a
 number of such persons that the fact would be surprising, if we did not
 know that the greater part of those who trouble themselves about the
 matter are disingenuous, and not in fact what they say. They are people
 who have heard it said that it is the fashion to be thus daring. It is
 what they call shaking off the yoke, and they try to imitate this. But
 it would not be difficult to make them understand how greatly they
 deceive themselves in thus seeking esteem. This is not the way to gain
 it, even I say among those men of the world who take a healthy view of
 things, and who know that the only way to succeed in this life is to
 make ourselves appear honourable, faithful, judicious, and capable of
 useful service to a friend; because naturally men love only what may be
 useful to them. Now, what do we gain by hearing it said of a man that he
 has now thrown off the yoke, that he does not believe there is a God who
 watches our actions, that he considers himself the sole master of his
 conduct, and that he thinks he is accountable for it only to himself?
 Does he think that he has thus brought us to have henceforth complete
 confidence in him, and to look to him for consolation, advice, and help
 in every need of life? Do they profess to have delighted us by telling
 us that they hold our soul to be only a little wind and smoke,
 especially by telling us this in a haughty and self-satisfied tone of
 voice? Is this a thing to say gaily? Is it not, on the contrary, a thing
 to say sadly, as the saddest thing in the world?
 
 If they thought of it seriously, they would see that this is so bad a
 mistake, so contrary to good sense, so opposed to decency and so removed
 in every respect from that good breeding which they seek, that they
 would be more likely to correct than to pervert those who had an
 inclination to follow them. And indeed, make them give an account of
 their opinions, and of the reasons which they have for doubting
 religion, and they will say to you things so feeble and so petty, that
 they will persuade you of the contrary. The following is what a person
 one day said to such a one very appositely: "If you continue to talk in
 this manner, you will really make me religious." And he was right, for
 who would not have a horror of holding opinions in which he would have
 such contemptible persons as companions!
 
 Thus those who only feign these opinions would be very unhappy, if they
 restrained their natural feelings in order to make themselves the most
 conceited of men. If, at the bottom of their heart, they are troubled at
 not having more light, let them not disguise the fact; this avowal will
 not be shameful. The only shame is to have none. Nothing reveals more an
 extreme weakness of mind than not to know the misery of a godless man.
 Nothing is more indicative of a bad disposition of heart than not to
 desire the truth of eternal promises. Nothing is more dastardly than to
 act with bravado before God. Let them then leave these impieties to
 those who are sufficiently ill-bred to be really capable of them. Let
 them at least be honest men, if they cannot be Christians. Finally, let
 them recognise that there are two kinds of people one can call
 reasonable; those who serve God with all their heart because they know
 Him, and those who seek Him with all their heart because they do not
 know Him.
 
 But as for those who live without knowing Him and without seeking Him,
 they judge themselves so little worthy of their own care, that they are
 not worthy of the care of others; and it needs all the charity of the
 religion which they despise, not to despise them even to the point of
 leaving them to their folly. But because this religion obliges us always
 to regard them, so long as they are in this life, as capable of the
 grace which can enlighten them, and to believe that they may, in a
 little time, be more replenished with faith than we are, and that, on
 the other hand, we may fall into the blindness wherein they are, we must
 do for them what we would they should do for us if we were in their
 place, and call upon them to have pity upon themselves, and to take at
 least some steps in the endeavour to find light. Let them give to
 reading this some of the hours which they otherwise employ so uselessly;
 whatever aversion they may bring to the task, they will perhaps gain
 something, and at least will not lose much. But as for those who bring
 to the task perfect sincerity and a real desire to meet with truth,
 those I hope will be satisfied and convinced of the proofs of a religion
 so divine, which I have here collected, and in which I have followed
 somewhat after this order ...
 
 
 195
 
 Before entering into the proofs of the Christian religion, I find it
 necessary to point out the sinfulness of those men who live in
 indifference to the search for truth in a matter which is so important
 to them, and which touches them so nearly.
 
 Of all their errors, this doubtless is the one which most convicts them
 of foolishness and blindness, and in which it is easiest to confound
 them by the first glimmerings of common sense, and by natural feelings.
 
 For it is not to be doubted that the duration of this life is but a
 moment; that the state of death is eternal, whatever may be its nature;
 and that thus all our actions and thoughts must take such different
 directions according to the state of that eternity, that it is
 impossible to take one step with sense and judgment, unless we regulate
 our course by the truth of that point which ought to be our ultimate
 end.
 
 There is nothing clearer than this; and thus, according to the
 principles of reason, the conduct of men is wholly unreasonable, if they
 do not take another course.
 
 On this point, therefore, we condemn those who live without thought of
 the ultimate end of life, who let themselves be guided by their own
 inclinations and their own pleasures without reflection and without
 concern, and, as if they could annihilate eternity by turning away their
 thought from it, think only of making themselves happy for the moment.
 
 Yet this eternity exists, and death, which must open into it, and
 threatens them every hour, must in a little time infallibly put them
 under the dreadful necessity of being either annihilated or unhappy for
 ever, without knowing which of these eternities is for ever prepared for
 them.
 
 This is a doubt of terrible consequence. They are in peril of eternal
 woe; and thereupon, as if the matter were not worth the trouble, they
 neglect to inquire whether this is one of those opinions which people
 receive with too credulous a facility, or one of those which, obscure in
 themselves, have a very firm, though hidden, foundation. Thus they know
 not whether there be truth or falsity in the matter, nor whether there
 be strength or weakness in the proofs. They have them before their eyes;
 they refuse to look at them; and in that ignorance they choose all that
 is necessary to fall into this misfortune if it exists, to await death
 to make trial of it, yet to be very content in this state, to make
 profession of it, and indeed to boast of it. Can we think seriously on
 the importance of this subject without being horrified at conduct so
 extravagant?
 
 This resting in ignorance is a monstrous thing, and they who pass their
 life in it must be made to feel its extravagance and stupidity, by
 having it shown to them, so that they may be confounded by the sight of
 their folly. For this is how men reason, when they choose to live in
 such ignorance of what they are, and without seeking enlightenment. "I
 know not," they say ...
 
 
 196
 
 Men lack heart; they would not make a friend of it.
 
 
 197
 
 To be insensible to the extent of despising interesting things, and to
 become insensible to the point which interests us most.
 
 
 198
 
 The sensibility of man to trifles, and his insensibility to great
 things, indicates a strange inversion.
 
 
 199
 
 Let us imagine a number of men in chains, and all condemned to death,
 where some are killed each day in the sight of the others, and those who
 remain see their own fate in that of their fellows, and wait their turn,
 looking at each other sorrowfully and without hope. It is an image of
 the condition of men.
 
 
 200
 
 A man in a dungeon, ignorant whether his sentence be pronounced, and
 having only one hour to learn it, but this hour enough, if he know that
 it is pronounced, to obtain its repeal, would act unnaturally in
 spending that hour, not in ascertaining his sentence, but in playing
 piquet. So it is against nature that man, etc. It is making heavy the
 hand of God.
 
 Thus not only the zeal of those who seek Him proves God, but also the
 blindness of those who seek Him not.
 
 
 201
 
 All the objections of this one and that one only go against themselves,
 and not against religion. All that infidels say ...
 
 
 202
 
 [From those who are in despair at being without faith, we see that God
 does not enlighten them; but as to the rest, we see there is a God who
 makes them blind.]
 
 
 203
 
 _Fascinatio nugacitatis._[87]--That passion may not harm us, let us act
 as if we had only eight hours to live.
 
 
 204
 
 If we ought to devote eight hours of life, we ought to devote a hundred
 years.
 
 
 205
 
 When I consider the short duration of my life, swallowed up in the
 eternity before and after, the little space which I fill, and even can
 see, engulfed in the infinite immensity of spaces of which I am
 ignorant, and which know me not, I am frightened, and am astonished at
 being here rather than there; for there is no reason why here rather
 than there, why now rather than then. Who has put me here? By whose
 order and direction have this place and time been allotted to me?
 _Memoria hospitis unius diei praetereuntis._[88]
 
 
 206
 
 The eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me.
 
 
 207
 
 How many kingdoms know us not!
 
 
 208
 
 Why is my knowledge limited? Why my stature? Why my life to one hundred
 years rather than to a thousand? What reason has nature had for giving
 me such, and for choosing this number rather than another in the
 infinity of those from which there is no more reason to choose one than
 another, trying nothing else?
 
 
 209
 
 Art thou less a slave by being loved and favoured by thy master? Thou
 art indeed well off, slave. Thy master favours thee; he will soon beat
 thee.
 
 
 210
 
 The last act is tragic, however happy all the rest of the play is; at
 the last a little earth is thrown upon our head, and that is the end for
 ever.
 
 
 211
 
 We are fools to depend upon the society of our fellow-men. Wretched as
 we are, powerless as we are, they will not aid us; we shall die alone.
 We should therefore act as if we were alone, and in that case should we
 build fine houses, etc.? We should seek the truth without hesitation;
 and, if we refuse it, we show that we value the esteem of men more than
 the search for truth.
 
 
 212
 
 _Instability._[89]--It is a horrible thing to feel all that we possess
 slipping away.
 
 
 213
 
 Between us and heaven or hell there is only life, which is the frailest
 thing in the world.
 
 
 214
 
 _Injustice._--That presumption should be joined to meanness is extreme
 injustice.
 
 
 215
 
 To fear death without danger, and not in danger, for one must be a man.
 
 
 216
 
 Sudden death alone is feared; hence confessors stay with lords.
 
 
 217
 
 An heir finds the title-deeds of his house. Will he say, "Perhaps they
 are forged?" and neglect to examine them?
 
 
 218
 
 _Dungeon._--I approve of not examining the opinion of Copernicus; but
 this...! It concerns all our life to know whether the soul be mortal or
 immortal.
 
 
 219
 
 It is certain that the mortality or immortality of the soul must make an
 entire difference to morality. And yet philosophers have constructed
 their ethics independently of this: they discuss to pass an hour.
 
 Plato, to incline to Christianity.
 
 
 220
 
 The fallacy of philosophers who have not discussed the immortality of
 the soul. The fallacy of their dilemma in Montaigne.
 
 
 221
 
 Atheists ought to say what is perfectly evident; now it is not perfectly
 evident that the soul is material.
 
 
 222
 
 _Atheists._--What reason have they for saying that we cannot rise from
 the dead? What is more difficult, to be born or to rise again; that what
 has never been should be, or that what has been should be again? Is it
 more difficult to come into existence than to return to it? Habit makes
 the one appear easy to us; want of habit makes the other impossible. A
 popular way of thinking!
 
 Why cannot a virgin bear a child? Does a hen not lay eggs without a
 cock? What distinguishes these outwardly from others? And who has told
 us that the hen may not form the germ as well as the cock?
 
 
 223
 
 What have they to say against the resurrection, and against the
 child-bearing of the Virgin? Which is the more difficult, to produce a
 man or an animal, or to reproduce it? And if they had never seen any
 species of animals, could they have conjectured whether they were
 produced without connection with each other?
 
 
 224
 
 How I hate these follies of not believing in the Eucharist, etc.! If the
 Gospel be true, if Jesus Christ be God, what difficulty is there?
 
 
 225
 
 Atheism shows strength of mind, but only to a certain degree.
 
 
 226
 
 Infidels, who profess to follow reason, ought to be exceedingly strong
 in reason. What say they then? "Do we not see," say they, "that the
 brutes live and die like men, and Turks like Christians? They have their
 ceremonies, their prophets, their doctors, their saints, their monks,
 like us," etc. (Is this contrary to Scripture? Does it not say all
 this?)
 
 If you care but little to know the truth, here is enough of it to leave
 you in repose. But if you desire with all your heart to know it, it is
 not enough; look at it in detail. This would be sufficient for a
 question in philosophy; but not here, where it concerns your all. And
 yet, after a trifling reflection of this kind, we go to amuse ourselves,
 etc. Let us inquire of this same religion whether it does not give a
 reason for this obscurity; perhaps it will teach it to us.
 
 
 227
 
 _Order by dialogues._--What ought I to do? I see only darkness
 everywhere. Shall I believe I am nothing? Shall I believe I am God?
 
 "All things change and succeed each other." You are mistaken; there
 is ...
 
 
 228
 
 Objection of atheists: "But we have no light."
 
 
 229
 
 This is what I see and what troubles me. I look on all sides, and I see
 only darkness everywhere. Nature presents to me nothing which is not
 matter of doubt and concern. If I saw nothing there which revealed a
 Divinity, I would come to a negative conclusion; if I saw everywhere the
 signs of a Creator, I would remain peacefully in faith. But, seeing too
 much to deny and too little to be sure, I am in a state to be pitied;
 wherefore I have a hundred time wished that if a God maintains nature,
 she should testify to Him unequivocally, and that, if the signs she
 gives are deceptive, she should suppress them altogether; that she
 should say everything or nothing, that I might see which cause I ought
 to follow. Whereas in my present state, ignorant of what I am or of what
 I ought to do, I know neither my condition nor my duty. My heart
 inclines wholly to know where is the true good, in order to follow it;
 nothing would be too dear to me for eternity.
 
 I envy those whom I see living in the faith with such carelessness, and
 who make such a bad use of a gift of which it seems to me I would make
 such a different use.
 
 
 230
 
 It is incomprehensible that God should exist, and it is incomprehensible
 that He should not exist; that the soul should be joined to the body,
 and that we should have no soul; that the world should be created, and
 that it should not be created, etc.; that original sin should be, and
 that it should not be.
 
 
 231
 
 Do you believe it to be impossible that God is infinite, without
 parts?--Yes. I wish therefore to show you an infinite and indivisible
 thing. It is a point moving everywhere with an infinite velocity; for it
 is one in all places, and is all totality in every place.
 
 Let this effect of nature, which previously seemed to you impossible,
 make you know that there may be others of which you are still ignorant.
 Do not draw this conclusion from your experiment, that there remains
 nothing for you to know; but rather that there remains an infinity for
 you to know.
 
 
 232
 
 Infinite movement, the point which fills everything, the moment of rest;
 infinite without quantity, indivisible and infinite.
 
 
 233
 
 _Infinite_--_nothing._--Our soul is cast into a body, where it finds
 number, time, dimension. Thereupon it reasons, and calls this nature,
 necessity, and can believe nothing else.
 
 Unity joined to infinity adds nothing to it, no more than one foot to an
 infinite measure. The finite is annihilated in the presence of the
 infinite, and becomes a pure nothing. So our spirit before God, so our
 justice before divine justice. There is not so great a disproportion
 between our justice and that of God, as between unity and infinity.
 
 The justice of God must be vast like His compassion. Now justice to the
 outcast is less vast, and ought less to offend our feelings than mercy
 towards the elect.
 
 We know that there is an infinite, and are ignorant of its nature. As we
 know it to be false that numbers are finite, it is therefore true that
 there is an infinity in number. But we do not know what it is. It is
 false that it is even, it is false that it is odd; for the addition of a
 unit can make no change in its nature. Yet it is a number, and every
 number is odd or even (this is certainly true of every finite number).
 So we may well know that there is a God without knowing what He is. Is
 there not one substantial truth, seeing there are so many things which
 are not the truth itself?
 
 We know then the existence and nature of the finite, because we also are
 finite and have extension. We know the existence of the infinite, and
 are ignorant of its nature, because it has extension like us, but not
 limits like us. But we know neither the existence nor the nature of God,
 because He has neither extension nor limits.
 
 But by faith we know His existence; in glory we shall know His nature.
 Now, I have already shown that we may well know the existence of a
 thing, without knowing its nature.
 
 Let us now speak according to natural lights.
 
 If there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible, since, having
 neither parts nor limits, He has no affinity to us. We are then
 incapable of knowing either what He is or if He is. This being so, who
 will dare to undertake the decision of the question? Not we, who have no
 affinity to Him.
 
 Who then will blame Christians for not being able to give a reason for
 their belief, since they profess a religion for which they cannot give a
 reason? They declare, in expounding it to the world, that it is a
 foolishness, _stultitiam_;[90] and then you complain that they do not
 prove it! If they proved it, they would not keep their word; it is in
 lacking proofs, that they are not lacking in sense. "Yes, but although
 this excuses those who offer it as such, and takes away from them the
 blame of putting it forward without reason, it does not excuse those who
 receive it." Let us then examine this point, and say, "God is, or He is
 not." But to which side shall we incline? Reason can decide nothing
 here. There is an infinite chaos which separated us. A game is being
 played at the extremity of this infinite distance where heads or tails
 will turn up. What will you wager? According to reason, you can do
 neither the one thing nor the other; according to reason, you can defend
 neither of the propositions.
 
 Do not then reprove for error those who have made a choice; for you know
 nothing about it. "No, but I blame them for having made, not this
 choice, but a choice; for again both he who chooses heads and he who
 chooses tails are equally at fault, they are both in the wrong. The true
 course is not to wager at all."
 
 Yes; but you must wager. It is not optional. You are embarked. Which
 will you choose then? Let us see. Since you must choose, let us see
 which interests you least. You have two things to lose, the true and the
 good; and two things to stake, your reason and your will, your
 knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to shun,
 error and misery. Your reason is no more shocked in choosing one rather
 than the other, since you must of necessity choose. This is one point
 settled. But your happiness? Let us weigh the gain and the loss in
 wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances. If you gain,
 you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without
 hesitation that He is.--"That is very fine. Yes, I must wager; but I may
 perhaps wager too much."--Let us see. Since there is an equal risk of
 gain and of loss, if you had only to gain two lives, instead of one, you
 might still wager. But if there were three lives to gain, you would have
 to play (since you are under the necessity of playing), and you would be
 imprudent, when you are forced to play, not to chance your life to gain
 three at a game where there is an equal risk of loss and gain. But there
 is an eternity of life and happiness. And this being so, if there were
 an infinity of chances, of which one only would be for you, you would
 still be right in wagering one to win two, and you would act stupidly,
 being obliged to play, by refusing to stake one life against three at a
 game in which out of an infinity of chances there is one for you, if
 there were an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain. But there is
 here an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain, a chance of gain
 against a finite number of chances of loss, and what you stake is
 finite. It is all divided; wherever the infinite is and there is not an
 infinity of chances of loss against that of gain, there is no time to
 hesitate, you must give all. And thus, when one is forced to play, he
 must renounce reason to preserve his life, rather than risk it for
 infinite gain, as likely to happen as the loss of nothingness.
 
 For it is no use to say it is uncertain if we will gain, and it is
 certain that we risk, and that the infinite distance between the
 _certainty_ of what is staked and the _uncertainty_ of what will be
 gained, equals the finite good which is certainly staked against the
 uncertain infinite. It is not so, as every player stakes a certainty to
 gain an uncertainty, and yet he stakes a finite certainty to gain a
 finite uncertainty, without transgressing against reason. There is not
 an infinite distance between the certainty staked and the uncertainty of
 the gain; that is untrue. In truth, there is an infinity between the
 certainty of gain and the certainty of loss. But the uncertainty of the
 gain is proportioned to the certainty of the stake according to the
 proportion of the chances of gain and loss. Hence it comes that, if
 there are as many risks on one side as on the other, the course is to
 play even; and then the certainty of the stake is equal to the
 uncertainty of the gain, so far is it from fact that there is an
 infinite distance between them. And so our proposition is of infinite
 force, when there is the finite to stake in a game where there are equal
 risks of gain and of loss, and the infinite to gain. This is
 demonstrable; and if men are capable of any truths, this is one.
 
 "I confess it, I admit it. But, still, is there no means of seeing the
 faces of the cards?"--Yes, Scripture and the rest, etc. "Yes, but I have
 my hands tied and my mouth closed; I am forced to wager, and am not
 free. I am not released, and am so made that I cannot believe. What,
 then, would you have me do?"
 
 True. But at least learn your inability to believe, since reason brings
 you to this, and yet you cannot believe. Endeavour then to convince
 yourself, not by increase of proofs of God, but by the abatement of your
 passions. You would like to attain faith, and do not know the way; you
 would like to cure yourself of unbelief, and ask the remedy for it.
 Learn of those who have been bound like you, and who now stake all their
 possessions. These are people who know the way which you would follow,
 and who are cured of an ill of which you would be cured. Follow the way
 by which they began; by acting as if they believed, taking the holy
 water, having masses said, etc. Even this will naturally make you
 believe, and deaden your acuteness.--"But this is what I am afraid
 of."--And why? What have you to lose?
 
 But to show you that this leads you there, it is this which will lessen
 the passions, which are your stumbling-blocks.
 
 _The end of this discourse._--Now, what harm will befall you in taking
 this side? You will be faithful, honest, humble, grateful, generous, a
 sincere friend, truthful. Certainly you will not have those poisonous
 pleasures, glory and luxury; but will you not have others? I will tell
 you that you will thereby gain in this life, and that, at each step you
 take on this road, you will see so great certainty of gain, so much
 nothingness in what you risk, that you will at last recognise that you
 have wagered for something certain and infinite, for which you have
 given nothing.
 
 "Ah! This discourse transports me, charms me," etc.
 
 If this discourse pleases you and seems impressive, know that it is
 made by a man who has knelt, both before and after it, in prayer to that
 Being, infinite and without parts, before whom he lays all he has, for
 you also to lay before Him all you have for your own good and for His
 glory, that so strength may be given to lowliness.
 
 
 234
 
 If we must not act save on a certainty, we ought not to act on religion,
 for it is not certain. But how many things we do on an uncertainty, sea
 voyages, battles! I say then we must do nothing at all, for nothing is
 certain, and that there is more certainty in religion than there is as
 to whether we may see to-morrow; for it is not certain that we may see
 to-morrow, and it is certainly possible that we may not see it. We
 cannot say as much about religion. It is not certain that it is; but who
 will venture to say that it is certainly possible that it is not? Now
 when we work for to-morrow, and so on an uncertainty, we act reasonably;
 for we ought to work for an uncertainty according to the doctrine of
 chance which was demonstrated above.
 
 Saint Augustine has seen that we work for an uncertainty, on sea, in
 battle, etc. But he has not seen the doctrine of chance which proves
 that we should do so. Montaigne has seen that we are shocked at a fool,
 and that habit is all-powerful; but he has not seen the reason of this
 effect.
 
 All these persons have seen the effects, but they have not seen the
 causes. They are, in comparison with those who have discovered the
 causes, as those who have only eyes are in comparison with those who
 have intellect. For the effects are perceptible by sense, and the causes
 are visible only to the intellect. And although these effects are seen
 by the mind, this mind is, in comparison with the mind which sees the
 causes, as the bodily senses are in comparison with the intellect.
 
 
 235
 
 _Rem viderunt, causam non viderunt._
 
 
 236
 
 According to the doctrine of chance, you ought to put yourself to the
 trouble of searching for the truth; for if you die without worshipping
 the True Cause, you are lost.--"But," say you, "if He had wished me to
 worship Him, He would have left me signs of His will."--He has done so;
 but you neglect them. Seek them, therefore; it is well worth it.
 
 
 237
 
 _Chances._--We must live differently in the world, according to these
 different assumptions: (1) that we could always remain in it; (2) that
 it is certain that we shall not remain here long, and uncertain if we
 shall remain here one hour. This last assumption is our condition.
 
 
 238
 
 What do you then promise me, in addition to certain troubles, but ten
 years of self-love (for ten years is the chance), to try hard to please
 without success?
 
 
 239
 
 _Objection._--Those who hope for salvation are so far happy; but they
 have as a counterpoise the fear of hell.
 
 _Reply._--Who has most reason to fear hell: he who is in ignorance
 whether there is a hell, and who is certain of damnation if there is; or
 he who certainly believes there is a hell, and hopes to be saved if
 there is?
 
 
 240
 
 "I would soon have renounced pleasure," say they, "had I faith." For my
 part I tell you, "You would soon have faith, if you renounced pleasure."
 Now, it is for you to begin. If I could, I would give you faith. I
 cannot do so, nor therefore test the truth of what you say. But you can
 well renounce pleasure, and test whether what I say is true.
 
 
 241
 
 _Order._--I would have far more fear of being mistaken, and of finding
 that the Christian religion was true, than of not being mistaken in
 believing it true.
 
 
 
 
 SECTION IV
 
 OF THE MEANS OF BELIEF
 
 
 242
 
 _Preface to the second part._--To speak of those who have treated of
 this matter.
 
 I admire the boldness with which these persons undertake to speak of
 God. In addressing their argument to infidels, their first chapter is to
 prove Divinity from the works of nature.[91] I should not be astonished
 at their enterprise, if they were addressing their argument to the
 faithful; for it is certain that those who have the living faith in
 their heart see at once that all existence is none other than the work
 of the God whom they adore. But for those in whom this light is
 extinguished, and in whom we purpose to rekindle it, persons destitute
 of faith and grace, who, seeking with all their light whatever they see
 in nature that can bring them to this knowledge, find only obscurity and
 darkness; to tell them that they have only to look at the smallest
 things which surround them, and they will see God openly, to give them,
 as a complete proof of this great and important matter, the course of
 the moon and planets, and to claim to have concluded the proof with such
 an argument, is to give them ground for believing that the proofs of our
 religion are very weak. And I see by reason and experience that nothing
 is more calculated to arouse their contempt.
 
 It is not after this manner that Scripture speaks, which has a better
 knowledge of the things that are of God. It says, on the contrary, that
 God is a hidden God, and that, since the corruption of nature, He has
 left men in a darkness from which they can escape only through Jesus
 Christ, without whom all communion with God is cut off. _Nemo novit
 Patrem, nisi Filius, et cui voluerit Filius revelare._[92]
 
 This is what Scripture points out to us, when it says in so many places
 that those who seek God find Him.[93] It is not of that light, "like the
 noonday sun," that this is said. We do not say that those who seek the
 noonday sun, or water in the sea, shall find them; and hence the
 evidence of God must not be of this nature. So it tells us elsewhere:
 _Vere tu es Deus absconditus_.[94]
 
 
 243
 
 It is an astounding fact that no canonical writer has ever made use of
 nature to prove God. They all strive to make us believe in Him. David,
 Solomon, etc., have never said, "There is no void, therefore there is a
 God." They must have had more knowledge than the most learned people who
 came after them, and who have all made use of this argument. This is
 worthy of attention.
 
 
 244
 
 "Why! Do you not say yourself that the heavens and birds prove God?" No.
 "And does your religion not say so?" No. For although it is true in a
 sense for some souls to whom God gives this light, yet it is false with
 respect to the majority of men.
 
 
 245
 
 There are three sources of belief: reason, custom, inspiration. The
 Christian religion, which alone has reason, does not acknowledge as her
 true children those who believe without inspiration. It is not that she
 excludes reason and custom. On the contrary, the mind must be opened to
 proofs, must be confirmed by custom, and offer itself in humbleness to
 inspirations, which alone can produce a true and saving effect. _Ne
 evacuetur crux Christi._[95]
 
 
 246
 
 _Order._--After the letter _That we ought to seek God_, to write the
 letter _On removing obstacles_; which is the discourse on "the
 machine,"[96] on preparing the machine, on seeking by reason.
 
 
 247
 
 _Order._--A letter of exhortation to a friend to induce him to seek. And
 he will reply, "But what is the use of seeking? Nothing is seen." Then
 to reply to him, "Do not despair." And he will answer that he would be
 glad to find some light, but that, according to this very religion, if
 he believed in it, it will be of no use to him, and that therefore he
 prefers not to seek. And to answer to that: The machine.
 
 
 248
 
 _A letter which indicates the use of proofs by the machine._--Faith is
 different from proof; the one is human, the other is a gift of God.
 _Justus ex fide vivit._[97] It is this faith that God Himself puts into
 the heart, of which the proof is often the instrument, _fides ex
 auditu_;[98] but this faith is in the heart, and makes us not say
 _scio_, but _credo_.
 
 
 249
 
 It is superstition to put one's hope in formalities; but it is pride to
 be unwilling to submit to them.
 
 
 250
 
 The external must be joined to the internal to obtain anything from God,
 that is to say, we must kneel, pray with the lips, etc., in order that
 proud man, who would not submit himself to God, may be now subject to
 the creature.[99] To expect help from these externals is superstition;
 to refuse to join them to the internal is pride.
 
 
 251
 
 Other religions, as the pagan, are more popular, for they consist in
 externals. But they are not for educated people. A purely intellectual
 religion would be more suited to the learned, but it would be of no use
 to the common people. The Christian religion alone is adapted to all,
 being composed of externals and internals. It raises the common people
 to the internal, and humbles the proud to the external; it is not
 perfect without the two, for the people must understand the spirit of
 the letter, and the learned must submit their spirit to the letter.
 
 
 252
 
 For we must not misunderstand ourselves; we are as much automatic as
 intellectual; and hence it comes that the instrument by which conviction
 is attained is not demonstrated alone. How few things are demonstrated?
 Proofs only convince the mind. Custom is the source of our strongest and
 most believed proofs. It bends the automaton, which persuades the mind
 without its thinking about the matter. Who has demonstrated that there
 will be a to-morrow, and that we shall die? And what is more believed?
 It is, then, custom which persuades us of it; it is custom that makes
 so many men Christians; custom that makes them Turks, heathens,
 artisans, soldiers, etc. (Faith in baptism is more received among
 Christians than among Turks.) Finally, we must have recourse to it when
 once the mind has seen where the truth is, in order to quench our
 thirst, and steep ourselves in that belief, which escapes us at every
 hour; for always to have proofs ready is too much trouble. We must get
 an easier belief, which is that of custom, which, without violence,
 without art, without argument, makes us believe things, and inclines all
 our powers to this belief, so that out soul falls naturally into it. It
 is not enough to believe only by force of conviction, when the automaton
 is inclined to believe the contrary. Both our parts must be made to
 believe, the mind by reasons which it is sufficient to have seen once in
 a lifetime, and the automaton by custom, and by not allowing it to
 incline to the contrary. _Inclina cor meum, Deus._[100]
 
 The reason acts slowly, with so many examinations, and on so many
 principles, which must be always present, that at every hour it falls
 asleep, or wanders, through want of having all its principles present.
 Feeling does not act thus; it acts in a moment, and is always ready to
 act. We must then put our faith in feeling; otherwise it will be always
 vacillating.
 
 
 253
 
 Two extremes: to exclude reason, to admit reason only.
 
 
 254
 
 It is not a rare thing to have to reprove the world for too much
 docility. It is a natural vice like credulity, and as pernicious.
 Superstition.
 
 
 255
 
 Piety is different from superstition.
 
 To carry piety as far as superstition is to destroy it.
 
 The heretics reproach us for this superstitious submission. This is to
 do what they reproach us for ...
 
 Infidelity, not to believe in the Eucharist, because it is not seen.
 
 Superstition to believe propositions. Faith, etc.
 
 
 256
 
 I say there are few true Christians, even as regards faith. There are
 many who believe but from superstition. There are many who do not
 believe solely from wickedness. Few are between the two.
 
 In this I do not include those who are of truly pious character, nor all
 those who believe from a feeling in their heart.
 
 
 257
 
 There are only three kinds of persons; those who serve God, having found
 Him; others who are occupied in seeking Him, not having found Him; while
 the remainder live without seeking Him, and without having found Him.
 The first are reasonable and happy, the last are foolish and unhappy;
 those between are unhappy and reasonable.
 
 
 258
 
 _Unusquisque sibi Deum fingit._[101]
 
 Disgust.
 
 
 259
 
 Ordinary people have the power of not thinking of that about which they
 do not wish to think. "Do not meditate on the passages about the
 Messiah," said the Jew to his son. Thus our people often act. Thus are
 false religions preserved, and even the true one, in regard to many
 persons.
 
 But there are some who have not the power of thus preventing thought,
 and who think so much the more as they are forbidden. These undo false
 religions, and even the true one, if they do not find solid arguments.
 
 
 260
 
 They hide themselves in the press, and call numbers to their rescue.
 Tumult.
 
 _Authority._--So far from making it a rule to believe a thing because
 you have heard it, you ought to believe nothing without putting yourself
 into the position as if you had never heard it.
 
 It is your own assent to yourself, and the constant voice of your own
 reason, and not of others, that should make you believe.
 
 Belief is so important! A hundred contradictions might be true. If
 antiquity were the rule of belief, men of ancient time would then be
 without rule. If general consent, if men had perished?
 
 False humanity, pride.
 
 Lift the curtain. You try in vain; if you must either believe, or deny,
 or doubt. Shall we then have no rule? We judge that animals do well what
 they do. Is there no rule whereby to judge men?
 
 To deny, to believe, and to doubt well, are to a man what the race is to
 a horse.
 
 Punishment of those who sin, error.
 
 
 261
 
 Those who do not love the truth take as a pretext that it is disputed,
 and that a multitude deny it. And so their error arises only from this,
 that they do not love either truth or charity. Thus they are without
 excuse.
 
 
 262
 
 Superstition and lust. Scruples, evil desires. Evil fear; fear, not such
 as comes from a belief in God, but such as comes from a doubt whether He
 exists or not. True fear comes from faith; false fear comes from doubt.
 True fear is joined to hope, because it is born of faith, and because
 men hope in the God in whom they believe. False fear is joined to
 despair, because men fear the God in whom they have no belief. The
 former fear to lose Him; the latter fear to find Him.
 
 
 263
 
 "A miracle," says one, "would strengthen my faith." He says so when he
 does not see one. Reasons, seen from afar, appear to limit our view; but
 when they are reached, we begin to see beyond. Nothing stops the
 nimbleness of our mind. There is no rule, say we, which has not some
 exceptions, no truth so general which has not some aspect in which it
 fails. It is sufficient that it be not absolutely universal to give us a
 pretext for applying the exceptions to the present subject, and for
 saying, "This is not always true; there are therefore cases where it is
 not so." It only remains to show that this is one of them; and that is
 why we are very awkward or unlucky, if we do not find one some day.
 
 
 264
 
 We do not weary of eating and sleeping every day, for hunger and
 sleepiness recur. Without that we should weary of them. So, without the
 hunger for spiritual things, we weary of them. Hunger after
 righteousness, the eighth beatitude.[102]
 
 
 265
 
 Faith indeed tells what the senses do not tell, but not the contrary of
 what they see. It is above them and not contrary to them.
 
 
 266
 
 How many stars have telescopes revealed to us which did not exist for
 our philosophers of old! We freely attack Holy Scripture on the great
 number of stars, saying, "There are only one thousand and
 twenty-eight,[103] we know it." There is grass on the earth, we see
 it--from the moon we would not see it--and on the grass are leaves, and
 in these leaves are small animals; but after that no more.--O
 presumptuous man!--The compounds are composed of elements, and the
 elements not.--O presumptuous man! Here is a fine reflection.--We must
 not say that there is anything which we do not see.--We must then talk
 like others, but not think like them.
 
 
 267
 
 The last proceeding of reason is to recognise that there is an infinity
 of things which are beyond it. It is but feeble if it does not see so
 far as to know this. But if natural things are beyond it, what will be
 said of supernatural?
 
 
 268
 
 _Submission._--We must know where to doubt, where to feel certain, where
 to submit. He who does not do so, understands not the force of reason.
 There are some who offend against these three rules, either by affirming
 everything as demonstrative, from want of knowing what demonstration is;
 or by doubting everything, from want of knowing where to submit; or by
 submitting in everything, from want of knowing where they must judge.
 
 
 269
 
 Submission is the use of reason in which consists true Christianity.
 
 
 270
 
 _St. Augustine._[104]--Reason would never submit, if it did not judge
 that there are some occasions on which it ought to submit. It is then
 right for it to submit, when it judges that it ought to submit.
 
 
 271
 
 Wisdom sends us to childhood. _Nisi efficiamini sicut parvuli._[105]
 
 
 272
 
 There is nothing so conformable to reason as this disavowal of reason.
 
 
 273
 
 If we submit everything to reason, our religion will have no mysterious
 and supernatural element. If we offend the principles of reason, our
 religion will be absurd and ridiculous.
 
 
 274
 
 All our reasoning reduces itself to yielding to feeling.
 
 But fancy is like, though contrary to feeling, so that we cannot
 distinguish between these contraries. One person says that my feeling is
 fancy, another that his fancy is feeling. We should have a rule. Reason
 offers itself; but it is pliable in every sense; and thus there is no
 rule.
 
 
 275
 
 Men often take their imagination for their heart; and they believe they
 are converted as soon as they think of being converted.
 
 
 276
 
 M. de Roannez said: "Reasons come to me afterwards, but at first a thing
 pleases or shocks me without my knowing the reason, and yet it shocks me
 for that reason which I only discover afterwards." But I believe, not
 that it shocked him for the reasons which were found afterwards, but
 that these reasons were only found because it shocks him.
 
 
 277
 
 The heart has its reasons, which reason does not know. We feel it in a
 thousand things. I say that the heart naturally loves the Universal
 Being, and also itself naturally, according as it gives itself to them;
 and it hardens itself against one or the other at its will. You have
 rejected the one, and kept the other. Is it by reason that you love
 yourself?
 
 
 278
 
 It is the heart which experiences God, and not the reason. This, then,
 is faith: God felt by the heart, not by the reason.
 
 
 279
 
 Faith is a gift of God; do not believe that we said it was a gift of
 reasoning. Other religions do not say this of their faith. They only
 gave reasoning in order to arrive at it, and yet it does not bring them
 to it.
 
 
 280
 
 The knowledge of God is very far from the love of Him.
 
 
 281
 
 Heart, instinct, principles.
 
 
 282
 
 We know truth, not only by the reason, but also by the heart, and it is
 in this last way that we know first principles; and reason, which has no
 part in it, tries in vain to impugn them. The sceptics, who have only
 this for their object, labour to no purpose. We know that we do not
 dream, and however impossible it is for us to prove it by reason, this
 inability demonstrates only the weakness of our reason, but not, as they
 affirm, the uncertainty of all our knowledge. For the knowledge of first
 principles, as space, time, motion, number, is as sure as any of those
 which we get from reasoning. And reason must trust these intuitions of
 the heart, and must base them on every argument. (We have intuitive
 knowledge of the tri-dimensional nature of space, and of the infinity of
 number, and reason then shows that there are no two square numbers one
 of which is double of the other. Principles are intuited, propositions
 are inferred, all with certainty, though in different ways.) And it is
 as useless and absurd for reason to demand from the heart proofs of her
 first principles, before admitting them, as it would be for the heart to
 demand from reason an intuition of all demonstrated propositions before
 accepting them.
 
 This inability ought, then, to serve only to humble reason, which would
 judge all, but not to impugn our certainty, as if only reason were
 capable of instructing us. Would to God, on the contrary, that we had
 never need of it, and that we knew everything by instinct and intuition!
 But nature has refused us this boon. On the contrary, she has given us
 but very little knowledge of this kind; and all the rest can be acquired
 only by reasoning.
 
 Therefore, those to whom God has imparted religion by intuition are very
 fortunate, and justly convinced. But to those who do not have it, we can
 give it only by reasoning, waiting for God to give them spiritual
 insight, without which faith is only human, and useless for salvation.
 
 
 283
 
 _Order.--Against the objection that Scripture has no order._
 
 The heart has its own order; the intellect has its own, which is by
 principle and demonstration. The heart has another. We do not prove that
 we ought to be loved by enumerating in order the causes of love; that
 would be ridiculous.
 
 Jesus Christ and Saint Paul employ the rule of love, not of intellect;
 for they would warm, not instruct. It is the same with Saint Augustine.
 This order consists chiefly in digressions on each point to indicate the
 end, and keep it always in sight.
 
 
 284
 
 Do not wonder to see simple people believe without reasoning. God
 imparts to them love of Him and hatred of self. He inclines their heart
 to believe. Men will never believe with a saving and real faith, unless
 God inclines their heart; and they will believe as soon as He inclines
 it. And this is what David knew well, when he said: _Inclina cor meum,
 Deus, in ..._[106]
 
 
 285
 
 Religion is suited to all kinds of minds. Some pay attention only to its
 establishment,[107] and this religion is such that its very
 establishment suffices to prove its truth. Others trace it even to the
 apostles. The more learned go back to the beginning of the world. The
 angels see it better still, and from a more distant time.
 
 
 286
 
 Those who believe without having read the Testaments, do so because they
 have an inward disposition entirely holy, and all that they hear of our
 religion conforms to it. They feel that a God has made them; they desire
 only to love God; they desire to hate themselves only. They feel that
 they have no strength in themselves; that they are incapable of coming
 to God; and that if God does not come to them, they can have no
 communion with Him. And they hear our religion say that men must love
 God only, and hate self only; but that all being corrupt and unworthy of
 God, God made Himself man to unite Himself to us. No more is required to
 persuade men who have this disposition in their heart, and who have this
 knowledge of their duty and of their inefficiency.
 
 
 287
 
 Those whom we see to be Christians without the knowledge of the prophets
 and evidences, nevertheless judge of their religion as well as those who
 have that knowledge. They judge of it by the heart, as others judge of
 it by the intellect. God Himself inclines them to believe, and thus they
 are most effectively convinced.
 
 I confess indeed that one of those Christians who believe without proofs
 will not perhaps be capable of convincing an infidel who will say the
 same of himself. But those who know the proofs of religion will prove
 without difficulty that such a believer is truly inspired by God, though
 he cannot prove it himself.
 
 For God having said in His prophecies (which are undoubtedly
 prophecies), that in the reign of Jesus Christ He would spread His
 spirit abroad among nations, and that the youths and maidens and
 children of the Church would prophesy;[108] it is certain that the
 Spirit of God is in these, and not in the others.
 
 
 288
 
 Instead of complaining that God had hidden Himself, you will give Him
 thanks for having revealed so much of Himself; and you will also give
 Him thanks for not having revealed Himself to haughty sages, unworthy to
 know so holy a God.
 
 Two kinds of persons know Him: those who have a humble heart, and who
 love lowliness, whatever kind of intellect they may have, high or low;
 and those who have sufficient understanding to see the truth, whatever
 opposition they may have to it.
 
 
 289
 
 _Proof._--1. The Christian religion, by its establishment, having
 established itself so strongly, so gently, whilst contrary to
 nature.--2. The sanctity, the dignity, and the humility of a Christian
 soul.--3. The miracles of Holy Scripture.--4. Jesus Christ in
 particular.--5. The apostles in particular.--6. Moses and the prophets
 in particular.--7. The Jewish people.--8. The prophecies.--9.
 Perpetuity; no religion has perpetuity.--10. The doctrine which gives a
 reason for everything.--11. The sanctity of this law.--12. By the course
 of the world.
 
 Surely, after considering what is life and what is religion, we should
 not refuse to obey the inclination to follow it, if it comes into our
 heart; and it is certain that there is no ground for laughing at those
 who follow it.
 
 
 290
 
 _Proofs of religion._--Morality, Doctrine, Miracles, Prophecies, Types.
 
 
 
 
 SECTION V
 
 JUSTICE AND THE REASON OF EFFECTS
 
 
 291
 
 In the letter _On Injustice_ can come the ridiculousness of the law that
 the elder gets all. "My friend, you were born on this side of the
 mountain, it is therefore just that your elder brother gets everything."
 
 "Why do you kill me?"
 
 
 292
 
 He lives on the other side of the water.
 
 
 293
 
 "Why do you kill me? What! do you not live on the other side of the
 water? If you lived on this side, my friend, I should be an assassin,
 and it would be unjust to slay you in this manner. But since you live on
 the other side, I am a hero, and it is just."
 
 
 294
 
 On what shall man found the order of the world which he would
 govern?[109] Shall it be on the caprice of each individual? What
 confusion! Shall it be on justice? Man is ignorant of it.
 
 Certainly had he known it, he would not have established this maxim, the
 most general of all that obtain among men, that each should follow the
 custom of his own country. The glory of true equity would have brought
 all nations under subjection, and legislators would not have taken as
 their model the fancies and caprice of Persians and Germans instead of
 this unchanging justice. We should have seen it set up in all the States
 on earth and in all times; whereas we see neither justice nor injustice
 which does not change its nature with change in climate. Three degrees
 of latitude reverse all jurisprudence; a meridian decides the truth.
 Fundamental laws change after a few years of possession; right has its
 epochs; the entry of Saturn into the Lion marks to us the origin of
 such and such a crime. A strange justice that is bounded by a river!
 Truth on this side of the Pyrenees, error on the other side.
 
 Men admit that justice does not consist in these customs, but that it
 resides in natural laws, common to every country. They would certainly
 maintain it obstinately, if reckless chance which has distributed human
 laws had encountered even one which was universal; but the farce is that
 the caprice of men has so many vagaries that there is no such law.
 
 Theft, incest, infanticide, parricide, have all had a place among
 virtuous actions. Can anything be more ridiculous than that a man should
 have the right to kill me because he lives on the other side of the
 water, and because his ruler has a quarrel with mine, though I have none
 with him?
 
 Doubtless there are natural laws; but good reason once corrupted has
 corrupted all. _Nihil amplius nostrum est;[110] quod nostrum dicimus,
 artis est. Ex senatus--consultis et plebiscitis crimina exercentur.[111]
 Ut olim vitiis, sic nunc legibus laboramus._[112]
 
 The result of this confusion is that one affirms the essence of justice
 to be the authority of the legislator; another, the interest of the
 sovereign;[113] another, present custom,[114] and this is the most sure.
 Nothing, according to reason alone, is just in itself; all changes with
 time. Custom creates the whole of equity, for the simple reason that it
 is accepted. It is the mystical foundation of its authority;[115]
 whoever carries it back to first principles destroys it. Nothing is so
 faulty as those laws which correct faults. He who obeys them because
 they are just, obeys a justice which is imaginary, and not the essence
 of law; it is quite self-contained, it is law and nothing more. He who
 will examine its motive will find it so feeble and so trifling that if
 he be not accustomed to contemplate the wonders of human imagination, he
 will marvel that one century has gained for it so much pomp and
 reverence. The art of opposition and of revolution is to unsettle
 established customs, sounding them even to their source, to point out
 their want of authority and justice. We must, it is said, get back to
 the natural and fundamental laws of the State, which an unjust custom
 has abolished. It is a game certain to result in the loss of all;
 nothing will be just on the balance. Yet people readily lend their ear
 to such arguments. They shake off the yoke as soon as they recognise it;
 and the great profit by their ruin, and by that of these curious
 investigators of accepted customs. But from a contrary mistake men
 sometimes think they can justly do everything which is not without an
 example. That is why the wisest of legislators[116] said that it was
 necessary to deceive men for their own good; and another, a good
 politician, _Cum veritatem qua liberetur ignoret, expedit quod
 fallatur._[117] We must not see the fact of usurpation; law was once
 introduced without reason, and has become reasonable. We must make it
 regarded as authoritative, eternal, and conceal its origin, if we do not
 wish that it should soon come to an end.
 
 
 295
 
 _Mine, thine._--"This dog is mine," said those poor children; "that is
 my place in the sun." Here is the beginning and the image of the
 usurpation of all the earth.
 
 
 296
 
 When the question for consideration is whether we ought to make war, and
 kill so many men--condemn so many Spaniards to death--only one man is
 judge, and he is an interested party. There should be a third, who is
 disinterested.
 
 
 297
 
 _Veri juris._[118]--We have it no more; if we had it, we should take
 conformity to the customs of a country as the rule of justice. It is
 here that, not finding justice, we have found force, etc.
 
 
 298
 
 _Justice, might._--It is right that what is just should be obeyed; it is
 necessary that what is strongest should be obeyed. Justice without might
 is helpless; might without justice is tyrannical. Justice without might
 is gainsaid, because there are always offenders; might without justice
 is condemned. We must then combine justice and might, and for this end
 make what is just strong, or what is strong just.
 
 Justice is subject to dispute; might is easily recognised and is not
 disputed. So we cannot give might to justice, because might has gainsaid
 justice, and has declared that it is she herself who is just. And thus
 being unable to make what is just strong, we have made what is strong
 just.
 
 
 299
 
 The only universal rules are the laws of the country in ordinary
 affairs, and of the majority in others. Whence comes this? From the
 might which is in them. Hence it comes that kings, who have power of a
 different kind, do not follow the majority of their ministers.
 
 No doubt equality of goods is just; but, being unable to cause might to
 obey justice, men have made it just to obey might. Unable to strengthen
 justice, they have justified might; so that the just and the strong
 should unite, and there should be peace, which is the sovereign good.
 
 
 300
 
 "When a strong man armed keepeth his goods, his goods are in
 peace."[119]
 
 
 301
 
 Why do we follow the majority? It is because they have more reason? No,
 because they have more power.
 
 Why do we follow the ancient laws and opinions? Is it because they are
 more sound? No, but because they are unique, and remove from us the root
 of difference.
 
 
 302
 
 ... It is the effect of might, not of custom. For those who are capable
 of originality are few; the greater number will only follow, and refuse
 glory to those inventors who seek it by their inventions. And if these
 are obstinate in their wish to obtain glory, and despise those who do
 not invent, the latter will call them ridiculous names, and would beat
 them with a stick. Let no one then boast of his subtlety, or let him
 keep his complacency to himself.
 
 
 303
 
 Might is the sovereign of the world, and not opinion.--But opinion makes
 use of might.--It is might that makes opinion. Gentleness is beautiful
 in our opinion. Why? Because he who will dance on a rope will be
 alone,[120] and I will gather a stronger mob of people who will say that
 it is unbecoming.

 The cords which bind the respect of men to each other are in general
 cords of necessity; for there must be different degrees, all men wishing
 to rule, and not all being able to do so, but some being able.
 
 Let us then imagine we see society in the process of formation. Men will
 doubtless fight till the stronger party overcomes the weaker, and a
 dominant party is established. But when this is once determined, the
 masters, who do not desire the continuation of strife, then decree that
 the power which is in their hands shall be transmitted as they please.
 Some place it in election by the people, others in hereditary
 succession, etc.
 
 And this is the point where imagination begins to play its part. Till
 now power makes fact; now power is sustained by imagination in a certain
 party, in France in the nobility, in Switzerland in the burgesses, etc.
 
 These cords which bind the respect of men to such and such an individual
 are therefore the cords of imagination.
 
 
 305
 
 The Swiss are offended by being called gentlemen, and prove themselves
 true plebeians in order to be thought worthy of great office.
 
 
 306
 
 As duchies, kingships, and magistracies are real and necessary, because
 might rules all, they exist everywhere and always. But since only
 caprice makes such and such a one a ruler, the principle is not
 constant, but subject to variation, etc.
 
 
 307
 
 The chancellor is grave, and clothed with ornaments, for his position is
 unreal. Not so the king, he has power, and has nothing to do with the
 imagination. Judges, physicians, etc. appeal only to the imagination.
 
 
 308
 
 The habit of seeing kings accompanied by guards, drums, officers, and
 all the paraphernalia which mechanically inspire respect and awe, makes
 their countenance, when sometimes seen alone without these
 accompaniments, impress respect and awe on their subjects; because we
 cannot separate in thought their persons from the surroundings with
 which we see them usually joined. And the world, which knows not that
 this effect is the result of habit, believes that it arises by a natural
 force, whence come these words, "The character of Divinity is stamped on
 his countenance," etc.
 
 
 309
 
 _Justice._--As custom determines what is agreeable, so also does it
 determine justice.
 
 
 310
 
 _King and tyrant._--I, too, will keep my thoughts secret.
 
 I will take care on every journey.
 
 Greatness of establishment, respect for establishment.
 
 The pleasure of the great is the power to make people happy.
 
 The property of riches is to be given liberally.
 
 The property of each thing must be sought. The property of power is to
 protect.
 
 When force attacks humbug, when a private soldier takes the square cap
 off a first president, and throws it out of the window.
 
 
 311
 
 The government founded on opinion and imagination reigns for some time,
 and this government is pleasant and voluntary; that founded on might
 lasts for ever. Thus opinion is the queen of the world, but might is its
 tyrant.
 
 
 312
 
 Justice is what is established; and thus all our established laws will
 necessarily be regarded as just without examination, since they are
 established.
 
 
 313
 
 _Sound opinions of the people._--Civil wars are the greatest of
 evils.[121] They are inevitable, if we wish to reward desert; for all
 will say they are deserving. The evil we have to fear from a fool who
 succeeds by right of birth, is neither so great nor so sure.
 
 
 314
 
 God has created all for Himself. He has bestowed upon Himself the power
 of pain and pleasure.
 
 You can apply it to God, or to yourself. If to God, the Gospel is the
 rule. If to yourself, you will take the place of God. As God is
 surrounded by persons full of charity, who ask of Him the blessings of
 charity that are in His power, so ... Recognise then and learn that you
 are only a king of lust, and take the ways of lust.
 
 
 315
 
 _The reason of effects._--It is wonderful that men would not have me
 honour a man clothed in brocade, and followed by seven or eight lackeys!
 Why! He will have me thrashed, if I do not salute him. This custom is a
 force. It is the same with a horse in fine trappings in comparison with
 another! Montaigne[122] is a fool not to see what difference there is,
 to wonder at our finding any, and to ask the reason. "Indeed," says he,
 "how comes it," etc....
 
 
 316
 
 _Sound opinions of the people._--To be spruce is not altogether foolish,
 for it proves that a great number of people work for one. It shows by
 one's hair, that one has a valet, a perfumer, etc., by one's band,
 thread, lace, ... etc. Now it is not merely superficial nor merely
 outward show to have many arms at command. The more arms one has, the
 more powerful one is. To be spruce is to show one's power.
 
 
 317
 
 Deference means, "Put yourself to inconvenience." This is apparently
 silly, but is quite right. For it is to say, "I would indeed put myself
 to inconvenience if you required it, since indeed I do so when it is of
 no service to you." Deference further serves to distinguish the great.
 Now if deference was displayed by sitting in an arm-chair, we should
 show deference to everybody, and so no distinction would be made; but,
 being put to inconvenience, we distinguish very well.
 
 
 318
 
 He has four lackeys.
 
 
 319
 
 How rightly do we distinguish men by external appearances rather than by
 internal qualities! Which of us two shall have precedence? Who will give
 place to the other? The least clever. But I am as clever as he. We
 should have to fight over this. He has four lackeys, and I have only
 one. This can be seen; we have only to count. It falls to me to yield,
 and I am a fool if I contest the matter. By this means we are at peace,
 which is the greatest of boons.
 
 
 320
 
 The most unreasonable things in the world become most reasonable,
 because of the unruliness of men. What is less reasonable than to choose
 the eldest son of a queen to rule a State? We do not choose as captain
 of a ship the passenger who is of the best family.
 
 This law would be absurd and unjust; but because men are so themselves,
 and always will be so, it becomes reasonable and just. For whom will men
 choose, as the most virtuous and able? We at once come to blows, as each
 claims to be the most virtuous and able. Let us then attach this quality
 to something indisputable. This is the king's eldest son. That is clear,
 and there is no dispute. Reason can do no better, for civil war is the
 greatest of evils.
 
 
 321
 
 Children are astonished to see their comrades respected.
 
 
 322
 
 To be of noble birth is a great advantage. In eighteen years it places a
 man within the select circle, known and respected, as another would have
 merited in fifty years. It is a gain of thirty years without trouble.
 
 
 323
 
 What is the Ego?
 
 Suppose a man puts himself at a window to see those who pass by. If I
 pass by, can I say that he placed himself there to see me? No; for he
 does not think of me in particular. But does he who loves someone on
 account of beauty really love that person? No; for the small-pox, which
 will kill beauty without killing the person, will cause him to love her
 no more.
 
 And if one loves me for my judgment, memory, he does not love _me_, for
 I can lose these qualities without losing myself. Where, then, is this
 Ego, if it be neither in the body nor in the soul? And how love the body
 or the soul, except for these qualities which do not constitute _me_,
 since they are perishable? For it is impossible and would be unjust to
 love the soul of a person in the abstract, and whatever qualities might
 be therein. We never, then, love a person, but only qualities.
 
 Let us, then, jeer no more at those who are honoured on account of rank
 and office; for we love a person only on account of borrowed qualities.
 
 
 324
 
 The people have very sound opinions, for example:
 
 1. In having preferred diversion and hunting to poetry. The half-learned
 laugh at it, and glory in being above the folly of the world; but the
 people are right for a reason which these do not fathom.
 
 2. In having distinguished men by external marks, as birth or wealth.
 The world again exults in showing how unreasonable this is; but it is
 very reasonable. Savages laugh at an infant king.[123]
 
 3. In being offended at a blow, on in desiring glory so much. But it is
 very desirable on account of the other essential goods which are joined
 to it; and a man who has received a blow, without resenting it, is
 overwhelmed with taunts and indignities.
 
 4. In working for the uncertain; in sailing on the sea; in walking over
 a plank.
 
 
 325
 
 Montaigne is wrong. Custom should be followed only because it is custom,
 and not because it is reasonable or just. But people follow it for this
 sole reason, that they think it just. Otherwise they would follow it no
 longer, although it were the custom; for they will only submit to reason
 or justice. Custom without this would pass for tyranny; but the
 sovereignty of reason and justice is no more tyrannical than that of
 desire. They are principles natural to man.
 
 It would therefore be right to obey laws and customs, because they are
 laws; but we should know that there is neither truth nor justice to
 introduce into them, that we know nothing of these, and so must follow
 what is accepted. By this means we would never depart from them. But
 people cannot accept this doctrine; and, as they believe that truth can
 be found, and that it exists in law and custom, they believe them, and
 take their antiquity as a proof of their truth, and not simply of their
 authority apart from truth. Thus they obey laws, but they are liable to
 revolt when these are proved to be valueless; and this can be shown of
 all, looked at from a certain aspect.
 
 
 326
 
 _Injustice._--It is dangerous to tell the people that the laws are
 unjust; for they obey them only because they think them just. Therefore
 it is necessary to tell them at the same time that they must obey them
 because they are laws, just as they must obey superiors, not because
 they are just, but because they are superiors. In this way all sedition
 is prevented, if this can be made intelligible, and it be understood
 what is the proper definition of justice.
 
 
 327
 
 The world is a good judge of things, for it is in natural ignorance,
 which is man's true state.[124] The sciences have two extremes which
 meet. The first is the pure natural ignorance in which all men find
 themselves at birth. The other extreme is that reached by great
 intellects, who, having run through all that men can know, find they
 know nothing, and come back again to that same ignorance from which they
 set out; but this is a learned ignorance which is conscious of itself.
 Those between the two, who have departed from natural ignorance and not
 been able to reach the other, have some smattering of this vain
 knowledge, and pretend to be wise. These trouble the world, and are bad
 judges of everything. The people and the wise constitute the world;
 these despise it, and are despised. They judge badly of everything, and
 the world judges rightly of them.
 
 
 328
 
 _The reason of effects._--Continual alternation of pro and con.
 
 We have then shown that man is foolish, by the estimation he makes of
 things which are not essential; and all these opinions are destroyed. We
 have next shown that all these opinions are very sound, and that thus,
 since all these vanities are well founded, the people are not so foolish
 as is said. And so we have destroyed the opinion which destroyed that of
 the people.
 
 But we must now destroy this last proposition, and show that it remains
 always true that the people are foolish, though their opinions are
 sound; because they do not perceive the truth where it is, and, as they
 place it where it is not, their opinions are always very false and very
 unsound.
 
 
 329
 
 _The reason of effects._--The weakness of man is the reason why so many
 things are considered fine, as to be good at playing the lute. It is
 only an evil because of our weakness.
 
 
 330
 
 The power of kings is founded on the reason and on the folly of the
 people, and specially on their folly. The greatest and most important
 thing in the world has weakness for its foundation, and this foundation
 is wonderfully sure; for there is nothing more sure than this, that the
 people will be weak. What is based on sound reason is very ill founded,
 as the estimate of wisdom.
 
 
 331
 
 We can only think of Plato and Aristotle in grand academic robes. They
 were honest men, like others, laughing with their friends, and when they
 diverted themselves with writing their _Laws_ and the _Politics_, they
 did it as an amusement. That part of their life was the least
 philosophic and the least serious; the most philosophic was to live
 simply and quietly. If they wrote on politics, it was as if laying down
 rules for a lunatic asylum; and if they presented the appearance of
 speaking of a great matter, it was because they knew that the madmen, to
 whom they spoke, thought they were kings and emperors. They entered into
 their principles in order to make their madness as little harmful as
 possible.
 
 
 332
 
 Tyranny consists in the desire of universal power beyond its scope.
 
 There are different assemblies of the strong, the fair, the sensible,
 the pious, in which each man rules at home, not elsewhere. And sometimes
 they meet, and the strong and the fair foolishly fight as to who shall
 be master, for their mastery is of different kinds. They do not
 understand one another, and their fault is the desire to rule
 everywhere. Nothing can effect this, not even might, which is of no use
 in the kingdom of the wise, and is only mistress of external actions.
 
 _Tyranny_--... So these expressions are false and tyrannical: "I am
 fair, therefore I must be feared. I am strong, therefore I must be
 loved. I am ..."
 
 Tyranny is the wish to have in one way what can only be had in another.
 We render different duties to different merits; the duty of love to the
 pleasant; the duty of fear to the strong; the duty of belief to the
 learned.
 
 We must render these duties; it is unjust to refuse them, and unjust to
 ask others. And so it is false and tyrannical to say, "He is not strong,
 therefore I will not esteem him; he is not able, therefore I will not
 fear him."
 
 
 333
 
 Have you never seen people who, in order to complain of the little fuss
 you make about them, parade before you the example of great men who
 esteem them? In answer I reply to them, "Show me the merit whereby you
 have charmed these persons, and I also will esteem you."
 
 
 334
 
 _The reason of effects._--Lust and force are the source of all our
 actions; lust causes voluntary actions, force involuntary ones.
 
 
 335
 
 _The reason of effects._--It is then true to say that all the world is
 under a delusion; for, although the opinions of the people are sound,
 they are not so as conceived by them, since they think the truth to be
 where it is not. Truth is indeed in their opinions, but not at the point
 where they imagine it. [Thus] it is true that we must honour noblemen,
 but not because noble birth is real superiority, etc.
 
 
 336
 
 _The reason of effects._--We must keep our thought secret, and judge
 everything by it, while talking like the people.
 
 
 337
 
 _The reason of effects._--Degrees. The people honour persons of high
 birth. The semi-learned despise them, saying that birth is not a
 personal, but a chance superiority. The learned honour them, not for
 popular reasons, but for secret reasons. Devout persons, who have more
 zeal than knowledge, despise them, in spite of that consideration which
 makes them honoured by the learned, because they judge them by a new
 light which piety gives them. But perfect Christians honour them by
 another and higher light. So arise a succession of opinions for and
 against, according to the light one has.
 
 
 338
 
 True Christians nevertheless comply with folly, not because they respect
 folly, but the command of God, who for the punishment of men has made
 them subject to these follies. _Omnis creatura subjecta est
 vanitati.[125] Liberabitur._[126] Thus Saint Thomas[127] explains the
 passage in Saint James on giving place to the rich, that if they do it
 not in the sight of God, they depart from the command of religion.
 
 
 
 
 SECTION VI
 
 THE PHILOSOPHERS
 
 
 339
 
 I can well conceive a man without hands, feet, head (for it is only
 experience which teaches us that the head is more necessary than feet).
 But I cannot conceive man without thought; he would be a stone or a
 brute.
 
 
 340
 
 The arithmetical machine produces effects which approach nearer to
 thought than all the actions of animals. But it does nothing which would
 enable us to attribute will to it, as to the animals.
 
 
 341
 
 The account of the pike and frog of Liancourt.[128] They do it always,
 and never otherwise, nor any other thing showing mind.
 
 
 342
 
 If an animal did by mind what it does by instinct, and if it spoke by
 mind what it speaks by instinct, in hunting, and in warning its mates
 that the prey is found or lost; it would indeed also speak in regard to
 those things which affect it closer, as example, "Gnaw me this cord
 which is wounding me, and which I cannot reach."
 
 
 343
 
 The beak of the parrot, which it wipes, although it is clean.
 
 
 344
 
 Instinct and reason, marks of two natures.
 
 
 345
 
 Reason commands us far more imperiously than a master; for in disobeying
 the one we are unfortunate, and in disobeying the other we are fools.
 
 
 346
 
 Thought constitutes the greatness of man.
 
 
 347
 
 Man is but a reed, the most feeble thing in nature; but he is a thinking
 reed. The entire universe need not arm itself to crush him. A vapour, a
 drop of water suffices to kill him. But, if the universe were to crush
 him, man would still be more noble than that which killed him, because
 he knows that he dies and the advantage which the universe has over him;
 the universe knows nothing of this.
 
 All our dignity consists, then, in thought. By it we must elevate
 ourselves, and not by space and time which we cannot fill. Let us
 endeavour, then, to think well; this is the principle of morality.
 
 
 348
 
 _A thinking reed._--It is not from space that I must seek my dignity,
 but from the government of my thought. I shall have no more if I possess
 worlds. By space the universe encompasses and swallows me up like an
 atom; by thought I comprehend the world.
 
 
 349
 
 _Immateriality of the soul._--Philosophers[129] who have mastered their
 passions. What matter could do that?
 
 
 350
 
 _The Stoics._--They conclude that what has been done once can be done
 always, and that since the desire of glory imparts some power to those
 whom it possesses, others can do likewise. There are feverish movements
 which health cannot imitate.
 
 Epictetus[130] concludes that since there are consistent Christians,
 every man can easily be so.
 
 
 351
 
 Those great spiritual efforts, which the soul sometimes assays, are
 things on which it does not lay hold.[131] It only leaps to them, not as
 upon a throne, for ever, but merely for an instant.
 
 
 352
 
 The strength of a man's virtue must not be measured by his efforts, but
 by his ordinary life.
 
 
 353
 
 I do not admire the excess of a virtue as of valour, except I see at the
 same time the excess of the opposite virtue, as in Epaminondas,[132] who
 had the greatest valour and the greatest kindness. For otherwise it is
 not to rise, it is to fall. We do not display greatness by going to one
 extreme, but in touching both at once, and filling all the intervening
 space. But perhaps this is only a sudden movement of the soul from one
 to the other extreme, and in fact it is ever at one point only, as in
 the case of a firebrand. Be it so, but at least this indicates agility
 if not expanse of soul.
 
 
 354
 
 Man's nature is not always to advance; it has its advances and retreats.
 
 Fever has its cold and hot fits; and the cold proves as well as the hot
 the greatness of the fire of fever.
 
 The discoveries of men from age to age turn out the same. The kindness
 and the malice of the world in general are the same. _Plerumque gratae
 principibus vices._[133]
 
 
 355
 
 Continuous eloquence wearies.
 
 Princes and kings sometimes play. They are not always on their thrones.
 They weary there. Grandeur must be abandoned to be appreciated.
 Continuity in everything is unpleasant. Cold is agreeable, that we may
 get warm.
 
 Nature acts by progress, _itus et reditus_. It goes and returns, then
 advances further, then twice as much backwards, then more forward than
 ever, etc.
 
 The tide of the sea behaves in the same manner; and so apparently does
 the sun in its course.
 
 
 356
 
 The nourishment of the body is little by little. Fullness of nourishment
 and smallness of substance.
 
 
 357
 
 When we would pursue virtues to their extremes on either side, vices
 present themselves, which insinuate themselves insensibly there, in
 their insensible journey towards the infinitely little: and vices
 present themselves in a crowd towards the infinitely great, so that we
 lose ourselves in them, and no longer see virtues. We find fault with
 perfection itself.
 
 
 358
 
 Man is neither angel nor brute, and the unfortunate thing is that he who
 would act the angel acts the brute.[134]
 
 
 359
 
 We do not sustain ourselves in virtue by our own strength, but by the
 balancing of two opposed vices, just as we remain upright amidst two
 contrary gales. Remove one of the vices, and we fall into the other.
 
 
 360
 
 What the Stoics propose is so difficult and foolish!
 
 The Stoics lay down that all those who are not at the high degree of
 wisdom are equally foolish and vicious, as those who are two inches
 under water.
 
 
 361
 
 _The sovereign good. Dispute about the sovereign good._--_Ut sis
 contentus temetipso et ex te nascentibus bonis._[135] There is a
 contradiction, for in the end they advise suicide. Oh! What a happy
 life, from which we are to free ourselves as from the plague!
 
 
 362
 
 _Ex senatus-consultis et plebiscitis_ ...
 
 To ask like passages.

 _Nec me pudet, ut istos, fateri nescire quid nesciam._[147]
 
 _Melius non incipient._[148]
 
 
 365
 
 _Thought._--All the dignity of man consists in thought. Thought is
 therefore by its nature a wonderful and incomparable thing. It must have
 strange defects to be contemptible. But it has such, so that nothing is
 more ridiculous. How great it is in its nature! How vile it is in its
 defects!
 
 But what is this thought? How foolish it is!
 
 
 366
 
 The mind of this sovereign judge of the world is not so independent that
 it is not liable to be disturbed by the first din about it. The noise of
 a cannon is not necessary to hinder its thoughts; it needs only the
 creaking of a weathercock or a pulley. Do not wonder if at present it
 does not reason well; a fly is buzzing in its ears; that is enough to
 render it incapable of good judgment. If you wish it to be able to reach
 the truth, chase away that animal which holds its reason in check and
 disturbs that powerful intellect which rules towns and kingdoms. Here is
 a comical god! _O ridicolosissimo eroe!_
 
 
 367
 
 The power of flies; they win battles,[149] hinder our soul from acting,
 eat our body.
 
 
 368
 
 When it is said that heat is only the motions of certain molecules, and
 light the _conatus recedendi_ which we feel,[150] it astonishes us.
 What! Is pleasure only the ballet of our spirits? We have conceived so
 different an idea of it! And these sensations seem so removed from those
 others which we say are the same as those with which we compare them!
 The sensation from the fire, that warmth which affects us in a manner
 wholly different from touch, the reception of sound and light, all this
 appears to us mysterious, and yet it is material like the blow of a
 stone. It is true that the smallness of the spirits which enter into the
 pores touches other nerves, but there are always some nerves touched.
 
 
 369
 
 Memory is necessary for all the operations of reason.
 
 
 370
 
 [Chance gives rise to thoughts, and chance removes them; no art can keep
 or acquire them.
 
 A thought has escaped me. I wanted to write it down. I write instead,
 that it has escaped me.]
 
 
 371
 
 [When I was small, I hugged my book; and because it sometimes happened
 to me to ... in believing I hugged it, I doubted....]
 
 
 372
 
 In writing down my thought, it sometimes escapes me; but this makes me
 remember my weakness, that I constantly forget. This is as instructive
 to me as my forgotten thought; for I strive only to know my nothingness.
 
 
 373
 
 _Scepticism._--I shall here write my thoughts without order, and not
 perhaps in unintentional confusion; that is true order, which will
 always indicate my object by its very disorder. I should do too much
 honour to my subject, if I treated it with order, since I want to show
 that it is incapable of it.
 
 
 374
 
 What astonishes me most is to see that all the world is not astonished
 at its own weakness. Men act seriously, and each follows his own mode of
 life, not because it is in fact good to follow since it is the custom,
 but as if each man knew certainly where reason and justice are. They
 find themselves continually deceived, and by a comical humility think it
 is their own fault, and not that of the art which they claim always to
 possess. But it is well there are so many such people in the world, who
 are not sceptics for the glory of scepticism, in order to show that man
 is quite capable of the most extravagant opinions, since he is capable
 of believing that he is not in a state of natural and inevitable
 weakness, but, on the contrary, of natural wisdom. Nothing fortifies
 scepticism more than that there are some who are not sceptics; if all
 were so, they would be wrong.
 
 
 375
 
 [I have passed a great part of my life believing that there was justice,
 and in this I was not mistaken; for there is justice according as God
 has willed to reveal it to us. But I did not take it so, and this is
 where I made a mistake; for I believed that our justice was essentially
 just, and that I had that whereby to know and judge of it. But I have so
 often found my right judgment at fault, that at last I have come to
 distrust myself, and then others. I have seen changes in all nations and
 men, and thus after many changes of judgment regarding true justice, I
 have recognised that our nature was but in continual change, and I have
 not changed since; and if I changed, I would confirm my opinion.
 
 The sceptic Arcesilaus,[151] who became a dogmatist.]
 
 
 376
 
 This sect derives more strength from its enemies than from its friends;
 for the weakness of man is far more evident in those who know it not
 than in those who know it.

 Discourses on humility are a source of pride in the vain, and of
 humility in the humble. So those on scepticism cause believers to
 affirm. Few men speak humbly of humility, chastely of chastity, few
 doubtingly of scepticism. We are only falsehood, duplicity,
 contradiction; we both conceal and disguise ourselves from ourselves.
 
 
 378
 
 _Scepticism._--Excess, like defect of intellect, is accused of madness.
 Nothing is good but mediocrity. The majority has settled that, and finds
 fault with him who escapes it at whichever end. I will not oppose it. I
 quite consent to put myself there, and refuse to be at the lower end,
 not because it is low, but because it is an end; for I would likewise
 refuse to be placed at the top. To leave the mean is to abandon
 humanity. The greatness of the human soul consists in knowing how to
 preserve the mean. So far from greatness consisting in leaving it, it
 consists in not leaving it.
 
 
 379
 
 It is not good to have too much liberty. It is not good to have all one
 wants.
 
 
 380
 
 All good maxims are in the world. We only need to apply them. For
 instance, we do not doubt that we ought to risk our lives in defence of
 the public good; but for religion, no.
 
 It is true there must be inequality among men; but if this be conceded,
 the door is opened not only to the highest power, but to the highest
 tyranny.
 
 We must relax our minds a little; but this opens the door to the
 greatest debauchery. Let us mark the limits. There are no limits in
 things. Laws would put them there, and the mind cannot suffer it.
 
 
 381
 
 When we are too young, we do not judge well; so, also, when we are too
 old. If we do not think enough, or if we think too much on any matter,
 we get obstinate and infatuated about it. If one considers one's work
 immediately after having done it, one is entirely prepossessed in its
 favour; by delaying too long, one can no longer enter into the spirit of
 it. So with pictures seen from too far or too near; there is but one
 exact point which is the true place wherefrom to look at them: the rest
 are too near, too far, too high, or too low. Perspective determines that
 point in the art of painting. But who shall determine it in truth and
 morality?
 
 
 382
 
 When all is equally agitated, nothing appears to be agitated, as in a
 ship. When all tend to debauchery, none appears to do so. He who stops
 draws attention to the excess of others, like a fixed point.
 
 
 383
 
 The licentious tell men of orderly lives that they stray from nature's
 path, while they themselves follow it; as people in a ship think those
 move who are on the shore. On all sides the language is similar. We must
 have a fixed point in order to judge. The harbour decides for those who
 are in a ship; but where shall we find a harbour in morality?
 
 
 384
 
 Contradiction is a bad sign of truth; several things which are certain
 are contradicted; several things which are false pass without
 contradiction. Contradiction is not a sign of falsity, nor the want of
 contradiction a sign of truth.
 
 
 385
 
 _Scepticism._--Each thing here is partly true and partly false.
 Essential truth is not so; it is altogether pure and altogether true.
 This mixture dishonours and annihilates it. Nothing is purely true, and
 thus nothing is true, meaning by that pure truth. You will say it is
 true that homicide is wrong. Yes; for we know well the wrong and the
 false. But what will you say is good? Chastity? I say no; for the world
 would come to an end. Marriage? No; continence is better. Not to kill?
 No; for lawlessness would be horrible, and the wicked would kill all the
 good. To kill? No; for that destroys nature. We possess truth and
 goodness only in part, and mingled with falsehood and evil.
 
 
 386
 
 If we dreamt the same thing every night, it would affect us as much as
 the objects we see every day. And if an artisan were sure to dream every
 night for twelve hours' duration that he was a king, I believe he would
 be almost as happy as a king, who should dream every night for twelve
 hours on end that he was an artisan.
 
 If we were to dream every night that we were pursued by enemies, and
 harassed by these painful phantoms, or that we passed every day in
 different occupations, as in making a voyage, we should suffer almost as
 much as if it were real, and should fear to sleep, as we fear to wake
 when we dread in fact to enter on such mishaps. And, indeed, it would
 cause pretty nearly the same discomforts as the reality.
 
 But since dreams are all different, and each single one is diversified,
 what is seen in them affects us much less than what we see when awake,
 because of its continuity, which is not, however, so continuous and
 level as not to change too; but it changes less abruptly, except rarely,
 as when we travel, and then we say, "It seems to me I am dreaming." For
 life is a dream a little less inconstant.
 
 
 387
 
 [It may be that there are true demonstrations; but this is not certain.
 Thus, this proves nothing else but that it is not certain that all is
 uncertain, to the glory of scepticism.]
 
 
 388
 
 _Good sense._--They are compelled to say, "You are not acting in good
 faith; we are not asleep," etc. How I love to see this proud reason
 humiliated and suppliant! For this is not the language of a man whose
 right is disputed, and who defends it with the power of armed hands. He
 is not foolish enough to declare that men are not acting in good faith,
 but he punishes this bad faith with force.
 
 
 389
 
 Ecclesiastes[152] shows that man without God is in total ignorance and
 inevitable misery. For it is wretched to have the wish, but not the
 power. Now he would be happy and assured of some truth, and yet he can
 neither know, nor desire not to know. He cannot even doubt.
 
 
 390
 
 My God! How foolish this talk is! "Would God have made the world to damn
 it? Would He ask so much from persons so weak?" etc. Scepticism is the
 cure for this evil, and will take down this vanity.
 
 
 391
 
 _Conversation._--Great words: Religion, I deny it.
 
 _Conversation._--Scepticism helps religion.
 
 
 392
 
 _Against Scepticism._--[... It is, then, a strange fact that we cannot
 define these things without obscuring them, while we speak of them with
 all assurance.] We assume that all conceive of them in the same way; but
 we assume it quite gratuitously, for we have no proof of it. I see, in
 truth, that the same words are applied on the same occasions, and that
 every time two men see a body change its place, they both express their
 view of this same fact by the same word, both saying that it has moved;
 and from this conformity of application we derive a strong conviction of
 a conformity of ideas. But this is not absolutely or finally convincing,
 though there is enough to support a bet on the affirmative, since we
 know that we often draw the same conclusions from different premisses.
 
 This is enough, at least, to obscure the matter; not that it completely
 extinguishes the natural light which assures us of these things. The
 academicians[153] would have won. But this dulls it, and troubles the
 dogmatists to the glory of the sceptical crowd, which consists in this
 doubtful ambiguity, and in a certain doubtful dimness from which our
 doubts cannot take away all the clearness, nor our own natural lights
 chase away all the darkness.
 
 
 393
 
 It is a singular thing to consider that there are people in the world
 who, having renounced all the laws of God and nature, have made laws for
 themselves which they strictly obey, as, for instance, the soldiers of
 Mahomet, robbers, heretics, etc. It is the same with logicians. It seems
 that their licence must be without any limits or barriers, since they
 have broken through so many that are so just and sacred.
 
 
 394
 
 All the principles of sceptics, stoics, atheists, etc., are true. But
 their conclusions are false, because the opposite principles are also
 true.
 
 
 395
 
 _Instinct, reason._--We have an incapacity of proof, insurmountable by
 all dogmatism. We have an idea of truth, invincible to all scepticism.
 
 
 396
 
 Two things instruct man about his whole nature; instinct and experience.
 
 
 397
 
 The greatness of man is great in that he knows himself to be miserable.
 A tree does not know itself to be miserable. It is then being miserable
 to know oneself to be miserable; but it is also being great to know that
 one is miserable.
 
 
 398
 
 All these same miseries prove man's greatness. They are the miseries of
 a great lord, of a deposed king.
 
 
 399
 
 We are not miserable without feeling it. A ruined house is not
 miserable. Man only is miserable. _Ego vir videns._[154]
 
 
 400
 
 _The greatness of man._--We have so great an idea of the soul of man
 that we cannot endure being despised, or not being esteemed by any soul;
 and all the happiness of men consists in this esteem.
 
 
 401
 
 _Glory._--The brutes do not admire each other. A horse does not admire
 his companion. Not that there is no rivalry between them in a race, but
 that is of no consequence; for, when in the stable, the heaviest and
 most ill-formed does not give up his oats to another, as men would have
 others do to them. Their virtue is satisfied with itself.
 
 
 402
 
 The greatness of man even in his lust, to have known how to extract from
 it a wonderful code, and to have drawn from it a picture of benevolence.
 
 
 403
 
 _Greatness._--The reasons of effects indicate the greatness of man, in
 having extracted so fair an order from lust.
 
 
 404
 
 The greatest baseness of man is the pursuit of glory. But it is also the
 greatest mark of his excellence; for whatever possessions he may have on
 earth, whatever health and essential comfort, he is not satisfied if he
 has not the esteem of men. He values human reason so highly that,
 whatever advantages he may have on earth, he is not content if he is not
 also ranked highly in the judgment of man. This is the finest position
 in the world. Nothing can turn him from that desire, which is the most
 indelible quality of man's heart.
 
 And those who most despise men, and put them on a level with the brutes,
 yet wish to be admired and believed by men, and contradict themselves by
 their own feelings; their nature, which is stronger than all, convincing
 them of the greatness of man more forcibly than reason convinces them of
 their baseness.
 
 
 405
 
 _Contradiction._--Pride counterbalancing all miseries. Man either hides
 his miseries, or, if he disclose them, glories in knowing them.
 
 
 406
 
 Pride counterbalances and takes away all miseries. Here is a strange
 monster, and a very plain aberration. He is fallen from his place, and
 is anxiously seeking it. This is what all men do. Let us see who will
 have found it.
 
 
 407
 
 When malice has reason on its side, it becomes proud, and parades reason
 in all its splendour. When austerity or stern choice has not arrived at
 the true good, and must needs return to follow nature, it becomes proud
 by reason of this return.
 
 
 408
 
 Evil is easy, and has infinite forms; good is almost unique.[155] But a
 certain kind of evil is as difficult to find as what we call good; and
 often on this account such particular evil gets passed off as good. An
 extraordinary greatness of soul is needed in order to attain to it as
 well as to good.
 
 
 409
 
 _The greatness of man._--The greatness of man is so evident, that it is
 even proved by his wretchedness. For what in animals is nature we call
 in man wretchedness; by which we recognise that, his nature being now
 like that of animals, he has fallen from a better nature which once was
 his.
 
 For who is unhappy at not being a king, except a deposed king? Was
 Paulus AEmilius[156] unhappy at being no longer consul? On the contrary,
 everybody thought him happy in having been consul, because the office
 could only be held for a time. But men thought Perseus so unhappy in
 being no longer king, because the condition of kingship implied his
 being always king, that they thought it strange that he endured life.
 Who is unhappy at having only one mouth? And who is not unhappy at
 having only one eye? Probably no man ever ventured to mourn at not
 having three eyes. But any one is inconsolable at having none.
 
 
 410
 
 _Perseus, King of Macedon._--Paulus AEmilius reproached Perseus for not
 killing himself.
 
 
 411
 
 Notwithstanding the sight of all our miseries, which press upon us and
 take us by the throat, we have an instinct which we cannot repress, and
 which lifts us up.
 
 
 412
 
 There is internal war in man between reason and the passions.
 
 If he had only reason without passions ...
 
 If he had only passions without reason ...
 
 But having both, he cannot be without strife, being unable to be at
 peace with the one without being at war with the other. Thus he is
 always divided against, and opposed to himself.
 
 
 413
 
 This internal war of reason against the passions has made a division of
 those who would have peace into two sects. The first would renounce
 their passions, and become gods; the others would renounce reason, and
 become brute beasts. (Des Barreaux.)[157] But neither can do so, and
 reason still remains, to condemn the vileness and injustice of the
 passions, and to trouble the repose of those who abandon themselves to
 them; and the passions keep always alive in those who would renounce
 them.
 
 
 414
 
 Men are so necessarily mad, that not to be mad would amount to another
 form of madness.
 
 
 415
 
 The nature of man may be viewed in two ways: the one according to its
 end, and then he is great and incomparable; the other according to the
 multitude, just as we judge of the nature of the horse and the dog,
 popularly, by seeing its fleetness, _et animum arcendi_; and then man is
 abject and vile. These are the two ways which make us judge of him
 differently, and which occasion such disputes among philosophers.
 
 For one denies the assumption of the other. One says, "He is not born
 for this end, for all his actions are repugnant to it." The other says,
 "He forsakes his end, when he does these base actions."
 
 
 416
 
 _For Port-Royal.[158] Greatness and wretchedness._--Wretchedness being
 deduced from greatness, and greatness from wretchedness, some have
 inferred man's wretchedness all the more because they have taken his
 greatness as a proof of it, and others have inferred his greatness with
 all the more force, because they have inferred it from his very
 wretchedness. All that the one party has been able to say in proof of
 his greatness has only served as an argument of his wretchedness to the
 others, because the greater our fall, the more wretched we are, and
 _vice versa._ The one party is brought back to the other in an endless
 circle, it being certain that in proportion as men possess light they
 discover both the greatness and the wretchedness of man. In a word, man
 knows that he is wretched. He is therefore wretched, because he is so;
 but he is really great because he knows it.
 
 
 417
 
 This twofold nature of man is so evident that some have thought that we
 had two souls. A single subject seemed to them incapable of such sudden
 variations from unmeasured presumption to a dreadful dejection of
 heart.
 
 
 418
 
 It is dangerous to make man see too clearly his equality with the brutes
 without showing him his greatness. It is also dangerous to make him see
 his greatness too clearly, apart from his vileness. It is still more
 dangerous to leave him in ignorance of both. But it is very advantageous
 to show him both. Man must not think that he is on a level either with
 the brutes or with the angels, nor must he be ignorant of both sides of
 his nature; but he must know both.
 
 
 419
 
 I will not allow man to depend upon himself, or upon another, to the end
 that being without a resting-place and without repose ...
 
 
 420
 
 If he exalt himself, I humble him; if he humble himself, I exalt him;
 and I always contradict him, till he understands that he is an
 incomprehensible monster.
 
 
 421
 
 I blame equally those who choose to praise man, those who choose to
 blame him, and those who choose to amuse themselves; and I can only
 approve of those who seek with lamentation.
 
 
 422
 
 It is good to be tired and wearied by the vain search after the true
 good, that we may stretch out our arms to the Redeemer.
 
 
 423
 
 _Contraries. After having shown the vileness and the greatness of
 man._--Let man now know his value. Let him love himself, for there is in
 him a nature capable of good; but let him not for this reason love the
 vileness which is in him. Let him despise himself, for this capacity is
 barren; but let him not therefore despise this natural capacity. Let him
 hate himself, let him love himself; he has within him the capacity of
 knowing the truth and of being happy, but he possesses no truth, either
 constant or satisfactory.
 
 I would then lead man to the desire of finding truth; to be free from
 passions, and ready to follow it where he may find it, knowing how much
 his knowledge is obscured by the passions. I would indeed that he should
 hate in himself the lust which determined his will by itself, so that it
 may not blind him in making his choice, and may not hinder him when he
 has chosen.
 
 
 424
 
 All these contradictions, which seem most to keep me from the knowledge
 of religion, have led me most quickly to the true one.
 
 
 
 
 SECTION VII
 
 MORALITY AND DOCTRINE
 
 
 425
 
 _Second part.--That man without faith cannot know the true good, nor
 justice._
 
 All men seek happiness. This is without exception. Whatever different
 means they employ, they all tend to this end.[159] The cause of some
 going to war, and of others avoiding it, is the same desire in both,
 attended with different views. The will never takes the least step but
 to this object. This is the motive of every action of every man, even of
 those who hang themselves.
 
 And yet after such a great number of years, no one without faith has
 reached the point to which all continually look. All complain, princes
 and subjects, noblemen and commoners, old and young, strong and weak,
 learned and ignorant, healthy and sick, of all countries, all times, all
 ages, and all conditions.
 
 A trial so long, so continuous, and so uniform, should certainly
 convince us of our inability to reach the good by our own efforts. But
 example teaches us little. No resemblance is ever so perfect that there
 is not some slight difference; and hence we expect that our hope will
 not be deceived on this occasion as before. And thus, while the present
 never satisfies us, experience dupes us, and from misfortune to
 misfortune leads us to death, their eternal crown.
 
 What is it then that this desire and this inability proclaim to us, but
 that there was once in man a true happiness of which there now remain to
 him only the mark and empty trace, which he in vain tries to fill from
 all his surroundings, seeking from things absent the help he does not
 obtain in things present? But these are all inadequate, because the
 infinite abyss can only be filled by an infinite and immutable object,
 that is to say, only by God Himself.
 
 He only is our true good, and since we have forsaken Him, it is a
 strange thing that there is nothing in nature which has not been
 serviceable in taking His place; the stars, the heavens, earth, the
 elements, plants, cabbages, leeks, animals, insects, calves, serpents,
 fever, pestilence, war, famine, vices, adultery, incest. And since man
 has lost the true good, everything can appear equally good to him, even
 his own destruction, though so opposed to God, to reason, and to the
 whole course of nature.
 
 Some seek good in authority, others in scientific research, others in
 pleasure. Others, who are in fact nearer the truth, have considered it
 necessary that the universal good, which all men desire, should not
 consist in any of the particular things which can only be possessed by
 one man, and which, when shared, afflict their possessor more by the
 want of the part he has not, than they please him by the possession of
 what he has. They have learned that the true good should be such as all
 can possess at once, without diminution and without envy, and which no
 one can lose against his will. And their reason is that this desire
 being natural to man, since it is necessarily in all, and that it is
 impossible not to have it, they infer from it ...
 
 
 426
 
 True nature being lost, everything becomes its own nature; as the true
 good being lost, everything becomes its own true good.
 
 
 427
 
 Man does not know in what rank to place himself. He has plainly gone
 astray, and fallen from his true place without being able to find it
 again. He seeks it anxiously and unsuccessfully everywhere in
 impenetrable darkness.
 
 
 428
 
 If it is a sign of weakness to prove God by nature, do not despise
 Scripture; if it is a sign of strength to have known these
 contradictions, esteem Scripture.
 
 
 429
 
 The vileness of man in submitting himself to the brutes, and in even
 worshipping them.
 
 
 430
 
 _For Port Royal. The beginning, after having explained the
 incomprehensibility._--The greatness and the wretchedness of man are so
 evident that the true religion must necessarily teach us both that there
 is in man some great source of greatness, and a great source of
 wretchedness. It must then give us a reason for these astonishing
 contradictions.
 
 In order to make man happy, it must prove to him that there is a God;
 that we ought to love Him; that our true happiness is to be in Him, and
 our sole evil to be separated from Him; it must recognise that we are
 full of darkness which hinders us from knowing and loving Him; and that
 thus, as our duties compel us to love God, and our lusts turn us away
 from Him, we are full of unrighteousness. It must give us an explanation
 of our opposition to God and to our own good. It must teach us the
 remedies for these infirmities, and the means of obtaining these
 remedies. Let us therefore examine all the religions of the world, and
 see if there be any other than the Christian which is sufficient for
 this purpose.
 
 Shall it be that of the philosophers, who put forward as the chief good,
 the good which is in ourselves? Is this the true good? Have they found
 the remedy for our ills? Is man's pride cured by placing him on an
 equality with God? Have those who have made us equal to the brutes, or
 the Mahommedans who have offered us earthly pleasures as the chief good
 even in eternity, produced the remedy for our lusts? What religion,
 then, will teach us to cure pride and lust? What religion will in fact
 teach us our good, our duties, the weakness which turns us from them,
 the cause of this weakness, the remedies which can cure it, and the
 means of obtaining these remedies?
 
 All other religions have not been able to do so. Let us see what the
 wisdom of God will do.
 
 "Expect neither truth," she says, "nor consolation from men. I am she
 who formed you, and who alone can teach you what you are. But you are
 now no longer in the state in which I formed you. I created man holy,
 innocent, perfect. I filled him with light and intelligence. I
 communicated to him my glory and my wonders. The eye of man saw then the
 majesty of God. He was not then in the darkness which blinds him, nor
 subject to mortality and the woes which afflict him. But he has not been
 able to sustain so great glory without falling into pride. He wanted to
 make himself his own centre, and independent of my help. He withdrew
 himself from my rule; and, on his making himself equal to me by the
 desire of finding his happiness in himself, I abandoned him to himself.
 And setting in revolt the creatures that were subject to him, I made
 them his enemies; so that man is now become like the brutes, and so
 estranged from me that there scarce remains to him a dim vision of his
 Author. So far has all his knowledge been extinguished or disturbed! The
 senses, independent of reason, and often the masters of reason, have led
 him into pursuit of pleasure. All creatures either torment or tempt him,
 and domineer over him, either subduing him by their strength, or
 fascinating him by their charms, a tyranny more awful and more
 imperious.
 
 "Such is the state in which men now are. There remains to them some
 feeble instinct of the happiness of their former state; and they are
 plunged in the evils of their blindness and their lust, which have
 become their second nature.
 
 "From this principle which I disclose to you, you can recognise the
 cause of those contradictions which have astonished all men, and have
 divided them into parties holding so different views. Observe, now, all
 the feelings of greatness and glory which the experience of so many woes
 cannot stifle, and see if the cause of them must not be in another
 nature."
 
 _For Port-Royal to-morrow (Prosopopoea)._--"It is in vain, O men, that
 you seek within yourselves the remedy for your ills. All your light can
 only reach the knowledge that not in yourselves will you find truth or
 good. The philosophers have promised you that, and have been unable to
 do it. They neither know what is your true good, nor what is your true
 state. How could they have given remedies for your ills, when they did
 not even know them? Your chief maladies are pride, which takes you away
 from God, and lust, which binds you to earth; and they have done nothing
 else but cherish one or other of these diseases. If they gave you God as
 an end, it was only to administer to your pride; they made you think
 that you are by nature like Him, and conformed to Him. And those who saw
 the absurdity of this claim put you on another precipice, by making you
 understand that your nature was like that of the brutes, and led you to
 seek your good in the lusts which are shared by the animals. This is not
 the way to cure you of your unrighteousness, which these wise men never
 knew. I alone can make you understand who you are...."
 
 Adam, Jesus Christ.
 
 If you are united to God, it is by grace, not by nature. If you are
 humbled, it is by penitence, not by nature.
 
 Thus this double capacity ...
 
 You are not in the state of your creation.
 
 As these two states are open, it is impossible for you not to recognise
 them. Follow your own feelings, observe yourselves, and see if you do
 not find the lively characteristics of these two natures. Could so many
 contradictions be found in a simple subject?
 
 --Incomprehensible.--Not all that is incomprehensible ceases to exist.
 Infinite number. An infinite space equal to a finite.
 
 --Incredible that God should unite Himself to us.--This consideration is
 drawn only from the sight of our vileness. But if you are quite sincere
 over it, follow it as far as I have done, and recognise that we are
 indeed so vile that we are incapable in ourselves of knowing if His
 mercy cannot make us capable of Him. For I would know how this animal,
 who knows himself to be so weak, has the right to measure the mercy of
 God, and set limits to it, suggested by his own fancy. He has so little
 knowledge of what God is, that he does not know what he himself is, and,
 completely disturbed at the sight of his own state, dares to say that
 God cannot make him capable of communion with Him.
 
 But I would ask him if God demands anything else from him than the
 knowledge and love of Him, and why, since his nature is capable of love
 and knowledge, he believes that God cannot make Himself known and loved
 by him. Doubtless he knows at least that he exists, and that he loves
 something. Therefore, if he sees anything in the darkness wherein he is,
 and if he finds some object of his love among the things on earth, why,
 if God impart to him some ray of His essence, will he not be capable of
 knowing and of loving Him in the manner in which it shall please Him to
 communicate Himself to us? There must then be certainly an intolerable
 presumption in arguments of this sort, although they seem founded on an
 apparent humility, which is neither sincere nor reasonable, if it does
 not make us admit that, not knowing of ourselves what we are, we can
 only learn it from God.
 
 "I do not mean that you should submit your belief to me without reason,
 and I do not aspire to overcome you by tyranny. In fact, I do not claim
 to give you a reason for everything. And to reconcile these
 contradictions, I intend to make you see clearly, by convincing proofs,
 those divine signs in me, which may convince you of what I am, and may
 gain authority for me by wonders and proofs which you cannot reject; so
 that you may then believe without ... the things which I teach you,
 since you will find no other ground for rejecting them, except that you
 cannot know of yourselves if they are true or not.
 
 "God has willed to redeem men, and to open salvation to those who seek
 it. But men render themselves so unworthy of it, that it is right that
 God should refuse to some, because of their obduracy, what He grants to
 others from a compassion which is not due to them. If He had willed to
 overcome the obstinacy of the most hardened, He could have done so by
 revealing Himself so manifestly to them that they could not have doubted
 of the truth of His essence; as it will appear at the last day, with
 such thunders and such a convulsion of nature, that the dead will rise
 again, and the blindest will see Him.
 
 "It is not in this manner that He has willed to appear in His advent of
 mercy, because, as so many make themselves unworthy of His mercy, He has
 willed to leave them in the loss of the good which they do not want. It
 was not then right that He should appear in a manner manifestly divine,
 and completely capable of convincing all men; but it was also not right
 that He should come in so hidden a manner that He could not be known by
 those who should sincerely seek Him. He has willed to make Himself quite
 recognisable by those; and thus, willing to appear openly to those who
 seek Him with all their heart, and to be hidden from those who flee from
 Him with all their heart, He so regulates the knowledge of Himself that
 He has given signs of Himself, visible to those who seek Him, and not to
 those who seek Him not. There is enough light for those who only desire
 to see, and enough obscurity for those who have a contrary disposition."
 
 
 431
 
 No other religion has recognised that man is the most excellent
 creature. Some, which have quite recognised the reality of his
 excellence, have considered as mean and ungrateful the low opinions
 which men naturally have of themselves; and others, which have
 thoroughly recognised how real is this vileness, have treated with proud
 ridicule those feelings of greatness, which are equally natural to man.
 
 "Lift your eyes to God," say the first; "see Him whom you resemble, and
 who has created you to worship Him. You can make yourselves like unto
 Him; wisdom will make you equal to Him, if you will follow it." "Raise
 your heads, free men," says Epictetus. And others say, "Bend your eyes
 to the earth, wretched worm that you are, and consider the brutes whose
 companion you are."
 
 What, then, will man become? Will he be equal to God or the brutes? What
 a frightful difference! What, then, shall we be? Who does not see from
 all this that man has gone astray, that he has fallen from his place,
 that he anxiously seeks it, that he cannot find it again? And who shall
 then direct him to it? The greatest men have failed.
 
 
 432
 
 Scepticism is true; for, after all, men before Jesus Christ did not know
 where they were, nor whether they were great or small. And those who
 have said the one or the other, knew nothing about it, and guessed
 without reason and by chance. They also erred always in excluding the
 one or the other.
 
 _Quod ergo ignorantes, quaeritis, religio annuntiat vobis._[160]
 
 
 433
 
 _After having understood the whole nature of man._--That a religion may
 be true, it must have knowledge of our nature. It ought to know its
 greatness and littleness, and the reason of both. What religion but the
 Christian has known this?
 
 
 434
 
 The chief arguments of the sceptics--I pass over the lesser ones--are
 that we have no certainty of the truth of these principles apart from
 faith and revelation, except in so far as we naturally perceive them in
 ourselves. Now this natural intuition is not a convincing proof of their
 truth; since, having no certainty, apart from faith, whether man was
 created by a good God, or by a wicked demon,[161] or by chance, it is
 doubtful whether these principles given to us are true, or false, or
 uncertain, according to our origin. Again, no person is certain, apart
 from faith, whether he is awake or sleeps, seeing that during sleep we
 believe that we are awake as firmly as we do when we _are_ awake; we
 believe that we see space, figure, and motion; we are aware of the
 passage of time, we measure it; and in fact we act as if we were awake.
 So that half of our life being passed in sleep, we have on our own
 admission no idea of truth, whatever we may imagine. As all our
 intuitions are then illusions, who knows whether the other half of our
 life, in which we think we are awake, is not another sleep a little
 different from the former, from which we awake when we suppose ourselves
 asleep?
 
 [And who doubts that, if we dreamt in company, and the dreams chanced to
 agree, which is common enough, and if we were always alone when awake,
 we should believe that matters were reversed? In short, as we often
 dream that we dream, heaping dream upon dream, may it not be that this
 half of our life, wherein we think ourselves awake, is itself only a
 dream on which the others are grafted, from which we wake at death,
 during which we have as few principles of truth and good as during
 natural sleep, these different thoughts which disturb us being perhaps
 only illusions like the flight of time and the vain fancies of our
 dreams?]
 
 These are the chief arguments on one side and the other.
 
 I omit minor ones, such as the sceptical talk against the impressions of
 custom, education, manners, country, and the like. Though these
 influence the majority of common folk, who dogmatise only on shallow
 foundations, they are upset by the least breath of the sceptics. We have
 only to see their books if we are not sufficiently convinced of this,
 and we shall very quickly become so, perhaps too much.
 
 I notice the only strong point of the dogmatists, namely, that, speaking
 in good faith and sincerely, we cannot doubt natural principles. Against
 this the sceptics set up in one word the uncertainty of our origin,
 which includes that of our nature. The dogmatists have been trying to
 answer this objection ever since the world began.
 
 So there is open war among men, in which each must take a part, and side
 either with dogmatism or scepticism. For he who thinks to remain neutral
 is above all a sceptic. This neutrality is the essence of the sect; he
 who is not against them is essentially for them. [In this appears their
 advantage.] They are not for themselves; they are neutral, indifferent,
 in suspense as to all things, even themselves being no exception.
 
 What then shall man do in this state? Shall he doubt everything? Shall
 he doubt whether he is awake, whether he is being pinched, or whether he
 is being burned? Shall he doubt whether he doubts? Shall he doubt
 whether he exists? We cannot go so far as that; and I lay it down as a
 fact that there never has been a real complete sceptic. Nature sustains
 our feeble reason, and prevents it raving to this extent.
 
 Shall he then say, on the contrary, that he certainly possesses
 truth--he who, when pressed ever so little, can show no title to it, and
 is forced to let go his hold?
 
 What a chimera then is man! What a novelty! What a monster, what a
 chaos, what a contradiction, what a prodigy! Judge of all things,
 imbecile worm of the earth; depositary of truth, a sink of uncertainty
 and error; the pride and refuse of the universe!
 
 Who will unravel this tangle? Nature confutes the sceptics, and reason
 confutes the dogmatists. What then will you become, O men! who try to
 find out by your natural reason what is your true condition? You cannot
 avoid one of these sects, nor adhere to one of them.
 
 Know then, proud man, what a paradox you are to yourself. Humble
 yourself, weak reason; be silent, foolish nature; learn that man
 infinitely transcends man, and learn from your Master your true
 condition, of which you are ignorant. Hear God.
 
 For in fact, if man had never been corrupt, he would enjoy in his
 innocence both truth and happiness with assurance; and if man had always
 been corrupt, he would have no idea of truth or bliss. But, wretched as
 we are, and more so than if there were no greatness in our condition, we
 have an idea of happiness, and cannot reach it. We perceive an image of
 truth, and possess only a lie. Incapable of absolute ignorance and of
 certain knowledge, we have thus been manifestly in a degree of
 perfection from which we have unhappily fallen.
 
 It is, however, an astonishing thing that the mystery furthest removed
 from our knowledge, namely, that of the transmission of sin, should be a
 fact without which we can have no knowledge of ourselves. For it is
 beyond doubt that there is nothing which more shocks our reason than to
 say that the sin of the first man has rendered guilty those, who, being
 so removed from this source, seem incapable of participation in it. This
 transmission does not only seem to us impossible, it seems also very
 unjust. For what is more contrary to the rules of our miserable justice
 than to damn eternally an infant incapable of will, for a sin wherein he
 seems to have so little a share, that it was committed six thousand
 years before he was in existence? Certainly nothing offends us more
 rudely than this doctrine; and yet, without this mystery, the most
 incomprehensible of all, we are incomprehensible to ourselves. The knot
 of our condition takes its twists and turns in this abyss, so that man
 is more inconceivable without this mystery than this mystery is
 inconceivable to man.
 
 [Whence it seems that God, willing to render the difficulty of our
 existence unintelligible to ourselves, has concealed the knot so high,
 or, better speaking, so low, that we are quite incapable of reaching it;
 so that it is not by the proud exertions of our reason, but by the
 simple submissions of reason, that we can truly know ourselves.
 
 These foundations, solidly established on the inviolable authority of
 religion, make us know that there are two truths of faith equally
 certain: the one, that man, in the state of creation, or in that of
 grace, is raised above all nature, made like unto God and sharing in His
 divinity; the other, that in the state of corruption and sin, he is
 fallen from this state and made like unto the beasts.
 
 These two propositions are equally sound and certain. Scripture
 manifestly declares this to us, when it says in some places: _Deliciae
 meae esse cum filiis hominum.[162] Effundam spiritum meum super omnem
 carnem.[163] Dii estis[164]_, etc.; and in other places, _Omnis caro
 faenum.[165] Homo assimilatus est jumentis insipientibus, et similis
 factus est illis.[166] Dixi in corde meo de filiis hominum._ Eccles.
 iii.
 
 Whence it clearly seems that man by grace is made like unto God, and a
 partaker in His divinity, and that without grace he is like unto the
 brute beasts.]
 
 
 435
 
 Without this divine knowledge what could men do but either become elated
 by the inner feeling of their past greatness which still remains to
 them, or become despondent at the sight of their present weakness? For,
 not seeing the whole truth, they could not attain to perfect virtue.
 Some considering nature as incorrupt, others as incurable, they could
 not escape either pride or sloth, the two sources of all vice; since
 they cannot but either abandon themselves to it through cowardice, or
 escape it by pride. For if they knew the excellence of man, they were
 ignorant of his corruption; so that they easily avoided sloth, but fell
 into pride. And if they recognised the infirmity of nature, they were
 ignorant of its dignity; so that they could easily avoid vanity, but it
 was to fall into despair. Thence arise the different schools of the
 Stoics and Epicureans, the Dogmatists, Academicians, etc.
 
 The Christian religion alone has been able to cure these two vices, not
 by expelling the one through means of the other according to the wisdom
 of the world, but by expelling both according to the simplicity of the
 Gospel. For it teaches the righteous that it raises them even to a
 participation in divinity itself; that in this lofty state they still
 carry the source of all corruption, which renders them during all their
 life subject to error, misery, death, and sin; and it proclaims to the
 most ungodly that they are capable of the grace of their Redeemer. So
 making those tremble whom it justifies, and consoling those whom it
 condemns, religion so justly tempers fear with hope through that double
 capacity of grace and of sin, common to all, that it humbles infinitely
 more than reason alone can do, but without despair; and it exalts
 infinitely more than natural pride, but without inflating; thus making
 it evident that alone being exempt from error and vice, it alone fulfils
 the duty of instructing and correcting men.
 
 Who then can refuse to believe and adore this heavenly light? For is it
 not clearer than day that we perceive within ourselves ineffaceable
 marks of excellence? And is it not equally true that we experience every
 hour the results of our deplorable condition? What does this chaos and
 monstrous confusion proclaim to us but the truth of these two states,
 with a voice so powerful that it is impossible to resist it?
 
 
 436
 
 _Weakness._--Every pursuit of men is to get wealth; and they cannot have
 a title to show that they possess it justly, for they have only that of
 human caprice; nor have they strength to hold it securely. It is the
 same with knowledge, for disease takes it away. We are incapable both of
 truth and goodness.
 
 
 437
 
 We desire truth, and find within ourselves only uncertainty.
 
 We seek happiness, and find only misery and death.
 
 We cannot but desire truth and happiness, and are incapable of certainty
 or happiness. This desire is left to us, partly to punish us, partly to
 make us perceive wherefrom we are fallen.
 
 
 438
 
 If man is not made for God, why is he only happy in God? If man is made
 for God, why is he so opposed to God?
 
 
 439
 
 _Nature corrupted._--Man does not act by reason, which constitutes his
 being.
 
 
 440
 
 The corruption of reason is shown by the existence of so many different
 and extravagant customs. It was necessary that truth should come, in
 order that man should no longer dwell within himself.
 
 
 441
 
 For myself, I confess that so soon as the Christian religion reveals the
 principle that human nature is corrupt and fallen from God, that opens
 my eyes to see everywhere the mark of this truth: for nature is such
 that she testifies everywhere, both within man and without him, to a
 lost God and a corrupt nature.
 
 
 442
 
 Man's true nature, his true good, true virtue, and true religion, are
 things of which the knowledge is inseparable.
 
 
 443
 
 _Greatness, wretchedness._--The more light we have, the more greatness
 and the more baseness we discover in man. Ordinary men--those who are
 more educated: philosophers, they astonish ordinary men--Christians,
 they astonish philosophers.
 
 Who will then be surprised to see that religion only makes us know
 profoundly what we already know in proportion to our light?
 
 
 444
 
 This religion taught to her children what men have only been able to
 discover by their greatest knowledge.
 
 
 445
 
 Original sin is foolishness to men, but it is admitted to be such. You
 must not then reproach me for the want of reason in this doctrine, since
 I admit it to be without reason. But this foolishness is wiser than all
 the wisdom of men, _sapientius est hominibus_.[167] For without this,
 what can we say that man is? His whole state depends on this
 imperceptible point. And how should it be perceived by his reason, since
 it is a thing against reason, and since reason, far from finding it out
 by her own ways, is averse to it when it is presented to her?
 
 
 446
 
 _Of original sin.[168] Ample tradition of original sin according to the
 Jews._
 
 On the saying in Genesis viii, 21: "The imagination of man's heart is
 evil from his youth."
 
 _R. Moses Haddarschan_: This evil leaven is placed in man from the time
 that he is formed.
 
 _Massechet Succa_: This evil leaven has seven names in Scripture. It is
 called _evil, the foreskin, uncleanness, an enemy, a scandal, a heart of
 stone, the north wind_; all this signifies the malignity which is
 concealed and impressed in the heart of man.
 
 _Midrasch Tillim_ says the same thing, and that God will deliver the
 good nature of man from the evil.
 
 This malignity is renewed every day against man, as it is written, Psalm
 xxxvii, 32: "The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay
 him"; but God will not abandon him. This malignity tries the heart of
 man in this life, and will accuse him in the other. All this is found in
 the Talmud.
 
 _Midrasch Tillim_ on Psalm iv, 4: "Stand in awe and sin not." Stand in
 awe and be afraid of your lust, and it will not lead you into sin. And
 on Psalm xxxvi, 1: "The wicked has said within his own heart, Let not
 the fear of God be before me." That is to say that the malignity natural
 to man has said that to the wicked.
 
 _Midrasch el Kohelet_: "Better is a poor and wise child than an old and
 foolish king who cannot foresee the future."[169] The child is virtue,
 and the king is the malignity of man. It is called king because all the
 members obey it, and old because it is in the human heart from infancy
 to old age, and foolish because it leads man in the way of
 [_perdition_], which he does not foresee. The same thing is in _Midrasch
 Tillim_.
 
 _Bereschist Rabba_ on Psalm xxxv, 10: "Lord, all my bones shall bless
 Thee, which deliverest the poor from the tyrant." And is there a greater
 tyrant than the evil leaven? And on Proverbs xxv, 21: "If thine enemy be
 hungry, give him bread to eat." That is to say, if the evil leaven
 hunger, give him the bread of wisdom of which it is spoken in Proverbs
 ix., and if he be thirsty, give him the water of which it is spoken in
 Isaiah lv.
 
 _Midrasch Tillim_ says the same thing, and that Scripture in that
 passage, speaking of the enemy, means the evil leaven; and that, in
 [_giving_] him that bread and that water, we heap coals of fire on his
 head.
 
 _Midrasch el Kohelet_ on Ecclesiastes ix, 14: "A great king besieged a
 little city." This great king is the evil leaven; the great bulwarks
 built against it are temptations; and there has been found a poor wise
 man who has delivered it--that is to say, virtue.
 
 And on Psalm xli, 1: "Blessed is he that considereth the poor."
 
 And on Psalm lxxviii, 39: "The spirit passeth away, and cometh not
 again"; whence some have erroneously argued against the immortality of
 the soul. But the sense is that this spirit is the evil leaven, which
 accompanies man till death, and will not return at the resurrection.
 
 And on Psalm ciii the same thing.
 
 And on Psalm xvi.
 
 Principles of Rabbinism: two Messiahs.
 
 
 447
 
 Will it be said that, as men have declared that righteousness has
 departed the earth, they therefore knew of original sin?--_Nemo ante
 obitum beatus est_[170]--that is to say, they knew death to be the
 beginning of eternal and essential happiness?
 
 
 448
 
 [_Miton_] sees well that nature is corrupt, and that men are averse to
 virtue; but he does not know why they cannot fly higher.
 
 
 449
 
 _Order._--After _Corruption_ to say: "It is right that all those who are
 in that state should know it, both those who are content with it, and
 those who are not content with it; but it is not right that all should
 see Redemption."
 
 
 450
 
 If we do not know ourselves to be full of pride, ambition, lust,
 weakness, misery, and injustice, we are indeed blind. And if, knowing
 this, we do not desire deliverance, what can we say of a man...?
 
 What, then, can we have but esteem for a religion which knows so well
 the defects of man, and desire for the truth of a religion which
 promises remedies so desirable?
 
 
 451
 
 All men naturally hate one another. They employ lust as far as possible
 in the service of the public weal. But this is only a [_pretence_] and a
 false image of love; for at bottom it is only hate.
 
 
 452
 
 To pity the unfortunate is not contrary to lust. On the contrary, we can
 quite well give such evidence of friendship, and acquire the reputation
 of kindly feeling, without giving anything.
 
 
 453
 
 From lust men have found and extracted excellent rules of policy,
 morality, and justice; but in reality this vile root of man, this
 _figmentum malum_,[171] is only covered, it is not taken away.
 
 
 454
 
 _Injustice._--They have not found any other means of satisfying lust
 without doing injury to others.
 
 
 455
 
 Self is hateful. You, Miton, conceal it; you do not for that reason
 destroy it; you are, then, always hateful.
 
 --No; for in acting as we do to oblige everybody, we give no more
 occasion for hatred of us.--That is true, if we only hated in Self the
 vexation which comes to us from it. But if I hate it because it is
 unjust, and because it makes itself the centre of everything, I shall
 always hate it.
 
 In a word, the Self has two qualities: it is unjust in itself since it
 makes itself the centre of everything; it is inconvenient to others
 since it would enslave them; for each Self is the enemy, and would like
 to be the tyrant of all others. You take away its inconvenience, but not
 its injustice, and so you do not render it lovable to those who hate
 injustice; you render it lovable only to the unjust, who do not any
 longer find in it an enemy. And thus you remain unjust, and can please
 only the unjust.
 
 
 456
 
 It is a perverted judgment that makes every one place himself above the
 rest of the world, and prefer his own good, and the continuance of his
 own good fortune and life, to that of the rest of the world!
 
 
 457
 
 Each one is all in all to himself; for he being dead, all is dead to
 him. Hence it comes that each believes himself to be all in all to
 everybody. We must not judge of nature by ourselves, but by it.
 
 
 458
 
 "All that is in the world is the lust of the flesh, or the lust of the
 eyes, or the pride of life; _libido sentiendi, libido sciendi, libido
 dominandi._"[172] Wretched is the cursed land which these three rivers
 of fire enflame rather than water![173] Happy they who, on these rivers,
 are not overwhelmed nor carried away, but are immovably fixed, not
 standing but seated on a low and secure base, whence they do not rise
 before the light, but, having rested in peace, stretch out their hands
 to Him, who must lift them up, and make them stand upright and firm in
 the porches of the holy Jerusalem! There pride can no longer assail them
 nor cast them down; and yet they weep, not to see all those perishable
 things swept away by the torrents, but at the remembrance of their loved
 country, the heavenly Jerusalem, which they remember without ceasing
 during their prolonged exile.
 
 
 459
 
 The rivers of Babylon rush and fall and sweep away.
 
 O holy Sion, where all is firm and nothing falls!
 
 We must sit upon the waters, not under them or in them, but on them; and
 not standing but seated; being seated to be humble, and being above them
 to be secure. But we shall stand in the porches of Jerusalem.
 
 Let us see if this pleasure is stable or transitory; if it pass away, it
 is a river of Babylon.
 
 
 460
 
 _The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, pride, etc._--There are
 three orders of things: the flesh, the spirit, and the will. The carnal
 are the rich and kings; they have the body as their object. Inquirers
 and scientists; they have the mind as their object. The wise; they have
 righteousness as their object.
 
 God must reign over all, and all men must be brought back to Him. In
 things of the flesh lust reigns specially; in intellectual matters,
 inquiry specially; in wisdom, pride specially. Not that a man cannot
 boast of wealth or knowledge, but it is not the place for pride; for in
 granting to a man that he is learned, it is easy to convince him that he
 is wrong to be proud. The proper place for pride is in wisdom, for it
 cannot be granted to a man that he has made himself wise, and that he is
 wrong to be proud; for that is right. Now God alone gives wisdom, and
 that is why _Qui gloriatur, in Domino glorietur_.[174]
 
 
 461
 
 The three lusts have made three sects; and the philosophers have done no
 other thing than follow one of the three lusts.
 
 
 462
 
 _Search for the true good._--Ordinary men place the good in fortune and
 external goods, or at least in amusement. Philosophers have shown the
 vanity of all this, and have placed it where they could.
 
 
 463
 
 [_Against the philosophers who believe in God without Jesus Christ_]
 
 _Philosophers._--They believe that God alone is worthy to be loved and
 admired; and they have desired to be loved and admired of men, and do
 not know their own corruption. If they feel full of feelings of love and
 admiration, and find therein their chief delight, very well, let them
 think themselves good. But if they find themselves averse to Him, if
 they have no inclination but the desire to establish themselves in the
 esteem of men, and if their whole perfection consists only in making
 men--but without constraint--find their happiness in loving them, I
 declare that this perfection is horrible. What! they have known God, and
 have not desired solely that men should love Him, but that men should
 stop short at them! They have wanted to be the object of the voluntary
 delight of men.
 
 
 464
 
 _Philosophers._--We are full of things which take us out of ourselves.
 
 Our instinct makes us feel that we must seek our happiness outside
 ourselves. Our passions impel us outside, even when no objects present
 themselves to excite them. External objects tempt us of themselves, and
 call to us, even when we are not thinking of them. And thus philosophers
 have said in vain, "Retire within yourselves, you will find your good
 there." We do not believe them, and those who believe them are the most
 empty and the most foolish.
 
 
 465
 
 The Stoics say, "Retire within yourselves; it is there you will find
 your rest." And that is not true.
 
 Others say, "Go out of yourselves; seek happiness in amusement." And
 this is not true. Illness comes.
 
 Happiness is neither without us nor within us. It is in God, both
 without us and within us.
 
 
 466
 
 Had Epictetus seen the way perfectly, he would have said to men, "You
 follow a wrong road"; he shows that there is another, but he does not
 lead to it. It is the way of willing what God wills. Jesus Christ alone
 leads to it: _Via, veritas._[175]
 
 The vices of Zeno[176] himself.
 
 
 467
 
 _The reason of effects._--Epictetus.[177] Those who say, "You have a
 headache;" this is not the same thing. We are assured of health, and not
 of justice; and in fact his own was nonsense.
 
 And yet he believed it demonstrable, when he said, "It is either in our
 power or it is not." But he did not perceive that it is not in our power
 to regulate the heart, and he was wrong to infer this from the fact that
 there were some Christians.
 
 
 468
 
 No other religion has proposed to men to hate themselves. No other
 religion then can please those who hate themselves, and who seek a Being
 truly lovable. And these, if they had never heard of the religion of a
 God humiliated, would embrace it at once.
 
 
 469
 
 I feel that I might not have been; for the Ego consists in my thoughts.
 Therefore I, who think, would not have been, if my mother had been
 killed before I had life. I am not then a necessary being. In the same
 way I am not eternal or infinite; but I see plainly that there exists in
 nature a necessary Being, eternal and infinite.
 
 
 470
 
 "Had I seen a miracle," say men, "I should become converted." How can
 they be sure they would do a thing of the nature of which they are
 ignorant? They imagine that this conversion consists in a worship of God
 which is like commerce, and in a communion such as they picture to
 themselves. True religion consists in annihilating self before that
 Universal Being, whom we have so often provoked, and who can justly
 destroy us at any time; in recognising that we can do nothing without
 Him, and have deserved nothing from Him but His displeasure. It consists
 in knowing that there is an unconquerable opposition between us and God,
 and that without a mediator there can be no communion with Him.
 
 
 471
 
 It is unjust that men should attach themselves to me, even though they
 do it with pleasure and voluntarily. I should deceive those in whom I
 had created this desire; for I am not the end of any, and I have not the
 wherewithal to satisfy them. Am I not about to die? And thus the object
 of their attachment will die. Therefore, as I would be blamable in
 causing a falsehood to be believed, though I should employ gentle
 persuasion, though it should be believed with pleasure, and though it
 should give me pleasure; even so I am blamable in making myself loved,
 and if I attract persons to attach themselves to me. I ought to warn
 those who are ready to consent to a lie, that they ought not to believe
 it, whatever advantage comes to me from it; and likewise that they ought
 not to attach themselves to me; for they ought to spend their life and
 their care in pleasing God, or in seeking Him.
 
 
 472
 
 Self-will will never be satisfied, though it should have command of all
 it would; but we are satisfied from the moment we renounce it. Without
 it we cannot be discontented; with it we cannot be content.
 
 
 473
 
 Let us imagine a body full of thinking members.[178]
 
 
 474
 
 _Members, To commence with that._--To regulate the love which we owe to
 ourselves, we must imagine a body full of thinking members, for we are
 members of the whole, and must see how each member should love itself,
 etc....
 
 
 475
 
 If the feet and the hands had a will of their own, they could only be in
 their order in submitting this particular will to the primary will which
 governs the whole body. Apart from that, they are in disorder and
 mischief; but in willing only the good of the body, they accomplish
 their own good.
 
 
 476
 
 We must love God only and hate self only.
 
 If the foot had always been ignorant that it belonged to the body, and
 that there was a body on which it depended, if it had only had the
 knowledge and the love of self, and if it came to know that it belonged
 to a body on which it depended, what regret, what shame for its past
 life, for having been useless to the body which inspired its life, which
 would have annihilated it if it had rejected it and separated it from
 itself, as it kept itself apart from the body! What prayers for its
 preservation in it! And with what submission would it allow itself to be
 governed by the will which rules the body, even to consenting, if
 necessary, to be cut off, or it would lose its character as member! For
 every member must be quite willing to perish for the body, for which
 alone the whole is.
 
 
 477
 
 It is false that we are worthy of the love of others; it is unfair that
 we should desire it. If we were born reasonable and impartial, knowing
 ourselves and others, we should not give this bias to our will. However,
 we are born with it; therefore born unjust, for all tends to self. This
 is contrary to all order. We must consider the general good; and the
 propensity to self is the beginning of all disorder, in war, in
 politics, in economy, and in the particular body of man. The will is
 therefore depraved.
 
 If the members of natural and civil communities tend towards the weal of
 the body, the communities themselves ought to look to another more
 general body of which they are members. We ought therefore to look to
 the whole. We are therefore born unjust and depraved.
 
 
 478
 
 When we want to think of God, is there nothing which turns us away, and
 tempts us to think of something else? All this is bad, and is born in
 us.
 
 
 479
 
 If there is a God, we must love Him only, and not the creatures of a
 day. The reasoning of the ungodly in the book of Wisdom[179] is only
 based upon the non-existence of God. "On that supposition," say they,
 "let us take delight in the creatures." That is the worst that can
 happen. But if there were a God to love, they would not have come to
 this conclusion, but to quite the contrary. And this is the conclusion
 of the wise: "There is a God, let us therefore not take delight in the
 creatures."
 
 Therefore all that incites us to attach ourselves to the creatures is
 bad; since it prevents us from serving God if we know Him, or from
 seeking Him if we know Him not. Now we are full of lust. Therefore we
 are full of evil; therefore we ought to hate ourselves and all that
 excited us to attach ourselves to any other object than God only.
 
 
 480
 
 To make the members happy, they must have one will, and submit it to the
 body.
 
 
 481
 
 The examples of the noble deaths of the Lacedaemonians and others scarce
 touch us. For what good is it to us? But the example of the death of the
 martyrs touches us; for they are "our members." We have a common tie
 with them. Their resolution can form ours, not only by example, but
 because it has perhaps deserved ours. There is nothing of this in the
 examples of the heathen. We have no tie with them; as we do not become
 rich by seeing a stranger who is so, but in fact by seeing a father or a
 husband who is so.
 
 
 482
 
 _Morality._--God having made the heavens and the earth, which do not
 feel the happiness of their being, He has willed to make beings who
 should know it, and who should compose a body of thinking members. For
 our members do not feel the happiness of their union, of their
 wonderful intelligence, of the care which has been taken to infuse into
 them minds, and to make them grow and endure. How happy they would be if
 they saw and felt it! But for this they would need to have intelligence
 to know it, and good-will to consent to that of the universal soul. But
 if, having received intelligence, they employed it to retain nourishment
 for themselves without allowing it to pass to the other members, they
 would hate rather than love themselves; their blessedness, as well as
 their duty, consisting in their consent to the guidance of the whole
 soul to which they belong, which loves them better than they love
 themselves.
 
 
 483
 
 To be a member is to have neither life, being, nor movement, except
 through the spirit of the body, and for the body.
 
 The separate member, seeing no longer the body to which it belongs, has
 only a perishing and dying existence. Yet it believes it is a whole, and
 seeing not the body on which it depends, it believes it depends only on
 self, and desires to make itself both centre and body. But not having in
 itself a principle of life, it only goes astray, and is astonished in
 the uncertainty of its being; perceiving in fact that it is not a body,
 and still not seeing that it is a member of a body. In short, when it
 comes to know itself, it has returned as it were to its own home, and
 loves itself only for the body. It deplores its past wanderings.
 
 It cannot by its nature love any other thing, except for itself and to
 subject it to self, because each thing loves itself more than all. But
 in loving the body, it loves itself, because it only exists in it, by
 it, and for it. _Qui adhaeret Deo unus spiritus est._[180]
 
 The body loves the hand; and the hand, if it had a will, should love
 itself in the same way as it is loved by the soul. All love which goes
 beyond this is unfair.
 
 _Adhaerens Deo unus spiritus est._ We love ourselves, because we are
 members of Jesus Christ. We love Jesus Christ, because He is the body of
 which we are members. All is one, one is in the other, like the Three
 Persons.
 
 
 484
 
 Two laws[181] suffice to rule the whole Christian Republic better than
 all the laws of statecraft.
 
 
 485
 
 The true and only virtue, then, is to hate self (for we are hateful on
 account of lust), and to seek a truly lovable being to love. But as we
 cannot love what is outside ourselves, we must love a being who is in
 us, and is not ourselves; and that is true of each and all men. Now,
 only the Universal Being is such. The kingdom of God is within us;[182]
 the universal good is within us, is ourselves--and not ourselves.
 
 
 486
 
 The dignity of man in his innocence consisted in using and having
 dominion over the creatures, but now in separating himself from them,
 and subjecting himself to them.
 
 
 487
 
 Every religion is false, which as to its faith does not worship one God
 as the origin of everything, and which as to its morality does not love
 one only God as the object of everything.
 
 
 488
 
 ... But it is impossible that God should ever be the end, if He is not
 the beginning. We lift our eyes on high, but lean upon the sand; and the
 earth will dissolve, and we shall fall whilst looking at the heavens.
 
 
 489
 
 If there is one sole source of everything, there is one sole end of
 everything; everything through Him, everything for Him. The true
 religion, then, must teach us to worship Him only, and to love Him only.
 But as we find ourselves unable to worship what we know not, and to love
 any other object but ourselves, the religion which instructs us in these
 duties must instruct us also of this inability, and teach us also the
 remedies for it. It teaches us that by one man all was lost, and the
 bond broken between God and us, and that by one man the bond is renewed.
 
 We are born so averse to this love of God, and it is so necessary that
 we must be born guilty, or God would be unjust.
 
 
 490
 
 Men, not being accustomed to form merit, but only to recompense it where
 they find it formed, judge of God by themselves.
 
 
 491
 
 The true religion must have as a characteristic the obligation to love
 God. This is very just, and yet no other religion has commanded this;
 ours has done so. It must also be aware of human lust and weakness; ours
 is so. It must have adduced remedies for this; one is prayer. No other
 religion has asked of God to love and follow Him.
 
 
 492
 
 He who hates not in himself his self-love, and that instinct which leads
 him to make himself God, is indeed blinded. Who does not see that there
 is nothing so opposed to justice and truth? For it is false that we
 deserve this, and it is unfair and impossible to attain it, since all
 demand the same thing. It is, then, a manifest injustice which is innate
 in us, of which we cannot get rid, and of which we must get rid.
 
 Yet no religion has indicated that this was a sin; or that we were born
 in it; or that we were obliged to resist it; or has thought of giving us
 remedies for it.
 
 
 493
 
 The true religion teaches our duties; our weaknesses, pride, and lust;
 and the remedies, humility and mortification.
 
 
 494
 
 The true religion must teach greatness and misery; must lead to the
 esteem and contempt of self, to love and to hate.
 
 
 495
 
 If it is an extraordinary blindness to live without investigating what
 we are, it is a terrible one to live an evil life, while believing in
 God.
 
 
 496
 
 Experience makes us see an enormous difference between piety and
 goodness.
 
 
 497
 
 _Against those who, trusting to the mercy of God, live heedlessly,
 without doing good works._--As the two sources of our sins are pride and
 sloth, God has revealed to us two of His attributes to cure them, mercy
 and justice. The property of justice is to humble pride, however holy
 may be our works, _et non intres in judicium_,[183] etc.; and the
 property of mercy is to combat sloth by exhorting to good works,
 according to that passage: "The goodness of God leadeth to
 repentance,"[184] and that other of the Ninevites: "Let us do penance to
 see if peradventure He will pity us."[185] And thus mercy is so far from
 authorising slackness, that it is on the contrary the quality which
 formally attacks it; so that instead of saying, "If there were no mercy
 in God we should have to make every kind of effort after virtue," we
 must say, on the contrary, that it is because there is mercy in God,
 that we must make every kind of effort.
 
 
 498
 
 It is true there is difficulty in entering into godliness. But this
 difficulty does not arise from the religion which begins in us, but from
 the irreligion which is still there. If our senses were not opposed to
 penitence, and if our corruption were not opposed to the purity of God,
 there would be nothing in this painful to us. We suffer only in
 proportion as the vice which is natural to us resists supernatural
 grace. Our heart feels torn asunder between these opposed efforts. But
 it would be very unfair to impute this violence to God, who is drawing
 us on, instead of to the world, which is holding us back. It is as a
 child, which a mother tears from the arms of robbers, in the pain it
 suffers, should love the loving and legitimate violence of her who
 procures its liberty, and detest only the impetuous and tyrannical
 violence of those who detain it unjustly. The most cruel war which God
 can make with men in this life is to leave them without that war which
 He came to bring. "I came to send war,"[186] He says, "and to teach them
 of this war. I came to bring fire and the sword."[187] Before Him the
 world lived in this false peace.
 
 
 499
 
 _External works._--There is nothing so perilous as what pleases God and
 man. For those states, which please God and man, have one property which
 pleases God, and another which pleases men; as the greatness of Saint
 Teresa. What pleased God was her deep humility in the midst of her
 revelations; what pleased men was her light. And so we torment ourselves
 to imitate her discourses, thinking to imitate her conditions, and not
 so much to love what God loves, and to put ourselves in the state which
 God loves.
 
 It is better not to fast, and thereby humbled, than to fast and be
 self-satisfied therewith. The Pharisee and the Publican.[188]
 
 What use will memory be to me, if it can alike hurt and help me, and all
 depends upon the blessing of God, who gives only to things done for Him,
 according to His rules and in His ways, the manner being as important as
 the thing, and perhaps more; since God can bring forth good out of evil,
 and without God we bring forth evil out of good?
 
 
 500
 
 The meaning of the words, good and evil.
 
 
 501
 
 First step: to be blamed for doing evil, and praised for doing good.
 
 Second step: to be neither praised, nor blamed.
 
 
 502
 
 Abraham[189] took nothing for himself, but only for his servants. So the
 righteous man takes for himself nothing of the world, nor the applause
 of the world, but only for his passions, which he uses as their master,
 saying to the one, "Go," and to another, "Come." _Sub te erit appetitus
 tuus._[190] The passions thus subdued are virtues. Even God attributes
 to Himself avarice, jealousy, anger; and these are virtues as well as
 kindness, pity, constancy, which are also passions. We must employ them
 as slaves, and, leaving to them their food, prevent the soul from taking
 any of it. For, when the passions become masters, they are vices; and
 they give their nutriment to the soul, and the soul nourishes itself
 upon it, and is poisoned.
 
 
 503
 
 Philosophers have consecrated the vices by placing them in God Himself.
 Christians have consecrated the virtues.
 
 
 504
 
 The just man acts by faith in the least things; when he reproves his
 servants, he desires their conversion by the Spirit of God, and prays
 God to correct them; and he expects as much from God as from his own
 reproofs, and prays God to bless his corrections. And so in all his
 other actions he proceeds with the Spirit of God; and his actions
 deceive us by reason of the ... or suspension of the Spirit of God in
 him; and he repents in his affliction.
 
 
 505
 
 All things can be deadly to us, even the things made to serve us; as in
 nature walls can kill us, and stairs can kill us, if we do not walk
 circumspectly.
 
 The least movement affects all nature; the entire sea changes because of
 a rock. Thus in grace, the least action affects everything by its
 consequences; therefore everything is important.
 
 In each action we must look beyond the action at our past, present, and
 future state, and at others whom it affects, and see the relations of
 all those things. And then we shall be very cautious.
 
 
 506
 
 Let God not impute to us our sins, that is to say, all the consequences
 and results of our sins, which are dreadful, even those of the smallest
 faults, if we wish to follow them out mercilessly!
 
 
 507
 
 The spirit of grace; the hardness of the heart; external circumstances.
 
 
 508
 
 Grace is indeed needed to turn a man into a saint; and he who doubts it
 does not know what a saint or a man is.
 
 
 509
 
 _Philosophers._--A fine thing to cry to a man who does not know himself,
 that he should come of himself to God! And a fine thing to say so to a
 man who does know himself!
 
 
 510
 
 Man is not worthy of God, but he is not incapable of being made worthy.
 
 It is unworthy of God to unite Himself to wretched man; but it is not
 unworthy of God to pull him out of his misery.
 
 
 511
 
 If we would say that man is too insignificant to deserve communion with
 God, we must indeed be very great to judge of it.
 
 
 512
 
 It is, in peculiar phraseology, wholly the body of Jesus Christ, but it
 cannot be said to be the whole body of Jesus Christ.[191] The union of
 two things without change does not enable us to say that one becomes the
 other; the soul thus being united to the body, the fire to the timber,
 without change. But change is necessary to make the form of the one
 become the form of the other; thus the union of the Word to man. Because
 my body without my soul would not make the body of a man; therefore my
 soul united to any matter whatsoever will make my body. It does not
 distinguish the necessary condition from the sufficient condition; the
 union is necessary, but not sufficient. The left arm is not the right.
 
 Impenetrability is a property of matter.
 
 Identity _de numers_ in regard to the same time requires the identity of
 matter.
 
 Thus if God united my soul to a body in China, the same body, _idem
 numero_, would be in China.
 
 The same river which runs there is _idem numero_ as that which runs at
 the same time in China.
 
 
 513
 
 Why God has established prayer.
 
 1. To communicate to His creatures the dignity of causality.
 2. To teach us from whom our virtue comes.
 3. To make us deserve other virtues by work.
 
 (But to keep His own pre-eminence, He grants prayer to whom He pleases.)
 
 Objection: But we believe that we hold prayer of ourselves.
 
 This is absurd; for since, though having faith, we cannot have virtues,
 how should we have faith? Is there a greater distance between infidelity
 and faith than between faith and virtue?
 
 _Merit._ This word is ambiguous.
 
 _Meruit habere Redemptorem.
 
 Meruit tam sacra membra tangere.
 
 Digno tam sacra membra tangere.
 
 Non sum dignus.[192]
 
 Qui manducat indignus[193]
 
 Dignus est accipere.[194]
 
 Dignare me._
 
 God is only bound according to His promises. He has promised to grant
 justice to prayers; He has never promised prayer only to the children of
 promise.
 
 Saint Augustine has distinctly said that strength would be taken away
 from the righteous. But it is by chance that he said it; for it might
 have happened that the occasion of saying it did not present itself. But
 his principles make us see that when the occasion for it presented
 itself, it was impossible that he should not say it, or that he should
 say anything to the contrary. It is then rather that he was forced to
 say it, when the occasion presented itself, than that he said it, when
 the occasion presented itself, the one being of necessity, the other of
 chance. But the two are all that we can ask.
 
 
 514
 
 The elect will be ignorant of their virtues, and the outcast of the
 greatness of their sins: "Lord, when saw we Thee an hungered, thirsty?"
 etc.[195][196]
 
 
 515
 
 Romans iii, 27. Boasting is excluded. By what law? Of works? nay, but by
 faith. Then faith is not within our power like the deeds of the law, and
 it is given to us in another way.
 
 
 516
 
 Comfort yourselves. It is not from yourselves that you should expect
 grace; but, on the contrary, it is in expecting nothing from yourselves,
 that you must hope for it.
 
 
 517
 
 Every condition, and even the martyrs, have to fear, according to
 Scripture.
 
 The greatest pain of purgatory is the uncertainty of the judgment. _Deus
 absconditus._
 
 
 518
 
 John viii. _Multi crediderunt in eum. Dicebat ergo Jesus: "Si
 manseritis_ ... VERE _mei discipuli eritis, et_ VERITAS LIBERABIT VOS."
 _Responderunt: "Semen Abrahae sumus, et nemini servimus unquam."_
 
 There is a great difference between disciples and true disciples. We
 recognise them by telling them that the truth will make them free; for
 if they answer that they are free, and that it is in their power to come
 out of slavery to the devil, they are indeed disciples, but not true
 disciples.
 
 
 519
 
 The law has not destroyed nature, but has instructed it; grace has not
 destroyed the law, but has made it act. Faith received at baptism is the
 source of the whole life of Christians and of the converted.
 
 
 520
 
 Grace will always be in the world, and nature also; so that the former
 is in some sort natural. And thus there will always be Pelagians, and
 always Catholics, and always strife; because the first birth makes the
 one, and the grace of the second birth the other.
 
 
 521
 
 The law imposed what it did not give. Grace gives what is imposes.
 
 
 522
 
 All faith consists in Jesus Christ and in Adam, and all morality in lust
 and in grace.
 
 
 523
 
 There is no doctrine more appropriate to man than this, which teaches
 him his double capacity of receiving and of losing grace, because of the
 double peril to which he is exposed, of despair or of pride.
 
 
 524
 
 The philosophers did not prescribe feelings suitable to the two states.
 
 They inspired feelings of pure greatness, and that is not man's state.
 
 They inspired feelings of pure littleness, and that is not man's state.
 
 There must be feelings of humility, not from nature, but from penitence,
 not to rest in them, but to go on to greatness. There must be feelings
 of greatness, not from merit, but from grace, and after having passed
 through humiliation.
 
 
 525
 
 Misery induces despair, pride induces presumption. The Incarnation shows
 man the greatness of his misery by the greatness of the remedy which he
 required.
 
 
 526
 
 The knowledge of God without that of man's misery causes pride. The
 knowledge of man's misery without that of God causes despair. The
 knowledge of Jesus Christ constitutes the middle course, because in Him
 we find both God and our misery.
 
 
 527
 
 Jesus Christ is a God whom we approach without pride, and before whom we
 humble ourselves without despair.
 
 
 528
 
 ... Not a degradation which renders us incapable of good, nor a holiness
 exempt from evil.
 
 
 529
 
 A person told me one day that on coming from confession he felt great
 joy and confidence. Another told me that he remained in fear. Whereupon
 I thought that these two together would make one good man, and that each
 was wanting in that he had not the feeling of the other. The same often
 happens in other things.
 
 
 530
 
 He who knows the will of his master will be beaten with more blows,
 because of the power he has by his knowledge. _Qui justus est,
 justificetur adhuc_,[197] because of the power he has by justice. From
 him who has received most, will the greatest reckoning be demanded,
 because of the power he has by this help.
 
 
 531
 
 Scripture has provided passages of consolation and of warning for all
 conditions.
 
 Nature seems to have done the same thing by her two infinities, natural
 and moral; for we shall always have the higher and the lower, the more
 clever and the less clever, the most exalted and the meanest, in order
 to humble our pride, and exalt our humility.
 
 
 532
 
 _Comminutum cor_ (Saint Paul). This is the Christian character. _Alba
 has named you, I know you no more_ (Corneille).[198] That is the inhuman
 character. The human character is the opposite.
 
 
 533
 
 There are only two kinds of men: the righteous who believe themselves
 sinners; the rest, sinners, who believe themselves righteous.
 
 
 534
 
 We owe a great debt to those who point out faults. For they mortify us.
 They teach us that we have been despised. They do not prevent our being
 so in the future; for we have many other faults for which we may be
 despised. They prepare for us the exercise of correction and freedom
 from fault.
 
 
 535
 
 Man is so made that by continually telling him he is a fool he believes
 it, and by continually telling it to himself he makes himself believe
 it. For man holds an inward talk with his self alone, which it behoves
 him to regulate well: _Corrumpunt bonos mores colloquia prava_.[199] We
 must keep silent as much as possible and talk with ourselves only of
 God, whom we know to be true; and thus we convince ourselves of the
 truth.
 
 
 536
 
 Christianity is strange. It bids man recognise that he is vile, even
 abominable, and bids him desire to be like God. Without such a
 counterpoise, this dignity would make him horribly vain, or this
 humiliation would make him terribly abject.
 
 
 537
 
 With how little pride does a Christian believe himself united to God!
 With how little humiliation does he place himself on a level with the
 worms of earth!
 
 A glorious manner to welcome life and death, good and evil!
 
 
 538
 
 What difference in point of obedience is there between a soldier and a
 Carthusian monk? For both are equally under obedience and dependent,
 both engaged in equally painful exercises. But the soldier always hopes
 to command, and never attains this, for even captains and princes are
 ever slaves and dependants; still he ever hopes and ever works to attain
 this. Whereas the Carthusian monk makes a vow to be always dependent. So
 they do not differ in their perpetual thraldom, in which both of them
 always exist, but in the hope, which one always has, and the other
 never.
 
 
 539
 
 The hope which Christians have of possessing an infinite good is mingled
 with real enjoyment as well as with fear; for it is not as with those
 who should hope for a kingdom, of which they, being subjects, would have
 nothing; but they hope for holiness, for freedom from injustice, and
 they have something of this.
 
 
 540
 
 None is so happy as a true Christian, nor so reasonable, virtuous, or
 amiable.
 
 
 541
 
 The Christian religion alone makes man altogether _lovable and happy_.
 In honesty, we cannot perhaps be altogether lovable and happy.
 
 
 542
 
 _Preface._--The metaphysical proofs of God are so remote from the
 reasoning of men, and so complicated, that they make little impression;
 and if they should be of service to some, it would be only during the
 moment that they see such demonstration; but an hour afterwards they
 fear they have been mistaken.
 
 _Quod curiositate cognoverunt superbia amiserunt._[200]
 
 This is the result of the knowledge of God obtained without Jesus
 Christ; it is communion without a mediator with the God whom they have
 known without a mediator. Whereas those who have known God by a mediator
 know their own wretchedness.
 
 
 543
 
 The God of the Christians is a God who makes the soul feel that He is
 her only good, that her only rest is in Him, that her only delight is
 in loving Him; and who makes her at the same time abhor the obstacles
 which keep her back, and prevent her from loving God with all her
 strength. Self-love and lust, which hinder us, are unbearable to her.
 Thus God makes her feel that she has this root of self-love which
 destroys her, and which He alone can cure.
 
 
 544
 
 Jesus Christ did nothing but teach men that they loved themselves, that
 they were slaves, blind, sick, wretched, and sinners; that He must
 deliver them, enlighten, bless, and heal them; that this would be
 effected by hating self, and by following Him through suffering and the
 death on the cross.
 
 
 545
 
 Without Jesus Christ man must be in vice and misery; with Jesus Christ
 man is free from vice and misery; in Him is all our virtue and all our
 happiness. Apart from Him there is but vice, misery, darkness, death,
 despair.
 
 
 546
 
 We know God only by Jesus Christ. Without this mediator all communion
 with God is taken away; through Jesus Christ we know God. All those who
 have claimed to know God, and to prove Him without Jesus Christ, have
 had only weak proofs. But in proof of Jesus Christ we have the
 prophecies, which are solid and palpable proofs. And these prophecies,
 being accomplished and proved true by the event, mark the certainty of
 these truths, and therefore the divinity of Christ. In Him then, and
 through Him, we know God. Apart from Him, and without the Scripture,
 without original sin, without a necessary Mediator promised and come, we
 cannot absolutely prove God, nor teach right doctrine and right
 morality. But through Jesus Christ, and in Jesus Christ, we prove God,
 and teach morality and doctrine. Jesus Christ is then the true God of
 men.
 
 But we know at the same time our wretchedness; for this God is none
 other than the Saviour of our wretchedness. So we can only know God well
 by knowing our iniquities. Therefore those who have known God, without
 knowing their wretchedness, have not glorified Him, but have glorified
 themselves. _Quia ... non cognovit per sapientiam ... placuit Deo per
 stultitiam praedicationis salvos facere._[201]
 
 
 547
 
 Not only do we know God by Jesus Christ alone, but we know ourselves
 only by Jesus Christ. We know life and death only through Jesus Christ.
 Apart from Jesus Christ, we do not know what is our life, nor our death,
 nor God, nor ourselves.
 
 Thus without the Scripture, which has Jesus Christ alone for its object,
 we know nothing, and see only darkness and confusion in the nature of
 God, and in our own nature.
 
 
 548
 
 It is not only impossible but useless to know God without Jesus Christ.
 They have not departed from Him, but approached; they have not humbled
 themselves, but ...
 
 _Quo quisque optimus est, pessimus, si hoc ipsum, quod optimus est,
 adscribat sibi._
 
 
 549
 
 I love poverty because He loved it. I love riches because they afford me
 the means of helping the very poor. I keep faith with everybody; I do
 not render evil to those who wrong me, but I wish them a lot like mine,
 in which I receive neither evil nor good from men. I try to be just,
 true, sincere, and faithful to all men; I have a tender heart for those
 to whom God has more closely united me; and whether I am alone, or seen
 of men, I do all my actions in the sight of God, who must judge of them,
 and to whom I have consecrated them all.
 
 These are my sentiments; and every day of my life I bless my Redeemer,
 who has implanted them in me, and who, of a man full of weakness, of
 miseries, of lust, of pride, and of ambition, has made a man free from
 all these evils by the power of His grace, to which all the glory of it
 is due, as of myself I have only misery and error.
 
 
 550
 
 _Dignior plagis quam osculis non timeo quia amo._
 
 
 551
 
 _The Sepulchre of Jesus Christ._--Jesus Christ was dead, but seen on the
 Cross. He was dead, and hidden in the Sepulchre.
 
 Jesus Christ was buried by the saints alone.
 
 Jesus Christ wrought no miracle at the Sepulchre.
 
 Only the saints entered it.
 
 It is there, not on the Cross, that Jesus Christ takes a new life.
 
 It is the last mystery of the Passion and the Redemption.
 
 Jesus Christ had nowhere to rest on earth but in the Sepulchre.
 
 His enemies only ceased to persecute Him at the Sepulchre.
 
 
 552
 
 _The Mystery of Jesus._--Jesus suffers in His passions the torments
 which men inflict upon Him; but in His agony He suffers the torments
 which He inflicts on Himself; _turbare semetipsum_.[202] This is a
 suffering from no human, but an almighty hand, for He must be almighty
 to bear it.
 
 Jesus seeks some comfort at least in His three dearest friends, and they
 are asleep. He prays them to bear with Him for a little, and they leave
 Him with entire indifference, having so little compassion that it could
 not prevent their sleeping even for a moment. And thus Jesus was left
 alone to the wrath of God.
 
 Jesus is alone on the earth, without any one not only to feel and share
 His suffering, but even to know of it; He and Heaven were alone in that
 knowledge.
 
 Jesus is in a garden, not of delight as the first Adam, where he lost
 himself and the whole human race, but in one of agony, where He saved
 Himself and the whole human race.
 
 He suffers this affliction and this desertion in the horror of night.
 
 I believe that Jesus never complained but on this single occasion; but
 then He complained as if he could no longer bear His extreme suffering.
 "My soul is sorrowful, even unto death."[203]
 
 Jesus seeks companionship and comfort from men. This is the sole
 occasion in all His life, as it seems to me. But He receives it not, for
 His disciples are asleep.
 
 Jesus will be in agony even to the end of the world. We must not sleep
 during that time.
 
 Jesus, in the midst of this universal desertion, including that of His
 own friends chosen to watch with Him, finding them asleep, is vexed
 because of the danger to which they expose, not Him, but themselves; He
 cautions them for their own safety and their own good, with a sincere
 tenderness for them during their ingratitude, and warns them that the
 spirit is willing and the flesh weak.
 
 Jesus, finding them still asleep, without being restrained by any
 consideration for themselves or for Him, has the kindness not to waken
 them, and leaves them in repose.
 
 Jesus prays, uncertain of the will of His Father, and fears death; but,
 when He knows it, He goes forward to offer Himself to death. _Eamus.
 Processit_[204] (John).
 
 Jesus asked of men and was not heard.
 
 Jesus, while His disciples slept, wrought their salvation. He has
 wrought that of each of the righteous while they slept, both in their
 nothingness before their birth, and in their sins after their birth.
 
 He prays only once that the cup pass away, and then with submission; and
 twice that it come if necessary.
 
 Jesus is weary.
 
 Jesus, seeing all His friends asleep and all His enemies wakeful,
 commits Himself entirely to His Father.
 
 Jesus does not regard in Judas his enmity, but the order of God, which
 He loves and admits, since He calls him friend.
 
 Jesus tears Himself away from His disciples to enter into His agony; we
 must tear ourselves away from our nearest and dearest to imitate Him.
 
 Jesus being in agony and in the greatest affliction, let us pray longer.
 
 We implore the mercy of God, not that He may leave us at peace in our
 vices, but that He may deliver us from them.
 
 If God gave us masters by His own hand, oh! how necessary for us to obey
 them with a good heart! Necessity and events follow infallibly.
 
 --"Console thyself, thou wouldst not seek Me, if thou hadst not found
 Me.
 
 "I thought of thee in Mine agony, I have sweated such drops of blood for
 thee.
 
 "It is tempting Me rather than proving thyself, to think if thou wouldst
 do such and such a thing on an occasion which has not happened; I shall
 act in thee if it occur.
 
 "Let thyself be guided by My rules; see how well I have led the Virgin
 and the saints who have let Me act in them.
 
 "The Father loves all that I do.
 
 "Dost thou wish that it always cost Me the blood of My humanity, without
 thy shedding tears?
 
 "Thy conversion is My affair; fear not, and pray with confidence as for
 Me.
 
 "I am present with thee by My Word in Scripture, by My Spirit in the
 Church and by inspiration, by My power in the priests, by My prayer in
 the faithful.
 
 "Physicians will not heal thee, for thou wilt die at last. But it is I
 who heal thee, and make the body immortal.
 
 "Suffer bodily chains and servitude, I deliver thee at present only from
 spiritual servitude.
 
 "I am more a friend to thee than such and such an one, for I have done
 for thee more than they, they would not have suffered what I have
 suffered from thee, and they would not have died for thee as I have done
 in the time of thine infidelities and cruelties, and as I am ready to
 do, and do, among my elect and at the Holy Sacrament."
 
 "If thou knewest thy sins, thou wouldst lose heart."
 
 --I shall lose it then, Lord, for on Thy assurance I believe their
 malice.
 
 --"No, for I, by whom thou learnest, can heal thee of them, and what I
 say to thee is a sign that I will heal thee. In proportion to thy
 expiation of them, thou wilt know them, and it will be said to thee:
 'Behold, thy sins are forgiven thee.' Repent, then, for thy hidden sins,
 and for the secret malice of those which thou knowest."
 
 --Lord, I give Thee all.
 
 --"I love thee more ardently than thou hast loved thine abominations,
 _ut immundus pro luto_.
 
 "To Me be the glory, not to thee, worm of the earth.
 
 "Ask thy confessor, when My own words are to thee occasion of evil,
 vanity, or curiosity."
 
 --I see in me depths of pride, curiosity, and lust. There is no relation
 between me and God, nor Jesus Christ the Righteous. But He has been made
 sin for me; all Thy scourges are fallen upon Him. He is more abominable
 than I, and, far from abhorring me, He holds Himself honoured that I go
 to Him and succour Him.
 
 But He has healed Himself, and still more so will He heal me.
 
 I must add my wounds to His, and join myself to Him; and He will save me
 in saving Himself. But this must not be postponed to the future.
 
 _Eritis sicut dii scientes bonum et malum._[205] Each one creates his
 god, when judging, "This is good or bad"; and men mourn or rejoice too
 much at events.
 
 Do little things as though they were great, because of the majesty of
 Jesus Christ who does them in us, and who lives our life; and do the
 greatest things as though they were little and easy, because of His
 omnipotence.
 
 
 553
 
 It seems to me that Jesus Christ only allowed His wounds to be touched
 after His resurrection: _Noli me tangere._[206] We must unite ourselves
 only to His sufferings.
 
 At the Last Supper He gave Himself in communion as about to die; to the
 disciples at Emmaus as risen from the dead; to the whole Church as
 ascended into heaven.
 
 
 554
 
 "Compare not thyself with others, but with Me. If thou dost not find Me
 in those with whom thou comparest thyself, thou comparest thyself to one
 who is abominable. If thou findest Me in them, compare thyself to Me.
 But whom wilt thou compare? Thyself, or Me in thee? If it is thyself, it
 is one who is abominable. If it is I, thou comparest Me to Myself. Now I
 am God in all.
 
 "I speak to thee, and often counsel thee, because thy director cannot
 speak to thee, for I do not want thee to lack a guide.
 
 "And perhaps I do so at his prayers, and thus he leads thee without thy
 seeing it. Thou wouldst not seek Me, if thou didst not possess Me.
 
 "Be not therefore troubled."
 
 
 
 
 SECTION VIII
 
 THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION
 
 
 555
 
 ... Men blaspheme what they do not know. The Christian religion consists
 in two points. It is of equal concern to men to know them, and it is
 equally dangerous to be ignorant to them. And it is equally of God's
 mercy that He has given indications of both.
 
 And yet they take occasion to conclude that one of these points does not
 exist, from that which should have caused them to infer the other. The
 sages who have said there is only one God have been persecuted, the Jews
 were hated, and still more the Christians. They have seen by the light
 of nature that if there be a true religion on earth, the course of all
 things must tend to it as to a centre.
 
 The whole course of things must have for its object the establishment
 and the greatness of religion. Men must have within them feelings suited
 to what religion teaches us. And, finally, religion must so be the
 object and centre to which all things tend, that whoever knows the
 principles of religion can give an explanation both of the whole nature
 of man in particular, and of the whole course of the world in general.
 
 And on this ground they take occasion to revile the Christian religion,
 because they misunderstand it. They imagine that it consists simply in
 the worship of a God considered as great, powerful, and eternal; which
 is strictly deism, almost as far removed from the Christian religion as
 atheism, which is its exact opposite. And thence they conclude that this
 religion is not true, because they do not see that all things concur to
 the establishment of this point, that God does not manifest Himself to
 men with all the evidence which He could show.
 
 But let them conclude what they will against deism, they will conclude
 nothing against the Christian religion, which properly consists in the
 mystery of the Redeemer, who, uniting in Himself the two natures, human
 and divine, has redeemed men from the corruption of sin in order to
 reconcile them in His divine person to God.
 
 The Christian religion, then, teaches men these two truths; that there
 is a God whom men can know, and that there is a corruption in their
 nature which renders them unworthy of Him. It is equally important to
 men to know both these points; and it is equally dangerous for man to
 know God without knowing his own wretchedness, and to know his own
 wretchedness without knowing the Redeemer who can free him from it. The
 knowledge of only one of these points gives rise either to the pride of
 philosophers, who have known God, and not their own wretchedness, or to
 the despair of atheists, who know their own wretchedness, but not the
 Redeemer.
 
 And, as it is alike necessary to man to know these two points, so is it
 alike merciful of God to have made us know them. The Christian religion
 does this; it is in this that it consists.
 
 Let us herein examine the order of the world, and see if all things do
 not tend to establish these two chief points of this religion: Jesus
 Christ is the end of all, and the centre to which all tends. Whoever
 knows Him knows the reason of everything.
 
 Those who fall into error err only through failure to see one of these
 two things. We can then have an excellent knowledge of God without that
 of our own wretchedness, and of our own wretchedness without that of
 God. But we cannot know Jesus Christ without knowing at the same time
 both God and our own wretchedness.
 
 Therefore I shall not undertake here to prove by natural reasons either
 the existence of God, or the Trinity, or the immortality of the soul, or
 anything of that nature; not only because I should not feel myself
 sufficiently able to find in nature arguments to convince hardened
 atheists, but also because such knowledge without Jesus Christ is
 useless and barren. Though a man should be convinced that numerical
 proportions are immaterial truths, eternal and dependent on a first
 truth, in which they subsist, and which is called God, I should not
 think him far advanced towards his own salvation.
 
 The God of Christians is not a God who is simply the author of
 mathematical truths, or of the order of the elements; that is the view
 of heathens and Epicureans. He is not merely a God who exercises His
 providence over the life and fortunes of men, to bestow on those who
 worship Him a long and happy life. That was the portion of the Jews. But
 the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God of
 Christians, is a God of love and of comfort, a God who fills the soul
 and heart of those whom He possesses, a God who makes them conscious of
 their inward wretchedness, and His infinite mercy, who unites Himself to
 their inmost soul, who fills it with humility and joy, with confidence
 and love, who renders them incapable of any other end than Himself.
 
 All who seek God without Jesus Christ, and who rest in nature, either
 find no light to satisfy them, or come to form for themselves a means of
 knowing God and serving Him without a mediator. Thereby they fall either
 into atheism, or into deism, two things which the Christian religion
 abhors almost equally.
 
 Without Jesus Christ the world would not exist; for it should needs be
 either that it would be destroyed or be a hell.
 
 If the world existed to instruct man of God, His divinity would shine
 through every part in it in an indisputable manner; but as it exists
 only by Jesus Christ, and for Jesus Christ, and to teach men both their
 corruption and their redemption, all displays the proofs of these two
 truths.
 
 All appearance indicates neither a total exclusion nor a manifest
 presence of divinity, but the presence of a God who hides Himself.
 Everything bears this character.
 
 ... Shall he alone who knows his nature know it only to be miserable?
 Shall he alone who knows it be alone unhappy?
 
 ... He must not see nothing at all, nor must he see sufficient for him
 to believe he possesses it; but he must see enough to know that he has
 lost it. For to know of his loss, he must see and not see; and that is
 exactly the state in which he naturally is.
 
 ... Whatever part he takes, I shall not leave him at rest ...
 
 
 556
 
 ... It is then true that everything teaches man his condition, but he
 must understand this well. For it is not true that all reveals God, and
 it is not true that all conceals God. But it is at the same time true
 that He hides Himself from those who tempt Him, and that He reveals
 Himself to those who seek Him, because men are both unworthy and capable
 of God; unworthy by their corruption capable by their original nature.
 
 
 557
 
 What shall we conclude from all our darkness, but our unworthiness?
 
 
 558
 
 If there never had been any appearance of God, this eternal deprivation
 would have been equivocal, and might have as well corresponded with the
 absence of all divinity, as with the unworthiness of men to know Him;
 but His occasional, though not continual, appearances remove the
 ambiguity, If He appeared once, He exists always; and thus we cannot but
 conclude both that there is a God, and that men are unworthy of Him.
 
 
 559
 
 We do not understand the glorious state of Adam, nor the nature of his
 sin, nor the transmission of it to us. These are matters which took
 place under conditions of a nature altogether different from our own,
 and which transcend our present understanding.
 
 The knowledge of all this is useless to us as a means of escape from it;
 and all that we are concerned to know, is that we are miserable,
 corrupt, separated from God, but ransomed by Jesus Christ, whereof we
 have wonderful proofs on earth.
 
 So the two proofs of corruption and redemption are drawn from the
 ungodly, who live in indifference to religion, and from the Jews who are
 irreconcilable enemies.
 
 
 560
 
 There are two ways of proving the truths of our religion; one by the
 power of reason, the other by the authority of him who speaks.
 
 We do not make use of the latter, but of the former. We do not say,
 "This must be believed, for Scripture, which says it, is divine." But we
 say that it must be believed for such and such a reason, which are
 feeble arguments, as reason may be bent to everything.
 
 
 561
 
 There is nothing on earth that does not show either the wretchedness of
 man, or the mercy of God; either the weakness of man without God, or the
 strength of man with God.
 
 
 562
 
 It will be one of the confusions of the damned to see that they are
 condemned by their own reason, by which they claimed to condemn the
 Christian religion.
 
 
 563
 
 The prophecies, the very miracles and proofs of our religion, are not of
 such a nature that they can be said to be absolutely convincing. But
 they are also of such a kind that it cannot be said that it is
 unreasonable to believe them. Thus there is both evidence and obscurity
 to enlighten some and confuse others. But the evidence is such that it
 surpasses, or at least equals, the evidence to the contrary; so that it
 is not reason which can determine men not to follow it, and thus it can
 only be lust or malice of heart. And by this means there is sufficient
 evidence to condemn, and insufficient to convince; so that it appears in
 those who follow it, that it is grace, and not reason, which makes them
 follow it; and in those who shun it, that it is lust, not reason, which
 makes them shun it.
 
 _Vere discipuli, vere Israelita, vere liberi, vere cibus._[207]
 
 
 564
 
 Recognise, then, the truth of religion in the very obscurity of
 religion, in the little light we have of it, and in the indifference
 which we have to knowing it.
 
 
 565
 
 We understand nothing of the works of God, if we do not take as a
 principle that He has willed to blind some, and enlighten others.
 
 
 566
 
 The two contrary reasons. We must begin with that; without that we
 understand nothing, and all is heretical; and we must even add at the
 end of each truth that the opposite truth is to be remembered.
 
 
 567
 
 _Objection._ The Scripture is plainly full of matters not dictated by
 the Holy Spirit.--_Answer._ Then they do not harm faith.--_Objection._
 But the Church has decided that all is of the Holy Spirit.--_Answer._ I
 answer two things: first, the Church has not so decided; secondly, if
 she should so decide, it could be maintained.
 
 Do you think that the prophecies cited in the Gospel are related to make
 you believe? No, it is to keep you from believing.
 
 
 568
 
 _Canonical._--The heretical books in the beginning of the Church serve
 to prove the canonical.
 
 
 569
 
 To the chapter on the _Fundamentals_ must be added that on _Typology_
 touching the reason of types: why Jesus Christ was prophesied as to His
 first coming; why prophesied obscurely as to the manner.
 
 
 570
 
 _The reason why. Types._--[They had to deal with a carnal people and to
 render them the depositary of the spiritual covenant.] To give faith to
 the Messiah, it was necessary there should have been precedent
 prophecies, and that these should be conveyed by persons above
 suspicion, diligent, faithful, unusually zealous, and known to all the
 world.
 
 To accomplish all this, God chose this carnal people, to whom He
 entrusted the prophecies which foretell the Messiah as a deliverer, and
 as a dispenser of those carnal goods which this people loved. And thus
 they have had an extraordinary passion for their prophets, and, in sight
 of the whole world, have had charge of these books which foretell their
 Messiah, assuring all nations that He should come, and in the way
 foretold in the books, which they held open to the whole world. Yet this
 people, deceived by the poor and ignominious advent of the Messiah, have
 been His most cruel enemies. So that they, the people least open to
 suspicion in the world of favouring us, the most strict and most zealous
 that can be named for their law and their prophets, have kept the books
 incorrupt. Hence those who have rejected and crucified Jesus Christ, who
 has been to them an offence, are those who have charge of the books
 which testify of Him, and state that He will be an offence and rejected.
 Therefore they have shown it was He by rejecting Him, and He has been
 alike proved both by the righteous Jews who received Him, and by the
 unrighteous who rejected Him, both facts having been foretold.
 
 Wherefore the prophecies have a hidden and spiritual meaning, to which
 this people were hostile, under the carnal meaning which they loved. If
 the spiritual meaning had been revealed, they would not have loved it,
 and, unable to bear it, they would not have been zealous of the
 preservation of their books and their ceremonies; and if they had loved
 these spiritual promises, and had preserved them incorrupt till the time
 of the Messiah, their testimony would have had no force, because they
 had been his friends.
 
 Therefore it was well that the spiritual meaning should be concealed;
 but, on the other hand, if this meaning had been so hidden as not to
 appear at all, it could not have served as a proof of the Messiah. What
 then was done? In a crowd of passages it has been hidden under the
 temporal meaning, and in a few has been clearly revealed; besides that
 the time and the state of the world have been so clearly foretold that
 it is clearer than the sun. And in some places this spiritual meaning is
 so clearly expressed, that it would require a blindness like that which
 the flesh imposes on the spirit when it is subdued by it, not to
 recognise it.
 
 See, then, what has been the prudence of God. This meaning is concealed
 under another in an infinite number of passages, and in some, though
 rarely, it is revealed; but yet so that the passages in which it is
 concealed are equivocal, and can suit both meanings; whereas the
 passages where it is disclosed are unequivocal, and can only suit the
 spiritual meaning.
 
 So that this cannot lead us into error, and could only be misunderstood
 by so carnal a people.
 
 For when blessings are promised in abundance, what was to prevent them
 from understanding the true blessings, but their covetousness, which
 limited the meaning to worldly goods? But those whose only good was in
 God referred them to God alone. For there are two principles, which
 divide the wills of men, covetousness and charity. Not that covetousness
 cannot exist along with faith in God, nor charity with worldly riches;
 but covetousness uses God, and enjoys the world, and charity is the
 opposite.
 
 Now the ultimate end gives names to things. All which prevents us from
 attaining it, is called an enemy to us. Thus the creatures, however
 good, are the enemies of the righteous, when they turn them away from
 God, and God Himself is the enemy of those whose covetousness He
 confounds.
 
 Thus as the significance of the word "enemy" is dependent on the
 ultimate end, the righteous understood by it their passions, and the
 carnal the Babylonians; and so these terms were obscure only for the
 unrighteous. And this is what Isaiah says: _Signa legem in electis
 meis_,[208] and that Jesus Christ shall be a stone of stumbling. But,
 "Blessed are they who shall not be offended in him." Hosea,[209] _ult._,
 says excellently, "Where is the wise? and he shall understand what I
 say. The righteous shall know them, for the ways of God are right; but
 the transgressors shall fall therein."
 
 
 571
 
 Hypothesis that the apostles were impostors.--The time clearly, the
 manner obscurely.--Five typical proofs.
 
         {1600 prophets.
    2000 {
         { 400 scattered.
 
 
 572
 
 _Blindness of Scripture._--"The Scripture," said the Jews, "says that we
 shall not know whence Christ will come (John vii, 27, and xii, 34). The
 Scripture says that Christ abideth for ever, and He said that He should
 die." Therefore, says Saint John,[210] they believed not, though He had
 done so many miracles, that the word of Isaiah might be fulfilled: "He
 hath blinded them," etc.
 
 
 573
 
 _Greatness._--Religion is so great a thing that it is right that those
 who will not take the trouble to seek it, if it be obscure, should be
 deprived of it. Why, then, do any complain, if it be such as can be
 found by seeking?
 
 
 574
 
 All things work together for good to the elect, even the obscurities of
 Scripture; for they honour them because of what is divinely clear. And
 all things work together for evil to the rest of the world, even what is
 clear; for they revile such, because of the obscurities which they do
 not understand.
 
 
 575
 
 _The general conduct of the world towards the Church: God willing to
 blind and to enlighten._--The event having proved the divinity of these
 prophecies, the rest ought to be believed. And thereby we see the order
 of the world to be of this kind. The miracles of the Creation and the
 Deluge being forgotten, God sends the law and the miracles of Moses, the
 prophets who prophesied particular things; and to prepare a lasting
 miracle, He prepares prophecies and their fulfilment; but, as the
 prophecies could be suspected, He desires to make them above suspicion,
 etc.
 
 
 576
 
 God has made the blindness of this people subservient to the good of the
 elect.
 
 
 577
 
 There is sufficient clearness to enlighten the elect, and sufficient
 obscurity to humble them. There is sufficient obscurity to blind the
 reprobate, and sufficient clearness to condemn them, and make them
 inexcusable.--Saint Augustine, Montaigne, Sebond.
 
 The genealogy of Jesus Christ in the Old Testament is intermingled with
 so many others that are useless, that it cannot be distinguished. If
 Moses had kept only the record of the ancestors of Christ, that might
 have been too plain. If he had not noted that of Jesus Christ, it might
 not have been sufficiently plain. But, after all, whoever looks closely
 sees that of Jesus Christ expressly traced through Tamar,[211]
 Ruth,[212] etc.
 
 Those who ordained these sacrifices, knew their uselessness; those who
 have declared their uselessness, have not ceased to practise them.
 
 If God had permitted only one religion, it had been too easily known;
 but when we look at it closely, we clearly discern the truth amidst this
 confusion.
 
 _The premiss._--Moses was a clever man. If, then, he ruled himself by
 his reason, he would say nothing clearly which was directly against
 reason.
 
 Thus all the very apparent weaknesses are strength. Example; the two
 genealogies in Saint Matthew and Saint Luke. What can be clearer than
 that this was not concerted?
 
 
 578
 
 God (and the Apostles), foreseeing that the seeds of pride would make
 heresies spring up, and being unwilling to give them occasion to arise
 from correct expressions, has put in Scripture and the prayers of the
 Church contrary words and sentences to produce their fruit in time.
 
 So in morals He gives charity, which produces fruits contrary to lust.
 
 
 579
 
 Nature has some perfections to show that she is the image of God, and
 some defects to show that she is only His image.
 
 
 580
 
 God prefers rather to incline the will than the intellect. Perfect
 clearness would be of use to the intellect, and would harm the will. To
 humble pride.
 
 
 581
 
 We make an idol of truth itself; for truth apart from charity is not
 God, but His image and idol, which we must neither love nor worship; and
 still less must we love or worship its opposite, namely, falsehood.
 
 I can easily love total darkness; but if God keeps me in a state of
 semi-darkness, such partial darkness displeases me, and, because I do
 not see therein the advantage of total darkness, it is unpleasant to me.
 This is a fault, and a sign that I make for myself an idol of darkness,
 apart from the order of God. Now only His order must be worshipped.
 
 
 582
 
 The feeble-minded are people who know the truth, but only affirm it so
 far as consistent with their own interest. But, apart from that, they
 renounce it.
 
 
 583
 
 The world exists for the exercise of mercy and judgment, not as if men
 were placed in it out of the hands of God, but as hostile to God; and to
 them He grants by grace sufficient light, that they may return to Him,
 if they desire to seek and follow Him; and also that they may be
 punished, if they refuse to seek or follow Him.
 
 
 584
 
 _That God has willed to hide Himself._--If there were only one religion,
 God would indeed be manifest. The same would be the case, if there were
 no martyrs but in our religion.
 
 God being thus hidden, every religion which does not affirm that God is
 hidden, is not true; and every religion which does not give the reason
 of it, is not instructive. Our religion does, all this: _Vere tu es Deus
 absconditus._
 
 
 585
 
 If there were no obscurity, man would not be sensible of his corruption;
 if there were no light, man would not hope for a remedy. Thus, it is not
 only fair, but advantageous to us, that God be partly hidden and partly
 revealed; since it is equally dangerous to man to know God without
 knowing his own wretchedness, and to know his own wretchedness without
 knowing God.
 
 
 586
 
 This religion, so great in miracles, saints, blameless Fathers, learned
 and great witnesses, martyrs, established kings as David, and Isaiah, a
 prince of the blood, and so great in science, after having displayed all
 her miracles and all her wisdom, rejects all this, and declares that she
 has neither wisdom nor signs, but only the cross and foolishness.
 
 For those, who, by these signs and that wisdom, have deserved your
 belief, and who have proved to you their character, declare to you that
 nothing of all this can change you, and render you capable of knowing
 and loving God, but the power of the foolishness of the cross without
 wisdom and signs, and not the signs without this power. Thus our
 religion is foolish in respect to the effective cause, and wise in
 respect to the wisdom which prepares it.
 
 
 587
 
 Our religion is wise and foolish. Wise, because it is the most learned,
 and the most founded on miracles, prophecies, etc. Foolish, because it
 is not all this which makes us belong to it. This makes us indeed
 condemn those who do not belong to it; but it does not cause belief in
 those who do belong to it. It is the cross that makes them believe, _ne
 evacuata sit crux_. And so Saint Paul, who came with wisdom and signs,
 says that he has come neither with wisdom nor with signs; for he came to
 convert. But those who come only to convince, can say that they come
 with wisdom and with signs.

 588
 
 _On the fact that the Christian religion is not the only religion._--So
 far is this from being a reason for believing that it is not the true
 one, that, on the contrary, it makes us see that it is so.
 
 
 589
 
 Men must be sincere in all religions; true heathens, true Jews, true
 Christians.

 _The falseness of other religions._--They have no witnesses. Jews have.
 God defies other religions to produce such signs: Isaiah xliii, 9; xliv,
 8.
 
 
 592
 
 _History of China._[213]-I believe only the histories, whose witnesses
 got themselves killed.
 
 [Which is the more credible of the two, Moses or China?]
 
 It is not a question of seeing this summarily. I tell you there is in it
 something to blind, and something to enlighten.
 
 By this one word I destroy all your reasoning. "But China obscures," say
 you; and I answer, "China obscures, but there is clearness to be found;
 seek it."
 
 Thus all that you say makes for one of the views, and not at all against
 the other. So this serves, and does no harm.
 
 We must then see this in detail; we must put the papers on the table.
 
 
 593
 
 _Against the history of China._ The historians of Mexico, the five
 suns,[214] of which the last is only eight hundred years old.
 
 The difference between a book accepted by a nation, and one which makes

 594
 
 Mahomet was without authority. His reasons then should have been very
 strong, having only their own force. What does he say then, that we must
 believe him?
 
 
 595
 
 The Psalms are chanted throughout the whole world.
 
 Who renders testimony to Mahomet? Himself. Jesus Christ[215] desires His
 own testimony to be as nothing.
 
 The quality of witnesses necessitates their existence always and
 everywhere; and he, miserable creature, is alone.
 
 
 596
 
 _Against Mahomet._--The Koran is not more of Mahomet than the Gospel is
 of Saint Matthew, for it is cited by many authors from age to age. Even
 its very enemies, Celsus and Porphyry, never denied it.
 
 The Koran says Saint Matthew was an honest man.[216] Therefore Mahomet
 was a false prophet for calling honest men wicked, or for not agreeing
 with what they have said of Jesus Christ.
 
 
 597
 
 It is not by that which is obscure in Mahomet, and which may be
 interpreted in a mysterious sense, that I would have him judged, but by
 what is clear, as his paradise and the rest. In that he is ridiculous.
 And since what is clear is ridiculous, it is not right to take his
 obscurities for mysteries.
 
 It is not the same with the Scripture. I agree that there are in it
 obscurities as strange as those of Mahomet; but there are admirably
 clear passages, and the prophecies are manifestly fulfilled. The cases
 are therefore not on a par. We must not confound, and put on one level
 things which only resemble each other in their obscurity, and not in the
 clearness, which requires us to reverence the obscurities.
 
 
 598
 
 _The difference between Jesus Christ and Mahomet._--Mahomet was not
 foretold; Jesus Christ was foretold.
 
 Mahomet slew; Jesus Christ caused His own to be slain.
 
 Mahomet forbade reading; the Apostles ordered reading.
 
 In fact the two are so opposed, that if Mahomet took the way to succeed
 from a worldly point of view, Jesus Christ, from the same point of view,
 took the way to perish. And instead of concluding that, since Mahomet
 succeeded, Jesus Christ might well have succeeded, we ought to say that
 since Mahomet succeeded, Jesus Christ should have failed.
 
 
 599
 
 Any man can do what Mahomet has done; for he performed no miracles, he
 was not foretold. No man can do what Christ has done.
 
 
 600
 
 The heathen religion has no foundation [at the present day. It is said
 once to have had a foundation by the oracles which spoke. But what are
 the books which assure us of this? Are they so worthy of belief on
 account of the virtue of their authors? Have they been preserved with
 such care that we can be sure that they have not been meddled with?]
 
 The Mahometan religion has for a foundation the Koran and Mahomet. But
 has this prophet, who was to be the last hope of the world, been
 foretold? What sign has he that every other man has not, who chooses to
 call himself a prophet? What miracles does he himself say that he has
 done? What mysteries has he taught, even according to his own tradition?
 What was the morality, what the happiness held out by him?
 
 The Jewish religion must be differently regarded in the tradition of the
 Holy Bible, and in the tradition of the people. Its morality and
 happiness are absurd in the tradition of the people, but are admirable
 in that of the Holy Bible. (And all religion is the same; for the
 Christian religion is very different in the Holy Bible and in the
 casuists.) The foundation is admirable; it is the most ancient book in
 the world, and the most authentic; and whereas Mahomet, in order to make
 his own book continue in existence, forbade men to read it, Moses,[217]
 for the same reason, ordered every one to read his.
 
 Our religion is so divine that another divine religion has only been the
 foundation of it.
 
 
 601
 
 _Order._--To see what is clear and indisputable in the whole state of
 the Jews.
 
 
 602
 
 The Jewish religion is wholly divine in its authority, its duration, its
 perpetuity, its morality, its doctrine, and its effects.
 
 
 603
 
 The only science contrary to common sense and human nature is that alone
 which has always existed among men.
 
 
 604
 
 The only religion contrary to nature, to common sense, and to our
 pleasure, is that alone which has always existed.
 
 
 605
 
 No religion but our own has taught that man is born in sin. No sect of
 philosophers has said this. Therefore none have declared the truth.
 
 No sect or religion has always existed on earth, but the Christian
 religion.
 
 
 606
 
 Whoever judges of the Jewish religion by its coarser forms will
 misunderstand it. It is to be seen in the Holy Bible, and in the
 tradition of the prophets, who have made it plain enough that they did
 not interpret the law according to the letter. So our religion is divine
 in the Gospel, in the Apostles, and in tradition; but it is absurd in
 those who tamper with it.
 
 The Messiah, according to the carnal Jews, was to be a great temporal
 prince. Jesus Christ, according to carnal Christians,[218] has come to
 dispense us from the love of God, and to give us sacraments which shall
 do everything without our help. Such is not the Christian religion, nor
 the Jewish. True Jews and true Christians have always expected a Messiah
 who should make them love God, and by that love triumph over their
 enemies.
 
 
 607
 
 The carnal Jews hold a midway place between Christians and heathens. The
 heathens know not God, and love the world only. The Jews know the true
 God, and love the world only. The Christians know the true God, and love
 not the world. Jews and heathens love the same good. Jews and Christians
 know the same God.
 
 The Jews were of two kinds; the first had only heathen affections, the
 other had Christian affections.
 
 
 608
 
 There are two kinds of men in each religion: among the heathen,
 worshippers of beasts, and the worshippers of the one only God of
 natural religion; among the Jews, the carnal, and the spiritual, who
 were the Christians of the old law; among Christians, the
 coarser-minded, who are the Jews of the new law. The carnal Jews looked
 for a carnal Messiah; the coarser Christians believe that the Messiah
 has dispensed them from the love of God; true Jews and true Christians
 worship a Messiah who makes them love God.
 
 
 609
 
 _To show that the true Jews and the true Christians have but the same
 religion._--The religion of the Jews seemed to consist essentially in
 the fatherhood of Abraham, in circumcision, in sacrifices, in
 ceremonies, in the Ark, in the temple, in Jerusalem, and, finally, in
 the law, and in the covenant with Moses.
 
 I say that it consisted in none of those things, but only in the love of
 God, and that God disregarded all the other things.
 
 That God did not accept the posterity of Abraham.
 
 That the Jews were to be punished like strangers, if they transgressed.
 _Deut._ viii, 19; "If thou do at all forget the Lord thy God, and walk
 after other gods, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely
 perish, as the nations which the Lord destroyeth before your face."
 
 That strangers, if they loved God, were to be received by Him as the
 Jews. _Isaiah_ lvi, 3: "Let not the stranger say, 'The Lord will not
 receive me.' The strangers who join themselves unto the Lord to serve
 Him and love Him, will I bring unto my holy mountain, and accept therein
 sacrifices, for mine house is a house of prayer."
 
 That the true Jews considered their merit to be from God only, and not
 from Abraham. _Isaiah_ lxiii, 16; "Doubtless thou art our Father, though
 Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not. Thou art our
 Father and our Redeemer."
 
 Moses himself told them that God would not accept persons. _Deut._ x,
 17: "God," said he, "regardeth neither persons nor sacrifices."
 
 The Sabbath was only a sign, _Exod._ xxxi, 13; and in memory of the
 escape from Egypt, _Deut._ v, 19. Therefore it is no longer necessary,
 since Egypt must be forgotten.
 
 Circumcision was only a sign, _Gen._ xvii, 11. And thence it came to
 pass that, being in the desert, they were not circumcised because they
 could not be confounded with other peoples; and after Jesus Christ came,
 it was no longer necessary.
 
 That the circumcision of the heart is commanded. _Deut._ x, 16;
 _Jeremiah_ iv, 4: "Be ye circumcised in heart; take away the
 superfluities of your heart, and harden yourselves not. For your God is
 a mighty God, strong and terrible, who accepteth not persons."
 
 That God said He would one day do it. _Deut._ xxx, 6; "God will
 circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, that thou mayest love
 Him with all thine heart."
 
 That the uncircumcised in heart shall be judged. _Jeremiah_ ix, 26: For
 God will judge the uncircumcised peoples, and all the people of Israel,
 because he is "uncircumcised in heart."
 
 That the external is of no avail apart from the internal. _Joel_ ii, 13:
 _Scindite corda vestra_, etc.; _Isaiah_ lviii, 3, 4, etc.
 
 The love of God is enjoined in the whole of Deuteronomy. _Deut._ xxx,
 19: "I call heaven and earth to record that I have set before you life
 and death, that you should choose life, and love God, and obey Him, for
 God is your life."
 
 That the Jews, for lack of that love, should be rejected for their
 offences, and the heathen chosen in their stead. _Hosea_ i, 10; _Deut._
 xxxii, 20. "I will hide myself from them in view of their latter sins,
 for they are a froward generation without faith. They have moved me to
 jealousy with that which is not God, and I will move them to jealousy
 with those which are not a people, and with an ignorant and foolish
 nation." _Isaiah_ lxv, 1.
 
 That temporal goods are false, and that the true good is to be united to
 God. _Psalm_ cxliii, 15.
 
 That their feasts are displeasing to God. _Amos_ v, 21.
 
 That the sacrifices of the Jews displeased God. _Isaiah_ lxvi. 1-3; i,
 II; _Jer._ vi, 20; David, _Miserere._--Even on the part of the good,
 _Expectavi_. _Psalm_ xlix, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.
 
 That He has established them only for their hardness. _Micah_,
 admirably, vi; 1 _Kings_ xv, 22; _Hosea_ vi, 6.
 
 That the sacrifices of the Gentiles will be accepted of God, and that
 God will take no pleasure in the sacrifices of the Jews. _Malachi_ i,
 II.
 
 That God will make a new covenant with the Messiah, and the old will be
 annulled. _Jer._ xxxi, 31. _Mandata non bona. Ezek._
 
 That the old things will be forgotten. _Isaiah_ xliii, 18, 19; lxv 17,
 10.
 
 That the Ark will no longer be remembered. _Jer._ iii, 15, 16.
 
 That the temple should be rejected. _Jer._ vii, 12, 13, 14.
 
 That the sacrifices should be rejected, and other pure sacrifices
 established. _Malachi_ i, II.
 
 That the order of Aaron's priesthood should be rejected, and that of
 Melchizedek introduced by the Messiah. _Ps. Dixit Dominus._
 
 That this priesthood should be eternal. _Ibid._
 
 That Jerusalem should be rejected, and Rome admitted. _Ps. Dixit
 Dominus._
 
 That the name of the Jews should be rejected, and a new name given.
 _Isaiah_ lxv, 15.
 
 That this last name should be more excellent than that of the Jews, and
 eternal. _Isaiah_ lvi, 5.
 
 That the Jews should be without prophets (Amos), without a king, without
 princes, without sacrifice, without an idol.
 
 That the Jews should nevertheless always remain a people. _Jer._ xxxi,
 36.
 
 
 610
 
 _Republic._--The Christian republic--and even the Jewish--has only had
 God for ruler, as Philo the Jew notices, _On Monarchy_.
 
 When they fought, it was for God only; their chief hope was in God only;
 they considered their towns as belonging to God only, and kept them for
 God. 1 _Chron._ xix, 13.
 
 
 611
 
 _Gen._ xvii, 7. _Statuam pactum meum inter me et te foedere sempiterno
 ... ut sim Deus tuus ..._
 
 _Et tu ergo custodies pactum meum._
 
 
 612
 
 _Perpetuity._--That religion has always existed on earth, which consists
 in believing that man has fallen from a state of glory and of communion
 with God into a state of sorrow, penitence, and estrangement from God,
 but that after this life we shall be restored by a Messiah who should
 have come. All things have passed away, and this has endured, for which
 all things are.
 
 Men have in the first age of the world been carried away into every kind
 of debauchery, and yet there were saints, as Enoch, Lamech, and others,
 who waited patiently for the Christ promised from the beginning of the
 world. Noah saw the wickedness of men at its height; and he was held
 worthy to save the world in his person, by the hope of the Messiah of
 whom he was the type. Abraham was surrounded by idolaters, when God made
 known to him the mystery of the Messiah, whom he welcomed from
 afar.[219] In the time of Isaac and Jacob abomination was spread over
 all the earth; but these saints lived in faith; and Jacob, dying and
 blessing his children, cried in a transport which made him break off his
 discourse, "I await, O my God, the Saviour whom Thou hast promised.
 _Salutare taum expectabo, Domine._"[220] The Egyptians were infected
 both with idolatry and magic; the very people of God were led astray by
 their example. Yet Moses and others believed Him whom they saw not, and
 worshipped Him, looking to the eternal gifts which He was preparing for
 them.
 
 The Greeks and Latins then set up false deities; the poets made a
 hundred different theologies, while the philosophers separated into a
 thousand different sects; and yet in the heart of Judaea there were
 always chosen men who foretold the coming of this Messiah, which was
 known to them alone.
 
 He came at length in the fullness of time, and time has since witnessed
 the birth of so many schisms and heresies, so many political
 revolutions, so many changes in all things; yet this Church, which
 worships Him who has always been worshipped, has endured
 uninterruptedly. It is a wonderful, incomparable, and altogether divine
 fact that this religion, which has always endured, has always been
 attacked. It has been a thousand times on the eve of universal
 destruction, and every time it has been in that state, God has restored
 it by extraordinary acts of His power. This is astonishing, as also that
 it has preserved itself without yielding to the will of tyrants. For it
 is not strange that a State endures, when its laws are sometimes made
 to give way to necessity, but that.... (See the passage indicated in
 Montaigne.)
 
 
 613
 
 States would perish if they did not often make their laws give way to
 necessity. But religion has never suffered this, or practised it.
 Indeed, there must be these compromises, or miracles. It is not strange
 to be saved by yieldings, and this is not strictly self-preservation;
 besides, in the end they perish entirely. None has endured a thousand
 years. But the fact that this religion has always maintained itself,
 inflexible as it is, proves its divinity.
 
 
 614
 
 Whatever may be said, it must be admitted that the Christian religion
 has something astonishing in it. Some will say, "This is because you
 were born in it." Far from it; I stiffen myself against it for this very
 reason, for fear this prejudice bias me. But although I am born in it, I
 cannot help finding it so.
 
 
 615
 
 _Perpetuity._--The Messiah has always been believed in. The tradition
 from Adam was fresh in Noah and in Moses. Since then the prophets have
 foretold him, while at the same time foretelling other things, which,
 being from time to time fulfilled in the sight of men, showed the truth
 of their mission, and consequently that of their promises touching the
 Messiah. Jesus Christ performed miracles, and the Apostles also, who
 converted all the heathen; and all the prophecies being thereby
 fulfilled, the Messiah is for ever proved.
 
 
 616
 
 _Perpetuity._--Let us consider that since the beginning of the world the
 expectation of worship of the Messiah has existed uninterruptedly; that
 there have been found men, who said that God had revealed to them that a
 Redeemer was to be born, who should save His people; that Abraham came
 afterwards, saying that he had had a revelation that the Messiah was to
 spring from him by a son, whom he should have; that Jacob declared that,
 of his twelve sons, the Messiah would spring from Judah; that Moses and
 the prophets then came to declare the time and the manner of His coming;
 that they said their law was only temporary till that of the Messiah,
 that it should endure till then, but that the other should last for
 ever; that thus either their law, or that of the Messiah, of which it
 was the promise, would be always upon the earth; that, in fact, it has
 always endured; that at last Jesus Christ came with all the
 circumstances foretold. This is wonderful.
 
 
 617
 
 This is positive fact. While all philosophers separate into different
 sects, there is found in one corner of the world the most ancient people
 in it, declaring that all the world is in error, that God has revealed
 to them the truth, that they will always exist on the earth. In fact,
 all other sects come to an end, this one still endures, and has done so
 for four thousand years.
 
 They declare that they hold from their ancestors that man has fallen
 from communion with God, and is entirely estranged from God, but that He
 has promised to redeem them; that this doctrine shall always exist on
 the earth; that their law has a double signification; that during
 sixteen hundred years they have had people, whom they believed prophets,
 foretelling both the time and the manner; that four hundred years after
 they were scattered everywhere, because Jesus Christ was to be
 everywhere announced; that Jesus Christ came in the manner, and at the
 time foretold; that the Jews have since been scattered abroad under a
 curse, and nevertheless still exist.
 
 
 618
 
 I see the Christian religion founded upon a preceding religion, and this
 is what I find as a fact.
 
 I do not here speak of the miracles of Moses, of Jesus Christ, and of
 the Apostles, because they do not at first seem convincing, and because
 I only wish here to put in evidence all those foundations of the
 Christian religion which are beyond doubt, and which cannot be called in
 question by any person whatsoever. It is certain that we see in many
 places of the world a peculiar people, separated from all other peoples
 of the world, and called the Jewish people.
 
 I see then a crowd of religions in many parts of the world and in all
 times; but their morality cannot please me, nor can their proofs
 convince me. Thus I should equally have rejected the religion of Mahomet
 and of China, of the ancient Romans and of the Egyptians, for the sole
 reason, that none having more marks of truth than another, nor anything
 which should necessarily persuade me, reason cannot incline to one
 rather than the other.
 
 But, in thus considering this changeable and singular variety of morals
 and beliefs at different times, I find in one corner of the world a
 peculiar people, separated from all other peoples on earth, the most
 ancient of all, and whose histories are earlier by many generations than
 the most ancient which we possess.
 
 I find, then, this great and numerous people, sprung from a single man,
 who worship one God, and guide themselves by a law which they say that
 they obtained from His own hand. They maintain that they are the only
 people in the world to whom God has revealed His mysteries; that all men
 are corrupt and in disgrace with God; that they are all abandoned to
 their senses and their own imagination, whence come the strange errors
 and continual changes which happen among them, both of religions and of
 morals, whereas they themselves remain firm in their conduct; but that
 God will not leave other nations in this darkness for ever; that there
 will come a Saviour for all; that they are in the world to announce Him
 to men; that they are expressly formed to be forerunners and heralds of
 this great event, and to summon all nations to join with them in the
 expectation of this Saviour.
 
 To meet with this people is astonishing to me, and seems to me worthy of
 attention. I look at the law which they boast of having obtained from
 God, and I find it admirable. It is the first law of all, and is of such
 a kind that, even before the term _law_ was in currency among the
 Greeks, it had, for nearly a thousand years earlier, been
 uninterruptedly accepted and observed by the Jews. I likewise think it
 strange that the first law of the world happens to be the most perfect;
 so that the greatest legislators have borrowed their laws from it, as is
 apparent from the law of the Twelve Tables at Athens,[221] afterwards
 taken by the Romans, and as it would be easy to prove, if Josephus[222]
 and others had not sufficiently dealt with this subject.
 
 
 619
 
 _Advantages of the Jewish people._--In this search the Jewish people at
 once attracts my attention by the number of wonderful and singular facts
 which appear about them.
 
 I first see that they are a people wholly composed of brethren, and
 whereas all others are formed by the assemblage of an infinity of
 families, this, though so wonderfully fruitful, has all sprung from one
 man alone, and, being thus all one flesh, and members one of another,
 they constitute a powerful state of one family. This is unique.
 
 This family, or people, is the most ancient within human knowledge, a
 fact which seems to me to inspire a peculiar veneration for it,
 especially in view of our present inquiry; since if God had from all
 time revealed Himself to men, it is to these we must turn for knowledge
 of the tradition.
 
 This people is not eminent solely by their antiquity, but is also
 singular by their duration, which has always continued from their origin
 till now. For whereas the nations of Greece and of Italy, of Lacedaemon,
 of Athens and of Rome, and others who came long after, have long since
 perished, these ever remain, and in spite of the endeavours of many
 powerful kings who have a hundred times tried to destroy them, as their
 historians testify, and as it is easy to conjecture from the natural
 order of things during so long a space of years, they have nevertheless
 been preserved (and this preservation has been foretold); and extending
 from the earliest times to the latest, their history comprehends in its
 duration all our histories [which it preceded by a long time].
 
 The law by which this people is governed is at once the most ancient law
 in the world, the most perfect, and the only one which has been always
 observed without a break in a state. This is what Josephus admirably
 proves, _against Apion_,[223] and also Philo[224] the Jew, in different
 places, where they point out that it is so ancient that the very name of
 _law_ was only known by the oldest nation more than a thousand years
 afterwards; so that Homer, who has written the history of so many
 states, has never used the term. And it is easy to judge of its
 perfection by simply reading it; for we see that it has provided for all
 things with so great wisdom, equity, and judgment, that the most ancient
 legislators, Greek and Roman, having had some knowledge of it, have
 borrowed from it their principal laws; this is evident from what are
 called the Twelve Tables, and from the other proofs which Josephus
 gives.
 
 But this law is at the same time the severest and strictest of all in
 respect to their religious worship, imposing on this people, in order to
 keep them to their duty, a thousand peculiar and painful observances, on
 pain of death. Whence it is very astonishing that it has been
 constantly preserved during many centuries by a people, rebellious and
 impatient as this one was; while all other states have changed their
 laws from time to time, although these were far more lenient.
 
 The book which contains this law, the first of all, is itself the most
 ancient book in the world, those of Homer, Hesiod, and others, being six
 or seven hundred years later.

 The creation and the deluge being past, and God no longer requiring to
 destroy the world, nor to create it anew, nor to give such great signs
 of Himself, He began to establish a people on the earth, purposely
 formed, who were to last until the coming of the people whom the Messiah
 should fashion by His spirit.
 
 
 621
 
 The creation of the world beginning to be distant, God provided a single
 contemporary historian, and appointed a whole people as guardians of
 this book, in order that this history might be the most authentic in the
 world, and that all men might thereby learn a fact so necessary to know,
 and which could only be known through that means.

 Why should Moses make the lives of men so long, and their generations so
 few?
 
 Because it is not the length of years, but the multitude of generations,
 which renders things obscure. For truth is perverted only by the change
 of men. And yet he puts two things, the most memorable that were ever
 imagined, namely, the creation and the deluge, so near that we reach
 from one to the other.
 
 
 624
 
 Shem, who saw Lamech, who saw Adam, saw also Jacob, who saw those who
 saw Moses; therefore the deluge and the creation are true. This is
 conclusive among certain people who understand it rightly.
 
 
 625
 
 The longevity of the patriarchs, instead of causing the loss of past
 history, conduced, on the contrary, to its preservation. For the reason
 why we are sometimes insufficiently instructed in the history of our
 ancestors, is that we have never lived long with them, and that they are
 often dead before we have attained the age of reason. Now, when men
 lived so long, children lived long with their parents. They conversed
 long with them. But what else could be the subject of their talk save
 the history of their ancestors, since to that all history was reduced,
 and men did not study science or art, which now form a large part of
 daily conversation? We see also that in these days tribes took
 particular care to preserve their genealogies.

 I believe that Joshua was the first of God's people to have this name,
 as Jesus Christ was the last of God's people.
 
 
 627
 
 _Antiquity of the Jews._--What a difference there is between one book
 and another! I am not astonished that the Greeks made the Iliad, nor the
 Egyptians and the Chinese their histories.
 
 We have only to see how this originates. These fabulous historians are
 not contemporaneous with the facts about which they write. Homer
 composes a romance, which he gives out as such, and which is received as
 such; for nobody doubted that Troy and Agamemnon no more existed than
 did the golden apple. Accordingly he did not think of making a history,
 but solely a book to amuse; he is the only writer of his time; the
 beauty of the work has made it last, every one learns it and talks of
 it, it is necessary to know it, and each one knows it by heart. Four
 hundred years afterwards the witnesses of these facts are no longer
 alive, no one knows of his own knowledge if it be a fable or a history;
 one has only learnt it from his ancestors, and this can pass for truth.
 
 Every history which is not contemporaneous, as the books of the Sibyls
 and Trismegistus,[226] and so many others which have been believed by
 the world, are false, and found to be false in the course of time. It is
 not so with contemporaneous writers.
 
 There is a great difference between a book which an individual writes,
 and publishes to a nation, and a book which itself creates a nation. We
 cannot doubt that the book is as old as the people.

 Josephus hides the shame of his nation.
 
 Moses does not hide his own shame.

 _The sincerity of the Jews._--Maccabees,[228] after they had no more
 prophets; the Masorah, since Jesus Christ.
 
 This book will be a testimony for you.[229]
 
 Defective and final letters.
 
 Sincere against their honour, and dying for it; this has no example in
 the world, and no root in nature.
 
 
 630
 
 _Sincerity of the Jews._--They preserve lovingly and carefully the book
 in which Moses declares that they have been all their life ungrateful to
 God, and that he knows they will be still more so after his death; but
 that he calls heaven and earth to witness against them, and that he has
 [_taught_] them enough.
 
 He declares that God, being angry with them, shall at last scatter them
 among all the nations of the earth; that as they have offended Him by
 worshipping gods who were not their God, so He will provoke them by
 calling a people who are not His people; that He desires that all His
 words be preserved for ever, and that His book be placed in the Ark of
 the Covenant to serve for ever as a witness against them.
 
 Isaiah says the same thing, xxx.
 
 
 631
 
 _On Esdras._--The story that the books were burnt with the temple proved
 false by Maccabees: "Jeremiah gave them the law."
 
 The story that he recited the whole by heart. Josephus and Esdras point
 out _that he read the book_. Baronius, _Ann._, p. 180: _Nullus penitus
 Hebraeorum antiquorum reperitur qui tradiderit libros periisse et per
 Esdram esse restitutos, nisi in IV Esdrae._

 Josephus says that the Law was in Hebrew when it was translated by the
 Seventy.
 
 Under Antiochus and Vespasian, when they wanted to abolish the books,
 and when there was no prophet, they could not do so. And under the
 Babylonians, when no persecution had been made, and when there were so
 many prophets, would they have let them be burnt?
 
 Josephus laughs at the Greeks who would not bear ...
 
 Tertullian.[230]--_Perinde potuit abolefactam eam violentia cataclysmi
 in spiritu rursus reformare, quemadmodum et Hierosolymis Babylonia
 expugnatione deletis, omne instrumentum Judaicae literaturae per Esdram
 constat restauratum._
 
 He says that Noah could as easily have restored in spirit the book of
 Enoch, destroyed by the Deluge, as Esdras could have restored the
 Scriptures lost during the Captivity.
 
 +(Theos) hen te hepi Nabouchodonosor aichmalosia tou laou,
 diaphthareison ton graphon ... henepneuse Esdra to ierei hek tes phyles
 Leui tous ton progegonoton propheton pantas hanataxasthai logous, kai
 hapokatastesai to lao ten dia Moyseos nomothesian.+[231] He alleges this
 to prove that it is not incredible that the Seventy may have explained
 the holy Scriptures with that uniformity which we admire in them. And he
 took that from Saint Irenaeus.[232]
 
 Saint Hilary, in his preface to the Psalms, says that Esdras arranged
 the Psalms in order.
 
 The origin of this tradition comes from the 14th chapter of the fourth
 book of Esdras. _Deus glorificatus est, et Scripturae vere divinae creditae
 sunt, omnibus eandem et eisdem verbis et eisdem nominibus recitantibus
 ab initio usque ad finem, uti et praesentes gentes cognoscerent quoniam
 per inspirationem Dei interpretatae sunt Scripturae, et non esset mirabile
 Deum hoc in eis operatum: quando in ea captivitate populi quae facta est
 a Nabuchodonosor, corruptis scripturis et post 70 annos Judaeis
 descendentibus in regionem suam, et post deinde temporibus Artaxerxis
 Persarum regis, inspiravit Esdrae sacerdoti tribus Levi praeteritorum
 prophetarum omnes rememorare sermones, et restituere populo eam legem
 quae data est per Moysen._
 
 
 632
 
 _Against the story in Esdras, 2 Maccab._ ii;--Josephus, _Antiquities_,
 II, i--Cyrus took occasion from the prophecy of Isaiah to release the
 people. The Jews held their property in peace under Cyrus in Babylon;
 hence they could well have the Law.
 
 Josephus, in the whole history of Esdras, does not say one word about
 this restoration.--2 Kings xvii, 27.
 
 
 633
 
 If the story in Esdras[233] is credible, then it must be believed that
 the Scripture is Holy Scripture; for this story is based only on the
 authority of those who assert that of the Seventy, which shows that the
 Scripture is holy.
 
 Therefore if this account be true, we have what we want therein; if not,
 we have it elsewhere. And thus those who would ruin the truth of our
 religion, founded on Moses, establish it by the same authority by which
 they attack it. So by this providence it still exists.

 _Prophecies._--The sceptre was not interrupted by the captivity in
 Babylon, because the return was promised and foretold.
 
 
 637
 
 _Proofs of Jesus Christ._--Captivity, with the assurance of deliverance
 within seventy years, was not real captivity. But now they are captives
 without any hope.
 
 God has promised them that even though He should scatter them to the
 ends of the earth, nevertheless if they were faithful to His law, He
 would assemble them together again. They are very faithful to it, and
 remain oppressed.
 
 
 638
 
 When Nebuchadnezzar carried away the people, for fear they should
 believe that the sceptre had departed from Judah, they were told
 beforehand that they would be there for a short time, and that they
 would be restored. They were always consoled by the prophets; and their
 kings continued. But the second destruction is without promise of
 restoration, without prophets, without kings, without consolation,
 without hope, because the sceptre is taken away for ever.
 
 
 639
 
 It is a wonderful thing, and worthy of particular attention, to see this
 Jewish people existing so many years in perpetual misery, it being
 necessary as a proof of Jesus Christ, both that they should exist to
 prove Him, and that they should be miserable because they crucified Him;
 and though to be miserable and to exist are contradictory, they
 nevertheless still exist in spite of their misery.
 
 
 640
 
 They are visibly a people expressly created to serve as a witness to the
 Messiah (Isaiah, xliii, 9; xliv, 8). They keep the books, and love them,
 and do not understand them. And all this was foretold; that God's
 judgments are entrusted to them, but as a sealed book.
 
 
 
 
 SECTION X
 
 TYPOLOGY
 
 
 641
 
 _Proof of the two Testaments at once._--To prove the two at one stroke,
 we need only see if the prophecies in one are fulfilled in the other. To
 examine the prophecies, we must understand them. For if we believe they
 have only one meaning, it is certain that the Messiah has not come; but
 if they have two meanings, it is certain that He has come in Jesus
 Christ.
 
 The whole problem then is to know if they have two meanings.
 
 That the Scripture has two meanings, which Jesus Christ and the Apostles
 have given, is shown by the following proofs:
 
 1. Proof by Scripture itself.
 
 2. Proof by the Rabbis. Moses Maimonides says that it has two aspects,
 and that the prophets have prophesied Jesus Christ only.
 
 3. Proof by the Kabbala.[234]
 
 4. Proof by the mystical interpretation which the Rabbis themselves give
 to Scripture.
 
 5. Proof by the principles of the Rabbis, that there are two meanings;
 that there are two advents of the Messiah, a glorious and an humiliating
 one, according to their desert; that the prophets have prophesied of the
 Messiah only--the Law is not eternal, but must change at the coming of
 the Messiah--that then they shall no more remember the Red Sea; that the
 Jews and the Gentiles shall be mingled.
 
 [6. Proof by the key which Jesus Christ and the Apostles give us.]
 
 
 642
 
 Isaiah, li. The Red Sea an image of the Redemption. _Ut sciatis quod
 filius hominis habet potestatem remittendi peccata, tibi dico:
 Surge._[235] God, wishing to show that He could form a people holy with
 an invisible holiness, and fill them with an eternal glory, made visible
 things. As nature is an image of grace, He has done in the bounties of
 nature what He would do in those of grace, in order that we might judge
 that He could make the invisible, since He made the visible excellently.
 
 Therefore He saved this people from the deluge; He has raised them up
 from Abraham, redeemed them from their enemies, and set them at rest.
 
 The object of God was not to save them from the deluge, and raise up a
 whole people from Abraham, only in order to bring them into a rich land.
 
 And even grace is only the type of glory, for it is not the ultimate
 end. It has been symbolised by the law, and itself symbolises [_glory_].
 But it is the type of it, and the origin or cause.
 
 The ordinary life of men is like that of the saints. They all seek their
 satisfaction, and differ only in the object in which they place it; they
 call those their enemies who hinder them, etc. God has then shown the
 power which He has of giving invisible blessings, by that which He has
 shown Himself to have over things visible.
 
 
 643
 
 _Types._--God, wishing to form for Himself an holy people, whom He
 should separate from all other nations, whom He should deliver from
 their enemies, and should put into a place of rest, has promised to do
 so, and has foretold by His prophets the time and the manner of His
 coming. And yet, to confirm the hope of His elect, He has made them see
 in it an image through all time, without leaving them devoid of
 assurances of His power and of His will to save them. For, at the
 creation of man, Adam was the witness, and guardian of the promise of a
 Saviour, who should be born of woman, when men were still so near the
 creation that they could not have forgotten their creation and their
 fall. When those who had seen Adam were no longer in the world, God sent
 Noah whom He saved, and drowned the whole earth by a miracle which
 sufficiently indicated the power which He had to save the world, and the
 will which He had to do so, and to raise up from the seed of woman Him
 whom He had promised. This miracle was enough to confirm the hope of
 men.
 
 The memory of the deluge being so fresh among men, while Noah was still
 alive, God made promises to Abraham, and, while Shem was still living,
 sent Moses, etc....
 
 
 644
 
 _Types._--God, willing to deprive His own of perishable blessings,
 created the Jewish people in order to show that this was not owing to
 lack of power.
 
 
 645
 
 The Synagogue did not perish, because it was a type. But because it was
 only a type, it fell into servitude. The type existed till the truth
 came, in order that the Church should be always visible, either in the
 sign which promised it, or in substance.
 
 
 646
 
 That the law was figurative.
 
 
 647
 
 Two errors: 1. To take everything literally. 2. To take everything
 spiritually.
 
 
 648
 
 To speak against too greatly figurative language.
 
 
 649
 
 There are some types clear and demonstrative, but others which seem
 somewhat far-fetched, and which convince only those who are already
 persuaded. These are like the Apocalyptics. But the difference is that
 they have none which are certain, so that nothing is so unjust as to
 claim that theirs are as well founded as some of ours; for they have
 none so demonstrative as some of ours. The comparison is unfair. We must
 not put on the same level, and confound things, because they seem to
 agree in one point, while they are so different in another. The
 clearness in divine things requires us to revere the obscurities in
 them.
 
 [It is like men, who employ a certain obscure language among themselves.
 Those who should not understand it, would understand only a foolish
 meaning.]
 
 
 650
 
 _Extravagances of the Apocalyptics, Preadamites, Millenarians, etc._--He
 who would base extravagant opinions on Scripture, will, for example,
 base them on this. It is said that "this generation shall not pass till
 all these things be fulfilled."[236] Upon that I will say that after
 that generation will come another generation, and so on ever in
 succession.
 
 Solomon and the King are spoken of in the second book of Chronicles, as
 if they were two different persons. I will say that they were two.
 
 
 651
 
 _Particular Types._--A double law, double tables of the law, a double
 temple, a double captivity.
 
 
 652
 
 _Types._--The prophets prophesied by symbols of a girdle, a beard and
 burnt hair, etc.
 
 
 653
 
 Difference between dinner and supper.[237]
 
 In God the word does not differ from the intention, for He is true; nor
 the word from the effect, for He is powerful; nor the means from the
 effect, for He is wise. Bern., _Ult. Sermo in Missam_.
 
 Augustine, _De Civit. Dei_, v, 10. This rule is general. God can do
 everything, except those things, which if He could do, He would not be
 almighty, as dying, being deceived, lying, etc.
 
 Several Evangelists for the confirmation of the truth; their difference
 useful.
 
 The Eucharist after the Lord's Supper. Truth after the type.
 
 The ruin of Jerusalem, a type of the ruin of the world, forty years
 after the death of Jesus. "I know not," as a man, or as an ambassador
 (Mark xiii, 32). (Matthew xxiv, 36.)
 
 Jesus condemned by the Jews and the Gentiles.
 
 The Jews and the Gentiles typified by the two sons. Aug., _De Civ._, xx,
 29.
 
 
 654
 
 The six ages, the six Fathers of the six ages, the six wonders at the
 beginning of the six ages, the six mornings at the beginning of the six
 ages.[238]
 
 
 655
 
 Adam _forma futuri_.[239] The six days to form the one, the six ages to
 form the other. The six days, which Moses represents for the formation
 of Adam, are only the picture of the six ages to form Jesus Christ and
 the Church. If Adam had not sinned, and Jesus Christ had not come, there
 had been only one covenant, only one age of men, and the creation would
 have been represented as accomplished at one single time.
 
 
 656
 
 _Types._--The Jewish and Egyptian peoples were plainly foretold by the
 two individuals whom Moses met; the Egyptian beating the Jew, Moses
 avenging him and killing the Egyptian, and the Jew being ungrateful.
 
 
 657
 
 The symbols of the Gospel for the state of the sick soul are sick
 bodies; but because one body cannot be sick enough to express it well,
 several have been needed. Thus there are the deaf, the dumb, the blind,
 the paralytic, the dead Lazarus, the possessed. All this crowd is in the
 sick soul.
 
 
 658
 
 _Types._--To show that the Old Testament is only figurative, and that
 the prophets understood by temporal blessings other blessings, this is
 the proof:
 
 First, that this would be unworthy of God.
 
 Secondly, that their discourses express very clearly the promise of
 temporal blessings, and that they say nevertheless that their discourses
 are obscure, and that their meaning will not be understood. Whence it
 appears that this secret meaning was not that which they openly
 expressed, and that consequently they meant to speak of other
 sacrifices, of another deliverer, etc. They say that they will be
 understood only in the fullness of time (Jer. xxx, _ult._).
 
 The third proof is that their discourses are contradictory, and
 neutralise each other; so that if we think that they did not mean by the
 words "law" and "sacrifice" anything else than that of Moses, there is a
 plain and gross contradiction. Therefore they meant something else,
 sometimes contradicting themselves in the same chapter. Now, to
 understand the meaning of an author ...
 
 
 659
 
 Lust has become natural to us, and has made our second nature. Thus
 there are two natures in us--the one good, the other bad. Where is God?
 Where you are not, and the kingdom of God is within you. The Rabbis.
 
 
 660
 
 Penitence, alone of all these mysteries, has been manifestly declared to
 the Jews, and by Saint John, the Forerunner; and then the other
 mysteries; to indicate that in each man, as in the entire world, this
 order must be observed.
 
 
 661
 
 The carnal Jews understood neither the greatness nor the humiliation of
 the Messiah foretold in their prophecies. They misunderstood Him in His
 foretold greatness, as when He said that the Messiah should be lord of
 David, though his son, and that He was before Abraham, who had seen Him.
 They did not believe Him so great as to be eternal, and they likewise
 misunderstood Him in His humiliation and in His death. "The Messiah,"
 said they, "abideth for ever, and this man says that he shall die."[240]
 Therefore they believed Him neither mortal nor eternal; they only sought
 in Him for a carnal greatness.
 
 
 662
 
 _Typical._--Nothing is so like charity as covetousness, and nothing is
 so opposed to it. Thus the Jews, full of possessions which flattered
 their covetousness, were very like Christians, and very contrary. And by
 this means they had the two qualities which it was necessary they should
 have, to be very like the Messiah to typify Him, and very contrary not
 to be suspected witnesses.
 
 
 663
 
 _Typical._--God made use of the lust of the Jews to make them minister
 to Jesus Christ, [who brought the remedy for their lust].
 
 
 664
 
 Charity is not a figurative precept. It is dreadful to say that Jesus
 Christ, who came to take away types in order to establish the truth,
 came only to establish the type of charity, in order to take away the
 existing reality which was there before.
 
 "If the light be darkness, how great is that darkness!"[241]
 
 
 665
 
 Fascination. _Somnum suum.[242] Figura hujus mundi._[243]
 
 The Eucharist. _Comedes panem_ tuum.[244] _Panem_ nostrum.
 
 _Inimici Dei terram lingent._[245] Sinners lick the dust, that is to
 say, love earthly pleasures.
 
 The Old Testament contained the types of future joy, and the New
 contains the means of arriving at it. The types were of joy; the means
 of penitence; and nevertheless the Paschal Lamb was eaten with bitter
 herbs, _cum amaritudinibus_.[246]
 
 _Singularis sum ego donec transeam._[247]--Jesus Christ before His death
 was almost the only martyr.
 
 
 666
 
 _Typical._--The expressions, sword, shield. _Potentissime._
 
 
 667
 
 We are estranged, only by departing from charity. Our prayers and our
 virtues are abominable before God, if they are not the prayers and the
 virtues of Jesus Christ. And our sins will never be the object of
 [_mercy_], but of the justice of God, if they are not [_those of_] Jesus
 Christ. He has adopted our sins, and has [_admitted_] us into union
 [_with Him_], for virtues are [_His own, and_] sins are foreign to Him;
 while virtues _[are]_ foreign to us, and our sins are our own.
 
 Let us change the rule which we have hitherto chosen for judging what is
 good. We had our own will as our rule. Let us now take the will of
 [_God_]; all that He wills is good and right to us, all that He does not
 will is [_bad_].
 
 All that God does not permit is forbidden. Sins are forbidden by the
 general declaration that God has made, that He did not allow them. Other
 things which He has left without general prohibition, and which for that
 reason are said to be permitted, are nevertheless not always permitted.
 For when God removed some one of them from us, and when, by the event,
 which is a manifestation of the will of God, it appears that God does
 not will that we should have a thing, that is then forbidden to us as
 sin; since the will of God is that we should not have one more than
 another. There is this sole difference between these two things, that it
 is certain that God will never allow sin, while it is not certain that
 He will never allow the other. But so long as God does not permit it, we
 ought to regard it as sin; so long as the absence of God's will, which
 alone is all goodness and all justice, renders it unjust and wrong.
 
 
 668
 
 To change the type, because of our weakness.
 
 
 669
 
 _Types._--The Jews had grown old in these earthly thoughts, that God
 loved their father Abraham, his flesh and what sprung from it; that on
 account of this He had multiplied them, and distinguished them from all
 other nations, without allowing them to intermingle; that when they were
 languishing in Egypt, He brought them out with all these great signs in
 their favour; that He fed them with manna in the desert, and led them
 into a very rich land; that He gave them kings and a well-built temple,
 in order to offer up beasts before Him, by the shedding of whose blood
 they should be purified; and that at last He was to send them the
 Messiah to make them masters of all the world, and foretold the time of
 His coming.
 
 The world having grown old in these carnal errors, Jesus Christ came at
 the time foretold, but not with the expected glory; and thus men did not
 think it was He. After His death, Saint Paul[248] came to teach men that
 all these things had happened in allegory; that the kingdom of God did
 not consist in the flesh, but in the spirit; that the enemies of men
 were not the Babylonians, but the passions; that God delighted not in
 temples made with hands, but in a pure and contrite heart; that the
 circumcision of the body was unprofitable, but that of the heart was
 needed; that Moses had not given them the bread from heaven, etc.[249]
 
 But God, not having desired to reveal these things to this people who
 were unworthy of them, and having nevertheless desired to foretell them,
 in order that they might be believed, foretold the time clearly, and
 expressed the things sometimes clearly, but very often in figures, in
 order that those who loved symbols might consider them, and those who
 loved what was symbolised might see it therein.
 
 All that tends not to charity is figurative.
 
 The sole aim of the Scripture is charity.
 
 All which tends not to the sole end is the type of it. For since there
 is only one end, all which does not lead to it in express terms is
 figurative.
 
 God thus varies that sole precept of charity to satisfy our curiosity,
 which seeks for variety, by that variety which still leads us to the one
 thing needful. For one thing alone is needful,[250] and we love variety;
 and God satisfies both by these varieties, which lead to the one thing
 needful.
 
 The Jews have so much loved the shadows, and have so strictly expected
 them, that they have misunderstood the reality, when it came in the time
 and manner foretold.
 
 The Rabbis take the breasts of the Spouse[251] for types, and all that
 does not express the only end they have, namely, temporal good.
 
 And Christians take even the Eucharist as a type of the glory at which
 they aim.
 
 
 670
 
 The Jews, who have been called to subdue nations and kings, have been
 the slaves of sin; and the Christians, whose calling has been to be
 servants and subjects, are free children.[252]
 
 
 671
 
 _A formal point._--When Saint Peter and the Apostles deliberated about
 abolishing circumcision, where it was a question of acting against the
 law of God, they did not heed the prophets, but simply the reception of
 the Holy Spirit in the persons uncircumcised.[253]
 
 They thought it more certain that God approved of those whom He filled
 with His Spirit, than it was that the law must be obeyed. They knew that
 the end of the law was only the Holy Spirit; and that thus, as men
 certainly had this without circumcision, it was not necessary.
 
 
 672
 
 _Fac secundum exemplar quod tibi ostensum est in monte._[254]--The
 Jewish religion then has been formed on its likeness to the truth of the
 Messiah; and the truth of the Messiah has been recognised by the Jewish
 religion, which was the type of it.
 
 Among the Jews the truth was only typified; in heaven it is revealed.
 
 In the Church it is hidden, and recognised by its resemblance to the
 type.
 
 The type has been made according to the truth, and the truth has been
 recognised according to the type.
 
 Saint Paul[255] says himself that people will forbid to marry, and he
 himself speaks of it to the Corinthians in a way which is a snare. For
 if a prophet had said the one, and Saint Paul had then said the other,
 he would have been accused.
 
 
 673
 
 _Typical._--"Do all things according to the pattern which has been shown
 thee on the mount." On which Saint Paul says that the Jews have shadowed
 forth heavenly things.[256]
 
 
 674
 
 ... And yet this Covenant, made to blind some and enlighten others,
 indicated in those very persons, whom it blinded, the truth which should
 be recognised by others. For the visible blessings which they received
 from God were so great and so divine, that He indeed appeared able to
 give them those that are invisible, and a Messiah.
 
 For nature is an image of Grace, and visible miracles are images of the
 invisible. _Ut sciatis ... tibi dico: Surge._
 
 Isaiah says that Redemption will be as the passage of the Red Sea.
 
 God has then shown by the deliverance from Egypt, and from the sea, by
 the defeat of kings, by the manna, by the whole genealogy of Abraham,
 that He was able to save, to send down bread from heaven, etc.; so that
 the people hostile to Him are the type and the representation of the
 very Messiah whom they know not, etc.
 
 He has then taught us at last that all these things were only types, and
 what is "true freedom," a "true Israelite," "true circumcision," "true
 bread from heaven," etc.
 
 In these promises each one finds what he has most at heart, temporal
 benefits or spiritual, God or the creatures; but with this difference,
 that those who therein seek the creatures find them, but with many
 contradictions, with a prohibition against loving them, with the command
 to worship God only, and to love Him only, which is the same thing, and,
 finally, that the Messiah came not for them; whereas those who therein
 seek God find Him, without any contradiction, with the command to love
 Him only, and that the Messiah came in the time foretold, to give them
 the blessings which they ask.
 
 Thus the Jews had miracles and prophecies, which they say fulfilled and
 the teaching of their law was to worship and love God only; it was also
 perpetual. Thus it had all the marks of the true religion; and so it
 was. But the Jewish teaching must be distinguished from the teaching of
 the Jewish law. Now the Jewish teaching was not true, although it had
 miracles and prophecy and perpetuity, because it had not this other
 point of worshipping and loving God only.
 
 
 675
 
 The veil, which is upon these books for the Jews, is there also for evil
 Christians, and for all who do not hate themselves.
 
 But how well disposed men are to understand them and to know Jesus
 Christ, when they truly hate themselves!
 
 
 676
 
 A type conveys absence and presence, pleasure and pain.
 
 A cipher has a double meaning, one clear, and one in which it is said
 that the meaning is hidden.
 
 
 677
 
 _Types._--A portrait conveys absence and presence, pleasure and pain.
 The reality excludes absence and pain.
 
 To know if the law and the sacrifices are a reality or a type, we must
 see if the prophets, in speaking of these things, confined their view
 and their thought to them, so that they saw only the old covenant; or if
 they saw therein something else of which they were the representation,
 for in a portrait we see the thing figured. For this we need only
 examine what they say of them.
 
 When they say that it will be eternal, do they mean to speak of that
 covenant which they say will be changed; and so of the sacrifices, etc.?
 
 A cipher has two meanings. When we find out an important letter in which
 we discover a clear meaning, and in which it is nevertheless said that
 the meaning is veiled and obscure, that it is hidden, so that we might
 read the letter without seeing it, and interpret it without
 understanding it, what must we think but that here is a cipher with a
 double meaning, and the more so if we find obvious contradictions in the
 literal meaning? The prophets have clearly said that Israel would be
 always loved by God, and that the law would be eternal; and they have
 said that their meaning would not be understood, and that it was veiled.
 
 How greatly then ought we to value those who interpret the cipher, and
 teach us to understand the hidden meaning, especially if the principles
 which they educe are perfectly clear and natural! This is what Jesus
 Christ did, and the Apostles. They broke the seal; He rent the veil, and
 revealed the spirit. They have taught us through this that the enemies
 of man are his passions; that the Redeemer would be spiritual, and His
 reign spiritual; that there would be two advents, one in lowliness to
 humble the proud, the other in glory to exalt the humble; that Jesus
 Christ would be both God and man.
 
 
 678
 
 _Types._--Jesus Christ opened their mind to understand the Scriptures.
 
 Two great revelations are these. (1) All things happened to them in
 types: _vere Israelitae, vere liberi_, true bread from Heaven. (2) A God
 humbled to the Cross. It was necessary that Christ should suffer in
 order to enter into glory, "that He should destroy death through
 death."[257] Two advents.
 
 
 679
 
 _Types._--When once this secret is disclosed, it is impossible not to
 see it. Let us read the Old Testament in this light, and let us see if
 the sacrifices were real; if the fatherhood of Abraham was the true
 cause of the friendship of God; and if the promised land was the true
 place of rest. No. They are therefore types. Let us in the same way
 examine all those ordained ceremonies, all those commandments which are
 not of charity, and we shall see that they are types.
 
 All these sacrifices and ceremonies were then either types or nonsense.
 Now these are things too clear, and too lofty, to be thought nonsense.
 
 To know if the prophets confined their view in the Old Testament, or saw
 therein other things.
 
 
 680
 
 _Typical._--The key of the cipher. _Veri adoratores._[258]--_Ecce agnus
 Dei qui tollit peccata mundi_.[259]
 
 
 681
 
 Is. i, 21. Change of good into evil, and the vengeance of God. Is. x, I;
 xxvi, 20; xxviii, I. Miracles: Is. xxxiii, 9; xl, 17; xli, 26; xliii,
 13.
 
 Jer. xi, 21; xv, 12; xvii, 9. _Pravum est cor omnium et incrustabile;
 quis cognoscet illud?_ that is to say, Who can know all its evil? For it
 is already known to be wicked. _Ego dominus_, etc.--vii, 14, _Faciam
 domui huic_, etc. Trust in external sacrifices--vii, 22, _Quia non sum
 locutus_, etc. Outward sacrifice is not the essential point--xi, 13,
 _Secundum numerum_, etc. A multitude of doctrines.
 
 Is. xliv, 20-24; liv, 8; lxiii, 12-17; lxvi, 17. Jer. ii, 35; iv, 22-24;
 v, 4, 29-31; vi, 16; xxiii, 15-17.
 
 
 682
 
 _Types_,--The letter kills. All happened in types. Here is the cipher
 which Saint Paul gives us. Christ must suffer. An humiliated God.
 Circumcision of the heart, true fasting, true sacrifice, a true temple.
 The prophets have shown that all these must be spiritual.
 
 Not the meat which perishes, but that which does not perish.
 
 "Ye shall be free indeed."[260] Then the other freedom was only a type
 of freedom.
 
 "I am the true bread from Heaven."[261]
 
 
 683
 
 _Contradiction._--We can only describe a good character by reconciling
 all contrary qualities, and it is not enough to keep up a series of
 harmonious qualities, without reconciling contradictory ones. To
 understand the meaning of an author, we must make all the contrary
 passages agree.
 
 Thus, to understand Scripture, we must have a meaning in which all the
 contrary passages are reconciled. It is not enough to have one which
 suits many concurring passages; but it is necessary to have one which
 reconciles even contradictory passages.
 
 Every author has a meaning in which all the contradictory passages
 agree, or he has no meaning at all. We cannot affirm the latter of
 Scripture and the prophets; they undoubtedly are full of good sense. We
 must then seek for a meaning which reconciles all discrepancies.
 
 The true meaning then is not that of the Jews; but in Jesus Christ all
 the contradictions are reconciled.
 
 The Jews could not reconcile the cessation of the royalty and
 principality, foretold by Hosea, with the prophecy of Jacob.
 
 If we take the law, the sacrifices, and the kingdom as realities, we
 cannot reconcile all the passages. They must then necessarily be only
 types. We cannot even reconcile the passages of the same author, nor of
 the same book, nor sometimes of the same chapter, which indicates
 copiously what was the meaning of the author. As when Ezekiel, chap, xx,
 says that man will not live by the commandments of God and will live by
 them.
 
 
 684
 
 _Types._--If the law and the sacrifices are the truth, it must please
 God, and must not displease Him. If they are types, they must be both
 pleasing and displeasing.
 
 Now in all the Scripture they are both pleasing and displeasing. It is
 said that the law shall be changed; that the sacrifice shall be changed;
 that they shall be without law, without a prince, and without a
 sacrifice; that a new covenant shall be made; that the law shall be
 renewed; that the precepts which they have received are not good; that
 their sacrifices are abominable; that God has demanded none of them.
 
 It is said, on the contrary, that the law shall abide for ever; that
 this covenant shall be for ever; that sacrifice shall be eternal; that
 the sceptre shall never depart from among them, because it shall not
 depart from them till the eternal King comes.
 
 Do all these passages indicate what is real? No. Do they then indicate
 what is typical? No, but what is either real or typical. But the first
 passages, excluding as they do reality, indicate that all this is only
 typical.
 
 All these passages together cannot be applied to reality; all can be
 said to be typical; therefore they are not spoken of reality, but of the
 type.
 
 _Agnus occisus est ab origine mundi._[262] A sacrificing judge.
 
 
 685
 
 _Contradictions._--The sceptre till the Messiah--without king or prince.
 
 The eternal law--changed.
 
 The eternal covenant--a new covenant.
 
 Good laws--bad precepts. Ezekiel.
 
 
 686
 
 _Types._--When the word of God, which is really true, is false
 literally, it is true spiritually. _Sede a dextris meis:_[263] this is
 false literally, therefore it is true spiritually.
 
 In these expressions, God is spoken of after the manner of men; and
 this means nothing else but that the intention which men have in giving
 a seat at their right hand, God will have also. It is then an indication
 of the intention of God, not of His manner of carrying it out.
 
 Thus when it is said, "God has received the odour of your incense, and
 will in recompense give you a rich land," that is equivalent to saying
 that the same intention which a man would have, who, pleased with your
 perfumes, should in recompense give you a rich land, God will have
 towards you, because you have had the same intention as a man has
 towards him to whom he presents perfumes. So _iratus est_, a "jealous
 God,"[264] etc. For, the things of God being inexpressible, they cannot
 be spoken of otherwise, and the Church makes use of them even to-day:
 _Quia confortavil seras_,[265] etc.
 
 It is not allowable to attribute to Scripture the meaning which is not
 revealed to us that it has. Thus, to say that the closed _mem_[266] of
 Isaiah signifies six hundred, has not been revealed. It might be said
 that the final _tsade_ and _he deficientes_ may signify mysteries. But
 it is not allowable to say so, and still less to say this is the way of
 the philosopher's stone. But we say that the literal meaning is not the
 true meaning, because the prophets have themselves said so.
 
 
 687
 
 I do not say that the _mem_ is mystical.
 
 
 688
 
 Moses (Deut. xxx) promises that God will circumcise their heart to
 render them capable of loving Him.
 
 
 689
 
 One saying of David, or of Moses, as for instance that "God will
 circumcise the heart," enables us to judge of their spirit. If all their
 other expressions were ambiguous, and left us in doubt whether they were
 philosophers or Christians, one saying of this kind would in fact
 determine all the rest, as one sentence of Epictetus decides the meaning
 of all the rest to be the opposite. So far ambiguity exists, but not
 afterwards.
 
 
 690
 
 If one of two persons, who are telling silly stories, uses language with
 a double meaning, understood in his own circle, while the other uses it
 with only one meaning, any one not in the secret, who hears them both
 talk in this manner, will pass upon them the same judgment. But if
 afterwards, in the rest of their conversation one says angelic things,
 and the other always dull commonplaces, he will judge that the one spoke
 in mysteries, and not the other; the one having sufficiently shown that
 he is incapable of such foolishness, and capable of being mysterious;
 and the other that he is incapable of mystery, and capable of
 foolishness.
 
 The Old Testament is a cipher.
 
 
 691
 
 There are some that see clearly that man has no other enemy than lust,
 which turns him from God, and not God; and that he has no other good
 than God, and not a rich land. Let those who believe that the good of
 man is in the flesh, and evil in what turns him away from sensual
 pleasures, [_satiate_] themselves with them, and [_die_] in them. But
 let those who seek God with all their heart, who are only troubled at
 not seeing Him, who desire only to possess Him, and have as enemies only
 those who turn them away from Him, who are grieved at seeing themselves
 surrounded and overwhelmed with such enemies, take comfort. I proclaim
 to them happy news. There exists a Redeemer for them. I shall show Him
 to them. I shall show that there is a God for them. I shall not show Him
 to others. I shall make them see that a Messiah has been promised, who
 should deliver them from their enemies, and that One has come to free
 them from their iniquities, but not from their enemies.
 
 When David foretold that the Messiah would deliver His people from their
 enemies, one can believe that in the flesh these would be the Egyptians;
 and then I cannot show that the prophecy was fulfilled. But one can well
 believe also that the enemies would be their sins; for indeed the
 Egyptians were not their enemies, but their sins were so. This word,
 enemies, is therefore ambiguous. But if he says elsewhere, as he does,
 that He will deliver His people from their sins, as indeed do Isaiah and
 others, the ambiguity is removed, and the double meaning of enemies is
 reduced to the simple meaning of iniquities. For if he had sins in his
 mind, he could well denote them as enemies; but if he thought of
 enemies, he could not designate them as iniquities.
 
 Now Moses, David, and Isaiah used the same terms. Who will say then that
 they have not the same meaning, and that David's meaning, which is
 plainly iniquities when he spoke of enemies, was not the same as [_that
 of_] Moses when speaking of enemies?
 
 Daniel (ix) prays for the deliverance of the people from the captivity
 of their enemies. But he was thinking of sins, and, to show this, he
 says that Gabriel came to tell him that his prayer was heard, and that
 there were only seventy weeks to wait, after which the people would be
 freed from iniquity, sin would have an end, and the Redeemer, the Holy
 of Holies, would bring _eternal_ justice, not legal, but eternal.
 
 
 
 
 SECTION XI
 
 THE PROPHECIES
 
 
 692
 
 When I see the blindness and the wretchedness of man, when I regard the
 whole silent universe, and man without light, left to himself, and, as
 it were, lost in this corner of the universe, without knowing who has
 put him there, what he has come to do, what will become of him at death,
 and incapable of all knowledge, I become terrified, like a man who
 should be carried in his sleep to a dreadful desert island, and should
 awake without knowing where he is, and without means of escape. And
 thereupon I wonder how people in a condition so wretched do not fall
 into despair. I see other persons around me of a like nature. I ask them
 if they are better informed than I am. They tell me that they are not.
 And thereupon these wretched and lost beings, having looked around them,
 and seen some pleasing objects, have given and attached themselves to
 them. For my own part, I have not been able to attach myself to them,
 and, considering how strongly it appears that there is something else
 than what I see, I have examined whether this God has not left some sign
 of Himself.
 
 I see many contradictory religions, and consequently all false save one.
 Each wants to be believed on its own authority, and threatens
 unbelievers. I do not therefore believe them. Every one can say this;
 every one can call himself a prophet. But I see that Christian religion
 wherein prophecies are fulfilled; and that is what every one cannot do.
 
 
 693
 
 And what crowns all this is prediction, so that it should not be said
 that it is chance which has done it.
 
 Whosoever, having only a week to live, will not find out that it is
 expedient to believe that all this is not a stroke of chance ...
 
 Now, if the passions had no hold on us, a week and a hundred years would
 amount to the same thing.
 
 
 694
 
 _Prophecies._--Great Pan is dead.[267]
 
 
 695
 
 _Susceperunt verbum cum omni aviditate, scrutantes Scripturas, si ita se
 haberent._[268]
 
 
 696
 
 _Prodita lege._--_Impleta cerne._--_Implenda collige._
 
 
 697
 
 We understand the prophecies only when we see the events happen. Thus
 the proofs of retreat, discretion, silence, etc. are proofs only to
 those who know and believe them.
 
 Joseph so internal in a law so external.
 
 Outward penances dispose to inward, as humiliations to humility. Thus
 the ...
 
 
 698
 
 The synagogue has preceded the church; the Jews, the Christians. The
 prophets have foretold the Christians; Saint John, Jesus Christ.
 
 
 699
 
 It is glorious to see with the eyes of faith the history of Herod and of
 Caesar.
 
 
 700
 
 The zeal of the Jews for their law and their temple (Josephus, and Philo
 the Jew, _Ad Caium_). What other people had such a zeal? It was
 necessary they should have it.
 
 Jesus Christ foretold as to the time and the state of the world. The
 ruler taken from the thigh,[269] and the fourth monarchy. How lucky we
 are to see this light amidst this darkness!
 
 How fine it is to see, with the eyes of faith, Darius and Cyrus,
 Alexander, the Romans, Pompey and Herod working, without knowing it, for
 the glory of the Gospel!
 
 
 701
 
 Zeal of the Jewish people for the law, especially after there were no
 more prophets.
 
 
 702
 
 While the prophets were for maintaining the law, the people were
 indifferent. But since there have been no more prophets, zeal has
 succeeded them.
 
 
 703
 
 The devil troubled the zeal of the Jews before Jesus Christ, because he
 would have been their salvation, but not since.
 
 The Jewish people scorned by the Gentiles; the Christian people
 persecuted.
 
 
 704
 
 _Proof._--Prophecies with their fulfilment; what has preceded and what
 has followed Jesus Christ.
 
 
 705
 
 The prophecies are the strongest proof of Jesus Christ. It is for them
 also that God has made most provision; for the event which has fulfilled
 them is a miracle existing since the birth of the Church to the end. So
 God has raised up prophets during sixteen hundred years, and, during
 four hundred years afterwards, He has scattered all these prophecies
 among all the Jews, who carried them into all parts of the world. Such
 was the preparation for the birth of Jesus Christ, and, as His Gospel
 was to be believed by all the world, it was not only necessary that
 there should be prophecies to make it believed, but that these
 prophecies should exist throughout the whole world, in order to make it
 embraced by the whole world.
 
 
 706
 
 But it was not enough that the prophecies should exist. It was necessary
 that they should be distributed throughout all places, and preserved
 throughout all times. And in order that this agreement might not be
 taken for an effect of chance, it was necessary that this should be
 foretold.
 
 It is far more glorious for the Messiah that the Jews should be the
 spectators, and even the instruments of His glory, besides that God had
 reserved them.
 
 
 707
 
 _Prophecies._--The time foretold by the state of the Jewish people, by
 the state of the heathen, by the state of the temple, by the number of
 years.
 
 
 708
 
 One must be bold to predict the same thing in so many ways. It was
 necessary that the four idolatrous or pagan monarchies, the end of the
 kingdom of Judah, and the seventy weeks, should happen at the same time,
 and all this before the second temple was destroyed.
 
 
 709
 
 _Prophecies._--If one man alone had made a book of predictions about
 Jesus Christ, as to the time and the manner, and Jesus Christ had come
 in conformity to these prophecies, this fact would have infinite weight.
 
 But there is much more here. Here is a succession of men during four
 thousand years, who, consequently and without variation, come, one after
 another, to foretell this same event. Here is a whole people who
 announce it, and who have existed for four thousand years, in order to
 give corporate testimony of the assurances which they have, and from
 which they cannot be diverted by whatever threats and persecutions
 people may make against them. This is far more important.
 
 
 710
 
 _Predictions of particular things._--They were strangers in Egypt,
 without any private property, either in that country or elsewhere.
 [There was not the least appearance, either of the royalty which had
 previously existed so long, or of that supreme council of seventy judges
 which they called the _Sanhedrin_, and which, having been instituted by
 Moses, lasted to the time of Jesus Christ. All these things were as far
 removed from their state at that time as they could be], when Jacob,
 dying, and blessing his twelve children, declared to them, that they
 would be proprietors of a great land, and foretold in particular to the
 family of Judah, that the kings, who would one day rule them, should be
 of his race; and that all his brethren should be their subjects; [and
 that even the Messiah, who was to be the expectation of nations, should
 spring from him; and that the kingship should not be taken away from
 Judah, nor the ruler and law-giver of his descendants, till the expected
 Messiah should arrive in his family].
 
 This same Jacob, disposing of this future land as though he had been its
 ruler, gave a portion to Joseph more than to the others. "I give you,"
 said he, "one part more than to your brothers." And blessing his two
 children, Ephraim and Manasseh, whom Joseph had presented to him, the
 elder, Manasseh, on his right, and the young Ephraim on his left, he put
 his arms crosswise, and placing his right hand on the head of Ephraim,
 and his left on Manasseh, he blessed them in this manner. And, upon
 Joseph's representing to him that he was preferring the younger, he
 replied to him with admirable resolution: "I know it well, my son; but
 Ephraim will increase more than Manasseh." This has been indeed so true
 in the result, that, being alone almost as fruitful as the two entire
 lines which composed a whole kingdom, they have been usually called by
 the name of Ephraim alone.
 
 This same Joseph, when dying, bade his children carry his bones with
 them when they should go into that land, to which they only came two
 hundred years afterwards.
 
 Moses, who wrote all these things so long before they happened, himself
 assigned to each family portions of that land before they entered it, as
 though he had been its ruler. [In fact he declared that God was to raise
 up from their nation and their race a prophet, of whom he was the type;
 and he foretold them exactly all that was to happen to them in the land
 which they were to enter after his death, the victories which God would
 give them, their ingratitude towards God, the punishments which they
 would receive for it, and the rest of their adventures.] He gave them
 judges who should make the division. He prescribed the entire form of
 political government which they should observe, the cities of refuge
 which they should build, and ...
 
 
 711
 
 The prophecies about particular things are mingled with those about the
 Messiah, so that the prophecies of the Messiah should not be without
 proofs, nor the special prophecies without fruit.
 
 
 712
 
 _Perpetual captivity of the Jews._--Jer. xi, 11: "I will bring evil upon
 Judah from which they shall not be able to escape."
 
 _Types._--Is. v: "The Lord had a vineyard, from which He looked for
 grapes; and it brought forth only wild grapes. I will therefore lay it
 waste, and destroy it; the earth shall only bring forth thorns, and I
 will forbid the clouds from _[raining]_ upon it. The vineyard of the
 Lord is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah His pleasant plant. I
 looked that they should do justice, and they bring forth only
 iniquities."
 
 Is. viii: "Sanctify the Lord with fear and trembling; let Him be your
 only dread, and He shall be to you for a sanctuary, but for a stone of
 stumbling and a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin
 and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and many among them
 shall stumble against that stone, and fall, and be broken, and be
 snared, and perish. Hide my words, and cover my law for my disciples.
 
 "I will then wait in patience upon the Lord that hideth and concealeth
 Himself from the house of Jacob."
 
 Is. xxix: "Be amazed and wonder, people of Israel; stagger and stumble,
 and be drunken, but not with wine; stagger, but not with strong drink.
 For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep. He will
 close your eyes; He will cover your princes and your prophets that have
 visions." (Daniel xii: "The wicked shall not understand, but the wise
 shall understand." Hosea, the last chapter, the last verse, after many
 temporal blessings, says: "Who is wise, and he shall understand these
 things, etc.?") "And the visions of all the prophets are become unto you
 as a sealed book, which men deliver to one that is learned, and who can
 read; and he saith, I cannot read it, for it is sealed. And when the
 book is delivered to them that are not learned, they say I am not
 learned.
 
 "Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people with their lips do
 honour me, but have removed their heart far from me,"--there is the
 reason and the cause of it; for if they adored God in their hearts, they
 would understand the prophecies,--"and their fear towards me is taught
 by the precept of man. Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a
 marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder;
 for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and their understanding
 shall be [hid]."
 
 _Prophecies. Proofs of Divinity._--Is. xli: "Shew the things that are to
 come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: we will incline our
 heart unto your words. Teach us the things that have been at the
 beginning, and declare us things for to come.
 
 "By this we shall know that ye are gods. Yea, do good or do evil, if you
 can. Let us then behold it and reason together. Behold, ye are of
 nothing, and only an abomination, etc. Who," (among contemporary
 writers), "hath declared from the beginning that we may know of the
 things done from the beginning and origin? that we may say, You are
 righteous. There is none that teacheth us, yea, there is none that
 declareth the future."
 
 Is. xlii: "I am the Lord, and my glory will I not give to another. I
 have foretold the things which have come to pass, and things that are to
 come do I declare. Sing unto God a new song in all the earth.
 
 "Bring forth the blind people that have eyes and see not, and the deaf
 that have ears and hear not. Let all the nations be gathered together.
 Who among them can declare this, and shew us former things, and things
 to come? Let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be
 justified; or let them hear, and say, It is truth.
 
 "Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen;
 that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am He.
 
 "I have declared, and have saved, and I alone have done wonders before
 your eyes: ye are my witnesses, said the Lord, that I am God.
 
 "For your sake I have brought down the forces of the Babylonians. I am
 the Lord, your Holy One and creator.
 
 "I have made a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters. I am He
 that drowned and destroyed for ever the mighty enemies that have
 resisted you.
 
 "Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.
 
 "Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not
 know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the
 desert.
 
 "This people have I formed for myself; I have established them to shew
 forth my praise, etc.
 
 "I, even I, am He that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own
 sake, and will not remember thy sins. Put in remembrance your
 ingratitude: see thou, if thou mayest be justified. Thy first father
 hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me."
 
 Is. xliv: "I am the first, and I am the last, saith the Lord. Let him
 who will equal himself to me, declare the order of things since I
 appointed the ancient people, and the things that are coming. Fear ye
 not: have I not told you all these things? Ye are my witnesses."
 
 _Prophecy of Cyrus._--Is. xlv, 4: "For Jacob's sake, mine elect, I have
 called thee by thy name."
 
 Is. xlv, 21: "Come and let us reason together. Who hath declared this
 from ancient time? Who hath told it from that time? Have not I, the
 Lord?"
 
 Is. xlvi: "Remember the former things of old, and know there is none
 like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times
 the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I
 will do all my pleasure."
 
 Is. xlii: "Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do
 I declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them."
 
 Is. xlviii, 3: "I have declared the former things from the beginning; I
 did them suddenly; and they came to pass. Because I know that thou art
 obstinate, that thy spirit is rebellious, and thy brow brass; I have
 even declared it to thee before it came to pass: lest thou shouldst say
 that it was the work of thy gods, and the effect of their commands.
 
 "Thou hast seen all this; and will not ye declare it? I have shewed thee
 new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know
 them. They are created now, and not from the beginning; I have kept them
 hidden from thee; lest thou shouldst say, Behold, I knew them.
 
 "Yea, thou knewest not; yea, thou heardest not; yea, from that time that
 thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou couldst deal very
 treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb."
 
 _Reprobation of the Jews and conversion of the Gentiles._--Is. lxv: "I
 am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought
 me not; I said, Behold me, behold me, behold me, unto a nation that did
 not call upon my name.
 
 "I have spread out my hands all the day unto an unbelieving people,
 which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts; a
 people that provoketh me to anger continually by the sins they commit in
 my face; that sacrificeth to idols, etc.
 
 "These shall be scattered like smoke in the day of my wrath, etc.
 
 "Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers, will I assemble
 together, and will recompense you for all according to your works.
 
 "Thus saith the Lord, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one
 saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it [and the promise of
 fruit]: for my servants' sake I will not destroy all Israel.
 
 "Thus I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob and out of Judah, an
 inheritor of my mountains, and mine elect and my servants shall inherit
 it, and my fertile and abundant plains; but I will destroy all others,
 because you have forgotten your God to serve strange gods. I called, and
 ye did not answer; I spake, and ye did not hear; and ye did choose the
 thing which I forbade.
 
 "Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye
 shall be hungry; my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed; my
 servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry and howl for
 vexation of spirit.
 
 "And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord
 shall slay thee, and call His servants by another name, that he who
 blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in God, etc., because
 the former troubles are forgotten.
 
 "For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former
 things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
 
 "But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for,
 behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
 
 "And I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people; and the voice of
 weeping shall no more be heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
 
 "Before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I
 will hear. The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall
 eat straw like the bullock; and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They
 shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain."
 
 Is. lvi, 3: "Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for
 my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.
 
 "Blessed is the man that doeth this, that keepeth the Sabbath, and
 keepeth his hand from doing any evil.
 
 "Neither let the strangers that have joined themselves to me, say, God
 will separate me from His people. For thus saith the Lord: Whoever will
 keep my Sabbath, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of
 my covenant; even unto them will I give in mine house a place and a name
 better than that of sons and of daughters: I will give them an
 everlasting name, that shall not be cut off."
 
 Is. lix, 9: "Therefore for our iniquities is justice far from us: we
 wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in
 darkness. We grope for the wall like the blind; we stumble at noon day
 as in the night: we are in desolate places as dead men.
 
 "We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves; we look for
 judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far from us."
 
 Is. lxvi, 18: "But I know their works and their thoughts; it shall come
 that I will gather all nations and tongues, and they shall see my glory.
 
 "And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of
 them unto the nations, to Africa, to Lydia, to Italy, to Greece, and to
 the people that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory. And
 they shall bring your brethren."
 
 Jer. vii. _Reprobation of the Temple_: "Go ye unto Shiloth, where I set
 my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my
 people. And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the Lord, I
 will do unto this house, wherein my name is called upon, wherein ye
 trust, and unto the place which I gave to your priests, as I have done
 to Shiloth." (For I have rejected it, and made myself a temple
 elsewhere.)
 
 "And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your
 brethren, even the seed of Ephraim." (Rejected for ever.) "Therefore
 pray not for this people."
 
 Jer. vii, 22: "What avails it you to add sacrifice to sacrifice? For I
 spake not unto your fathers, when I brought them out of the land of
 Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices. But this thing
 commanded I them, saying, Obey and be faithful to my commandments, and I
 will be your God, and ye shall be my people." (It was only after they
 had sacrificed to the golden calf that I gave myself sacrifices to turn
 into good an evil custom.)

 Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, are these."

 We might perhaps think that, when the prophets foretold that the sceptre
 should not depart from Judah until the eternal King came, they spoke to
 flatter the people, and that their prophecy was proved false by Herod.
 But to show that this was not their meaning, and that, on the contrary,
 they knew well that this temporal kingdom should cease, they said that
 they would be without a king and without a prince, and for a long time.

 Daniel ii: "All thy soothsayers and wise men cannot shew unto thee the
 secret which thou hast demanded. But there is a God in heaven who can do
 so, and that hath revealed to thee in thy dream what shall be in the
 latter days," (This dream must have caused him much misgiving.)
 
 "And it is not by my own wisdom that I have knowledge of this secret,
 but by the revelation of this same God, that hath revealed it to me, to
 make it manifest in thy presence.
 
 "Thy dream was then of this kind. Thou sawest a great image, high and
 terrible, which stood before thee. His head was of gold, his breast and
 arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, his legs of iron, his
 feet part of iron and part of clay. Thus thou sawest till that a stone
 was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet, that
 were of iron and of clay, and brake them to pieces.
 
 "Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken
 to pieces together, and the wind carried them away; but this stone that
 smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
 This is the dream, and now I will give thee the interpretation thereof.
 
 "Thou who art the greatest of kings, and to whom God hath given a power
 so vast that thou art renowned among all peoples, art the head of gold
 which thou hast seen. But after thee shall arise another kingdom
 inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear
 rule over all the earth.
 
 "But the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, and even as iron
 breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things, so shall this empire break
 in pieces and bruise all.
 
 "And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of clay and part of
 iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the
 strength of iron and of the weakness of clay.
 
 "But as iron cannot be firmly mixed with clay, so they who are
 represented by the iron and by the clay, shall not cleave one to another
 though united by marriage.
 
 "Now in the days of these kings shall God set up a kingdom, which shall
 never be destroyed, nor ever be delivered up to other people. It shall
 break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for
 ever, according as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the
 mountain without hands, and that it fell from the mountain, and brake in
 pieces the iron, the clay, the silver, and the gold. God hath made known
 to thee what shall come to pass hereafter. This dream is certain, and
 the interpretation thereof sure.
 
 "Then Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face towards the earth," etc.
 
 Daniel viii, 8. "Daniel having seen the combat of the ram and of the
 he-goat, who vanquished him and ruled over the earth, whereof the
 principal horn being broken four others came up toward the four winds of
 heaven, and out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed
 exceedingly great toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the
 land of Israel, and it waxed great even to the host of heaven; and it
 cast down some of the stars, and stamped upon them, and at last
 overthrew the prince, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and
 the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
 
 "This is what Daniel saw. He sought the meaning of it, and a voice cried
 in this manner, 'Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision,' And
 Gabriel said:
 
 "The ram which thou sawest is the king of the Medes and Persians, and
 the he-goat is the king of Greece, and the great horn that is between
 his eyes is the first king of this monarchy.
 
 "Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms
 shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.
 
 "And in the latter time of their kingdom, when iniquities are come to
 the full, there shall arise a king, insolent and strong, but not by his
 own power, to whom all things shall succeed after his own will; and he
 shall destroy the holy people, and through his policy also he shall
 cause craft to prosper in his hand, and he shall destroy many. He shall
 also stand up against the Prince of princes, but he shall perish
 miserably, and nevertheless by a violent hand."
 
 Daniel ix, 20. "Whilst I was praying with all my heart, and confessing
 my sin and the sin of all my people, and prostrating myself before my
 God, even Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, came
 to me and touched me about the time of the evening oblation, and he
 informed me and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee the
 knowledge of things. At the beginning of thy supplications I came to
 shew that which thou didst desire, for thou are greatly beloved:
 therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision. Seventy weeks
 are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy city, to finish the
 transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to abolish iniquity, and
 to bring in everlasting righteousness; to accomplish the vision and the
 prophecies, and to anoint the Most Holy. (After which this people shall
 be no more thy people, nor this city the holy city. The times of wrath
 shall be passed, and the years of grace shall come for ever.)
 
 "Know therefore, and understand, that, from the going forth of the
 commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the
 Prince, shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks." (The
 Hebrews were accustomed to divide numbers, and to place the small first.
 Thus, 7 and 62 make 69. Of this 70 there will then remain the 70th, that
 is to say, the 7 last years of which he will speak next.)
 
 "The street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.
 And after three score and two weeks," (which have followed the first
 seven. Christ will then be killed after the sixty-nine weeks, that is to
 say, in the last week), "the Christ shall be cut off, and a people of
 the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary, and
 overwhelm all, and the end of that war shall accomplish the desolation."
 
 "Now one week," (which is the seventieth, which remains), "shall confirm
 the covenant with many, and in the midst of the week," (that is to say,
 the last three and a half years), "he shall cause the sacrifice and the
 oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall
 make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall
 be poured upon the desolate."
 
 Daniel xi. "The angel said to Daniel: There shall stand up yet," (after
 Cyrus, under whom this still is), "three kings in Persia," (Cambyses,
 Smerdis, Darius); "and the fourth who shall then come," (Xerxes) "shall
 be far richer than they all, and far stronger, and shall stir up all his
 people against the Greeks.
 
 "But a mighty king shall stand up," (Alexander), "that shall rule with
 great dominion, and do according to his will. And when he shall stand
 up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided in four parts
 toward the four winds of heaven," (as he had said above, vii, 6; viii,
 8), "but not his posterity; and his successors shall not equal his
 power, for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besides
 these," (his four chief successors).
 
 "And the king of the south," (Ptolemy, son of Lagos, Egypt), "shall be
 strong; but one of his princes shall be strong above him, and his
 dominion shall be a great dominion," (Seleucus, King of Syria. Appian
 says that he was the most powerful of Alexander's successors).
 
 "And in the end of years they shall join themselves together, and the
 king's daughter of the south," (Berenice, daughter of Ptolemy
 Philadelphus, son of the other Ptolemy), "shall come to the king of the
 north," (to Antiochus Deus, King of Syria and of Asia, son of Seleucus
 Lagidas), "to make peace between these princes.
 
 "But neither she nor her seed shall have a long authority; for she and
 they that brought her, and her children, and her friends, shall be
 delivered to death." (Berenice and her son were killed by Seleucus
 Callinicus.)
 
 "But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up," (Ptolemy
 Euergetes was the issue of the same father as Berenice), "which shall
 come with a mighty army into the land of the king of the north, where he
 shall put all under subjection, and he shall also carry captive into
 Egypt their gods, their princes, their gold, their silver, and all their
 precious spoils," (if he had not been called into Egypt by domestic
 reasons, says Justin, he would have entirely stripped Seleucus); "and he
 shall continue several years when the king of the north can do nought
 against him.
 
 "And so he shall return into his kingdom. But his sons shall be stirred
 up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces," (Seleucus Ceraunus,
 Antiochus the Great). "And their army shall come and overthrow all;
 wherefore the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall
 also form a great army, and fight him," (Ptolemy Philopator against
 Antiochus the Great at Raphia), "and conquer; and his troops shall
 become insolent, and his heart shall be lifted up," (this Ptolemy
 desecrated the temple; Josephus): "he shall cast down many ten
 thousands, but he shall not be strengthened by it. For the king of the
 north," (Antiochus the Great), "shall return with a greater multitude
 than before, and in those times also a great number of enemies shall
 stand up against the king of the south," (during the reign of the young
 Ptolemy Epiphanes); "also the apostates and robbers of thy people shall
 exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall." (Those
 who abandon their religion to please Euergetes, when he will send his
 troops to Scopas; for Antiochus will again take Scopas, and conquer
 them.) "And the king of the north shall destroy the fenced cities, and
 the arms of the south shall not withstand, and all shall yield to his
 will; he shall stand in the land of Israel, and it shall yield to him.
 And thus he shall think to make himself master of all the empire of
 Egypt," (despising the youth of Epiphanes, says Justin). "And for that
 he shall make alliance with him, and give his daughter" (Cleopatra, in
 order that she may betray her husband. On which Appian says that
 doubting his ability to make himself master of Egypt by force, because
 of the protection of the Romans, he wished to attempt it by cunning).
 "He shall wish to corrupt her, but she shall not stand on his side,
 neither be for him. Then he shall turn his face to other designs, and
 shall think to make himself master of some isles," (that is to say,
 seaports), "and shall take many," (as Appian says).
 
 "But a prince shall oppose his conquests," (Scipio Africanus, who
 stopped the progress of Antiochus the Great, because he offended the
 Romans in the person of their allies), "and shall cause the reproach
 offered by him to cease. He shall then return into his kingdom and there
 perish, and be no more." (He was slain by his soldiers.)
 
 "And he who shall stand up in his estate," (Seleucus Philopator or
 Soter, the son of Antiochus the Great), "shall be a tyrant, a raiser of
 taxes in the glory of the kingdom," (which means the people), "but
 within a few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger nor in battle.
 And in his place shall stand up a vile person, unworthy of the honour of
 the kingdom, but he shall come in cleverly by flatteries. All armies
 shall bend before him; he shall conquer them, and even the prince with
 whom he has made a covenant. For having renewed the league with him, he
 shall work deceitfully, and enter with a small people into his province,
 peaceably and without fear. He shall take the fattest places, and shall
 do that which his fathers have not done, and ravage on all sides. He
 shall forecast great devices during his time."

 _Prophecies._--The seventy weeks of Daniel are ambiguous as regards
 the term of commencement, because of the terms of the prophecy; and as
 regards the term of conclusion, because of the differences among
 chronologists. But all this difference extends only to two hundred
 years.

 _Predictions._--That in the fourth monarchy, before the destruction of
 the second temple, before the dominion of the Jews was taken away, in
 the seventieth week of Daniel, during the continuance of the second
 temple, the heathen should be instructed, and brought to the knowledge
 of the God worshipped by the Jews; that those who loved Him should be
 delivered from their enemies, and filled with His fear and love.
 
 And it happened that in the fourth monarchy, before the destruction of
 the second temple, etc., the heathen in great number worshipped God, and
 led an angelic life. Maidens dedicated their virginity and their life to
 God. Men renounced their pleasures. What Plato could only make
 acceptable to a few men, specially chosen and instructed, a secret
 influence imparted, by the power of a few words, to a hundred million
 ignorant men.
 
 The rich left their wealth. Children left the dainty homes of their
 parents to go into the rough desert. (See Philo the Jew.) All this was
 foretold a great while ago. For two thousand years no heathen had
 worshipped the God of the Jews; and at the time foretold, a great number
 of the heathen worshipped this only God. The temples were destroyed. The
 very kings made submission to the cross. All this was due to the Spirit
 of God, which was spread abroad upon the earth.
 
 No heathen, since Moses until Jesus Christ, believed according to the
 very Rabbis. A great number of the heathen, after Jesus Christ, believed
 in the books of Moses, kept them in substance and spirit, and only
 rejected what was useless.

 "It is a tradition among us, that, when the Messiah shall come, the
 house of God, destined for the dispensation of His Word, shall be full
 of filth and impurity; and that the wisdom of the scribes shall be
 corrupt and rotten. Those who shall be afraid to sin, shall be rejected
 by the people, and treated as senseless fools."
 
 Is. xlix: "Listen, O isles, unto me, and hearken, ye people, from afar:
 The Lord hath called me by my name from the womb of my mother; in the
 shadow of His hand hath He hid me, and hath made my words like a sharp
 sword, and said unto me, Thou art my servant in whom I will be
 glorified. Then I said, Lord, have I laboured in vain? have I spent my
 strength for nought? yet surely my judgment is with Thee, O Lord, and my
 work with Thee. And now, saith the Lord, that formed me from the womb to
 be His servant, to bring Jacob and Israel again to Him, Thou shalt be
 glorious in my sight, and I will be thy strength. It is a light thing
 that thou shouldst convert the tribes of Jacob; I have raised thee up
 for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the
 ends of the earth. Thus saith the Lord to him whom man despiseth, to him
 whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Princes and kings
 shall worship thee, because the Lord is faithful that hath chosen thee.
 
 "Again saith the Lord unto me, I have heard thee in the days of
 salvation and of mercy, and I will preserve thee for a covenant of the
 people, to cause to inherit the desolate nations, that thou mayest say
 to the prisoners: Go forth; to them that are in darkness show
 yourselves, and possess these abundant and fertile lands. They shall not
 hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor sun smite them; for he
 that hath mercy upon them shall lead them, even by the springs of waters
 shall he guide them, and make the mountains a way before them. Behold,
 the peoples shall come from all parts, from the east and from the west,
 from the north and from the south. Let the heavens give glory to God;
 let the earth be joyful; for it hath pleased the Lord to comfort His
 people, and He will have mercy upon the poor who hope in Him.
 
 "Yet Sion dared to say: The Lord hath forsaken me, and hath forgotten
 me. Can a woman forget her child, that she should not have compassion on
 the son of her womb? but if she forget, yet will not I forget thee, O
 Sion. I will bear thee always between my hands, and thy walls are
 continually before me. They that shall build thee are come, and thy
 destroyers shall go forth of thee. Lift up thine eyes round about, and
 behold; all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I
 live, saith the Lord, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as
 with an ornament. Thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy
 destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants,
 and the children thou shalt have after thy barrenness shall say again in
 thy ears: The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may
 dwell. Then shalt thou say in thy heart: Who hath begotten me these,
 seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing
 to and fro? and who brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these,
 where had they been? And the Lord shall say to thee: Behold, I will lift
 up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people; and
 they shall bring thy sons in their arms and in their bosoms. And kings
 shall be their nursing fathers, and queens their nursing mothers; they
 shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up the
 dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; for they shall
 not be ashamed that wait for me. Shall the prey be taken from the
 mighty? But even if the captives be taken away from the strong, nothing
 shall hinder me from saving thy children, and from destroying thy
 enemies; and all flesh shall know that I am the Lord, thy Saviour and
 thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.
 
 "Thus saith the Lord: What is the bill of this divorcement, wherewith I
 have put away the synagogue? and why have I delivered it into the hands
 of your enemies? Is it not for your iniquities and for your
 transgressions that I have put it away?
 
 "For I came, and no man received me; I called and there was none to
 hear. Is my arm shortened, that I cannot redeem?
 
 "Therefore I will show the tokens of mine anger; I will clothe the
 heavens with darkness, and make sackcloth their covering.
 
 "The Lord hath given me the tongue of the learned that I should know how
 to speak a word in season to him that is weary. He hath opened mine ear,
 and I have listened to Him as a master.
 
 "The Lord hath revealed His will, and I was not rebellious.
 
 "I gave my body to the smiters, and my cheeks to outrage; I hid not my
 face from shame and spitting. But the Lord hath helped me; therefore I
 have not been confounded.
 
 "He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? who will be
 mine adversary, and accuse me of sin, God himself being my protector?
 
 "All men shall pass away, and be consumed by time; let those that fear
 God hearken to the voice of His servant; let him that languisheth in
 darkness put his trust in the Lord. But as for you, ye do but kindle the
 wrath of God upon you; ye walk in the light of your fire and in the
 sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall
 lie down in sorrow.
 
 "Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the
 Lord: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit
 whence ye are digged. Look unto Abraham, your father, and unto Sarah
 that bare you: for I called him alone, when childless, and increased
 him. Behold, I have comforted Zion, and heaped upon her blessings and
 consolations.
 
 "Hearken unto me, my people, and give ear unto me: for a law shall
 proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the
 Gentiles."
 
 Amos viii. The prophet, having enumerated the sins of Israel, said that
 God had sworn to take vengeance on them.
 
 He says this: "And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord,
 that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the
 earth in the clear day; and I will turn your feasts into mourning, and
 all your songs into lamentation.
 
 "You all shall have sorrow and suffering, and I will make this nation
 mourn as for an only son, and the end therefore as a bitter day. Behold,
 the days come, saith the Lord, that I will send a famine in the land,
 not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words
 of the Lord. And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north
 even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the
 Lord, and shall not find it.
 
 "In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst. They
 that have followed the idols of Samaria, and sworn by the god of Dan,
 and followed the manner of Beersheba, shall fall, and never rise up
 again."
 
 Amos iii, 2: "Ye only have I known of all the families of the earth for
 my people."
 
 Daniel xii, 7. Having described all the extent of the reign of the
 Messiah, he says: "All these things shall be finished, when the
 scattering of the people of Israel shall be accomplished."
 
 Haggai ii, 4: "Ye who, comparing this second house with the glory of the
 first, despise it, be strong, saith the Lord, be strong, O Zerubbabel,
 and O Jesus, the high priest, be strong, all ye people of the land, and
 work. For I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts; according to the word
 that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit
 remaineth among you. Fear ye not. For thus saith the Lord of hosts: Yet
 one little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the
 sea, and the dry land," (a way of speaking to indicate a great and an
 extraordinary change); "and I will shake all nations, and the desire of
 all the Gentiles shall come; and I will fill this house with glory,
 saith the Lord.
 
 "The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord," (that is to
 say, it is not by that that I wish to be honoured; as it is said
 elsewhere: All the beasts of the field are mine, what advantages me that
 they are offered me in sacrifice?). "The glory of this latter house
 shall be greater than of the former, saith the Lord of hosts; and in
 this place will I establish my house, saith the Lord.
 
 "According to all that thou desiredst in Horeb in the day of the
 assembly, saying, Let us not hear again the voice of the Lord, neither
 let us see this fire any more, that we die not.[272] And the Lord said
 unto me, Their prayer is just. I will raise them up a prophet from among
 their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and
 he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. And it shall come
 to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he will
 speak in my name, I will require it of him."
 
 Genesis xlix: "Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise, and
 thou shalt conquer thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down
 before thee. Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art
 gone up, and art couched as a lion, and as a lioness that shall be
 roused up.
 
 "The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between
 his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the
 people be."
 
 
 726
 
 _During the life of the Messiah._--_AEnigmatis._--Ezek. xvii.
 
 His forerunner. Malachi iii.
 
 He will be born an infant. Is. ix.
 
 He will be born in the village of Bethlehem. Micah v. He will appear
 chiefly in Jerusalem, and will be a descendant of the family of Judah
 and of David.
 
 He is to blind the learned and the wise, Is. vi, viii, xxix, etc.; and
 to preach the Gospel to the lowly, Is. xxix; to open the eyes of the
 blind, give health to the sick, and bring light to those that languish
 in darkness. Is. lxi.
 
 He is to show the perfect way, and be the teacher of the Gentiles. Is.
 lv; xlii, 1-7.
 
 The prophecies are to be unintelligible to the wicked, Dan. xii; Hosea
 xiv, 10; but they are to be intelligible to those who are well informed.
 
 The prophecies, which represent Him as poor, represent Him as master of
 the nations. Is. lii, 14, etc.; liii; Zech. ix, 9.
 
 The prophecies, which foretell the time, foretell Him only as master of
 the nations and suffering, and not as in the clouds nor as judge. And
 those, which represent Him thus as judge and in glory, do not mention
 the time. When the Messiah is spoken of as great and glorious, it is as
 the judge of the world, and not its Redeemer.
 
 He is to be the victim for the sins of the world. Is. xxxix, liii, etc.
 
 He is to be the precious corner-stone. Is. xxviii, 16.
 
 He is to be a stone of stumbling and offence. Is. viii. Jerusalem is to
 dash against this stone.
 
 The builders are to reject this stone. Ps. cxvii, 22.
 
 God is to make this stone the chief corner-stone.
 
 And this stone is to grow into a huge mountain, and fill the whole
 earth. Dan. ii.
 
 So He is to be rejected, despised, betrayed (Ps. cviii, 8), sold (Zech.
 xi, 12), spit upon, buffeted, mocked, afflicted in innumerable ways,
 given gall to drink (Ps. lxviii), pierced (Zech. xii), His feet and His
 hands pierced, slain, and lots cast for His raiment.
 
 He will raise again (Ps. xv) the third day (Hosea vi, 3).
 
 He will ascend to heaven to sit on the right hand. Ps. cx.
 
 The kings will arm themselves against Him. Ps. ii.
 
 Being on the right hand of the Father, He will be victorious over His
 enemies.
 
 The kings of the earth and all nations will worship Him. Is. lx.
 
 The Jews will continue as a nation. Jeremiah.
 
 They will wander, without kings, etc. (Hosea iii), without prophets
 (Amos), looking for salvation and finding it not (Isaiah).
 
 Calling of the Gentiles by Jesus Christ. Is. lii, 15; lv, 5; lx, etc.
 Ps. lxxxi.
 
 Hosea i, 9: "Ye are not my people, and I will not be your God, when ye
 are multiplied after the dispersion. In the places where it was said, Ye
 are not my people, I will call them my people."
 
 
 727
 
 It was not lawful to sacrifice outside of Jerusalem, which was the place
 that the Lord had chosen, nor even to eat the tithes elsewhere. Deut.
 xii, 5, etc.; Deut. xiv, 23, etc.; xv, 20; xvi, 2, 7, 11, 15.
 
 Hosea foretold that they should be without a king, without a prince,
 without a sacrifice, and without an idol; and this prophecy is now
 fulfilled, as they cannot make a lawful sacrifice out of Jerusalem.
 
 
 728
 
 _Predictions._--It was foretold that, in the time of the Messiah, He
 should come to establish a new covenant, which should make them forget
 the escape from Egypt (Jer. xxiii, 5; Is. xliii, 10); that He should
 place His law not in externals, but in the heart; that He should put His
 fear, which had only been from without, in the midst of the heart. Who
 does not see the Christian law in all this?
 
 
 729
 
 ... That then idolatry would be overthrown; that this Messiah would cast
 down all idols, and bring men into the worship of the true God.
 
 That the temples of the idols would be cast down, and that among all
 nations, and in all places of the earth, He would be offered a pure
 sacrifice, not of beasts.
 
 That He would be king of the Jews and Gentiles. And we see this king of
 the Jews and Gentiles oppressed by both, who conspire His death; and
 ruler of both, destroying the worship of Moses in Jerusalem, which was
 its centre, where He made His first Church; and also the worship of
 idols in Rome, the centre of it, where He made His chief Church.
 
 
 730
 
 _Prophecies._--That Jesus Christ will sit on the right hand, till God
 has subdued His enemies.
 
 Therefore He will not subdue them Himself.
 
 
 731
 
 "... Then they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, saying,
 Here is the Lord, _for God shall make Himself known to all._"[273]
 
 "... Your sons shall prophesy."[274] "I will put my spirit and my fear
 _in your heart_."
 
 All that is the same thing. To prophesy is to speak of God, not from
 outward proofs, but from an inward and immediate feeling.
 
 
 732
 
 That He would teach men the perfect way.
 
 And there has never come, before Him nor after Him, any man who has
 taught anything divine approaching to this.
 
 
 733
 
 ... That Jesus Christ would be small in His beginning, and would then
 increase. The little stone of Daniel.
 
 If I had in no wise heard of the Messiah, nevertheless, after such
 wonderful predictions of the course of the world which I see fulfilled,
 I see that He is divine. And if I knew that these same books foretold a
 Messiah, I should be sure that He would come; and seeing that they place
 His time before the destruction of the second temple, I should say that
 He had come.
 
 
 734
 
 _Prophecies._--That the Jews would reject Jesus Christ, and would be
 rejected of God, for this reason, that the chosen vine brought forth
 only wild grapes. That the chosen people would be fruitless, ungrateful,
 and unbelieving, _populum non credentem et contradicentem_.[275] That
 God would strike them with blindness, and in full noon they would grope
 like the blind; and that a forerunner would go before Him.
 
 
 735
 
 _Transfixerunt._ Zech. xii, 10.
 
 That a deliverer should come, who would crush the demon's head, and free
 His people from their sins, _ex omnibus iniquitatibus_; that there
 should be a New Covenant, which would be eternal; that there should be
 another priesthood after the order of Melchisedek, and it should be
 eternal; that the Christ should be glorious, mighty, strong, and yet so
 poor that He would not be recognised, nor taken for what He is, but
 rejected and slain; that His people who denied Him should no longer be
 His people; that the idolaters should receive Him, and take refuge in
 Him; that He should leave Zion to reign in the centre of idolatry; that
 nevertheless the Jews should continue for ever; that He should be of
 Judah, and when there should be no longer a king.
 
 
 
 
 SECTION XII
 
 PROOFS OF JESUS CHRIST
 
 
 736
 
 ... Therefore I reject all other religions. In that way I find an answer
 to all objections. It is right that a God so pure should only reveal
 Himself to those whose hearts are purified. Hence this religion is
 lovable to me, and I find it now sufficiently justified by so divine a
 morality. But I find more in it.
 
 I find it convincing that, since the memory of man has lasted, it was
 constantly announced to men that they were universally corrupt, but that
 a Redeemer should come; that it was not one man who said it, but
 innumerable men, and a whole nation expressly made for the purpose, and
 prophesying for four thousand years. This is a nation which is more
 ancient than every other nation. Their books, scattered abroad, are four
 thousand years old.
 
 The more I examine them, the more truths I find in them: an entire
 nation foretell Him before His advent, and an entire nation worship Him
 after His advent; what has preceded and what has followed; in short,
 people without idols and kings, this synagogue which was foretold, and
 these wretches who frequent it, and who, being our enemies, are
 admirable witnesses of the truth of these prophecies, wherein their
 wretchedness and even their blindness are foretold.
 
 I find this succession, this religion, wholly divine in its authority,
 in its duration, in its perpetuity, in its morality, in its conduct, in
 its doctrine, in its effects. The frightful darkness of the Jews was
 foretold: _Eris palpans in meridie.[276] Dabitur liber scienti literas,
 et dicet: Non possum legere._[277] While the sceptre was still in the
 hands of the first foreign usurper, there is the report of the coming of
 Jesus Christ.
 
 So I hold out my arms to my _Redeemer_, who, having been foretold for
 four thousand years, has come to suffer and to die for me on earth, at
 the time and under all the circumstances foretold. By His grace, I await
 death in peace, in the hope of being eternally united to Him. Yet I
 live with joy, whether in the prosperity which it pleases Him to bestow
 upon me, or in the adversity which He sends for my good, and which He
 has taught me to bear by His example.
 
 
 737
 
 The prophecies having given different signs which should all happen at
 the advent of the Messiah, it was necessary that all these signs should
 occur at the same time. So it was necessary that the fourth monarchy
 should have come, when the seventy weeks of Daniel were ended; and that
 the sceptre should have then departed from Judah. And all this happened
 without any difficulty. Then it was necessary that the Messiah should
 come; and Jesus Christ then came, who was called the Messiah. And all
 this again was without difficulty. This indeed shows the truth of the
 prophecies.
 
 
 738
 
 The prophets foretold, and were not foretold. The saints again were
 foretold, but did not foretell. Jesus Christ both foretold and was
 foretold.
 
 
 739
 
 Jesus Christ, whom the two Testaments regard, the Old as its hope, the
 New as its model, and both as their centre.
 
 
 740
 
 The two oldest books in the world are those of Moses and Job, the one a
 Jew and the other a Gentile. Both of them look upon Jesus Christ as
 their common centre and object: Moses in relating the promises of God to
 Abraham, Jacob, etc., and his prophecies; and Job, _Quis mihi det
 ut_,[278] etc. _Scio enim quod redemptor meus vivit_, etc.
 
 
 741
 
 The Gospel only speaks of the virginity of the Virgin up to the time of
 the birth of Jesus Christ. All with reference to Jesus Christ.
 
 
 742
 
 _Proofs of Jesus Christ._
 
      Why was the book of Ruth preserved?
 
      Why the story of Tamar?
 
 
 743
 
 "Pray that ye enter not into temptation."[279] It is dangerous to be
 tempted; and people are tempted because they do not pray.
 
 _Et tu conversus confirma fratres tuos._ But before, _conversus Jesus
 respexit Petrum_.
 
 Saint Peter asks permission to strike Malchus, and strikes before
 hearing the answer. Jesus Christ replies afterwards.
 
 The word, _Galilee_, which the Jewish mob pronounced as if by chance, in
 accusing Jesus Christ before Pilate, afforded Pilate a reason for
 sending Jesus Christ to Herod. And thereby the mystery was accomplished,
 that He should be judged by Jews and Gentiles. Chance was apparently the
 cause of the accomplishment of the mystery.
 
 
 744
 
 Those who have a difficulty in believing seek a reason in the fact that
 the Jews do not believe. "Were this so clear," say they, "why did the
 Jews not believe?" And they almost wish that they had believed, so as
 not to be kept back by the example of their refusal. But it is their
 very refusal that is the foundation of our faith. We should be much less
 disposed to the faith, if they were on our side. We should then have a
 more ample pretext. The wonderful thing is to have made the Jews great
 lovers of the things foretold, and great enemies of their fulfilment.
 
 
 745
 
 The Jews were accustomed to great and striking miracles, and so, having
 had the great miracles of the Red Sea and of the land of Canaan as an
 epitome of the great deeds of their Messiah, they therefore looked for
 more striking miracles, of which those of Moses were only the patterns.
 
 
 746
 
 The carnal Jews and the heathen have their calamities, and Christians
 also. There is no Redeemer for the heathen, for they do not so much as
 hope for one. There is no Redeemer for the Jews; they hope for Him in
 vain. There is a Redeemer only for Christians. (See _Perpetuity_.)
 
 
 747
 
 In the time of the Messiah the people divided themselves. The spiritual
 embraced the Messiah, and the coarser-minded remained to serve as
 witnesses of Him.
 
 
 748
 
 "If this was clearly foretold to the Jews, how did they not believe it,
 or why were they not destroyed for resisting a fact so clear?"
 
 I reply: in the first place, it was foretold both that they would not
 believe a thing so clear, and that they would not be destroyed. And
 nothing is more to the glory of the Messiah; for it was not enough that
 there should be prophets; their prophets must be kept above suspicion.
 Now, etc.
 
 
 749
 
 If the Jews had all been converted by Jesus Christ, we should have none
 but questionable witnesses. And if they had been entirely destroyed, we
 should have no witnesses at all.
 
 
 750
 
 What do the prophets say of Jesus Christ? That He will be clearly God?
 No; but that He is a God truly hidden; that He will be slighted; that
 none will think that it is He; that He will be a stone of stumbling,
 upon which many will stumble, etc. Let people then reproach us no longer
 for want of clearness, since we make profession of it.
 
 But, it is said, there are obscurities.--And without that, no one would
 have stumbled over Jesus Christ, and this is one of the formal
 pronouncements of the prophets: _Excaeca_[280] ...
 
 
 751
 
 Moses first teaches the Trinity, original sin, the Messiah.
 
 David: a great witness; a king, good, merciful, a beautiful soul, a
 sound mind, powerful. He prophesies, and his wonder comes to pass. This
 is infinite.
 
 He had only to say that he was the Messiah, if he had been vain; for the
 prophecies are clearer about him than about Jesus Christ. And the same
 with Saint John.
 
 
 752
 
 Herod was believed to be the Messiah. He had taken away the sceptre from
 Judah, but he was not of Judah. This gave rise to a considerable sect.
 
 Curse of the Greeks upon those who count three periods of time.
 
 In what way should the Messiah come, seeing that through Him the sceptre
 was to be eternally in Judah, and at His coming the sceptre was to be
 taken away from Judah?
 
 In order to effect that seeing they should not see, and hearing they
 should not understand, nothing could be better done.
 
 
 753
 
 _Homo existens te Deum facit.
 
 Scriptum est, Dii estis, et non potest solvi Scriptura.
 
 Haec infirmitas non est ad vitam et est ad mortem.
 
 Lazarus dormit, et deinde dixit: Lazarus mortuus est._[281]
 
 
 754
 
 The apparent discrepancy of the Gospels.[282]
 
 
 755
 
 What can we have but reverence for a man who foretells plainly things
 which come to pass, and who declares his intention both to blind and to
 enlighten, and who intersperses obscurities among the clear things which
 come to pass?
 
 
 756
 
 The time of the first advent was foretold; the time of the second is not
 so; because the first was to be obscure, and the second is to be
 brilliant, and so manifest that even His enemies will recognise it. But,
 as He was first to come only in obscurity, and to be known only of those
 who searched the Scriptures ...
 
 
 757
 
 God, in order to cause the Messiah to be known by the good and not to be
 known by the wicked, made Him to be foretold in this manner. If the
 manner of the Messiah had been clearly foretold, there would have been
 no obscurity, even for the wicked. If the time had been obscurely
 foretold, there would have been obscurity, even for the good. For their
 [goodness of heart] would not have made them understand, for instance,
 that the closed _mem_ signifies six hundred years. But the time has been
 clearly foretold, and the manner in types.
 
 By this means, the wicked, taking the promised blessings for material
 blessings, have fallen into error, in spite of the clear prediction of
 the time; and the good have not fallen in error. For the understanding
 of the promised blessings depends on the heart, which calls "good" that
 which it loves; but the understanding of the promised time does not
 depend on the heart. And thus the clear prediction of the time, and the
 obscure prediction of the blessings, deceive the wicked alone.
 
 
 758
 
 [Either the Jews or the Christians must be wicked.]
 
 
 759
 
 The Jews reject Him, but not all. The saints receive Him, and not the
 carnal-minded. And so far is this from being against His glory, that it
 is the last touch which crowns it. For their argument, the only one
 found in all their writings, in the Talmud and in the Rabbinical
 writings, amounts only to this, that Jesus Christ has not subdued the
 nations with sword in hand, _gladiumt uum, potentissime_.[283] (Is this
 all they have to say? Jesus Christ has been slain, say they. He has
 failed. He has not subdued the heathen with His might. He has not
 bestowed upon us their spoil. He does not give riches. Is this all they
 have to say? It is in this respect that He is lovable to me. I would not
 desire Him whom they fancy.) It is evident that it is only His life
 which has prevented them from accepting Him; and through this rejection
 they are irreproachable witnesses, and, what is more, they thereby
 accomplish the prophecies.
 
 [By means of the fact that this people have not accepted Him, this
 miracle here has happened. The prophecies were the only lasting miracles
 which could be wrought, but they were liable to be denied.]
 
 
 760
 
 The Jews, in slaying Him in order not to receive Him as the Messiah,
 have given Him the final proof of being the Messiah.
 
 And in continuing not to recognise Him, they made themselves
 irreproachable witnesses. Both in slaying Him, and in continuing to deny
 Him, they have fulfilled the prophecies (Isa. lx; Ps. lxxi).
 
 
 761
 
 What could the Jews, His enemies, do? If they receive Him, they give
 proof of Him by their reception; for then the guardians of the
 expectation of the Messiah receive Him. If they reject Him, they give
 proof of Him by their rejection.
 
 
 762
 
 The Jews, in testing if He were God, have shown that He was man.
 
 
 763
 
 The Church has had as much difficulty in showing that Jesus Christ was
 man, against those who denied it, as in showing that he was God; and the
 probabilities were equally great.
 
 
 764
 
 _Source of contradictions._--A God humiliated, even to the death on the
 cross; a Messiah triumphing over death by his own death. Two natures in
 Jesus Christ, two advents, two states of man's nature.
 
 
 765
 
 _Types._--Saviour, father, sacrificer, offering, food, king, wise,
 law-giver, afflicted, poor, having to create a people whom He must lead
 and nourish, and bring into His land....
 
 _Jesus Christ. Offices._--He alone had to create a great people, elect,
 holy, and chosen; to lead, nourish, and bring it into the place of rest
 and holiness; to make it holy to God; to make it the temple of God; to
 reconcile it to, and save it from, the wrath of God; to free it from the
 slavery of sin, which visibly reigns in man; to give laws to this
 people, and engrave these laws on their heart; to offer Himself to God
 for them, and sacrifice Himself for them; to be a victim without
 blemish, and Himself the sacrificer, having to offer Himself, His body,
 and His blood, and yet to offer bread and wine to God ...
 
 _Ingrediens mundum._[284]
 
 "Stone upon stone."[285]
 
 What preceded and what followed. All the Jews exist still, and are
 wanderers.
 
 
 766
 
 Of all that is on earth, He partakes only of the sorrows, not of the
 joys. He loves His neighbours, but His love does not confine itself
 within these bounds, and overflows to His own enemies, and then to those
 of God.
 
 
 767
 
 Jesus Christ typified by Joseph, the beloved of his father, sent by his
 father to see his brethren, etc., innocent, sold by his brethren for
 twenty pieces of silver, and thereby becoming their lord, their saviour,
 the saviour of strangers, and the saviour of the world; which had not
 been but for their plot to destroy him, their sale and their rejection
 of him.
 
 In prison Joseph innocent between two criminals; Jesus Christ on the
 cross between two thieves. Joseph foretells freedom to the one, and
 death to the other, from the same omens. Jesus Christ saves the elect,
 and condemns the outcast for the same sins. Joseph foretells only; Jesus
 Christ acts. Joseph asks him who will be saved to remember him, when he
 comes into his glory; and he whom Jesus Christ saves asks that He will
 remember him, when He comes into His kingdom.
 
 
 768
 
 The conversion of the heathen was only reserved for the grace of the
 Messiah. The Jews have been so long in opposition to them without
 success; all that Solomon and the prophets said has been useless. Sages,
 like Plato and Socrates, have not been able to persuade them.
 
 
 769
 
 After many persons had gone before, Jesus Christ at last came to
 say:[286] "Here am I, and this is the time. That which the prophets have
 said was to come in the fullness of time, I tell you My apostles will
 do. The Jews shall be cast out. Jerusalem shall be soon destroyed. And
 the heathen shall enter into the knowledge of God. My apostles shall do
 this after you have slain the heir of the vineyard."
 
 Then the apostles said to the Jews: "You shall be accursed," (_Celsus
 laughed at it_); and to the heathen, "You shall enter into the knowledge
 of God." And this then came to pass.
 
 
 770
 
 Jesus Christ came to blind those who saw clearly, and to give sight to
 the blind; to heal the sick, and leave the healthy to die; to call to
 repentance, and to justify sinners, and to leave the righteous in their
 sins; to fill the needy, and leave the rich empty.
 
 
 771
 
 _Holiness._--_Effundam spiritum meum._[287] All nations were in unbelief
 and lust. The whole world now became fervent with love. Princes
 abandoned their pomp; maidens suffered martyrdom. Whence came this
 influence? The Messiah was come. These were the effect and sign of His
 coming.
 
 
 772
 
 Destruction of the Jews and heathen by Jesus Christ: _Omnes gentes
 venient et adorabunt eum.[288] Parum est ut_,[289] etc. _Postula a
 me.[290] Adorabunt eum omnes reges.[291] Testes iniqui.[292] Dabit
 maxillam percutienti.[293] Dederunt fel in escam._[294]
 
 
 773
 
 Jesus Christ for all, Moses for a nation.
 
 The Jews blessed in Abraham: "I will bless those that bless thee."[295]
 But: "All nations blessed in his seed."[296] _Parum est ut_, etc.
 
 _Lumen ad revelationem gentium._[297]
 
 _Non fecit taliter omni nationi_,[298] said David, in speaking of the
 Law. But, in speaking of Jesus Christ, we must say: _Fecit taliter omni
 nationi. Parum est ut_, etc., Isaiah. So it belongs to Jesus Christ to
 be universal. Even the Church offers sacrifice only for the faithful.
 Jesus Christ offered that of the cross for all.
 
 
 774
 
 There is heresy in always explaining _omnes_ by "all," and heresy in not
 explaining it sometimes by "all." _Bibite ex hoc omnes_;[299] the
 Huguenots are heretics in explaining it by "all." _In quo omnes
 peccaverunt_;[300] the Huguenots are heretics in excepting the children
 of true believers. We must then follow the Fathers and tradition in
 order to know when to do so, since there is heresy to be feared on both
 sides.
 
 
 775
 
 _Ne timeas pusillus grex.[301] Timore et tremore.--Quid ergo? Ne timeas
 [modo] timeas._ Fear not, provided you fear; but if you fear not, then
 fear.
 
 _Qui me recipit, non me recipit, sed eum qui me misit._[302]
 
 _Nemo scit, neque Filius._
 
 _Nubes lucida obumbravit._
 
 Saint John[303] was to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,
 and Jesus Christ[304] to plant division. There is not contradiction.
 
 
 776
 
 The effects _in communi_ and _in particulari_. The semi-Pelagians err in
 saying of _in communi_ what is true only _in particulari_; and the
 Calvinists in saying _in particulari_ what is true _in communi_. (Such
 is my opinion.)
 
 
 777
 
 _Omnis Judaea regio, et Jerosolomymi universi, et baptizabantur._[305]
 Because of all the conditions of men who came there. From these stones
 there _can_ come children unto Abraham.[306]
 
 
 778
 
 If men knew themselves, God would heal and pardon them. _Ne convertantur
 et sanem eos, et dimittantur eis peccata._[307]
 
 
 779
 
 Jesus Christ never condemned without hearing. To Judas: _Amice, ad quid
 venisti?_[308] To him that had not on the wedding garment, the same.
 
 
 780
 
 The types of the completeness of the Redemption, as that the sun gives
 light to all, indicate only completeness; but [_the types_] of
 exclusions, as of the Jews elected to the exclusion of the Gentiles,
 indicate exclusion.
 
 "Jesus Christ the Redeemer of all."--Yes, for He has offered, like a man
 who has ransomed all those who were willing to come to Him. If any die
 on the way, it is their misfortune; but, so far as He was concerned, He
 offered them redemption.--That holds good in this example, where he who
 ransoms and he who prevents death are two persons, but not of Jesus
 Christ, who does both these things.--No, for Jesus Christ, in the
 quality of Redeemer, is not perhaps Master of all; and thus, in so far
 as it is in Him, He is the Redeemer of all.
 
 When it is said that Jesus Christ did not die for all, you take undue
 advantage of a fault in men who at once apply this exception to
 themselves; and this is to favour despair, instead of turning them from
 it to favour hope. For men thus accustom themselves in inward virtues by
 outward customs.
 
 
 781
 
 The victory over death. "What is a man advantaged if he gain the whole
 world and lose his own soul?[309] Whosoever will save his soul, shall
 lose it."[310]
 
 "I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil."[311]
 
 "Lambs took not away the sins of the world, but I am the lamb which
 taketh away the sins."[312]
 
 "Moses[313] hath not led you out of captivity, and made you truly free."
 
 
 782
 
 ... Then Jesus Christ comes to tell men that they have no other enemies
 but themselves; that it is their passions which keep them apart from
 God; that He comes to destroy these, and give them His grace, so as to
 make of them all one Holy Church; that He comes to bring back into this
 Church the heathen and Jews; that He comes to destroy the idols of the
 former and the superstition of the latter. To this all men are opposed,
 not only from the natural opposition of lust; but, above all, the kings
 of the earth, as had been foretold, join together to destroy this
 religion at its birth. (_Proph.: Quare fremuerunt gentes ... reges terrae
 ... adversus Christum._)[314]
 
 All that is great on earth is united together; the learned, the wise,
 the kings. The first write; the second condemn; the last kill. And
 notwithstanding all these oppositions, these men, simple and weak,
 resist all these powers, subdue even these kings, these learned men and
 these sages, and remove idolatry from all the earth. And all this is
 done by the power which had foretold it.
 
 
 783
 
 Jesus Christ would not have the testimony of devils, nor of those who
 were not called, but of God and John the Baptist.
 
 
 784
 
 I consider Jesus Christ in all persons and in ourselves: Jesus Christ as
 a Father in His Father, Jesus Christ as a Brother in His Brethren, Jesus
 Christ as poor in the poor, Jesus Christ as rich in the rich, Jesus
 Christ as Doctor and Priest in priests, Jesus Christ as Sovereign in
 princes, etc. For by His glory He is all that is great, being God; and
 by His mortal life He is all that is poor and abject. Therefore He has
 taken this unhappy condition, so that He could be in all persons, and
 the model of all conditions.
 
 
 785
 
 Jesus Christ is an obscurity (according to what the world calls
 obscurity), such that historians, writing only of important matters of
 states, have hardly noticed Him.
 
 
 786
 
 _On the fact that neither Josephus, nor Tacitus, nor other historians
 have spoken of Jesus Christ._--So far is this from telling against
 Christianity, that on the contrary it tells for it. For it is certain
 that Jesus Christ has existed; that His religion has made a great talk;
 and that these persons were not ignorant of it. Thus it is plain that
 they purposely concealed it, or that, if they did speak of it, their
 account has been suppressed or changed.
 
 
 787
 
 "I have reserved me seven thousand."[315] I love the worshippers unknown
 to the world and to the very prophets.
 
 
 788
 
 As Jesus Christ remained unknown among men, so His truth remains among
 common opinions without external difference. Thus the Eucharist among
 ordinary bread.
 
 
 789
 
 Jesus would not be slain without the forms of justice; for it is far
 more ignominious to die by justice than by an unjust sedition.
 
 
 790
 
 The false justice of Pilate only serves to make Jesus Christ suffer; for
 he causes Him to be scourged by his false justice, and afterwards puts
 Him to death. It would have been better to have put Him to death at
 once. Thus it is with the falsely just. They do good and evil works to
 please the world, and to show that they are not altogether of Jesus
 Christ; for they are ashamed of Him. And at last, under great temptation
 and on great occasions, they kill Him.
 
 
 791
 
 What man ever had more renown? The whole Jewish people foretell Him
 before His coming. The Gentile people worship Him after His coming. The
 two peoples, Gentile and Jewish, regard Him as their centre.
 
 And yet what man enjoys this renown less? Of thirty-three years, He
 lives thirty without appearing. For three years He passes as an
 impostor; the priests and the chief people reject Him; His friends and
 His nearest relatives despise Him. Finally, He dies, betrayed by one of
 His own disciples, denied by another, and abandoned by all.
 
 What part, then, has He in this renown? Never had man so much renown;
 never had man more ignominy. All that renown has served only for us, to
 render us capable of recognising Him; and He had none of it for Himself.
 
 
 792
 
 The infinite distance between body and mind is a symbol of the
 infinitely more infinite distance between mind and charity; for charity
 is supernatural.
 
 All the glory of greatness has no lustre for people who are in search of
 understanding.
 
 The greatness of clever men is invisible to kings, to the rich, to
 chiefs, and to all the worldly great.
 
 The greatness of wisdom, which is nothing if not of God, is invisible to
 the carnal-minded and to the clever. These are three orders differing in
 kind.
 
 Great geniuses have their power, their glory, their greatness, their
 victory, their lustre, and have no need of worldly greatness, with which
 they are not in keeping. They are seen, not by the eye, but by the mind;
 this is sufficient.
 
 The saints have their power, their glory, their victory, their lustre,
 and need no worldly or intellectual greatness, with which they have no
 affinity; for these neither add anything to them, nor take away anything
 from them. They are seen of God and the angels, and not of the body, nor
 of the curious mind. God is enough for them.
 
 Archimedes,[316] apart from his rank, would have the same veneration. He
 fought no battles for the eyes to feast upon; but he has given his
 discoveries to all men. Oh! how brilliant he was to the mind!
 
 Jesus Christ, without riches, and without any external exhibition of
 knowledge, is in His own order of holiness. He did not invent; He did
 not reign. But He was humble, patient, holy, holy to God, terrible to
 devils, without any sin. Oh! in what great pomp, and in what wonderful
 splendour, He is come to the eyes of the heart, which perceive wisdom!
 
 It would have been useless for Archimedes to have acted the prince in
 his books on geometry, although he was a prince.
 
 It would have been useless for our Lord Jesus Christ to come like a
 king, in order to shine forth in His kingdom of holiness. But He came
 there appropriately in the glory of His own order.
 
 It is most absurd to take offence at the lowliness of Jesus Christ, as
 if His lowliness were in the same order as the greatness which He came
 to manifest. If we consider this greatness in His life, in His passion,
 in His obscurity, in His death, in the choice of His disciples, in their
 desertion, in His secret resurrection, and the rest, we shall see it to
 be so immense, that we shall have no reason for being offended at a
 lowliness which is not of that order.
 
 But there are some who can only admire worldly greatness, as though
 there were no intellectual greatness; and others who only admire
 intellectual greatness, as though there were not infinitely higher
 things in wisdom.
 
 All bodies, the firmament, the stars, the earth and its kingdoms, are
 not equal to the lowest mind; for mind knows all these and itself; and
 these bodies nothing.
 
 All bodies together, and all minds together, and all their products, are
 not equal to the least feeling of charity. This is of an order
 infinitely more exalted.
 
 From all bodies together, we cannot obtain one little thought; this is
 impossible, and of another order. From all bodies and minds, we cannot
 produce a feeling of true charity; this is impossible, and of another
 and supernatural order.
 
 
 793
 
 Why did Jesus Christ not come in a visible manner, instead of obtaining
 testimony of Himself from preceding prophecies? Why did He cause Himself
 to be foretold in types?
 
 
 794
 
 If Jesus Christ had only come to sanctify, all Scripture and all things
 would tend to that end; and it would be quite easy to convince
 unbelievers. If Jesus Christ had only come to blind, all His conduct
 would be confused; and we would have no means of convincing unbelievers.
 But as He came _in sanctificationem et in scandalum_,[317] as Isaiah
 says, we cannot convince unbelievers, and they cannot convince us. But
 by this very fact we convince them; since we say that in His whole
 conduct there is no convincing proof on one side or the other.
 
 
 795
 
 Jesus Christ does not say that He is not of Nazareth, in order to leave
 the wicked in their blindness; nor that He is not Joseph's son.
 
 
 796
 
 _Proofs of Jesus Christ._--Jesus Christ said great things so simply,
 that it seems as though He had not thought them great; and yet so
 clearly that we easily see what He thought of them. This clearness,
 joined to this simplicity, is wonderful.
 
 
 797
 
 The style of the gospel is admirable in so many ways, and among the rest
 in hurling no invectives against the persecutors and enemies of Jesus
 Christ. For there is no such invective in any of the historians against
 Judas, Pilate, or any of the Jews.
 
 If this moderation of the writers of the Gospels had been assumed, as
 well as many other traits of so beautiful a character, and they had only
 assumed it to attract notice, even if they had not dared to draw
 attention to it themselves, they would not have failed to secure
 friends, who would have made such remarks to their advantage. But as
 they acted thus without pretence, and from wholly disinterested motives,
 they did not point it out to any one; and I believe that many such facts
 have not been noticed till now, which is evidence of the natural
 disinterestedness with which the thing has been done.
 
 
 798
 
 An artisan who speaks of wealth, a lawyer who speaks of war, of royalty,
 etc.; but the rich man rightly speaks of wealth, a king speaks
 indifferently of a great gift he has just made, and God rightly speaks
 of God.
 
 
 799
 
 Who has taught the evangelists the qualities of a perfectly heroic soul,
 that they paint it so perfectly in Jesus Christ? Why do they make Him
 weak in His agony? Do they not know how to paint a resolute death? Yes,
 for the same Saint Luke paints the death of Saint Stephen as braver than
 that of Jesus Christ.
 
 They make Him therefore capable of fear, before the necessity of dying
 has come, and then altogether brave.
 
 But when they make Him so troubled, it is when He afflicts Himself; and
 when men afflict Him, He is altogether strong.
 
 
 800
 
 _Proof of Jesus Christ._--The supposition that the apostles were
 impostors is very absurd. Let us think it out. Let us imagine those
 twelve men, assembled after the death of Jesus Christ, plotting to say
 that He was risen. By this they attack all the powers. The heart of man
 is strangely inclined to fickleness, to change, to promises, to gain.
 However little any of them might have been led astray by all these
 attractions, nay more, by the fear of prisons, tortures, and death, they
 were lost. Let us follow up this thought.
 
 
 801
 
 The apostles were either deceived or deceivers. Either supposition has
 difficulties; for it is not possible to mistake a man raised from the
 dead ...
 
 While Jesus Christ was with them, He could sustain them. But, after
 that, if He did not appear to them, who inspired them to act?
 
 
 
 
 SECTION XIII
 
 THE MIRACLES
 
 
 802
 
 _The beginning._--Miracles enable us to judge of doctrine, and doctrine
 enables us to judge of miracles.
 
 There are false miracles and true. There must be a distinction, in order
 to know them; otherwise they would be useless. Now they are not useless;
 on the contrary, they are fundamental. Now the rule which is given to us
 must be such, that it does not destroy the proof which the true miracles
 give of the truth, which is the chief end of the miracles.
 
 Moses has given two rules: that the prediction does not come to pass
 (Deut. xviii), and that they do not lead to idolatry (Deut. xiii); and
 Jesus Christ[318] one.
 
 If doctrine regulates miracles, miracles are useless for doctrine.
 
 If miracles regulate....
 
 _Objection to the rule._--The distinction of the times. One rule during
 the time of Moses, another at present.
 
 
 803
 
 _Miracle._--It is an effect, which exceeds the natural power of the
 means which are employed for it; and what is not a miracle is an effect,
 which does not exceed the natural power of the means which are employed
 for it. Thus, those who heal by invocation of the devil do not work a
 miracle; for that does not exceed the natural power of the devil.
 But ...
 
 
 804
 
 The two fundamentals; one inward, the other outward; grace and miracles;
 both supernatural.
 
 
 805
 
 Miracles and truth are necessary, because it is necessary to convince
 the entire man, in body and soul.
 
 
 806
 
 In all times, either men have spoken of the true God, or the true God
 has spoken to men.
 
 
 807
 
 Jesus Christ has verified that He was the Messiah, never in verifying
 His doctrine by Scripture and the prophecies, but always by His
 miracles.
 
 He proves by a miracle that He remits sins.
 
 Rejoice not in your miracles, said Jesus Christ, but because your names
 are written in heaven.[319]
 
 If they believe not Moses, neither will they believe one risen from the
 dead.
 
 Nicodemus recognises by His miracles that His teaching is of God.
 _Scimus quia venisti a Deo magister; nemo enim potest haec signa facere
 quae tu facis nisi Deus fuerit cum eo._[320] He does not judge of the
 miracles by the teaching, but of the teaching by the miracles.
 
 The Jews had a doctrine of God as we have one of Jesus Christ, and
 confirmed by miracles. They were forbidden to believe every worker of
 miracles; and they were further commanded to have recourse to the chief
 priests, and to rely on them.
 
 And thus, in regard to their prophets, they had all those reasons which
 we have for refusing to believe the workers of miracles.
 
 And yet they were very sinful in rejecting the prophets, and Jesus
 Christ, because of their miracles; and they would not have been
 culpable, if they had not seen the miracles. _Nisi fecissem ... peccatum
 non haberent._[321] Therefore all belief rests upon miracles.
 
 Prophecy is not called miracle; as Saint John speaks of the first
 miracle in Cana, and then of what Jesus Christ says to the woman of
 Samaria, when He reveals to her all her hidden life. Then He heals the
 centurion's son; and Saint John calls this "the second miracle."[322]
 
 
 808
 
 The combinations of miracles.
 
 
 809
 
 The second miracle can suppose the first, but the first cannot suppose
 the second.
 
 
 810
 
 Had it not been for the miracles, there would have been no sin in not
 believing in Jesus Christ.
 
 
 811
 
 I should not be a Christian, but for the miracles, said Saint Augustine.
 
 
 812
 
 _Miracles._--How I hate those who make men doubt of miracles!
 Montaigne[323] speaks of them as he should in two places. In one, we see
 how careful he is; and yet, in the other, he believes, and makes sport
 of unbelievers.
 
 However it may be, the Church is without proofs if they are right.
 
 
 813
 
 Montaigne against miracles.
 
 Montaigne for miracles.
 
 
 814
 
 It is not possible to have a reasonable belief against miracles.
 
 
 815
 
 Unbelievers the most credulous. They believe the miracles of Vespasian,
 in order not to believe those of Moses.
 
 
 816
 
 _Title: How it happens that men believe so many liars, who say that they
 have seen miracles, and do not believe any of those who say that they
 have secrets to make men immortal, or restore youth to them._--Having
 considered how it happens that so great credence is given to so many
 impostors, who say they have remedies, often to the length of men
 putting their lives into their hands, it has appeared to me that the
 true cause is that there are true remedies. For it would not be possible
 that there should be so many false remedies, and that so much faith
 should be placed in them, if there were none true. If there had never
 been any remedy for any ill, and all ills had been incurable, it is
 impossible that men should have imagined that they could give remedies,
 and still more impossible that so many others should have believed those
 who boasted of having remedies; in the same way as did a man boast of
 preventing death, no one would believe him, because there is no example
 of this. But as there were a number of remedies found to be true by the
 very knowledge of the greatest men, the belief of men is thereby
 induced; and, this being known to be possible, it has been therefore
 concluded that it was. For people commonly reason thus: "A thing is
 possible, therefore it is"; because the thing cannot be denied
 generally, since there are particular effects which are true, the
 people, who cannot distinguish which among these particular effects are
 true, believe them all. In the same way, the reason why so many false
 effects are credited to the moon, is that there are some true, as the
 tide.
 
 It is the same with prophecies, miracles, divination by dreams,
 sorceries, etc. For if there had been nothing true in all this, men
 would have believed nothing of them; and thus, instead of concluding
 that there are no true miracles because there are so many false, we
 must, on the contrary, say that there certainly are true miracles, since
 there are false, and that there are false miracles only because some are
 true. We must reason in the same way about religion; for it would not be
 possible that men should have imagined so many false religions, if there
 had not been a true one. The objection to this is that savages have a
 religion; but the answer is that they have heard the true spoken of, as
 appears by the deluge, circumcision, the cross of Saint Andrew, etc.
 
 
 817
 
 Having considered how it comes that there are so many false miracles,
 false revelations, sorceries, etc., it has seemed to me that the true
 cause is that there are some true; for it would not be possible that
 there should be so many false miracles, if there were none true, nor so
 many false revelations, if there were none true, nor so many false
 religions, if there were not one true. For if there had never been all
 this, it is almost impossible that men should have imagined it, and
 still more impossible that so many others should have believed it. But
 as there have been very great things true, and as they have been
 believed by great men, this impression has been the cause that nearly
 everybody is rendered capable of believing also the false. And thus,
 instead of concluding that there are no true miracles, since there are
 so many false, it must be said, on the contrary, that there are true
 miracles, since there are so many false; and that there are false ones
 only because there are true; and that in the same way there are false
 religions because there is one true.--Objection to this: savages have a
 religion. But this is because they have heard the true spoken of, as
 appears by the cross of Saint Andrew, the deluge, circumcision,
 etc.--This arises from the fact that the human mind, finding itself
 inclined to that side by the truth, becomes thereby susceptible of all
 the falsehoods of this ...
 
 
 818
 
 Jeremiah xxiii, 32. The _miracles_ of the false prophets. In the Hebrew
 and Vatable[324] they are the _tricks_.
 
 _Miracle_ does not always signify miracle. I Sam. xiv, 15; _miracle_
 signifies _fear_, and is so in the Hebrew. The same evidently in Job
 xxxiii, 7; and also Isaiah xxi, 4; Jeremiah xliv, 12. _Portentum_
 signifies _simulacrum_, Jeremiah l, 38; and it is so in the Hebrew and
 Vatable. Isaiah viii, 18. Jesus Christ says that He and His will be in
 _miracles_.
 
 
 819
 
 If the devil favoured the doctrine which destroys him, he would be
 divided against himself, as Jesus Christ said. If God favoured the
 doctrine which destroys the Church, He would be divided against Himself.
 _Omne regnum divisum._[325] For Jesus Christ wrought against the devil,
 and destroyed his power over the heart, of which exorcism is the
 symbolisation, in order to establish the kingdom of God. And thus He
 adds, _Si in digito Dei ... regnum Dei ad vos_.[326]
 
 
 820
 
 There is a great difference between tempting and leading into error. God
 tempts, but He does not lead into error. To tempt is to afford
 opportunities, which impose no necessity; if men do not love God, they
 will do a certain thing. To lead into error is to place a man under the
 necessity of inferring and following out what is untrue.
 
 
 821
 
 Abraham and Gideon are above revelation. The Jews blinded themselves in
 judging of miracles by the Scripture. God has never abandoned His true
 worshippers.
 
 I prefer to follow Jesus Christ than any other, because He has miracle,
 prophecy, doctrine, perpetuity, etc.
 
 The Donatists. No miracle which obliges them to say it is the devil.
 
 The more we particularise God, Jesus Christ, the Church ...
 
 
 822
 
 If there were no false miracles, there would be certainty. If there were
 no rule to judge of them, miracles would be useless, and there would be
 no reason for believing.
 
 Now there is, humanly speaking, no human certainty, but we have reason.
 
 
 823
 
 Either God has confounded the false miracles, or He has foretold them;
 and in both ways He has raised Himself above what is supernatural with
 respect to us, and has raised us to it.
 
 
 824
 
 Miracles serve not to convert, but to condemn. (Q. 113, A. 10, _Ad._
 2.)[327]
 
 
 825
 
 _Reasons why we do not believe._
 
 John xii, 37. _Cum autem tanta signa fecisset, non credebant in eum, ut
 sermo Isayae impleretur. Excaecavit_, etc.
 
 _Haec dixit Isaias, quando vidit gloriam ejus et locutus est de eo._
 
 _Judaei signa petunt et Graeci sapientiam quaerunt, nos autem Jesum
 crucifixum. Sed plenum signis, sed plenum sapientia; vos autem Christum
 non crucifixum et religionem sine miraculis et sine sapientia._[328]
 
 What makes us not believe in the true miracles, is want of love. John:
 _Sed vos non creditis, quia non estis ex ovibus._[329] What makes us
 believe the false is want of love. II Thess. ii.
 
 The foundation of religion. It is the miracles. What then? Does God
 speak against miracles, against the foundations of the faith which we
 have in Him?
 
 If there is a God, faith in God must exist on earth. Now the miracles of
 Jesus Christ are not foretold by Antichrist, but the miracles of
 Antichrist are foretold by Jesus Christ. And so if Jesus Christ were not
 the Messiah, He would have indeed led into error. When Jesus Christ
 foretold the miracles of Antichrist, did He think of destroying faith in
 His own miracles?
 
 Moses foretold Jesus Christ, and bade to follow Him. Jesus Christ
 foretold Antichrist, and forbade to follow him.
 
 It was impossible that in the time of Moses men should keep their faith
 for Antichrist, who was unknown to them. But it is quite easy, in the
 time of Antichrist, to believe in Jesus Christ, already known.
 
 There is no reason for believing in Antichrist, which there is not for
 believing in Jesus Christ. But there are reasons for believing in Jesus
 Christ, which there are not for believing in the other.
 
 
 826
 
 Judges xiii, 23: "If the Lord were pleased to kill us, He would not have
 shewed us all these things."
 
 Hezekiah, Sennacherib.
 
 Jeremiah. Hananiah, the false prophet, dies in seven months.
 
 2 Macc. iii. The temple, ready for pillage, miraculously succoured.--2
 Macc. xv.
 
 1 Kings xvii. The widow to Elijah, who had restored her son, "By this I
 know that thy words are true."
 
 1 Kings xviii. Elijah with the prophets of Baal.
 
 In the dispute concerning the true God and the truth of religion, there
 has never happened any miracle on the side of error, and not of truth.
 
 
 827
 
 _Opposition._--Abel, Cain; Moses, the Magicians; Elijah, the false
 prophets: Jeremiah, Hananiah; Micaiah, the false prophets; Jesus Christ,
 the Pharisees; St. Paul, Bar-jesus; the Apostles, the Exorcists;
 Christians, unbelievers; Catholics, heretics; Elijah, Enoch, Antichrist.
 
 
 828
 
 Jesus Christ says that the Scriptures testify of Him. But He does not
 point out in what respect.
 
 Even the prophecies could not prove Jesus Christ during His life; and
 so, men would not have been culpable for not believing in Him before His
 death, had the miracles not sufficed without doctrine. Now those who did
 not believe in Him, when He was still alive, were sinners, as He said
 Himself, and without excuse. Therefore they must have had proof beyond
 doubt, which they resisted. Now, they had not the prophecies, but only
 the miracles. Therefore the latter suffice, when the doctrine is not
 inconsistent with them; and they ought to be believed.
 
 John vii, 40. _Dispute among the Jews as among the Christians of
 to-day._ Some believed in Jesus Christ; others believed Him not, because
 of the prophecies which said that He should be born in Bethlehem. They
 should have considered more carefully whether He was not. For His
 miracles being convincing, they should have been quite sure of these
 supposed contradictions of His teaching to Scripture; and this obscurity
 did not excuse, but blinded them. Thus those who refuse to believe in
 the miracles in the present day on account of a supposed contradiction,
 which is unreal, are not excused.
 
 The Pharisees said to the people, who believed in Him, because of His
 miracles: "This people who knoweth not the law are cursed. But have any
 of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? For we know that out
 of Galilee ariseth no prophet." Nicodemus answered: "Doth our law judge
 any man before it hear him, [and specially, such a man who works such
 miracles]?"
 
 
 829
 
 The prophecies were ambiguous; they are no longer so.
 
 
 830
 
 The five propositions were ambiguous; they are no longer so.
 
 
 831
 
 Miracles are no longer necessary, because we have had them already. But
 when tradition is no longer minded; when the Pope alone is offered to
 us; when he has been imposed upon; and when the true source of truth,
 which is tradition, is thus excluded; and the Pope, who is its guardian,
 is biased; the truth is no longer free to appear. Then, as men speak no
 longer of truth, truth itself must speak to men. This is what happened
 in the time of Arius. (Miracles under Diocletian and under Arius.)
 
 
 832
 
 _Miracle._--The people concluded this of themselves; but if the reason
 of it must be given to you ...
 
 It is unfortunate to be in exception to the rule. The same must be
 strict, and opposed to exception. But yet, as it is certain that there
 are exceptions to a rule, our judgment must though strict, be just.
 
 
 833
 
 John vi, 26: _Non quia vidisti signum, sed quia saturati estis._
 
 Those who follow Jesus Christ because of His miracles honour His power
 in all the miracles which it produces. But those who, making profession
 to follow Him because of His miracles, follow Him in fact only because
 He comforts them and satisfies them with worldly blessings, discredit
 His miracles, when they are opposed to their own comforts.
 
 John ix: _Non est hic homo a Deo, quia sabbatum non custodit. Alii:
 Quomodo potest homo peccator haec signa facere?_
 
 Which is the most clear?
 
 This house is not of God; for they do not there believe that the five
 propositions are in Jansenius. Others: This house is of God; for in it
 there are wrought strange miracles.
 
 Which is the most clear?
 
 _Tu quid dicis? Dico quia propheta est. Nisi esset hic a Deo, non
 poterat facere quidquam._[330]
 
 
 834
 
 In the Old Testament, when they will turn you from God. In the New, when
 they will turn you from Jesus Christ. These are the occasions for
 excluding particular miracles from belief. No others need be excluded.
 
 Does it therefore follow that they would have the right to exclude all
 the prophets who came to them? No; they would have sinned in not
 excluding those who denied God, and would have sinned in excluding those
 who did not deny God.
 
 So soon, then, as we see a miracle, we must either assent to it, or have
 striking proofs to the contrary. We must see if it denies a God, or
 Jesus Christ, or the Church.
 
 
 835
 
 There is a great difference between not being for Jesus Christ and
 saying so, and not being for Jesus Christ and pretending to be so. The
 one party can do miracles, not the others. For it is clear of the one
 party, that they are opposed to the truth, but not of the others; and
 thus miracles are clearer.
 
 
 836
 
 That we must love one God only is a thing so evident, that it does not
 require miracles to prove it.
 
 
 837
 
 Jesus Christ performed miracles, then the apostles, and the first saints
 in great number; because the prophecies not being yet accomplished, but
 in the process of being accomplished by them, the miracles alone bore
 witness to them. It was foretold that the Messiah should convert the
 nations. How could this prophecy be fulfilled without the conversion of
 the nations? And how could the nations be converted to the Messiah, if
 they did not see this final effect of the prophecies which prove Him?
 Therefore, till He had died, risen again, and converted the nations, all
 was not accomplished; and so miracles were needed during all this time.
 Now they are no longer needed against the Jews; for the accomplished
 prophecies constitute a lasting miracle.
 
 
 838
 
 "Though ye believe not Me, believe at least the works."[331] He refers
 them, as it were, to the strongest proof.
 
 It had been told to the Jews, as well as to Christians, that they should
 not always believe the prophets; but yet the Pharisees and Scribes are
 greatly concerned about His miracles, and try to show that they are
 false, or wrought by the devil. For they must needs be convinced, if
 they acknowledge that they are of God.
 
 At the present day we are not troubled to make this distinction. Still
 it is very easy to do: those who deny neither God nor Jesus Christ do no
 miracles which are not certain. _Nemo facit virtutem in nomine meo, et
 cito possit de me male loqui._[332]
 
 But we have not to draw this distinction. Here is a sacred relic.[333]
 Here is a thorn from the crown of the Saviour of the world, over whom
 the prince of this world has no power, which works miracles by the
 peculiar power of the blood shed for us. Now God Himself chooses this
 house in order to display conspiciously therein His power.
 
 These are not men who do miracles by an unknown and doubtful virtue,
 which makes a decision difficult for us. It is God Himself. It is the
 instrument of the Passion of His only Son, who, being in many places,
 chooses this, and makes men come from all quarters there to receive
 these miraculous alleviations in their weaknesses.
 
 
 839
 
 The Church has three kinds of enemies: the Jews, who have never been of
 her body; the heretics, who have withdrawn from it; and the evil
 Christians, who rend her from within.
 
 These three kinds of different adversaries usually attack her in
 different ways. But here they attack her in one and the same way. As
 they are all without miracles, and as the Church has always had miracles
 against them, they have all had the same interest in evading them; and
 they all make use of this excuse, that doctrine must not be judged by
 miracles, but miracles by doctrine. There were two parties among those
 who heard Jesus Christ: those who followed His teaching on account of
 His miracles; others who said.... There were two parties in the time of
 Calvin.... There are now the Jesuits, etc.
 
 
 840
 
 Miracles furnish the test in matters of doubt, between Jews and
 heathens, Jews and Christians, Catholics and heretics, the slandered and
 slanderers, between the two crosses.
 
 But miracles would be useless to heretics; for the Church, authorised by
 miracles which have already obtained belief, tells us that they have not
 the true faith. There is no doubt that they are not in it, since the
 first miracles of the Church exclude belief of theirs. Thus there is
 miracle against miracle, both the first and greatest being on the side
 of the Church.
 
 These nuns,[334] astonished at what is said, that they are in the way of
 perdition; that their confessors are leading them to Geneva; that they
 suggest to them that Jesus Christ is not in the Eucharist, nor on the
 right hand of the Father; know that all this is false, and therefore
 offer themselves to God in this state. _Vide si via iniquitatis in me
 est._[335] What happens thereupon? This place, which is said to be the
 temple of the devil, God makes His own temple. It is said that the
 children must be taken away from it. God heals them there. It is said
 that it is the arsenal of hell. God makes of it the sanctuary of His
 grace. Lastly, they are threatened with all the fury and vengeance of
 heaven; and God overwhelms them with favours. A man would need to have
 lost his senses to conclude from this that they are therefore in the way
 of perdition.
 
 (We have without doubt the same signs as Saint Athanasius.)

 Antichrist _in signis mendacibus_, says Saint Paul, 2 Thess. ii.
 
 _Secundum operationem Satanae, in seductione iis qui pereunt eo quod
 charitatem veritatis non receperunt ut salvi fierent, ideo mittet illis
 Deus optationes erroris ut credant mendacio._
 
 As in the passage of Moses: _Tentat enim vos Deus, utrum diligatis
 eum.[342]
 
 Ecce praedixi vobis: vos ergo videte._[343]
 
 
 842
 
 Here is not the country of truth. She wanders unknown amongst men. God
 has covered her with a veil, which leaves her unrecognised by those who
 do not hear her voice. Room is opened for blasphemy, even against the
 truths that are at least very likely. If the truths of the Gospel are
 published, the contrary is published too, and the questions are
 obscured, so that the people cannot distinguish. And they ask, "What
 have you to make you believed rather than others? What sign do you give?
 You have only words, and so have we. If you had miracles, good and
 well." That doctrine ought to be supported by miracles is a truth, which
 they misuse in order to revile doctrine. And if miracles happen, it is
 said that miracles are not enough without doctrine; and this is another
 truth, which they misuse in order to revile miracles.
 
 Jesus Christ cured the man born blind, and performed a number of
 miracles on the Sabbath day. In this way He blinded the Pharisees, who
 said that miracles must be judged by doctrine.
 
 "We have Moses: but, as for this fellow, we know not from whence he
 is."[344] It is wonderful that you know not whence He is, and yet He
 does such miracles.
 
 Jesus Christ spoke neither against God, nor against Moses.
 
 Antichrist and the false prophets, foretold by both Testaments, will
 speak openly against God and against Jesus Christ. Who is not hidden ...
 God would not allow him, who would be a secret enemy, to do miracles
 openly.
 
 In a public dispute where the two parties profess to be for God, for
 Jesus Christ, for the Church, miracles have never been on the side of
 the false Christians, and the other side has never been without a
 miracle.
 
 "He hath a devil." John x, 21. And others said, "Can a devil open the
 eyes of the blind?"
 
 The proofs which Jesus Christ and the apostles draw from Scripture are
 not conclusive; for they say only that Moses foretold that a prophet
 should come. But they do not thereby prove that this is He; and that is
 the whole question. These passages therefore serve only to show that
 they are not contrary to Scripture, and that there appears no
 inconsistency, but not that there is agreement. Now this is enough,
 namely, exclusion of inconsistency, along with miracles.
 
 There is a mutual duty between God and men. We must pardon Him this
 saying: Quid debui?[345] "Accuse me," said God in Isaiah.
 
 "God must fulfil His promises," etc.
 
 Men owe it to God to accept the religion which He sends. God owes it to
 men not to lead them into error. Now, they would be led into error, if
 the workers of miracles announced a doctrine which should not appear
 evidently false to the light of common sense, and if a greater worker of
 miracles had not already warned men not to believe them.
 
 Thus, if there were divisions in the Church, and the Arians, for
 example, who declared themselves founded on Scripture just as the
 Catholics, had done miracles, and not the Catholics, men should have
 been led into error.
 
 For, as a man, who announces to us the secrets of God, is not worthy to
 be believed on his private authority, and that is why the ungodly doubt
 him; so when a man, as a token of the communion which he has with God,
 raises the dead, foretells the future, removes the seas, heals the sick,
 there is none so wicked as not to bow to him, and the incredulity of
 Pharaoh and the Pharisees is the effect of a supernatural obduracy.
 
 When, therefore, we see miracles and a doctrine not suspicious, both on
 one side, there is no difficulty. But when we see miracles and
 suspicious doctrine on the same side, we must then see which is the
 clearest. Jesus Christ was suspected.
 
 Bar-jesus blinded.[346] The power of God surpasses that of His enemies.
 
 The Jewish exorcists[347] beaten by the devils, saying, "Jesus I know,
 and Paul I know; but who are ye?"
 
 Miracles are for doctrine, and not doctrine for miracles.
 
 If the miracles are true, shall we be able to persuade men of all
 doctrine? No; for this will not come to pass. _Si angelus_[348]....
 
 Rule: we must judge of doctrine by miracles; we must judge of miracles
 by doctrine. All this is true, but contains no contradiction.
 
 For we must distinguish the times.
 
 How glad you are to know the general rules, thinking thereby to set up
 dissension, and render all useless! We shall prevent you, my father;
 truth is one and constant.
 
 It is impossible, from the duty of God to men, that a man, hiding his
 evil teaching, and only showing the good, saying that he conforms to God
 and the Church, should do miracles so as to instil insensibly a false
 and subtle doctrine. This cannot happen.
 
 And still less, that God, who knows the heart, should perform miracles
 in favour of such a one.
 
 
 843
 
 The three marks of religion: perpetuity, a good life, miracles. They
 destroy perpetuity by their doctrine of probability; a good life by
 their morals; miracles by destroying either their truth or the
 conclusions to be drawn from them.
 
 If we believe them, the Church will have nothing to do with perpetuity,
 holiness, and miracles. The heretics deny them, or deny the conclusions
 to be drawn from them; they do the same. But one would need to have no
 sincerity in order to deny them, or again to lose one's senses in order
 to deny the conclusions to be drawn from them.
 
 Nobody has ever suffered martyrdom for the miracles which he says he has
 seen; for the folly of men goes perhaps to the length of martyrdom, for
 those which the Turks believe by tradition, but not for those which they
 have seen.
 
 
 844
 
 The heretics have always attacked these three marks, which they have
 not.
 
 
 845
 
 _First objection_: "An angel from heaven.[349] We must not judge of
 truth by miracles, but of miracles by truth. Therefore the miracles are
 useless."
 
 Now they are of use, and they must not be in opposition to the truth.
 Therefore what Father Lingende[350] has said, that "God will not permit
 that a miracle may lead into error...."
 
 When there shall be a controversy in the same Church, miracle will
 decide.
 
 _Second objection_: "But Antichrist will do miracles."
 
 The magicians of Pharaoh did not entice to error. Thus we cannot say to
 Jesus respecting Antichrist, "You have led me into error." For
 Antichrist will do them against Jesus Christ, and so they cannot lead
 into error. Either God will not permit false miracles, or He will
 procure greater.
 
 [Jesus Christ has existed since the beginning of the world: this is more
 impressive than all the miracles of Antichrist.]
 
 If in the same Church there should happen a miracle on the side of those
 in error, men would be led into error. Schism is visible; a miracle is
 visible. But schism is more a sign of error than a miracle is a sign of
 truth. Therefore a miracle cannot lead into error.
 
 But apart from schism, error is not so obvious as a miracle is obvious.
 Therefore a miracle could lead into error.
 
 _Ubi est Deus tuus?_[351] Miracles show Him, and are a light.
 
 
 846
 
 One of the anthems for Vespers at Christmas: _Exortum est in tenebris
 lumen rectis corde._[352]
 
 
 847
 
 If the compassion of God is so great that He instructs us to our
 benefit, even when He hides Himself, what light ought we not to expect
 from Him when He reveals Himself?
 
 
 848
 
 Will _Est et non est_ be received in faith itself as well as in
 miracles? And if it is inseparable in the others ...
 
 When Saint Xavier[353] works miracles.--[Saint Hilary. "Ye wretches, who
 oblige us to speak of miracles."]
 
 Unjust judges, make not your own laws on the moment; judge by those
 which are established, and by yourselves. _Vae qui conditis leges
 iniquas._[354]
 
 Miracles endless, false.
 
 In order to weaken your adversaries, you disarm the whole Church.
 
 If they say that our salvation depends upon God, they are "heretics." If
 they say that they are obedient to the Pope, that is "hypocrisy." If
 they are ready to subscribe to all the articles, that is not enough. If
 they say that a man must not be killed for an apple, "they attack the
 morality of Catholics." If miracles are done among them, it is not a
 sign of holiness, and is, on the contrary, a symptom of heresy.
 
 This way in which the Church has existed is that truth has been without
 dispute, or, if it has been contested, there has been the Pope, or,
 failing him, there has been the Church.
 
 
 849
 
 The five propositions[355] condemned, but no miracle; for the truth was
 not attacked. But the Sorbonne ... but the bull....
 
 It is impossible that those who love God with all their heart should
 fail to recognise the Church; so evident is she.--It is impossible that
 those who do not love God should be convinced of the Church.
 
 Miracles have such influence that it was necessary that God should warn
 men not to believe in them in opposition to Him, all clear as it is that
 there is a God. Without this they would have been able to disturb men.
 
 And thus so far from these passages, Deut. xiii, making against the
 authority of the miracles, nothing more indicates their influence. And
 the same in respect of Antichrist. "To seduce, if it were possible, even
 the elect."[356]
 
 
 850
 
 The history of the man born blind.
 
 What says Saint Paul? Does he continually speak of the evidence of the
 prophecies? No, but of his own miracle. What says Jesus Christ? Does He
 speak of the evidence of the prophecies? No; His death had not fulfilled
 them. But He says, _Si non fecissem_.[357] Believe the works.
 
 Two supernatural foundations of our wholly supernatural religion; one
 visible, the other invisible; miracles with grace, miracles without
 grace.
 
 The synagogue, which had been treated with love as a type of the Church,
 and with hatred, because it was only the type, has been restored, being
 on the point of falling when it was well with God, and thus a type.
 
 Miracles prove the power which God has over hearts, by that which He
 exercises over bodies.
 
 The Church has never approved a miracle among heretics.
 
 Miracles a support of religion: they have been the test of Jews; they
 have been the test of Christians, saints, innocents, and true believers.
 
 A miracle among schismatics is not so much to be feared; for schism,
 which is more obvious than a miracle, visibly indicates their error. But
 when there is no schism, and error is in question, miracle decides.
 
 _Si non fecissem quae alius non fecit._ The wretches who have obliged us
 to speak of miracles.
 
 Abraham and Gideon confirm faith by miracles.
 
 Judith. God speaks at last in their greatest oppression.
 
 If the cooling of love leaves the Church almost without believers,
 miracles will rouse them. This is one of the last effects of grace.
 
 If one miracle were wrought among the Jesuits!
 
 When a miracle disappoints the expectation of those in whose presence it
 happens, and there is a disproportion between the state of their faith
 and the instrument of the miracle, it ought then to induce them to
 change. But with you it is otherwise. There would be as much reason in
 saying that, if the Eucharist raised a dead man, it would be necessary
 for one to turn a Calvinist rather than remain a Catholic. But when it
 crowns the expectation, and those, who hoped that God would bless the
 remedies, see themselves healed without remedies ...
 
 _The ungodly._--No sign has ever happened on the part of the devil
 without a stronger sign on the part of God, or even without it having
 been foretold that such would happen.
 
 
 851
 
 Unjust persecutors of those whom God visibly protects. If they reproach
 you with your excesses, "they speak as the heretics." If they say that
 the grace of Jesus Christ distinguishes us, "they are heretics." If they
 do miracles, "it is the mark of their heresy."
 
 Ezekiel.--They say: These are the people of God who speak thus.
 
 It is said, "Believe in the Church";[358] but it is not said, "Believe
 in miracles"; because the last is natural, and not the first. The one
 had need of a precept, not the other. Hezekiah.
 
 The synagogue was only a type, and thus it did not perish; and it was
 only a type, and so it is decayed. It was a type which contained the
 truth, and thus it has lasted until it no longer contained the truth.
 
 My reverend father, all this happened in types. Other religions perish;
 this one perishes not.
 
 Miracles are more important than you think. They have served for the
 foundation, and will serve for the continuation of the Church till
 Antichrist, till the end.
 
 The two witnesses.
 
 In the Old Testament and the New, miracles are performed in connection
 with types. Salvation, or a useless thing, if not to show that we must
 submit to the Scriptures: type of the sacrament.
 
 
 852
 
 [We must judge soberly of divine ordinances, my father.
 
 Saint Paul in the isle of Malta.]
 
 
 853
 
 The hardness of the Jesuits, then, surpasses that of the Jews, since
 those refused to believe Jesus Christ innocent only because they doubted
 if His miracles were of God. Whereas the Jesuits, though unable to doubt
 that the miracles of Port-Royal are of God, do not cease to doubt still
 the innocence of that house.
 
 
 854
 
 I suppose that men believe miracles. You corrupt religion either in
 favour of your friends, or against your enemies. You arrange it at your
 will.

 the case that He find none more thankful.
 
 
 
 
 SECTION XIV
 
 APPENDIX: POLEMICAL FRAGMENTS
 
 
 856
 
 _Clearness, obscurity._--There would be too great darkness, if truth had
 not visible signs. This is a wonderful one, that it has always been
 preserved in one Church and one visible assembly [of men]. There would
 be too great clearness, if there were only one opinion in this Church.
 But in order to recognise what is true, one has only to look at what has
 always existed; for it is certain that truth has always existed, and
 that nothing false has always existed.
 
 
 857
 
 The history of the Church ought properly to be called the history of
 truth.
 
 
 858
 
 There is a pleasure in being in a ship beaten about by a storm, when we
 are sure that it will not founder. The persecutions which harass the
 Church are of this nature.
 
 
 859
 
 In addition to so many other signs of piety, they[359] are also
 persecuted, which is the best sign of piety.
 
 
 860
 
 The Church is in an excellent state, when it is sustained by God only.
 
 
 861
 
 The Church has always been attacked by opposite errors, but perhaps
 never at the same time, as now. And if she suffer more because of the
 multiplicity of errors, she derives this advantage from it, that they
 destroy each other.
 
 She complains of both, but far more of the Calvinists, because of the
 schism.
 
 It is certain that many of the two opposite sects are deceived. They
 must be disillusioned.
 
 Faith embraces many truths which seem to contradict each other. _There
 is a time to laugh, and a time to weep_,[360] etc. _Responde. Ne
 respondeas_,[361] etc.
 
 The source of this is the union of the two natures in Jesus Christ; and
 also the two worlds (the creation of a new heaven and a new earth; a new
 life and a new death; all things double, and the same names remaining);
 and finally the two natures that are in the righteous, (for they are the
 two worlds, and a member and image of Jesus Christ. And thus all the
 names suit them: righteous, yet sinners; dead, yet living; living, yet
 dead; elect, yet outcast, etc.).
 
 There are then a great number of truths, both of faith and of morality,
 which seem contradictory, and which all hold good together in a
 wonderful system. The source of all heresies is the exclusion of some of
 these truths; and the source of all the objections which the heretics
 make against us is the ignorance of some of our truths. And it generally
 happens that, unable to conceive the connection of two opposite truths,
 and believing that the admission of one involves the exclusion of the
 other, they adhere to the one, exclude the other, and think of us as
 opposed to them. Now exclusion is the cause of their heresy; and
 ignorance that we hold the other truth causes their objections.
 
 1st example: Jesus Christ is God and man. The Arians, unable to
 reconcile these things, which they believe incompatible, say that He is
 man; in this they are Catholics. But they deny that He is God; in this
 they are heretics. They allege that we deny His humanity; in this they
 are ignorant.
 
 2nd example: On the subject of the Holy Sacrament. We believe that, the
 substance of the bread being changed, and being consubstantial with that
 of the body of our Lord, Jesus Christ is therein really present. That is
 one truth. Another is that this Sacrament is also a type of the cross
 and of glory, and a commemoration of the two. That is the Catholic
 faith, which comprehends these two truths which seem opposed.
 
 The heresy of to-day, not conceiving that this Sacrament contains at the
 same time both the presence of Jesus Christ and a type of Him, and that
 it is a sacrifice and a commemoration of a sacrifice, believes that
 neither of these truths can be admitted without excluding the other for
 this reason.
 
 They fasten to this point alone, that this Sacrament is typical; and in
 this they are not heretics. They think that we exclude this truth; hence
 it comes that they raise so many objections to us out of the passages of
 the Fathers which assert it. Finally, they deny the presence; and in
 this they are heretics.
 
 3rd example: Indulgences.
 
 The shortest way, therefore, to prevent heresies is to instruct in all
 truths; and the surest way to refute them is to declare them all. For
 what will the heretics say?
 
 In order to know whether an opinion is a Father's ...
 
 
 862
 
 All err the more dangerously, as they each follow a truth. Their fault
 is not in following a falsehood, but in not following another truth.
 
 
 863
 
 Truth is so obscure in these times, and falsehood so established, that
 unless we love the truth, we cannot know it.
 
 
 864
 
 If there is ever a time in which we must make profession of two opposite
 truths, it is when we are reproached for omitting one. Therefore the
 Jesuits and Jansenists are wrong in concealing them, but the Jansenists
 more so, for the Jesuits have better made profession of the two.
 
 
 865
 
 Two kinds of people make things equal to one another, as feasts to
 working days, Christians to priests, all things among them, etc. And
 hence the one party conclude that what is then bad for priests is also
 so for Christians, and the other that what is not bad for Christians is
 lawful for priests.
 
 
 866
 
 If the ancient Church was in error, the Church is fallen. If she should
 be in error to-day, it is not the same thing; for she has always the
 superior maxim of tradition from the hand of the ancient Church; and so
 this submission and this conformity to the ancient Church prevail and
 correct all. But the ancient Church did not assume the future Church,
 and did not consider her, as we assume and consider the ancient.
 
 
 867
 
 That which hinders us in comparing what formerly occurred in the Church
 with what we see there now, is that we generally look upon Saint
 Athanasius,[362] Saint Theresa, and the rest, as crowned with glory, and
 acting towards us as gods. Now that time has cleared up things, it does
 so appear. But at the time when he was persecuted, this great saint was
 a man called Athanasius; and Saint Theresa was a nun. "Elias was a man
 subject to like passions as we are," says Saint James, to disabuse
 Christians of that false idea which makes us reject the example of the
 saints, as disproportioned to our state. "They were saints," say we,
 "they are not like us." What then actually happened? Saint Athanasius
 was a man called Athanasius, accused of many crimes, condemned by such
 and such a council for such and such a crime. All the bishops assented
 to it, and finally the Pope. What said they to those who opposed this?
 That they disturbed the peace, that they created schism, etc.
 
 Zeal, light. Four kinds of persons: zeal without knowledge; knowledge
 without zeal; neither knowledge nor zeal; both zeal and knowledge. The
 first three condemned him. The last acquitted him, were excommunicated
 by the Church, and yet saved the Church.
 
 
 868
 
 If Saint Augustine came at the present time, and was as little
 authorised as his defenders, he would accomplish nothing. God directs
 His Church well, by having sent him before with authority.
 
 
 869
 
 God has not wanted to absolve without the Church. As she has part in the
 offence, He desires her to have part in the pardon. He associates her
 with this power, as kings their parliaments. But if she absolves or
 binds without God, she is no longer the Church. For, as in the case of
 parliament, even if the king have pardoned a man, it must be ratified;
 but if parliament ratifies without the king, or refuses to ratify on the
 order of the king, it is no longer the parliament of the king, but a
 rebellious assembly.
 
 
 870
 
 _The Church, the Pope. Unity, plurality._--Considering the Church as a
 unity, the Pope, who is its head, is as the whole. Considering it as a
 plurality, the Pope is only a part of it. The Fathers have considered
 the Church now in the one way, now in the other. And thus they have
 spoken differently of the Pope. (Saint Cyprian: _Sacerdos Dei._) But in
 establishing one of these truths, they have not excluded the other.
 Plurality which is not reduced to unity is confusion; unity which does
 not depend on plurality is tyranny. There is scarcely any other country
 than France in which it is permissible to say that the Council is above
 the Pope.
 
 
 871
 
 The Pope is head. Who else is known of all? Who else is recognised by
 all, having power to insinuate himself into all the body, because he
 holds the principal shoot, which insinuates itself everywhere? How easy
 it was to make this degenerate into tyranny! That is why Christ has laid
 down for them this precept: _Vos autem non sic._[363]
 
 
 872
 
 The Pope hates and fears the learned, who do not submit to him at will.
 
 
 873
 
 We must not judge of what the Pope is by some words of the Fathers--as
 the Greeks said in a council, important rules--but by the acts of the
 Church and the Fathers, and by the canons.
 
 _Duo aut tres in unum._[364] Unity and plurality. It is an error to
 exclude one of the two, as the papists do who exclude plurality, or the
 Huguenots who exclude unity.
 
 
 874
 
 Would the Pope be dishonoured by having his knowledge from God and
 tradition; and is it not dishonouring him to separate him from this holy
 union?
 
 
 875
 
 God does not perform miracles in the ordinary conduct of His Church. It
 would be a strange miracle if infallibility existed in one man. But it
 appears so natural for it to reside in a multitude, since the conduct
 of God is hidden under nature, as in all His other works.
 
 
 876
 
 Kings dispose of their own power; but the Popes cannot dispose of
 theirs.
 
 
 877
 
 _Summum jus, summa injuria._
 
 The majority is the best way, because it is visible, and has strength to
 make itself obeyed. Yet it is the opinion of the least able.
 
 If men could have done it, they would have placed might in the hands of
 justice. But as might does not allow itself to be managed as men want,
 because it is a palpable quality, whereas justice is a spiritual quality
 of which men dispose as they please, they have placed justice in the
 hands of might. And thus that is called just which men are forced to
 obey.
 
 Hence comes the right of the sword, for the sword gives a true right.
 Otherwise we should see violence on one side and justice on the other
 (end of the twelfth _Provincial_). Hence comes the injustice of the
 Fronde,[365] which raises its alleged justice against power. It is not
 the same in the Church, for there is a true justice and no violence.
 
 
 878
 
 _Injustice._--Jurisdiction is not given for the sake of the judge, but
 for that of the litigant. It is dangerous to tell this to the people.
 But the people have too much faith in you; it will not harm them, and
 may serve you. It should therefore be made known. _Pasce oves
 meas_,[366] non _tuas_. You owe me pasturage.
 
 
 879
 
 Men like certainty. They like the Pope to be infallible in faith, and
 grave doctors to be infallible in morals, so as to have certainty.
 
 
 880
 
 The Church teaches, and God inspires, both infallibly. The work of the
 Church is of use only as a preparation for grace or condemnation. What
 it does is enough for condemnation, not for inspiration.
 
 
 881
 
 Every time the Jesuits may impose upon the Pope, they will make all
 Christendom perjured.
 
 The Pope is very easily imposed upon, because of his occupations, and
 the confidence which he has in the Jesuits; and the Jesuits are very
 capable of imposing upon him by means of calumny.
 
 
 882
 
 The wretches who have obliged me to speak of the basis of religion.
 
 
 883
 
 Sinners purified without penitence; the righteous justified without
 love; all Christians without the grace of Jesus Christ; God without
 power over the will of men; a predestination without mystery; a
 redemption without certitude!
 
 
 884
 
 Any one is made a priest, who wants to be so, as under Jeroboam.[367]
 
 It is a horrible thing that they propound to us the discipline of the
 Church of to-day as so good, that it is made a crime to desire to change
 it. Formerly it was infallibly good, and it was thought that it could be
 changed without sin; and now, such as it is, we cannot wish it changed!
 It has indeed been permitted to change the custom of not making priests
 without such great circumspection, that there were hardly any who were
 worthy; and it is not allowed to complain of the custom which makes so
 many who are unworthy!
 
 
 885
 
 _Heretics._--Ezekiel. All the heathen, and also the Prophet, spoke evil
 of Israel. But the Israelites were so far from having the right to say
 to him, "You speak like the heathen," that he is most forcible upon
 this, that the heathen say the same as he.
 
 
 886
 
 The Jansenists are like the heretics in the reformation of morality; but
 you are like them in evil.
 
 
 887
 
 You are ignorant of the prophecies, if you do not know that all this
 must happen; princes, prophets, Pope, and even the priests. And yet the
 Church is to abide. By the grace of God we have not come to that. Woe to
 these priests! But we hope that God will bestow His mercy upon us that
 we shall not be of them.
 
 Saint Peter, ii: false prophets in the past, the image of future ones.
 
 
 888
 
 ... So that if it is true, on the one hand, that some lax monks, and
 some corrupt casuists, who are not members of the hierarchy, are steeped
 in these corruptions, it is, on the other hand, certain that the true
 pastors of the Church, who are the true guardians of the Divine Word,
 have preserved it unchangeably against the efforts of those who have
 attempted to destroy it.
 
 And thus true believers have no pretext to follow that laxity, which is
 only offered to them by the strange hands of these casuists, instead of
 the sound doctrine which is presented to them by the fatherly hands of
 their own pastors. And the ungodly and heretics have no ground for
 publishing these abuses as evidence of imperfection in the providence of
 God over His Church; since, the Church consisting properly in the body
 of the hierarchy, we are so far from being able to conclude from the
 present state of matters that God has abandoned her to corruption, that
 it has never been more apparent than at the present time that God
 visibly protects her from corruption.
 
 For if some of these men, who, by an extraordinary vocation, have made
 profession of withdrawing from the world and adopting the monks' dress,
 in order to live in a more perfect state than ordinary Christians, have
 fallen into excesses which horrify ordinary Christians, and have become
 to us what the false prophets were among the Jews; this is a private and
 personal misfortune, which must indeed be deplored, but from which
 nothing can be inferred against the care which God takes of His Church;
 since all these things are so clearly foretold, and it has been so long
 since announced that these temptations would arise from people of this
 kind; so that when we are well instructed, we see in this rather
 evidence of the care of God than of His forgetfulness in regard to us.
 
 
 889
 
 Tertullian: _Nunquam Ecclesia reformabitur._
 
 
 890
 
 Heretics, who take advantage of the doctrine of the Jesuits, must be
 made to know that it is not that of the Church [_the doctrine of the
 Church_], and that our divisions do not separate us from the altar.
 
 
 891
 
 If in differing we condemned, you would be right. Uniformity without
 diversity is useless to others; diversity without uniformity is ruinous
 for us. The one is harmful outwardly; the other inwardly.
 
 
 892
 
 By showing the truth, we cause it to be believed; but by showing the
 injustice of ministers, we do not correct it. Our mind is assured by a
 proof of falsehood; our purse is not made secure by proof of injustice.
 
 
 893
 
 Those who love the Church lament to see the corruption of morals; but
 laws at least exist. But these corrupt the laws. The model is damaged.
 
 
 894
 
 Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from
 religious conviction.
 
 
 895
 
 It is in vain that the Church has established these words, anathemas,
 heresies, etc. They are used against her.
 
 
 896
 
 The servant knoweth not what his lord doeth, for the master tells him
 only the act and not the intention.[368] And this is why he often obeys
 slavishly, and defeats the intention. But Jesus Christ has told us the
 object. And you defeat that object.
 
 
 897
 
 They cannot have perpetuity, and they seek universality; and therefore
 they make the whole Church corrupt, that they may be saints.
 
 
 898
 
 _Against those who misuse passages of Scripture, and who pride
 themselves in finding one which seems to favour their error._--The
 chapter for Vespers, Passion Sunday, the prayer for the king.
 
 Explanation of these words: "He that is not with me is against me."[369]
 And of these others: "He that is not against you is for you."[370] A
 person who says: "I am neither for nor against", we ought to reply to
 him ...
 
 
 899
 
 He who will give the meaning of Scripture, and does not take it from
 Scripture, is an enemy of Scripture. (Aug., _De Doct. Christ._)
 
 
 900
 
 _Humilibus dat gratiam; an ideo non dedit humilitatem?[371]
 
 Sui eum non receperunt; quotquot autem non receperunt an non erant
 sui?_[372]
 
 
 901
 
 "It must indeed be," says Feuillant, "that this is not so certain; for
 controversy indicates uncertainty, (Saint Athanasius, Saint Chrysostom,
 morals, unbelievers)."
 
 The Jesuits have not made the truth uncertain, but they have made their
 own ungodliness certain.
 
 Contradiction has always been permitted, in order to blind the wicked;
 for all that offends truth or love is evil. This is the true principle.
 
 
 902
 
 All religions and sects in the world have had natural reason for a
 guide. Christians alone have been constrained to take their rules from
 without themselves, and to acquaint themselves with those which Jesus
 Christ bequeathed to men of old to be handed down to true believers.
 This constraint wearies these good Fathers. They desire, like other
 people, to have liberty to follow their own imaginations. It is in vain
 that we cry to them, as the prophets said to the Jews of old: "Enter
 into the Church; acquaint yourselves with the precepts which the men of
 old left to her, and follow those paths." They have answered like the
 Jews: "We will not walk in them; but we will follow the thoughts of our
 hearts"; and they have said, "We will be as the other nations."[373]
 
 
 903
 
 They make a rule of exception.
 
 Have the men of old given absolution before penance? Do this as
 exceptional. But of the exception you make a rule without exception, so
 that you do not even want the rule to be exceptional.
 
 
 904
 
 _On confessions and absolutions without signs of regret._
 
 God regards only the inward; the Church judges only by the outward. God
 absolves as soon as He sees penitence in the heart; the Church when she
 sees it in works. God will make a Church pure within, which confounds,
 by its inward and entirely spiritual holiness, the inward impiety of
 proud sages and Pharisees; and the Church will make an assembly of men
 whose external manners are so pure as to confound the manners of the
 heathen. If there are hypocrites among them, but so well disguised that
 she does not discover their venom, she tolerates them; for, though they
 are not accepted of God, whom they cannot deceive, they are of men, whom
 they do deceive. And thus she is not dishonoured by their conduct, which
 appears holy. But you want the Church to judge neither of the inward,
 because that belongs to God alone, nor of the outward, because God
 dwells only upon the inward; and thus, taking away from her all choice
 of men, you retain in the Church the most dissolute, and those who
 dishonour her so greatly, that the synagogues of the Jews and sects of
 philosophers would have banished them as unworthy, and have abhorred
 them as impious.
 
 
 905
 
 The easiest conditions to live in according to the world are the most
 difficult to live in according to God, and vice versa. Nothing is so
 difficult according to the world as the religious life; nothing is
 easier than to live it according to God. Nothing is easier, according to
 the world, than to live in high office and great wealth; nothing is more
 difficult than to live in them according to God, and without acquiring
 an interest in them and a liking for them.
 
 
 906
 
 The casuists submit the decision to the corrupt reason, and the choice
 of decisions to the corrupt will, in order that all that is corrupt in
 the nature of man may contribute to his conduct.
 
 
 907
 
 But is it _probable_ that _probability_ gives assurance?
 
 Difference between rest and security of conscience. Nothing gives
 certainty but truth; nothing gives rest but the sincere search for
 truth.
 
 
 908
 
 The whole society itself of their casuists cannot give assurance to a
 conscience in error, and that is why it is important to choose good
 guides.
 
 Thus they will be doubly culpable, both in having followed ways which
 they should not have followed, and in having listened to teachers to
 whom they should not have listened.
 
 
 909
 
 Can it be anything but compliance with the world which makes you find
 things probable? Will you make us believe that it is truth, and that if
 duelling were not the fashion, you would find it probable that they
 might fight, considering the matter in itself?
 
 
 910
 
 Must we kill to prevent there being any wicked? This is to make both
 parties wicked instead of one. _Vince in bono malum._[374] (Saint
 Augustine.)
 
 
 911
 
 _Universal._--Ethics and language are special, but universal sciences.
 
 
 912
 
 _Probability._--Each one can employ it; no one can take it away.
 
 
 913
 
 They allow lust to act, and check scruples; whereas they should do the
 contrary.
 
 
 914
 
 _Montalte._[375]--Lax opinions please men so much, that it is strange
 that theirs displease. It is because they have exceeded all bounds.
 Again, there are many people who see the truth, and who cannot attain to
 it; but there are few who do not know that the purity of religion is
 opposed to our corruptions. It is absurd to say that an eternal
 recompense is offered to the morality of Escobar.
 
 
 915
 
 _Probability._--They have some true principles; but they misuse them.
 Now, the abuse of truth ought to be as much punished as the introduction
 of falsehood.
 
 As if there were two hells, one for sins against love, the other for
 those against justice!
 
 
 916
 
 _Probability._[376]--The earnestness of the saints in seeking the truth
 was useless, if the probable is trustworthy. The fear of the saints who
 have always followed the surest way (Saint Theresa having always
 followed her confessor).
 
 
 917
 
 Take away _probability_, and you can no longer please the world; give
 _probability_, and you can no longer displease it.
 
 
 918
 
 These are the effects of the sins of the peoples and of the Jesuits. The
 great have wished to be flattered. The Jesuits have wished to be loved
 by the great. They have all been worthy to be abandoned to the spirit of
 lying, the one party to deceive, the others to be deceived. They have
 been avaricious, ambitious, voluptuous. _Coacervabunt tibi
 magistros._[377] Worthy disciples of such masters, they have sought
 flatterers, and have found them.
 
 
 919
 
 If they do not renounce their doctrine of probability, their good maxims
 are as little holy as the bad, for they are founded on human authority;
 and thus, if they are more just, they will be more reasonable, but not
 more holy. They take after the wild stem on which they are grafted.
 
 If what I say does not serve to enlighten you, it will be of use to the
 people.
 
 If these[378] are silent, the stones will speak.
 
 Silence is the greatest persecution; the saints were never silent. It is
 true that a call is necessary; but it is not from the decrees of the
 Council that we must learn whether we are called, it is from the
 necessity of speaking. Now, after Rome has spoken, and we think that she
 has condemned the truth, and that they have written it, and after the
 books which have said the contrary are censured; we must cry out so much
 the louder, the more unjustly we are censured, and the more violently
 they would stifle speech, until there come a Pope who hears both
 parties, and who consults antiquity to do justice. So the good Popes
 will find the Church still in outcry.
 
 The Inquisition and the Society[379] are the two scourges of the truth.
 
 Why do you not accuse them of Arianism? For, though they have said that
 Jesus Christ is God, perhaps they mean by it not the natural
 interpretation, but as it is said, _Dii estis_.
 
 If my Letters are condemned at Rome, that which I condemn in them is
 condemned in heaven. _Ad tuum, Domine Jesu, tribunal appello._
 
 You yourselves are corruptible.
 
 I feared that I had written ill, seeing myself condemned; but the
 example of so many pious writings makes me believe the contrary. It is
 no longer allowable to write well, so corrupt or ignorant is the
 Inquisition!
 
 "It is better to obey God than men."
 
 I fear nothing; I hope for nothing. It is not so with the bishops.
 Port-Royal fears, and it is bad policy to disperse them; for they will
 fear no longer and will cause greater fear. I do not even fear your like
 censures, if they are not founded on those of tradition. Do you censure
 all? What! even my respect? No. Say then what, or you will do nothing,
 if you do not point out the evil, and why it is evil. And this is what
 they will have great difficulty in doing.
 
 _Probability._--They have given a ridiculous explanation of certitude;
 for, after having established that all their ways are sure, they have no
 longer called that sure which leads to heaven without danger of not
 arriving there by it, but that which leads there without danger of going
 out of that road.
 
 
 920
 
 ... The saints indulge in subtleties in order to think themselves
 criminals, and impeach their better actions. And these indulge in
 subtleties in order to excuse the most wicked.
 
 The heathen sages erected a structure equally fine outside, but upon a
 bad foundation; and the devil deceived men by this apparent resemblance
 based upon the most different foundation.
 
 Man never had so good a cause as I; and others have never furnished so
 good a capture as you....
 
 The more they point out weakness in my person, the more they authorise
 my cause.
 
 You say that I am a heretic. Is that lawful? And if you do not fear that
 men do justice, do you not fear that God does justice?
 
 You will feel the force of the truth, and you will yield to it ...
 
 There is something supernatural in such a blindness. _Digna
 necessitas.[380] Mentiris impudentissime_ ...
 
 _Doctrina sua noscitur vir_ ...
 
 False piety, a double sin.
 
 I am alone against thirty thousand. No. Protect, you, the court;
 protect, you, deception; let me protect the truth. It is all my
 strength. If I lose it, I am undone. I shall not lack accusations, and
 persecutions. But I possess the truth, and we shall see who will take it
 away.
 
 I do not need to defend religion, but you do not need to defend error
 and injustice. Let God, out of His compassion, having no regard to the
 evil which is in me, and having regard to the good which is in you,
 grant us all grace that truth may not be overcome in my hands, and that
 falsehood ...
 
 
 921
 
 _Probable._--Let us see if we seek God sincerely, by comparison of the
 things which we love. It is _probable_ that this food will not poison
 me. It is _probable_ that I shall not lose my action by not prosecuting
 it ...
 
 
 922
 
 It is not absolution only which remits sins by the sacrament of penance,
 but contrition, which is not real if it does not seek the sacrament.
 
 
 923
 
 People who do not keep their word, without faith, without honour,
 without truth, deceitful in heart, deceitful in speech; for which that
 amphibious animal in fable was once reproached, which held itself in a
 doubtful position between the fish and the birds ...
 
 It is important to kings and princes to be considered pious; and
 therefore they must confess themselves to you.
 
 
 
 
 NOTES
 
 
 The following brief notes are mainly based on those of M. Brunschvicg.
 But those of MM. Faugere, Molinier, and Havet have also been consulted.
 The biblical references are to the Authorised English Version. Those in
 the text are to the Vulgate, except where it has seemed advisable to
 alter the reference to the English Version.
 
 [1] P. 1, l. 1. _The difference between the mathematical and the
     intuitive mind._--Pascal is here distinguishing the logical or
     discursive type of mind, a good example of which is found in
     mathematical reasoning, and what we should call the intuitive type
     of mind, which sees everything at a glance. A practical man of sound
     judgment exemplifies the latter; for he is in fact guided by
     impressions of past experience, and does not consciously reason from
     general principles.
 
 [2] P. 2, l. 34. _There are different kinds_, etc.--This is probably a
     subdivision of the discursive type of mind.
 
 [3] P. 3, l. 31. _By rule._--This is an emendation by M. Brunschvicg.
     The MS. has _sans regle_.
 
 [4] P. 4, l. 3. _I judge by my watch._--Pascal is said to have always
     carried a watch attached to his left wrist-band.

     comedy.
 
 [7] P. 5, l. 24. _Cleobuline._--Princess, and afterwards Queen of
     Corinth, figures in the romance of Mademoiselle de Scudery, entitled
     _Artamene ou le Grand Cyrus_. She is enamoured of one of her
     subjects, Myrinthe. But she "loved him without thinking of love; and
     remained so long in that error, that this affection was no longer in
     a state to be overcome, when she became aware of it." The character
     is supposed to have been drawn from Christina of Sweden.
 
 [8] P. 6, l. 21. _Rivers are_, etc.--Apparently suggested by a chapter
     in Rabelais: _How we descended in the isle of Odes, in which the
     roads walk_.
 
 [9] P. 6, l. 30. _Salomon de Tultie._--A pseudonym adopted by Pascal as
     the author of the _Provincial Letters_.
 
 [10] P. 7, l. 7. _Abstine et sustine._--A maxim of the Stoics.
 
 [11] P. 7, l. 8. _Follow nature._--The maxim in which the Stoics summed
      up their positive ethical teaching.
 
 [12] P. 7, l. 9. _As Plato._--Compare Montaigne, _Essais_, iii, 9.
 
 [13] P. 9, l. 29. _We call this jargon poetical beauty._--According to
      M. Havet, Pascal refers here to Malherbe and his school.

      maxim in ancient Greek philosophy.
 
 [15] P. 11, l. 26. _That epigram about two one-eyed people._--M. Havet
      points out that this is not Martial's, but is to be found in
      _Epigrammatum Delectus_, published by Port-Royal in 1659.
 
           _Lumine AEon dextro, capta est Leonilla sinistro,
           Et potis est forma vincere uterque deos.

      time. His _Plaidoyers el Harangues_ appeared in 1657. _Plaidoyer
      VI_ is entitled _Pour un fils mis en religion par force_, and on
      the first page occurs the word _repandre_: "_Dieu qui repand des
      aveuglements et des tenebres sur les passions illegitimes._"
      Pascal's reference is probably to this passage.
 
 [19] P. 13, l. 12. _The Cardinal._--Mazarin. He was one of those
      statesmen who do not like condolences.
 
 [20] P. 14, l. 12. _Saint Thomas._--Thomas Aquinas (1223-74), one of the
      greatest scholastic philosophers.

      continued into the mind in imagination and the passions. It is
      therefore necessary for man so to alter, and adjust this mechanism,
      that it will always follow, and not obstruct, the good will.

 [195] P. 141. In the French edition on which this translation is based
       there was inserted the following fragment after No. 513:
 
         "Work out your own salvation with fear."
 
         Proofs of prayer. _Petenti dabitur._
 
         Therefore it is in our power to ask. On the other hand, there is
         God. So it is not in our power, since the obtaining of (the
         grace) to pray to Him is not in our power. For since salvation
         is not in us, and the obtaining of such grace is from Him,
         prayer is not in our power.
 
         The righteous man should then hope no more in God, for he ought
         not to hope, but to strive to obtain what he wants.
 
         Let us conclude then that, since man is now unrighteous since
         the first sin, and God is unwilling that he should thereby not
         be estranged from Him, it is only by a first effect that he is
         not estranged.
 
         Therefore, those who depart from God have not this first effect
         without which they are not estranged from God, and those who do
         not depart from God have this first effect. Therefore, those
         whom we have seen possessed for some time of grace by this first
         effect, cease to pray, for want of this first effect.
 
         Then God abandons the first in this sense.
 
         It is doubtful, however that this fragment should be included in
         the _Pensees_, and it has seemed best to separate it from the
         text. It has only once before appeared--in the edition of
         Michaut (1896). The first half of it has been freely translated
         in order to give an interpretation in accordance with a
         suggestion from M. Emile Boutroux, the eminent authority on
         Pascal. The meaning seems to be this. In one sense it is in our
         power to ask from God, who promises to give us what we ask. But,
         in another sense, it is not in our power to ask; for it is not
         in our power to obtain the grace which is necessary in asking.
         We know that salvation is not in our power. Therefore some
         condition of salvation is not in our power. Now the conditions
         of salvation are two: (1) The asking for it, and (2) the
         obtaining it. But God promises to give us what we ask. Hence the
         obtaining is in our power. Therefore the condition which is not
         in our power must be the first, namely, the asking. Prayer
         presupposes a grace which it is not within our power to obtain.
 
         After giving the utmost consideration to the second half of this
         obscure fragment, and seeking assistance from some eminent
         scholars, the translator has been compelled to give a strictly
         literal translation of it, without attempting to make sense.

 PREFACE.
 
 
 Those to whom the Life of Pascal and the Story of Port Royal are
 unknown, must be referred to works treating fully of the subject,
 since it were impossible to deal with them adequately within the
 limits of a preface. Sainte-Beuve's great work on Port Royal,
 especially the second and third volumes, and "Port Royal," by Charles
 Beard, B.A., London, 1863, may best be consulted by any who require
 full, lucid, and singularly impartial information.
 
 But for such as, already acquainted with the time and the man, need a
 recapitulation of the more important facts, or for those who may find
 an outline map useful of the country they are to study in detail, a
 few words are here given.
 
 Blaise Pascal was born at Clermont-Ferrand in Auvergne, on June 19,
 1623. He sprung from a well-known legal family, many members of which
 had held lucrative and responsible positions. His father, Etienne
 Pascal, held the post of intendant, or provincial administrator,
 in Normandy, where, and at Paris previously, Pascal lived from the
 age of sixteen to that of twenty-five; almost wholly educated by
 his father on account of his precarious health. His mother died
 when he was eight years old. Etienne Pascal was a pious but stern
 person, and by no means disposed to entertain or allow any undue
 exaltation in religion, refusing as long as he lived to allow his
 daughter Jaqueline to take the veil. But he had the usual faiths and
 superstitions of his time, and believing that his son's ill-health
 arose from witchcraft, employed the old woman who was supposed to
 have caused the malady to remove it, by herbs culled before sunrise,
 and the expiatory death of a cat. This made a great impression on his
 son, who in the "Thoughts" employs an ingenious argument to prove
 that wonders wrought by the invocation of the devil are not, in the
 proper sense of the term, miracles. At any rate the counter-charm was
 incomplete, as the child's feeble health remained feeble to the end.
 
 Intellectually, Blaise Pascal grew rapidly to the stature and
 strength of a giant; his genius showing itself mainly in the
 direction of mathematics; at the age of fifteen his studies on conic
 sections were thought worthy to be read before the most scientific
 men of Paris, and in after years of agonizing pain mathematical
 research alone was able to calm him, and distract his mind from
 himself. His actual reading was at all times narrow, and his
 scholarship was not profound. In 1646, his father, having broken
 his thigh at Rouen, came under the influence of two members of the
 Jansenist school of thought at that place, who attended him in his
 illness, and from that time dated the more serious religious views
 of the family. Jaqueline was from the first deeply affected by the
 more rigorous opinions with which she came in contact. Forbidden to
 enter the cloister, she lived at home as austere a life as though she
 had been professed, but after her father's death won her brother's
 reluctant consent to take the veil at Port Royal, and became one of
 the strictest nuns of that rigid rule.
 
 Blaise Pascal went through a double process of conversion. When the
 family first fell under Jansenist influence he threw himself so
 earnestly into the study of theology that he seriously injured his
 frail health, and being advised to refrain from all intellectual
 labour, he returned to the world of Paris, where his friends the
 Duc de Roannez, the Chevalier de Méré and M. Miton were among the
 best known and most fashionable persons. His father's death put him
 in possession of a fair fortune, which he used freely, not at all
 viciously, but with no renunciation of the pleasures of society.
 There is some evidence of a proposal that he should marry the Duc
 de Roannez' sister, and no doubt with such a scheme before him he
 wrote his celebrated "Discours sur les Passions de l'Amour." This,
 however, resulted only in the conversion of the duke and his sister,
 the latter of whom for a time, the former for the whole of his life,
 remained subject to the religious feelings then excited.
 
 In the autumn of 1654, whether after deliverance in a dangerous
 accident, or from some hidden cause of which nothing can now be even
 surmised, there came a second sudden conversion from which there was
 no return. That hour wrought a complete change in Pascal's life;
 austerity, self-denial, absolute obedience to his spiritual director,
 boundless alms-giving succeeded to what at most had been a moderate
 and restrained use of worldly pleasure, and he threw himself into the
 life, controversy and interests of Port Royal, with all the passion
 of one who was not only a new convert, but the champion of a society
 into which those dearest to him had entered even more fully than he.
 He became, for a time, one of the solitaries of Port Royal before the
 close of that same year.
 
 The Cistercian Abbey of Port Royal des Champs was situated about
 eighteen miles from Paris. It had been founded early in the
 thirteenth century, and would have faded away unremembered but for
 the grandeur of its closing years. The rule of the community had been
 greatly relaxed, but it was reformed with extreme rigour by Jaqueline
 Arnauld, its young abbess, known in religion as La Mère Angélique.
 The priest chosen as Director of the community was Jean du Vergier
 de Hauranne, Abbé de St. Cyran, a close friend of Cornelius Jansen,
 Bishop of Ypres. They had together devoted themselves to the study of
 Saint Augustine; and the "Augustinus," the work to which Jansen gave
 his whole life, was planned with the assistance of St. Cyran. Certain
 propositions drawn from this work were afterwards condemned, and the
 controversy which raged between the two schools of the Jesuits and
 the Jansenists divided itself into two parts, first, whether the
 propositions were heretical, and secondly, whether as a fact they
 were contained in, or could fairly be deduced from, Jansen's book.
 The strife, which raged with varying fortunes for many years, need
 not here detain us.
 
 After the reform of Port Royal, and when the Society, however
 assailed and in danger, was at the height of its renown, the whole
 establishment consisted of two convents, the mother house of Port
 Royal des Champs, and one in Paris to which was attached a school for
 girls. To Port Royal des Champs, as to a spiritual centre, and to be
 under the guidance of the three great directors, who in succession
 ruled the abbey, M. de St. Cyran, M. Singlin, and M. de Saci, there
 came men and women, not under monastic vows, but living for a time
 the monastic or even the eremitical life. The women, for the most
 part, had rooms in the convent, the men built rooms for themselves
 hard by, or shared between them La Grange, a farm belonging to the
 abbey. It need scarcely be said that in so strict a community the
 sexes were wholly separate; a common worship, and the confidence of
 the same confessor, together with similarity of views in religion,
 were the ties which bound together the whole society.
 
 When Pascal formally joined Port Royal, the Abbey and all that
 was attached to it greatly needed aid from without. A Bull in
 condemnation of Jansen had been gained from the Pope, and a
 Formulary, minimising its effect as far as possible, was drawn up
 by the General Assembly in France, which was ultimately accepted by
 Port Royal itself. But if the Port Royalists minimized the defeat,
 and, with great intellectual dexterity, showed that the condemned
 propositions were not in precise terms what they had held, and were
 not in Jansen's book, their adversaries exaggerated the victory. A
 confessor in Paris refused absolution to a parishioner because he
 had a Jansenist living in his house, and had sent his grand-daughter
 to school at Port Royal. Antoine Arnauld, known as Le Grand Arnauld,
 brother of La Mère Angélique, himself in danger of condemnation by
 the Sorbonne, drew up a statement of the case intended to instruct
 the public on the points in dispute. On reading this to the Port
 Royal solitaries before printing it, he saw that it would not do,
 and turning to Pascal, who had then been a year under M. Singlin's
 direction, he suggested to him as a younger man with a lighter pen
 to see what he could do. The next day Pascal produced the first of
 the "Provincial Letters," or to give it the correct title, "A Letter
 written to a Provincial by one of his friends." In these Letters
 Pascal formed his true style, and took rank at once among the great
 French writers. They contributed largely to turn the scale of feeling
 against his adversaries; they, and an occurrence in which he saw the
 visible finger of God, saved Port Royal for a time. But the history
 of the "Provincial Letters" must be read elsewhere, as must also in
 its fulness the miracle of the Holy Thorn, on which a few words are
 needed.
 
 The "Provincial Letters" were in course of publication, but M.
 Arnauld had been condemned by the Sorbonne just as the first was
 issued, and his enemies said he was excommunicated, which was not
 technically true; he was in danger of arrest, and was in hiding; the
 solitaries of Port Royal were almost all dispersed; the schools were
 thinned of their pupils and on the point of closing, the confessors
 were about to be withdrawn and the nuns sent to various other
 convents, when the miracle took place. Marguerite Perier, a child
 of ten years old, daughter of Pascal's elder sister, was one of the
 pupils at Port Royal in Paris, not as yet dismissed to her home. She
 was tenderly nursed by the nuns for an ulcer in the lachrymal gland,
 which had destroyed the bones of the nose, and produced other horrors
 of which there is no need to speak. A relic of the Saviour, one of
 the thorns of his crown of mockery, which had been intrusted to the
 nuns, was specially venerated during a service in its honour, and as
 it would seem was passed from hand to hand in its reliquary. When the
 turn of the scholars came, Sister Flavia, their mistress, moved by a
 sudden impulse said, "My child, pray for your eye," and touched the
 ulcer with the reliquary. The child was cured, and the effect on the
 community was immediate. The remaining solitaries were not dispersed,
 some of those who had gone returned, the confessors were not removed,
 the school was not closed, and Port Royal was respited.
 
 The miracle was to Pascal at once a solemn matter of religion and
 a family occurrence; he took henceforward as his cognizance an eye
 encircled with a crown of thorns and the motto _Scio cui credidi_, he
 jotted down various thoughts on the miracle, and the manner in which
 as it seemed to him God had by it given as by "a voice of thunder"
 his judgment in favour of Port Royal, and he sketched a plan of a
 work against atheists and unbelievers. In the year between the spring
 of 1657, and that of 1658, the last year of his good health, if that
 can be called good which was at best but feeble, he indicated the
 plan, and wrote the most finished paragraphs of his intended work.
 The detached thoughts which make up the bulk of it were scribbled,
 as they occurred to him during the last four years of his life, on
 scraps of paper, or on the margin of what he had already written,
 often when he was quite incapable of sustained employment. Many were
 dictated, some to friends, and some to a servant who constantly
 attended him in his illness.
 
 Towards the end of his life he was obliged to move into Paris again,
 where he was carefully nursed by his sister Madame Perrier, to whose
 house he was moved at the last, where he died on August 9th, 1662, at
 the age of thirty-nine, having spent his last years in an ecstasy of
 self-denial, of charity, and of aspiration after God.
 
 
 Not for six years after his death were his family and friends able
 to consider in what form his unfinished work should be given to the
 world. Then Port Royal had a breathing space, what was known as
 the Peace of the Church was established by Clement IX., and it was
 considered that the time had come to set in order these precious
 fragments. The duty of giving an author's works to the world as he
 left them was little understood in those days, and the Duc de Roannez
 even suggested that Pascal's whole work should be re-written on the
 lines he had laid down. Some editing was, on all hands, allowed to
 be needful; thus the arrangement of chapters, and the fragments to
 be included in chapters, were matter for fair discussion. But the
 committee of editors went further, and even when the text had been
 settled by them, it had to undergo a further censorship by various
 theologians. Finally, in January, 1670, the "Pensées" appeared as a
 small duodecimo, with a preface by the Perrier family, and no mention
 of Port Royal in the volume.
 
 For a full account of this and other editions, the reader must be
 referred to the preface to M. Molinier's edition, Paris, 1877-1879,
 and to that of M. Faugère, Paris, 1844.
 
 M. Victor Cousin was the first to draw attention to the need of a
 new edition of Pascal in 1842. He showed that great liberties had
 been taken with and suppressions made in the text, and the labour
 to which he invited was first undertaken by M. Prosper Faugère. M.
 Havet adopting his text departed from his arrangement, reverted in
 great measure to that of the old editors, and accompanied the whole
 by an excellent commentary and notes, 2nd edition, Paris, 1866. M.
 Molinier has again consulted the MSS. word for word, and while in a
 degree following M. Faugère's arrangement has yet been guided by his
 own skill and judgment. It must always be remembered that each editor
 must necessarily follow his own judgment in regard to the position
 he should give to fragments not placed by the writer. But provided
 that an editor makes no changes merely for the sake of change and
 that he loyally enters into the spirit of his predecessors, each new
 comer, till the arrangement is finally fixed, has a great advantage.
 Such an editor is M. Molinier, and in his arrangement the text of
 Pascal would seem to be mainly if not wholly fixed; so that for the
 first time we have not only Pascal's "Thoughts," but we have them
 approximately arranged as he designed to present them to his readers.
 
 The course of an English translator is clear; his responsibility is
 confined to deciding which text to follow, he has no right to make
 one for himself. In the present edition, therefore, M. Molinier's
 text and arrangement are scrupulously followed except in two places.
 In regard to one, M. Molinier has himself adopted a different
 reading in his notes made after the text was printed, the second is
 an obvious misprint. Pascal's "Profession of Faith," or "Amulet,"
 is transferred from the place it occupies in M. Molinier's edition
 to serve as an introduction to the work, striking as it does the
 key-note to the "Thoughts."
 
 Pascal's quotations from the Bible were made of course from the
 Vulgate, but very often indeed from memory, and incorrectly, while he
 often gave the substance alone of the passage he used. No one version
 of the Bible therefore has been used exclusively, but the Authorised
 Version and the Douai or Rheims versions have been used as each in
 turn most nearly afforded the equivalent of the quotations made by
 Pascal.
 
 The notes are mainly based on those of MM. Faugère, Havet, and
 Molinier.

 _GENERAL INTRODUCTION._
 
 
 Let them at least learn what is the Religion they assail, before they
 assail it. If this religion claimed to have a clear view of God, and
 to possess it openly and unveiled, then to say that we see nothing in
 the world which manifests him with this clearness would be to assail
 it. But since on the contrary it affirms that men are in darkness and
 estranged from God, that he has hidden himself from their knowledge,
 that the very name he has given himself in the Scriptures is _Deus
 absconditus_; and if indeed it aims equally at establishing these
 two points, that God has set in the Church evident notes to enable
 those who seek him in sincerity to recognise him, and that he has
 nevertheless so concealed them that he can only be perceived by those
 who seek him with their whole hearts; what advantages it them, when,
 in their professed neglect of the search after truth, they declare
 that nothing reveals it to them? For the very obscurity in which they
 are, and for which they blame the Church, does but establish one of
 the points which she maintains, without affecting the other, and far
 from destroying, establishes her doctrine.
 
 In order to assail it they ought to urge that they have sought
 everywhere with all their strength, and even in that which the Church
 proposes for their instruction, but without avail. Did they thus
 speak, they would indeed assail one of her claims. But I hope here to
 show that no rational person can thus speak, and I am even bold to
 say that no one has ever done so. We know well enough how men of this
 temper behave. They believe they have made great efforts for their
 instruction, when they have spent a few hours in reading some book
 of Scripture, and have talked with some Ecclesiastic on the truths
 of the faith. Whereupon they boast that they have in vain consulted
 books and men. But indeed I will tell them what I have often said,
 that such carelessness is intolerable. We are not here dealing with
 the light interest of a stranger, that we should thus treat it; but
 with that which concerns ourselves and our all.
 
 The immortality of the soul is a matter of so great moment to us,
 it touches us so deeply, that we must have lost all feeling if we
 are careless of the truth about it. Our every action and our every
 thought must take such different courses, according as there are or
 are not eternal blessings for which to hope, that it is impossible to
 take a single step with sense or judgment, save in view of that point
 which ought to be our end and aim.
 
 Thus our first interest and our first duty is to gain light on
 this subject, whereon our whole conduct depends. Therefore among
 unbelievers, I make a vast difference between those who labour with
 all their power to gain instruction, and those who live without
 taking trouble or thought for it.
 
 I can have nothing but compassion for all who sincerely lament their
 doubt, who look upon it as the worst of evils, and who, sparing no
 pains to escape it, find in that endeavour their principal and most
 serious occupation.
 
 But as for those who pass their life without thought of the ultimate
 goal of life, who, solely because they do not find within themselves
 the light of conviction, neglect to seek it elsewhere and to examine
 thoroughly whether the opinion in question be among those which are
 popularly received with credulous simplicity, or among those which,
 although in themselves obscure, have yet a solid and indestructible
 basis,--of those, I say, my thoughts are very different.
 
 This neglect of a matter in which themselves are concerned, their
 eternity, and their all, makes me angry rather than compassionate; it
 astonishes and terrifies me, it is to me something monstrous. I do
 not say this out of the pious zeal of a spiritual devotion. I mean
 on the contrary that such a feeling should spring from principles of
 human interest and self-love; and for this we need see no more than
 what is seen by the least enlightened persons.
 
 We need no great elevation of soul to understand that here is no
 true and solid satisfaction, that all our pleasures are but vanity,
 our evils infinite, and lastly that death, which threatens us every
 moment, must infallibly and within a few years place us in the dread
 alternative of being for ever either annihilated or wretched.
 
 Nothing is more real than this, nothing more terrible. Brave it out
 as we may, that is yet the end which awaits the fairest life in the
 world. Let us reflect on this, and then say if it be not certain that
 there is no good in this life save in the hope of another, that we
 are happy only in proportion as we approach it, and that as there is
 no more sorrow for those who have an entire assurance of eternity, so
 there is no happiness for those who have not a ray of its light.
 
 Assuredly then it is a great evil thus to be in doubt, but it is
 at least an indispensable duty to seek when we are in such doubt;
 he therefore who doubts and yet seeks not is at once thoroughly
 unhappy and thoroughly unfair. And if at the same time he be easy and
 content, profess to be so, and in fact pride himself thereon; if even
 it be this very condition of doubt which forms the subject of his
 joy and boasting, I have no terms in which to describe a creature so
 extravagant.
 
 Whence come such feelings? What delight can we find in the
 expectation of nothing but unavailing misery? What cause of boasting
 that we are in impenetrable darkness? How can such an argument as the
 following occur to a reasoning man?
 
 "I know not who has sent me into the world, nor what the world is,
 nor what I myself am; I am terribly ignorant of every thing; I know
 not what my body is, nor my senses, nor my soul, nor even that part
 of me which thinks what I say, which reflects on all and on itself,
 yet is as ignorant of itself as of all beside. I see those dreadful
 spaces of the universe which close me in, and I find myself fixed
 in one corner of this vast expanse, without knowing why I am set in
 this place rather than elsewhere, nor why this moment of time given
 me for life is assigned to this point rather than another of the
 whole Eternity which was before me or which shall be after me. I see
 nothing but infinities on every side, which close me round as an
 atom, and as a shadow which endures but for an instant and returns
 no more. I know only that I must shortly die, but what I know the
 least is this very death which I cannot avoid.
 
 "As I know not whence I come, so I know not whither I go; only this I
 know, that on departing this world, I shall either fall for ever into
 nothingness, or into the hands of an offended God, without knowing
 which of these two conditions shall eternally be my lot. Such is my
 state, full of weakness and uncertainty; from all which I conclude
 that I ought to pass all the days of my life without thought of
 searching for what must happen to me. Perhaps I might find some ray
 of light in my doubts, but I will not take the trouble, nor stir a
 foot to seek it; and after treating with scorn those who are troubled
 with this care, I will go without foresight and without fear to make
 trial of the grand event, and allow myself to be led softly on to
 death, uncertain of the eternity of my future condition."
 
 Who would wish to have for his friend a man who should thus speak;
 who would choose him rather than another for advice in business; who
 would turn to him in sorrow? And indeed to what use in life could we
 put him?
 
 In truth, it is the glory of Religion to have for enemies men so
 unreasoning, whose opposition is so little dangerous to her, that it
 the rather serves to establish her truths. For the Christian faith
 goes mainly to the establishment of these two points, the corruption
 of nature, and the Redemption by Jesus Christ. Now I maintain that
 if these men serve not to demonstrate the truth of Redemption by the
 holiness of their morals, they at least serve admirably to show the
 corruption of nature by sentiments so unnatural.
 
 Nothing is so important to man as his condition, nothing so
 formidable to him as eternity; and thus it is not natural there
 should be men indifferent to the loss of their being, and to the
 peril of an endless woe. They are quite other men in regard to all
 else; they fear the veriest trifles, they foresee them, they feel
 them; and the very man who spends so many days and nights in rage
 and despair for the loss of office or for some imaginary insult to
 his honour, is the same who, without disquiet and without emotion,
 knows that he must lose all by death. It is a monstrous thing to see
 in one and the same heart and at the same time this sensibility to
 the meanest, and this strange insensibility to the greatest matters.
 It is an incomprehensible spell, a supernatural drowsiness, which
 denotes as its cause an all powerful force.
 
 There must be a strange revolution in the nature of man, before he
 can glory at being in a state to which it seems incredible that any
 should attain. Experience however has shown me a large number of
 such men, a surprising fact did we not know that the greater part of
 those who meddle with the matter are not as a fact what they declare
 themselves. They are people who have been told that the manners of
 good society consist in such daring. This they call shaking off
 the yoke, this they try to imitate. Yet it would not be difficult
 to convince them how much they deceive themselves in thus seeking
 esteem. Not so is it acquired, even among those men of the world
 who judge wisely, and who know that the only way of worldly success
 is to show ourselves honourable, faithful, of sound judgment, and
 capable of useful service to a friend; because by nature men love
 only what may prove useful to them. Now in what way does it advantage
 us to hear a man say he has at last shaken off the yoke, that he
 does not believe there is a God who watches his actions, that he
 considers himself the sole master of his conduct and accountable for
 it only to himself. Does he think that thus he has brought us to
 have henceforward confidence in him, and to look to him for comfort,
 counsel and succour in every need of life? Do they think to delight
 us when they declare that they hold our soul to be but a little wind
 or smoke, nay, when they tell us so in a tone of proud content? Is
 this a thing to assert gaily, and not rather to say sadly as the
 saddest thing in all the world?
 
 Did they think on it seriously, they would see that this is so great
 a mistake, so contrary to good sense, so opposed to honourable
 conduct, so remote in every respect from that good breeding at which
 they aim, that they would choose rather to restore than to corrupt
 those who might have any inclination to follow them. And indeed if
 they are obliged to give an account of their opinions, and of the
 reasons they have for doubts about Religion, they will say things
 so weak and base, as rather to persuade the contrary. It was once
 happily said to such an one, "If you continue to talk thus you will
 really make me a Christian." And the speaker was right, for who would
 not be horrified at entertaining opinions in which he would have such
 despicable persons as his associates!
 
 Thus those who only feign these opinions would be very unhappy were
 they to put force on their natural disposition in order to make
 themselves the most inconsequent of men. If, in their inmost hearts,
 they are troubled at their lack of light, let them not dissemble:
 the avowal will bring no shame; the only shame is to be shameless.
 Nothing betrays so much weakness of mind as not to apprehend the
 misfortune of a man without God, nothing is so sure a token of an
 evil disposition of heart as not to desire the truth of eternal
 promises, nothing is more cowardly than to fight against God. Let
 them therefore leave these impieties to persons who are so ill-bred
 as to be really capable of them, let them at least be men of honour
 if they cannot be Christians, and lastly, let them recognise that
 there are but two classes of men who can be called reasonable; those
 who serve God with their whole heart because they know him, or those
 who seek him with their whole heart because they know him not.
 
 But as for those who live without knowing him and without seeking
 him, they judge themselves to deserve their own care so little, that
 they are not worthy the care of others, and it needs all the charity
 of the Religion they despise, not to despise them so utterly as to
 abandon them to their madness. But since this Religion obliges us
 to look on them, while they are in this life, as always capable of
 illuminating grace, and to believe that in a short while they may
 be more full of faith than ourselves, while we on the other hand
 may fall into the blindness which now is theirs, we ought to do for
 them what we would they should do for us were we in their place, and
 to entreat them to take pity on themselves and advance at least a
 few steps, if perchance they may find the light. Let them give to
 reading these words a few of the hours which otherwise they spend
 so unprofitably: with whatever aversion they set about it they may
 perhaps gain something; at least they cannot be great losers. But if
 any bring to the task perfect sincerity and a true desire to meet
 with truth, I despair not of their satisfaction, nor of their being
 convinced of so divine a Religion by the proofs which I have here
 gathered up, and have set forth in somewhat the following order....
 
 Before entering upon the proofs of the Christian Religion, I find it
 necessary to set forth the unfairness of men who live indifferent to
 the search for truth in a matter which is so important to them, and
 which touches them so nearly.
 
 Among all their errors this doubtless is the one which most proves
 them to be fools and blind, and in which it is most easy to confound
 them by the first gleam of common sense, and by our natural feelings.
 
 For it is not to be doubted that this life endures but for an
 instant, that the state of death is eternal, whatever may be its
 nature, and that thus all our actions and all our thoughts must take
 such different courses according to the state of that eternity, as to
 render it impossible to take a single step with sense and judgment,
 save in view of that point which ought to be our end and aim.
 
 Nothing is more clear than this, and therefore by all principles of
 reason the conduct of men is most unreasonable if they do not alter
 their course. Hence we may judge concerning those who live without
 thinking of the ultimate goal of life, who allow themselves to be
 guided by their inclinations and their pleasures without thought or
 disquiet, and, as if they could annihilate eternity by turning their
 minds from it, consider only how they may make themselves happy for
 the moment.
 
 Yet this eternity exists; and death the gate of eternity, which
 threatens them every hour, must in a short while infallibly reduce
 them to the dread necessity of being through eternity either nothing
 or miserable, without knowing which of these eternities is for ever
 prepared for them.
 
 This is a doubt which has terrible consequences. They are in danger
 of an eternity of misery, and thereupon, as if the matter were not
 worth the trouble, they care not to examine whether this is one of
 those opinions which men in general receive with a too credulous
 facility, or among those which, themselves obscure, have yet a solid
 though concealed foundation. Thus they know not whether the matter be
 true or false, nor if the proofs be strong or weak. They have them
 before their eyes, they refuse to look at them, and in that ignorance
 they choose to do all that will bring them into this misfortune if
 it exist, to wait for death to verify it, and to be in the meantime
 thoroughly satisfied with their state, openly avowing and even making
 boast of it. Can we think seriously on the importance of this matter
 without being revolted at conduct so extravagant?
 
 Such rest in ignorance is a monstrous thing, and they who live in it
 ought to be made aware of its extravagance and stupidity, by having
 it revealed to them, that they may be confounded by the sight of
 their own folly. For this is how men reason when they choose to live
 ignorant of what they are and do not seek to be enlightened. "I know
 not," say they....
 
 
 
 
 _NOTES_
 
 _FOR THE GENERAL INTRODUCTION._
 
 
 To doubt is then a misfortune, but to seek when in doubt is
 an indispensable duty. So he who doubts and seeks not is at
 once unfortunate and unfair. If at the same time he is gay and
 presumptuous, I have no terms in which to describe a creature so
 extravagant.
 
 
 A fine subject of rejoicing and boasting, with the head uplifted
 in such a fashion.... Therefore let us rejoice; I see not the
 conclusion, since it is uncertain, and we shall then see what will
 become of us.
 
 
 Is it courage in a dying man that he dare, in his weakness and agony,
 face an almighty and eternal God?
 
 
 Were I in that state I should be glad if any one would pity my folly,
 and would have the goodness to deliver me in despite of myself!
 
 
 Yet it is certain that man has so fallen from nature that there is in
 his heart a seed of joy in that very fact.
 
 
 A man in a dungeon, who knows not whether his doom is fixed, who has
 but one hour to learn it, and this hour enough, should he know that
 it is fixed, to obtain its repeal, would act against nature did he
 employ that hour, not in learning his sentence, but in playing piquet.
 
 So it is against nature that man, etc. It is to weight the hand of
 God.
 
 
 Thus not the zeal alone of those who seek him proves God, but the
 blindness of those who seek him not.
 
 
 We run carelessly to the precipice after having veiled our eyes to
 hinder us from seeing it.
 
 
 Between us and hell or heaven, there is nought but life, the frailest
 thing in all the world.
 
 
 If it be a supernatural blindness to live without seeking to know
 what we are, it is a terrible blindness to live ill while believing
 in God.
 
 
 The sensibility of man to trifles, and his insensibility to great
 things, is the mark of a strange inversion.
 
 
 This shows that there is nothing to say to them, not that we despise
 them, but because they have no common sense: God must touch them.
 
 
 We must pity both parties, but for the one we must feel the pity born
 of tenderness, and for the other the pity born of contempt.
 
 
 We must indeed be of that religion which man despises that we may not
 despise men.
 
 
 People of that kind are academicians and scholars, and that is the
 worst kind of men that I know.
 
 
 I do not gather that by system, but by the way in which the heart of
 man is made.
 
 
 To reproach Miton, that he is not troubled when God will reproach him.
 
 
 Is this a thing to say with joy? It is a thing we ought then to say
 with sadness.
 
 
 Nothing is so important as this, yet we neglect this only.
 
 
 This is all that a man could do were he assured of the falsehood of
 that news, and even then he ought not to be joyful, but downcast.
 
 
 ... Suppose an heir finds the title-deeds of his house. Will he say,
 "Perhaps they are forgeries?" and neglect to examine them?
 
 
 We must not say that this is a mark of reason.
 
 
 To be so insensible as to despise interesting things, and to become
 insensible to the point which most interests us.
 
 
 What then shall we conclude of all these obscurities, if not our own
 unworthiness?

 _THAT NATURE IS NATURALLY CORRUPT_.
 
 
 
 
 _PREFACE TO THE FIRST PART._
 
 
 To speak of those who have treated of the knowledge of self, of the
 divisions of Charron which sadden and weary us, of the confusion of
 Montaigne; that he was aware he had no definite system, and tried
 to evade the difficulty by leaping from subject to subject; that he
 sought to be fashionable.
 
 His foolish project of self-description, and this not casually and
 against his maxims, since everybody may make mistakes, but by his
 maxims themselves, and by his main and principal design. For to say
 foolish things by chance and weakness is an ordinary evil, but to say
 them designedly is unbearable, and to say of such that....
 
 
 _Montaigne._--Montaigne's defects are great. Lewd expressions. This
 is bad, whatever Mademoiselle de Gournay may say. He is credulous,
 _people without eyes_; ignorant, _squaring the circle, a greater
 world_. His opinions on suicide and on death. He suggests a
 carelessness about salvation, _without fear and without repentance_.
 Since his book was not written with a religious intent, it was not
 his duty to speak of religion; but it is always a duty not to turn
 men from it. We may excuse his somewhat lax and licentious opinions
 on some relations of life, but not his thoroughly pagan opinions on
 death, for a man must give over piety altogether, if he does not at
 least wish to die like a Christian. Now through the whole of his book
 he looks forward to nothing but a soft and indolent death.
 
 
 What good there is in Montaigne can only have been acquired with
 difficulty. What is evil in him, I mean apart from his morality,
 could have been corrected in a moment, if any one had told him he was
 too prolix and too egoistical.
 
 
 Not in Montaigne, but in myself, I find all that I see in him.
 
 
 Let no one say I have said nothing new, the disposition of my matter
 is new. In playing tennis, two men play with the same ball, but one
 places it better.
 
 It might as truly be said that my words have been used before. And if
 the same thoughts in a different arrangement do not form a different
 discourse, so neither do the same words in a different arrangement
 form different thoughts.
 
 
 
 
 _MAN'S DISPROPORTION._
 
 
 This is where our intuitive knowledge leads us. If it be not true,
 there is no truth in man; and if it be, he finds therein a great
 reason for humiliation, because he must abase himself in one way
 or another. And since he cannot exist without such knowledge, I
 wish that before entering on deeper researches into nature he
 would consider her seriously and at leisure, that he would examine
 himself also, and knowing what proportion there is.... Let man
 then contemplate the whole realm of nature in its full and exalted
 majesty, and turn his eyes from the low objects which hem him
 round; let him observe that brilliant light set like an eternal
 lamp to illumine the universe, let the earth appear to him a point
 in comparison with the vast circle described by that sun, and let
 him see with amazement that even this vast circle is itself but a
 fine point in regard to that described by the stars revolving in
 the firmament. If our view be arrested there, let imagination pass
 beyond, and it will sooner exhaust the power of thinking than nature
 that of giving scope for thought. The whole visible world is but an
 imperceptible speck in the ample bosom of nature. No idea approaches
 it. We may swell our conceptions beyond all imaginable space, yet
 bring forth only atoms in comparison with the reality of things.
 It is an infinite sphere, the centre of which is every where, the
 circumference no where. It is, in short, the greatest sensible mark
 of the almighty power of God, in that thought let imagination lose
 itself.
 
 Then, returning to himself, let man consider his own being compared
 with all that is; let him regard himself as wandering in this remote
 province of nature; and from the little dungeon in which he finds
 himself lodged, I mean the universe, let him learn to set a true
 value on the earth, on its kingdoms, its cities, and on himself.
 
 What is a man in the infinite? But to show him another prodigy no
 less astonishing, let him examine the most delicate things he knows.
 Let him take a mite which in its minute body presents him with
 parts incomparably more minute; limbs with their joints, veins in
 the limbs, blood in the veins, humours in the blood, drops in the
 humours, vapours in the drops; let him, again dividing these last,
 exhaust his power of thought; let the last point at which he arrives
 be that of which we speak, and he will perhaps think that here is the
 extremest diminutive in nature. Then I will open before him therein
 a new abyss. I will paint for him not only the visible universe, but
 all that he can conceive of nature's immensity in the enclosure of
 this diminished atom. Let him therein see an infinity of universes
 of which each has its firmament, its planets, its earth, in the
 same proportion as in the visible world; in each earth animals, and
 at the last the mites, in which he will come upon all that was in
 the first, and still find in these others the same without end and
 without cessation; let him lose himself in wonders as astonishing in
 their minuteness as the others in their immensity; for who will not
 be amazed at seeing that our body, which before was imperceptible in
 the universe, itself imperceptible in the bosom of the whole, is now
 a colossus, a world, a whole, in regard to the nothingness to which
 we cannot attain.
 
 Whoso takes this survey of himself will be terrified at the thought
 that he is upheld in the material being, given him by nature, between
 these two abysses of the infinite and nothing, he will tremble at the
 sight of these marvels; and I think that as his curiosity changes
 into wonder, he will be more disposed to contemplate them in silence
 than to search into them with presumption.
 
 For after all what is man in nature? A nothing in regard to the
 infinite, a whole in regard to nothing, a mean between nothing and
 the whole; infinitely removed from understanding either extreme. The
 end of things and their beginnings are invincibly hidden from him in
 impenetrable secrecy, he is equally incapable of seeing the nothing
 whence he was taken, and the infinite in which he is engulfed.
 
 What shall he do then, but discern somewhat of the middle of things
 in an eternal despair of knowing either their beginning or their end?
 All things arise from nothing, and tend towards the infinite. Who
 can follow their marvellous course? The author of these wonders can
 understand them, and none but he.
 
 Of these two infinites in nature, the infinitely great and the
 infinitely little, man can more easily conceive the great.
 
 Because they have not considered these infinities, men have rashly
 plunged into the research of nature, as though they bore some
 proportion to her.
 
 It is strange that they have wished to understand the origin of all
 that is, and thence to attain to the knowledge of the whole, with
 a presumption as infinite as their object. For there is no doubt
 that such a design cannot be formed without presumption or without a
 capacity as infinite as nature.
 
 If we are well informed, we understand that nature having graven her
 own image and that of her author on all things, they are almost all
 partakers of her double infinity. Thus we see that all the sciences
 are infinite in the extent of their researches, for none can doubt
 that geometry, for instance, has an infinite infinity of problems
 to propose. They are also infinite in the number and in the nicety
 of their premisses, for it is evident that those which are finally
 proposed are not self-supporting, but are based on others, which
 again having others as their support have no finality.
 
 But we make some apparently final to the reason, just as in regard to
 material things we call that an indivisible point beyond which our
 senses can no longer perceive any thing, though by its nature this
 also is infinitely divisible.
 
 Of these two scientific infinities, that of greatness is the
 most obvious to the senses, and therefore few persons have made
 pretensions to universal knowledge. "I will discourse of the all,"
 said Democritus.
 
 But beyond the fact that it is a small thing to speak of it simply,
 without proving and knowing, it is nevertheless impossible to do so,
 the infinite multitude of things being so hidden, that all we can
 express by word or thought is but an invisible trace of them. Hence
 it is plain how foolish, vain, and ignorant is that title of some
 books: _De omni scibili_.
 
 But the infinitely little is far less evident. Philosophers have much
 more frequently asserted they have attained it, yet in that very
 point they have all stumbled. This has given occasion to such common
 titles as _The Origin of Creation_, _The Principles of Philosophy_,
 and the like, as presumptuous in fact though not in appearance as
 that dazzling one, _De omni scibili_.
 
 We naturally think that we can more easily reach the centre of
 things than embrace their circumference. The visible bulk of the
 world visibly exceeds us, but as we exceed little things, we think
 ourselves more capable of possessing them. Yet we need no less
 capacity to attain the nothing than the whole. Infinite capacity
 is needed for both, and it seems to me that whoever shall have
 understood the ultimate principles of existence might also attain
 to the knowledge of the infinite. The one depends on the other, and
 one leads to the other. Extremes meet and reunite by virtue of their
 distance, to find each other in God, and in God alone.
 
 Let us then know our limits; we are something, but we are not all.
 What existence we have conceals from us the knowledge of first
 principles which spring from the nothing, while the pettiness of that
 existence hides from us the sight of the infinite.
 
 In the order of intelligible things our intelligence holds the same
 position as our body holds in the vast extent of nature.
 
 Restricted in every way, this middle state between two extremes is
 common to all our weaknesses.
 
 Our senses can perceive no extreme. Too much noise deafens us, excess
 of light blinds us, too great distance or nearness equally interfere
 with our vision, prolixity or brevity equally obscure a discourse,
 too much truth overwhelms us. I know even those who cannot understand
 that if four be taken from nothing nothing remains. First principles
 are too plain for us, superfluous pleasure troubles us. Too many
 concords are unpleasing in music, and too many benefits annoy, we
 wish to have wherewithal to overpay our debt. _Beneficia eo usque
 læta sunt dum videntur exsolvi posse; ubi multum antevenere, pro
 gratia odium redditur._
 
 We feel neither extreme heat nor extreme cold. Qualities in excess
 are inimical to us and not apparent to the senses, we do not feel but
 are passive under them. The weakness of youth and age equally hinder
 the mind, as also too much and too little teaching....
 
 In a word, all extremes are for us as though they were not; and we
 are not, in regard to them: they escape us, or we them.
 
 This is our true state; this is what renders us incapable both of
 certain knowledge and of absolute ignorance. We sail on a vast
 expanse, ever uncertain, ever drifting, hurried from one to the other
 goal. If we think to attach ourselves firmly to any point, it totters
 and fails us; if we follow, it eludes our grasp, and flies from
 us, vanishing for ever. Nothing stays for us. This is our natural
 condition, yet always the most contrary to our inclination; we burn
 with desire to find a steadfast place and an ultimate fixed basis
 whereon we may build a tower to reach the infinite. But our whole
 foundation breaks up, and earth opens to the abysses.
 
 We may not then look for certainty or stability. Our reason is always
 deceived by changing shows, nothing can fix the finite between the
 two infinites, which at once enclose and fly from it.
 
 If this be once well understood I think that we shall rest, each in
 the state wherein nature has placed him. This element which falls to
 us as our lot being always distant from either extreme, it matters
 not that a man should have a trifle more knowledge of the universe.
 If he has it, he but begins a little higher. He is always infinitely
 distant from the end, and the duration of our life is infinitely
 removed from eternity, even if it last ten years longer.
 
 In regard to these infinites all finites are equal, and I see not why
 we should fix our imagination on one more than on another. The only
 comparison which we can make of ourselves to the finite troubles us.
 
 Were man to begin with the study of himself, he would see how
 incapable he is of proceeding further. How can a part know the
 whole? But he may perhaps aspire to know at least the parts with
 which he has proportionate relation. But the parts of the world are
 so linked and related, that I think it impossible to know one without
 another, or without the whole.
 
 Man, for instance, is related to all that he knows. He needs place
 wherein to abide, time through which to exist, motion in order to
 live; he needs constituent elements, warmth and food to nourish him,
 air to breathe. He sees light, he feels bodies, he contracts an
 alliance with all that is.
 
 To know man then it is necessary to understand how it comes that he
 needs air to breathe, and to know the air we must understand how it
 has relation to the life of man, etc.
 
 Flame cannot exist without air, therefore to know one, we must know
 the other.
 
 All that exists then is both cause and effect, dependent and
 supporting, mediate and immediate, and all is held together by a
 natural though imperceptible bond, which unites things most distant
 and most different. I hold it impossible to know the parts without
 knowing the whole, or to know the whole without knowing the parts in
 detail.
 
 I hold it impossible to know one alone without all the others, that
 is to say impossible purely and absolutely.
 
 The eternity of things in themselves or in God must also confound
 our brief duration. The fixed and constant immobility of Nature in
 comparison with the continual changes which take place in us must
 have the same effect.
 
 And what completes our inability to know things is that they are in
 their essence simple, whereas we are composed of two opposite natures
 differing in kind, soul and body. For it is impossible that our
 reasoning part should be other than spiritual; and should any allege
 that we are simply material, this would far more exclude us from the
 knowledge of things, since it is an inconceivable paradox to affirm
 that matter can know itself, and it is not possible for us to know
 how it should know itself.
 
 So, were we simply material, we could know nothing whatever, and if
 we are composed of spirit and matter we cannot perfectly know what is
 simple, whether it be spiritual or material. For how should we know
 matter distinctly, since our being, which acts on this knowledge, is
 partly spiritual, and how should we know spiritual substances clearly
 since we have a body which weights us, and drags us down to earth.
 
 Moreover what completes our inability is the simplicity of things
 compared with our double and complex nature. To dispute this point
 were an invincible absurdity, for it is as absurd as impious to
 deny that man is composed of two parts, differing in their nature,
 soul and body. This renders us unable to know all things; for if
 this complexity be denied, and it be asserted that we are entirely
 material, it is plain that matter is incapable of knowing matter.
 Nothing is more impossible than this.
 
 Let us conceive then that this mixture of spirit and clay throws us
 out of proportion....
 
 Hence it comes that almost all philosophers have confounded different
 ideas, and speak of material things in spiritual phrase, and of
 spiritual things in material phrase. For they say boldly that bodies
 have a tendency to fall, that they seek after their centre, that
 they fly from destruction, that they fear a void, that they have
 inclinations, sympathies, antipathies; and all of these are spiritual
 qualities. Again, in speaking of spirits, they conceive of them as
 in a given spot, or as moving from place to place; qualities which
 belong to matter alone.
 
 Instead of receiving the ideas of these things simply, we colour them
 with our own qualities, and stamp with our complex being all the
 simple things which we contemplate.
 
 Who would not think, when we declare that all that is consists of
 mind and matter, that we really understood this combination? Yet it
 is the one thing we least understand. Man is to himself the most
 marvellous object in Nature, for he cannot conceive what matter is,
 still less what is mind, and less than all how a material body should
 be united to a mind. This is the crown of all his difficulties,
 yet it is his very being: _Modus quo corporibus adhæret spiritus
 comprehendi ab homine non potest et hoc tamen homo est_.
 
 These are some of the causes which render man so totally unable
 to know nature. For nature has a twofold infinity, he is finite
 and limited. Nature is permanent, and continues in one stay; he is
 fleeting and mortal. All things fail and change each instant, he
 sees them only as they pass, they have their beginning and end, he
 conceives neither the one nor the other. They are simple, he is
 composed of two different natures. And to complete the proof of our
 weakness, I will finish by this reflection on our natural condition.
 In a word, to complete the proof of our weakness, I will end with
 these two considerations....
 
 
 The nature of man may be considered in two ways, one according to
 its end, and then it is great and incomparable; the other according
 to popular opinion, as we judge of the nature of a horse or a dog,
 by popular opinion which discerns in it the power of speed, _et
 animum arcendi_; and then man is abject and vile. These are the two
 ways which make us judge of it so differently and which cause such
 disputes among philosophers.
 
 For one denies the supposition of the other; one says, _He was not
 born for such an end, for all his actions are repugnant to it_; the
 other says, _He cannot gain his end when he commits base deeds_.
 
 Two things instruct man about his whole nature, instinct and
 experience.
 
 
 _Inconstancy._--We think we are playing on ordinary organs when we
 play upon man. Men are organs indeed, but fantastic, changeable,
 and various, with pipes not arranged in due succession. Those who
 understand only how to play upon ordinary organs make no harmonies on
 these. We should know where are the....
 
 
 _Nature._--Nature has placed us so truly in the centre, that if we
 alter one side of the balance we alter also the other. This makes me
 believe that there is a mechanism in our brain, so adjusted, that who
 touches one touches also the contrary spring.
 
 
 _Lustravit lampade terras._--The weather and my moods have little
 in common. I have my foggy and my fine days within me, whether my
 affairs go well or ill has little to do with the matter. I sometimes
 strive against my luck, the glory of subduing it makes me subdue it
 gaily, whereas I am sometimes wearied in the midst of my good luck.
 
 
 It is difficult to submit anything to the judgment of a second
 person without prejudicing him by the way in which we submit it. If
 we say, "I think it beautiful, I think it obscure," or the like, we
 either draw the imagination to that opinion, or irritate it to form
 the contrary. It is better to say nothing, so that the other may
 judge according to what really is, that is to say, as it then is,
 and according as the other circumstances which are not of our making
 have placed it. We at least shall have added nothing of our own,
 except that silence produces an effect, according to the turn and
 the interpretation which the other is inclined to give it, or as he
 may conjecture it, from gestures or countenance, or from the tone of
 voice, if he be a physiognomist; so difficult is it not to oust the
 judgment from its natural seat, or rather so rarely is it firm and
 stable!
 
 
 The spirit of this sovereign judge of the world is not so independent
 but that it is liable to be troubled by the first disturbance about
 him. The noise of a cannon is not needed to break his train of
 thought, it need only be the creaking of a weathercock or a pulley.
 Do not be astonished if at this moment he argues incoherently, a fly
 is buzzing about his ears, and that is enough to render him incapable
 of sound judgment. Would you have him arrive at truth, drive away
 that creature which holds his reason in check, and troubles that
 powerful intellect which gives laws to towns and kingdoms. Here is a
 droll kind of god! _O ridicolosissimo eroe!_
 
 
 The power of flies, which win battles, hinder our soul from action,
 devour our body.
 
 
 When we are too young our judgment is at fault, so also when we are
 too old.
 
 If we take not thought enough, or too much, on any matter, we are
 obstinate and infatuated.
 
 He that considers his work so soon as it leaves his hands, is
 prejudiced in its favour, he that delays his survey too long, cannot
 regain the spirit of it.
 
 So with pictures seen from too near or too far; there is but one
 precise point from which to look at them, all others are too near or
 too far, too high or too low. Perspective determines that precise
 point in the art of painting. But who shall determine it in truth or
 morals?
 
 
 When I consider the short duration of my life, swallowed up in the
 eternity before and after, the small space which I fill, or even can
 see, engulfed in the infinite immensity of spaces whereof I know
 nothing, and which know nothing of me, I am terrified, and wonder
 that I am here rather than there, for there is no reason why here
 rather than there, or now rather than then. Who has set me here? By
 whose order and design have this place and time been destined for
 me?--_Memoria hospitis unius diei prætereuntis_.
 
 
 It is not well to be too much at liberty. It is not well to have all
 we want.
 
 
 How many kingdoms know nothing of us!
 
 The eternal silence of these infinite spaces alarms me.
 
 
 Nothing more astonishes me than to see that men are not astonished
 at their own weakness. They act seriously, and every one follows his
 own mode of life, not because it is, as a fact, good to follow, being
 the custom, but as if each man knew certainly where are reason and
 justice. They find themselves constantly deceived, and by an amusing
 humility always imagine that the fault is in themselves, and not in
 the art which all profess to understand. But it is well there are so
 many of this kind of people in the world, who are not sceptics for
 the glory of scepticism, to show that man is thoroughly capable of
 the most extravagant opinions, because he is capable of believing
 that his weakness is not natural and inevitable, but that, on the
 contrary, his wisdom comes by nature.
 
 Nothing fortifies scepticism more than that there are some who are
 not sceptics. If all were so, they would be wrong.
 
 
 Two infinites, a mean. If we read too quickly or too slowly, we
 understand nothing.
 
 
 Too much and too little wine. Give a man none, he cannot find truth,
 give him too much, the same.
 
 
 Chance gives thoughts, and chance takes them away; there is no art
 for keeping or gaining them.
 
 A thought has escaped me. I would write it down. I write instead,
 that it has escaped me.
 
 
 In writing down my thought it now and then escapes me, but this
 reminds me of my weakness, which I constantly forget. This teaches
 me as much as my forgotten thought, for my whole study is to know my
 nothingness.
 
 
 Are men so strong, as to be insensible to all which affects them? Let
 us try them in the loss of goods or honour. Ah! the charm is worked.
 
 
 To fear death out of danger, and not in danger, for we must be men.
 
 Sudden death is the only thing to fear, therefore confessors live in
 the houses of the great.
 
 
 We know ourselves so little, that many think themselves near death
 when they are perfectly well, and many think themselves well when
 they are near death, since they do not feel the fever at hand, or the
 abscess about to form.
 
 
 Why is my knowledge so restricted, or my height, or my life to a
 hundred years rather than to a thousand? What was nature's reason for
 giving me such length of days, and for choosing this number rather
 than another, in that infinity where there is no reason to choose one
 more than another, since none is preferable to another?
 
 
 The nature of man is not always to go forward, it has its advances
 and retreats.
 
 Fever has its hot and cold fits, and the cold proves as well as the
 hot how great is the force of the fever.
 
 
 The inventions of men from age to age follow the same plan. It is the
 same with the goodness and the wickedness of the world in general.
 
 _Plerumque gratæ principibus vices._
 
 
 The strength of a man's virtue must not be measured by his occasional
 efforts, but by his ordinary life.
 
 
 Those great spiritual efforts to which the soul sometimes attains are
 things on which it takes no permanent hold. It leaps to them, not as
 to a throne, for ever, but only for an instant.
 
 
 I do not admire the excess of a virtue as of valour, unless I see at
 the same time the excess of the opposite virtue, as in Epaminondas,
 who had exceeding valour and exceeding humanity, for otherwise we do
 not rise, but fall. Grandeur is not shown by being at one extremity,
 but in touching both at once, and filling the whole space between.
 But perhaps this is only a sudden motion of the soul from one to the
 other extreme, and in fact it is always at one point only, as when a
 firebrand is whirled. Be it so, but at least this marks the agility
 if not the magnitude of the soul.
 
 
 We do not remain virtuous by our own power, but by the counterpoise
 of two opposite vices, we remain standing as between two contrary
 winds; take away one of these vices, we fall into the other.
 
 
 When we would pursue the virtues to their extremes on either side,
 vices present themselves, which insinuate themselves insensibly
 there, in their insensible course towards the infinitely great, so
 that we lose ourselves in vices, and no longer see virtues.
 
 
 It is not shameful to man to yield to pain, and it is shameful to
 yield to pleasure. This is not because pain comes from without
 us, while we seek pleasure, for we may seek pain, and yield to it
 willingly without this kind of baseness. How comes it then that
 reason finds it glorious in us to yield under the assaults of
 pain, and shameful to yield under the assaults of pleasure? It is
 because pain does not tempt and attract us. We ourselves choose it
 voluntarily, and will that it have dominion over us. We are thus
 masters of the situation, and so far man yields to himself, but in
 pleasure man yields to pleasure. Now only mastery and empire bring
 glory, and only slavery causes shame.
 
 
 All things may prove fatal to us, even those made to serve us, as
 in nature walls may kill us and stairs may kill us, if we walk not
 aright.
 
 The slightest movement affects all nature, the whole sea changes
 because of a rock. Thus in grace, the most trifling action has effect
 on everything by its consequences; therefore everything is important.
 
 
 Provided we know each man's ruling passion we are sure of pleasing
 him; yet each man has his fancies, contrary to his real good, even in
 the very idea he forms of good; a strange fact which puts all out of
 tune.
 
 
 When our passions lead us to any act we forget our duty. If we
 like a book we read it, when we should be doing something else.
 But as a reminder we ought to propose to ourselves to do something
 distasteful; we then excuse ourselves that we have something else to
 do, and thus remember our duty.
 
 
 Sneezing absorbs all the faculties of the soul, as do certain bodily
 functions, but we do not draw therefrom the same conclusions against
 the greatness of man, because it is against his will. And if we make
 ourselves sneeze we do so against our will. It is not in view of
 the act itself, but for another end, and so it is not a mark of the
 weakness of man, and of his slavery to that act.

 he has to say, so full is he of the desire of talking.

 The sense of falseness in present pleasures, and our ignorance of the
 vanity of absent pleasures, are the causes of inconstancy.
 
 
 He no longer loves the person he loved ten years ago. I can well
 believe it. She is no longer the same, nor is he. He was young, and
 so was she; she is quite different. He would perhaps love her still
 were she what she then was.
 
 
 Reasons, seen from afar, appear to restrict our view, but not when we
 reach them; we begin to see beyond.
 
 
 ... We look at things not only from other sides, but with other eyes,
 and care not to find them alike.
 
 
 Diversity is so ample, that all tones of voice, all modes of walking,
 coughing, blowing the nose, sneering. We distinguish different kinds
 of vine by their fruit, and name them the Condrieu, the Desargues,
 and this stock. But is this all? Has a vine ever produced two bunches
 exactly alike, and has a bunch ever two grapes alike? etc.
 
 I never can judge of the same thing exactly in the same way. I cannot
 judge of my work while engaged on it. I must do as the painters,
 stand at a distance, but not too far. How far, then? Guess.
 
 
 _Diversity._--Theology is a science; but at the same time how many
 sciences! Man is a whole, but if we dissect him, will man be the
 head, the heart, the stomach, the veins, each vein, each portion of a
 vein, the blood, each humour of the blood?
 
 A town, a champaign, is from afar a town and a champaign; but as we
 approach there are houses, trees, tiles, leaves, grass, emmets, limbs
 of emmets, in infinite series. All this is comprised under the word
 champaign.
 
 
 We like to see the error, the passion of Cleobuline, because she is
 not aware of it. She would be displeasing if she were not deceived.
 
 
 What a confusion of judgment is that, by which every one puts himself
 above all the rest of the world, and loves his own advantage and the
 duration of his happiness or his life above those of all others.
 
 
 
 
 _DIVERSION._
 
 
 Diversion.--When I have set myself now and then to consider the
 various distractions of men, the toils and dangers to which they
 expose themselves in the court or the camp, whence arise so many
 quarrels and passions, such daring and often such evil exploits,
 etc., I have discovered that all the misfortunes of men arise from
 one thing only, that they are unable to stay quietly in their own
 chamber. A man who has enough to live on, if he knew how to dwell
 with pleasure in his own home, would not leave it for sea-faring
 or to besiege a city. An office in the army would not be bought so
 dearly but that it seems insupportable not to stir from the town, and
 people only seek conversation and amusing games because they cannot
 remain with pleasure in their own homes.
 
 But upon stricter examination, when, having found the cause of all
 our ills, I have sought to discover the reason of it, I have found
 one which is paramount, the natural evil of our weak and mortal
 condition, so miserable that nothing can console us when we think of
 it attentively.
 
 Whatever condition we represent to ourselves, if we bring to our
 minds all the advantages it is possible to possess, Royalty is the
 finest position in the world. Yet, when we imagine a king surrounded
 with all the conditions which he can desire, if he be without
 diversion, and be allowed to consider and examine what he is, this
 feeble happiness will never sustain him; he will necessarily fall
 into a foreboding of maladies which threaten him, of revolutions
 which may arise, and lastly, of death and inevitable diseases; so
 that if he be without what is called diversion he is unhappy, and
 more unhappy than the humblest of his subjects who plays and diverts
 himself.
 
 Hence it comes that play and the society of women, war, and offices
 of state, are so sought after. Not that there is in these any real
 happiness, or that any imagine true bliss to consist in the money won
 at play, or in the hare which is hunted; we would not have these as
 gifts. We do not seek an easy and peaceful lot which leaves us free
 to think of our unhappy condition, nor the dangers of war, nor the
 troubles of statecraft, but seek rather the distraction which amuses
 us, and diverts our mind from these thoughts.
 
 Hence it comes that men so love noise and movement, hence it comes
 that a prison is so horrible a punishment, hence it comes that the
 pleasure of solitude is a thing incomprehensible. And it is the great
 subject of happiness in the condition of kings, that all about them
 try incessantly to divert them, and to procure for them all manner of
 pleasures.
 
 The king is surrounded by persons who think only how to divert the
 king, and to prevent his thinking of self. For he is unhappy, king
 though he be, if he think of self.
 
 That is all that human ingenuity can do for human happiness. And
 those who philosophise on the matter, and think men unreasonable
 that they pass a whole day in hunting a hare which they would not
 have bought, scarce know our nature. The hare itself would not free
 us from the view of death and our miseries, but the chase of the
 hare does free us. Thus, when we make it a reproach that what they
 seek with such eagerness cannot satisfy them, if they answered as on
 mature judgment they should do, that they sought in it only violent
 and impetuous occupation to turn their thoughts from self, and that
 therefore they made choice of an attractive object which charms and
 ardently attracts them, they would leave their adversaries without a
 reply. But they do not so answer because they do not know themselves;
 they do not know they seek the chase and not the quarry.
 
 They fancy that were they to gain such and such an office they would
 then rest with pleasure, and are unaware of the insatiable nature of
 their desire. They believe they are honestly seeking repose, but they
 are only seeking agitation.
 
 They have a secret instinct prompting them to look for diversion
 and occupation from without, which arises from the sense of their
 continual pain. They have another secret instinct, a relic of the
 greatness of our primitive nature, teaching them that happiness
 indeed consists in rest, and not in turmoil. And of these two
 contrary instincts a confused project is formed within them,
 concealing itself from their sight in the depths of their soul,
 leading them to aim at rest through agitation, and always to imagine
 that they will gain the satisfaction which as yet they have not, if
 by surmounting certain difficulties which now confront them, they may
 thereby open the door to rest.
 
 Thus rolls all our life away. We seek repose by resistance to
 obstacles, and so soon as these are surmounted, repose becomes
 intolerable. For we think either on the miseries we feel or on those
 we fear. And even when we seem sheltered on all sides, weariness, of
 its own accord, will spring from the depths of the heart wherein are
 its natural roots, and fill the soul with its poison.
 
 
 The counsel given to Pyrrhus to take the rest of which he was going
 in search through so many labours, was full of difficulties.
 
 
 A gentleman sincerely believes that the chase is a great, and even a
 royal sport, but his whipper-in does not share his opinion.
 
 _Dancing._--We must think where to place our feet.
 
 
 But can you say what object he has in all this? The pleasure of
 boasting to-morrow among his friends that he has played better
 than another. Thus others sweat in their closets to prove to the
 learned world that they have solved an algebraical problem hitherto
 insoluble, while many more expose themselves to the greatest perils,
 in my judgment as foolishly, for the glory of taking a town. Again,
 others kill themselves, by their very application to all these
 studies, not indeed that they may grow wiser, but simply to prove
 that they know them; these are the most foolish of the band, because
 they are so wittingly, whereas it is reasonable to suppose of the
 others, that were they but aware of it, they would give over their
 folly.
 
 A man passes his life without weariness in playing every day for a
 small stake. Give him each morning, on condition he does not play,
 the money he might possibly win, and you make him miserable. It will
 be said, perhaps, that he seeks the amusement of play, and not the
 winnings. Make him then play for nothing, he will not be excited over
 it, and will soon be wearied. Mere diversion then is not his pursuit,
 a languid and passionless amusement will weary him. He must grow
 warm in it, and cheat himself by thinking that he is made happy by
 gaining what he would despise if it were given him not to play; and
 must frame for himself a subject of passion and excitement to employ
 his desire, his wrath, his fear, as children are frightened at a face
 they themselves have daubed.
 
 Whence comes it that a man who within a few months has lost his
 only son, or who this morning was overwhelmed with law suits and
 wrangling, now thinks of them no more? Be not surprised; he is
 altogether taken up with looking out for the boar which his hounds
 have been hunting so hotly for the last six hours. He needs no more.
 However full of sadness a man may be, he is happy for the time, if
 you can only get him to enter into some diversion. And however happy
 a man may be, he will soon become dispirited and miserable if he be
 not diverted and occupied by some passion or pursuit which hinders
 his being overcome by weariness. Without diversion no joy, with
 diversion no sadness. And this forms the happiness of persons in high
 position, that they have a number of people to divert them, and that
 they have the power to keep themselves in this state.
 
 Take heed to this. What is it to be superintendent, chancellor, first
 president, but to be in a condition wherein from early morning a vast
 number of persons flock in from every side, so as not to leave them
 an hour in the day in which they can think of themselves? And if they
 are in disgrace and dismissed to their country houses, though they
 want neither wealth nor retinue at need, they yet are miserable and
 desolate because no one hinders them from thinking of themselves.
 
 Thus man is so unhappy that he wearies himself without cause of
 weariness by the peculiar state of his temperament, and he is so
 frivolous that, being full of a thousand essential causes of
 weariness, the least thing, such as a cue and a ball to strike with
 it, is enough to divert him.
 
 
 _Diversions._--Men are charged from infancy with the care of their
 honour, their fortunes, and their friends, and more, with the care
 of the fortunes and honour of their friends. They are overwhelmed
 with business, with the study of languages and bodily exercises;
 they are given to understand that they cannot be happy unless their
 health, their honour, their fortune and that of their friends be in
 good condition, and that a single point wanting will render them
 unhappy. Thus we give them business and occupations which harass them
 incessantly from the very dawn of day. A strange mode, you will say,
 of making them happy. What more could be done to make them miserable?
 What could be done? We need only release them from all these cares,
 for then they would see themselves; they would think on what they
 are, whence they come, and whither they go, and therefore it is
 impossible to occupy and distract them too much. This is why, after
 having provided them with constant business, if there be any time to
 spare we urge them to employ it in diversion and in play, so as to be
 always fully occupied.
 
 
 How comes it that this man, distressed at the death of his wife and
 his only son, or who has some great and embarrassing law suit, is not
 at this moment sad, and that he appears so free from all painful and
 distressing thoughts? We need not be astonished, for a ball has just
 been served to him, and he must return it to his opponent. His whole
 thoughts are fixed on taking it as it falls from the pent-house, to
 win a chase; and you cannot ask that he should think on his business,
 having this other affair in hand. Here is a care worthy of occupying
 this great soul, and taking away from him every other thought of the
 mind. This man, born to know the Universe, to judge of all things, to
 rule a State, is altogether occupied and filled with the business of
 catching a hare. And if he will not abase himself to this, and wishes
 always to be highly strung, he will only be more foolish still,
 because he wishes to raise himself above humanity; yet when all is
 said and done he is only a man, that is to say capable of little and
 of much, of all and of nothing. He is neither angel nor brute, but
 man.
 
 One thought alone occupies us, we cannot think of two things at once;
 a good thing for us from a worldly point of view, but not as regards
 God.
 
 
 _Diversion._--Death is easier to bear without the thought of it, than
 is the thought of death without danger.
 
 
 _Diversion._--Men, unable to remedy death, sorrow, and ignorance,
 determine, in order to make themselves happy, not to think on these
 things.
 
 Notwithstanding these miseries, man wishes to be happy, and wishes
 for happiness only; unable to wish otherwise, he knows not how to
 gain happiness. For this he must needs make himself immortal; but
 unable to effect this, he sets himself to avoid the thought of death.
 
 
 The miseries of human life are the cause of all this; having a
 perception of them men take to diversion.
 
 
 _Diversion._--If man were happy he would be the more so the less he
 was diverted, like the Saints and God.
 
 Yes: but is not the power of being pleased with diversion in itself
 a happiness? No; for that comes from elsewhere and from without, so
 it is dependent, and therefore liable to be troubled by a thousand
 accidents, which make afflictions inevitable.
 
 
 _Misery._--The one thing which consoles us for our miseries is
 diversion, yet this itself is the greatest of our miseries. For
 this it is which mainly hinders us from thinking of ourselves, and
 which insensibly destroys us. Without this we should be weary, and
 weariness would drive us to seek a more abiding way out of it. But
 diversion beguiles us and leads us insensibly onward to death.
 
 
 This is all they have been able to discover to console them in so
 many evils. But it is a miserable consolation, since it does not
 serve for the cure of the evil, but simply for the concealment of
 it for a short time, and its very concealment prevents the thought
 of any true cure. Thus by a strange inversion of man's nature he
 finds that the weariness which is his most sensible evil, is in
 some measure his greatest good, because more than any thing else it
 contributes to make him seek his true healing, and that the diversion
 which he regards as his greatest good is in fact his greatest evil,
 because more than any thing else it prevents his seeking the remedy
 for his evils. Both of these are admirable proofs of man's misery and
 corruption, and at the same time of his greatness, since man is only
 weary of all things, and only seeks this multitude of occupations
 because he has the idea of a lost happiness. And not finding this in
 himself, he seeks it vainly in external things, without being able to
 content himself, because it is neither in us, nor in the creature,
 but in God alone.
 
 
 _Thoughts._--_In omnibus requiem quæsivi._
 
 Were our condition truly happy we need not turn our minds from it in
 order to become happy.
 
 A little matter consoles us, because a little matter afflicts us.
 
 
 Strife alone pleases us and not the victory. We like to see beasts
 fighting, not the victor furious over the vanquished. We wish only to
 see the victorious end, and as soon as it comes, we are surfeited. It
 is the same in play, and in the search for truth. In all disputes we
 like to see the clash of opinions, but care not at all to contemplate
 truth when found. If we are to see truth with pleasure, we must see
 it arise out of conflict.
 
 So in the passions, there is pleasure in seeing the shock of two
 contraries, but as soon as one gains the mastery it becomes mere
 brutality. We never seek things in themselves, but only the search
 for things. So on the stage, quiet scenes which raise no emotion are
 worthless, so is extreme and hopeless misery, so are brutal lust and
 excessive cruelty.
 
 
 Continuous eloquence wearies.
 
 Princes and kings sometimes unbend. They are not for ever on
 their thrones, where they grow weary. Grandeur to be felt must be
 abandoned, continuity in any thing is displeasing. Cold is pleasant,
 that we may seek warmth.
 
 
 _Weariness._--Nothing is so insupportable to man as to be completely
 at rest, without passion, without business, without diversion,
 without study. He then feels his nothingness, his loneliness, his
 insufficiency, his dependence, his weakness, his emptiness.
 
 At once, from the depth of his soul, will arise weariness, gloom,
 sadness, vexation, disappointment, despair.
 
 
 _Agitation._--When a soldier complains of his work, or a ploughman,
 etc., force them to be idle.
 
 
 _Diversion._--Is not the royal dignity itself so truly great as to
 make its possessor happy by the mere contemplation of what he is?
 Must he be diverted from this thought like ordinary people? I see
 well enough that a man may be made happy by diverting him from the
 thought of his domestic sorrows so that he apply all his care to
 excel in dancing. But will it be the same with a king, and will he be
 happier if he devote himself to these idle amusements rather than to
 the contemplation of his greatness? And what more satisfactory object
 can he offer to his mind? Might it not be to lessen his content that
 he occupy his soul in thinking how to suit his steps to the cadence
 of an air, or how to throw a bar skilfully, rather than allow it to
 enjoy peacefully the contemplation of the majesty which wraps him
 round? Let us make the experiment, let us leave a king all alone,
 without any gratifications of sense, or any occupation for the mind,
 without companions, reflecting on himself at leisure, and it will be
 seen that a king without diversion is a man full of miseries. This is
 therefore carefully avoided, and there are always about the persons
 of kings a great number of people who watch to see that diversion
 succeeds to business, and look after their every hour of leisure to
 furnish them with pleasures and games, so that no vacancy may be
 left in life; that is, they are surrounded with persons who take
 wonderful pains that the king is never alone and able to think of
 self, knowing well that he will be miserable, king though he is, if
 he think of self.
 
 In all this I am not speaking of Christian kings as Christians, but
 simply as kings.
 
 
 Men busy themselves in pursuing a ball or a hare, and this is the
 pleasure even of kings.
 
 
 Cæsar, as it seems to me, was too old to set about amusing himself
 with the conquest of the world. Such a pastime was good for Augustus
 or Alexander, who were still young men, and these are difficult to
 restrain, but Cæsar should have been more mature.
 
 
 The weariness we experience in leaving occupations to which we are
 attached. A man lives with pleasure in his home, but if he see a
 woman who charms him, or if he take pleasure in play for five or
 six days, he is miserable if he return to his former mode of life.
 Nothing is more common than that.
 
 
 _Frivolity._--It is plain that the frivolity of the world is so
 little known, that it is a strange and surprising thing to say it is
 foolish to seek for greatness, and this is great cause for wonder.
 
 
 Whoso does not see the frivolity of the world is himself most
 frivolous. And indeed all see it save young people, who are engaged
 in turmoil, diversion, and the thought of the future. But take away
 their diversion and you will see them consumed with weariness; then
 they feel their nothingness without knowing it. For it is indeed to
 be unhappy to be intolerably sad as soon as we are reduced to the
 thought of self, without any diversion.
 
 
 
 
 _THE GREATNESS AND LITTLENESS OF MAN._
 
 
 Greatness, _Littleness_.--The more light we have, the more greatness
 and the more baseness we discover in man.
 
 Ordinary men....
 
 The more cultivated....
 
 Philosophers.
 
 They astonish ordinary men.
 
 Christians. They astonish Philosophers.
 
 Who then will be surprised to see that Religion only makes us know
 deeply what we already know in proportion to our light.
 
 
 _For Port Royal. Greatness and Littleness._
 
 Littleness being correlative to greatness, and greatness to
 littleness, some have inferred man's littleness all the more because
 they have taken his greatness as a proof of it, and others have
 inferred his greatness with all the more force, because they have
 inferred it from his littleness; all that the one party was able
 to say for his greatness having served only as an argument of his
 littleness to others, because we are low in proportion to the height
 from which we have fallen, and the contrary is equally true. So that
 the one party returns on the other in an endless circle, for it is
 certain that in measure as men possess light the more they discern
 both the greatness and the littleness of man. In a word, man knows he
 is little. He is then little because he is so; but he is truly great
 because he knows it.
 
 
 Man knows not in what rank to place himself. He has evidently gone
 astray and fallen from his true place, unable to find it again.
 Disquieted and unsuccessful he seeks it everywhere in impenetrable
 darkness.
 
 
 Though we see all the miseries which close upon us and take us by the
 throat, we have an irrepressible instinct which raises us.
 
 
 _The greatness of Man._--We have so great an idea of the human soul
 that we cannot bear to be despised, or to lie under the disesteem of
 any soul, and all the happiness of men consists in that esteem.
 
 
 The search after glory is the greatest vileness of man. Yet it is
 also the greatest mark of his excellence, for whatever riches he may
 have on earth, whatever health and advantage, he is not satisfied if
 he have not the esteem of men. He rates human reason so highly that
 whatever privileges he may have on earth, he is not content unless
 he stand well in the judgment of men. This is the finest position in
 the world, nothing can turn him from this desire, which is the most
 indelible quality of the human heart.
 
 And those who most despise men, and place them on the level of the
 brutes, still wish to be admired and believed by men, and are in
 contradiction with themselves through their own feelings; their
 nature, which is stronger than all else, convincing them of the
 greatness of man more powerfully than reason convinces them of their
 vileness.
 
 
 The vileness of man in that he submits himself to the brutes, and
 even worships them.
 
 
 Instinct and reason, marks of two natures.
 
 
 Description of man. Dependence, desire of independence, bodily needs.
 
 
 Contradiction. To despise existence, to die for nothing, to hate our
 existence.
 
 
 Man is neither angel nor brute, and the misfortune is that whoever
 would play the angel plays the brute.
 
 
 If man is not made for God, why is he happy only in God?
 
 If man is made for God, why is he so contrary to God?
 
 
 Contraries. Man is naturally credulous and incredulous, timid and
 rash.
 
 
 _A corrupt nature._--Man does not act by reason, which constitutes
 his essence.
 
 
 The nature of man is his whole nature, _omne animal_.
 
 There is nothing we cannot make natural, nothing natural we cannot
 lose.
 
 
 The true nature being lost, all becomes natural. As the true good
 being lost, all becomes truly good.
 
 
 _Misery._--Solomon and Job best knew, and have best spoken of
 human misery; the former the most fortunate, the latter the most
 unfortunate of men; the one knowing by experience the vanity of
 pleasure, the other the reality of evil.
 
 
 It is dangerous to prove to man too plainly how nearly he is on
 a level with the brutes without showing him his greatness; it is
 also dangerous to show him his greatness too clearly apart from his
 vileness. It is still more dangerous to leave him in ignorance of
 both. But it is of great advantage to show him both.
 
 
 How comes it that we have so much patience with those who are maimed
 in body, and so little with those who are defective in mind? Because
 a cripple recognises that we have the true use of our legs, but the
 fool maintains that we are they whose understanding halts; were it
 not so we should feel pity and not anger.
 
 Epictetus puts it yet more strongly: "How comes it that we are not
 angry if a man says we have an headache, but are angry if told we use
 a weak argument or make a wrong choice?" The reason of this is that
 we are quite certain we have no headache, or are not lame, but we are
 not equally sure that our judgment is correct. So having no assurance
 but that we see with our whole powers of sight, we are startled and
 confounded when another with equal powers sees the exact opposite,
 especially when a thousand others laugh at our decision; for then
 we must prefer our light to that of so many others, a daring and
 difficult matter. There is never this contradiction in feeling as to
 a cripple.
 
 Man is so framed that by dint of telling him he is a fool he believes
 it, and by dint of telling it to himself he makes himself believe it.
 For man holds a secret communing with himself, which it behoves him
 well to regulate: _Corrumpunt mores bonos colloquia prava_. We must
 keep silent as much as possible, and converse with ourselves only of
 God, whom we know to be true, and thus we persuade ourselves of truth.
 
 
 I will not suffer him to rest on himself, nor on another, so that
 being without a resting place or repose....
 
 
 If he exalt himself I humble him, if he humble himself I exalt
 him, and ever contradict him, till he comprehend that he is an
 incomprehensible monster.
 
 
 The greatness of man consists in thought.
 
 
 _A thinking reed._--Not from space must I seek my dignity, but from
 the ruling of my thought. I should have no more if I possessed whole
 worlds. By space the Universe encompasses and swallows me as an atom,
 by thought I encompass it.
 
 
 Man is but a reed, weakest in nature, but a reed which thinks. It
 needs not that the whole Universe should arm to crush him. A vapour,
 a drop of water is enough to kill him. But were the Universe to crush
 him, man would still be more noble than that which has slain him,
 because he knows that he dies, and that the Universe has the better
 of him. The Universe knows nothing of this.
 
 
 All our dignity therefore consists in thought. By this must we raise
 ourselves, not by space or duration which we cannot fill. Then let us
 make it our study to think well, for this is the starting-point of
 morals.
 
 
 The greatness of man is great in that he knows he is miserable. A
 tree does not know that it is miserable.
 
 It is therefore little to know ourselves little, and it is great to
 know ourselves little.
 
 Thus his very infirmities proves man's greatness. They are the
 infirmities of a great lord, of a discrowned king.
 
 
 The greatness of man is so evident that it is even proved by his
 littleness. For what in animals is nature we call in man littleness,
 whereby we recognise that his nature being now like that of animals
 he is fallen from a better nature which once was his.
 
 For what man ever was unhappy at not being a king, save a discrowned
 king? Was Paulus Emilius unhappy at being no longer consul? On the
 contrary, all men thought him happy in having filled that office,
 because it was involved in it that it should be but temporary. But
 Perseus was thought so unhappy in being no longer king, because the
 condition of royalty involved his being always king, that it was
 thought strange he could bear to live. No man thinks himself unhappy
 in having but one mouth, but any man is unhappy if he have but one
 eye. No man was ever grieved at not having three eyes, but any man is
 inconsolable if he have none.
 
 
 _Perseus, King of Macedon._--Paulus Emilius reproached Perseus for
 not killing himself.
 
 
 There is no misery apart from sensation. A ruined house is not
 miserable. Man only is miserable. _Ego vir videns._
 
 
 It is then thought which makes man's being, and without this we
 cannot conceive him. What is it in us which feels pleasure? The hand?
 The arm? The flesh? The blood? We see that it roust be something
 immaterial.
 
 
 I can easily conceive a man without hands, feet, head, for it is only
 experience which teaches us that the head is more necessary than the
 feet. But I cannot conceive a man without thought; he would be a
 stone or a brute.
 
 
 Man is evidently made for thought, this is his whole dignity and his
 whole merit; his whole duty is to think as he ought. Now the order of
 thought is to begin with self, and with its author and its end.
 
 Now of what thinks the world? Never of these things, but of dancing,
 playing the lute, singing, making verses, tilting at the ring, etc.,
 of fighting, making ourselves kings, without thinking what it is to
 be a king, or what to be a man.
 
 
 _Thought._--The whole dignity of man lies in thought But what is this
 thought? how foolish it is!
 
 
 Thought is then in its nature admirable and incomparable. It must
 have strange defects to be despicable, but it has these, and so
 nothing is more ridiculous.
 
 How great it is in essence, how vile in defects!
 
 
 _Contraries._ _After having shown the vileness and the greatness of
 man._--Let man now estimate his value. Let him love himself, because
 he has a nature capable of good, but let him not therefore love
 the vileness which exists in that nature. Let him despise himself,
 because this capacity is void, but let him not therefore despise his
 natural capacity. Let him hate himself, let him love himself: he has
 in himself the power of knowing the truth and being happy, and yet
 has found no truth either permanent or satisfactory.
 
 I would then lead man to the desire of finding it; to be free from
 passions and ready to follow it where he may find it, knowing how his
 knowledge is obscured by the passions. I would that he should hate
 in himself the desires which bias his judgment, that they may neither
 blind him in making his choice, nor obstruct him when he has chosen.
 
 
 I blame equally those who take on themselves to praise man, those
 who take on themselves to blame him, and those who merely amuse
 themselves; I can approve those only who seek with tears.
 
 
 The stoics say, "Retire within yourselves, there will you find your
 rest;" which is not true. Others say, "Go out of yourselves, seek
 your happiness in diversion;" nor is that true, for sickness may come.
 
 Happiness is neither without us nor within us; it is in God, both
 without us and within us.
 
 
 
 
 _OF THE DECEPTIVE POWERS OF THE IMAGINATION_.
 
 
 _Of the deceptive powers_.--Man is only a subject full of natural
 error, which is indelible without grace. Nothing shows him the truth,
 everything deceives him. These two principles of truth, reason and
 the senses, in addition to the fact that they are both wanting in
 sincerity, reciprocally deceive each other. The senses trick the
 reason by false appearances, and gain from reason in their turn the
 same deception with which they deceive; reason avenges herself. The
 passions of the soul trouble the senses, and make on them false
 impressions. They lie and deceive, outvying one another.
 
 But beyond those errors which come by accident, and by a lack of
 intelligence, with these heterogeneous faculties.... _To begin thus
 the chapter on the deceptive powers_.
 
 
 _Imagination._--This is that deceitful part of man, the mistress of
 error and falsity, the more knavish that she is not always so, for
 she would be an infallible rule of truth, if she were an infallible
 rule of lying. But being for the most part false, she gives no mark
 of her character, stamping the true and the false with the same die.
 
 I speak not of fools, but of the wisest men, and it is among them
 that imagination has the great gift of persuasion. Reason protests in
 vain, for she can make no true estimate.
 
 This proud potentate, who loves to rule and domineer over her enemy,
 reason, has established in man a second nature in order to show her
 wide-spread influence. She makes men happy and miserable, sound and
 sick, rich and poor; she obliges reason to believe, doubt and deny;
 she dulls the senses, or sharpens them; she has her fools and wise;
 and nothing vexes us more than to see that she fills her votaries
 with a satisfaction far more full and entire than does reason. Those
 whose imagination is active feel greater complacency than the truly
 wise can reasonably allow themselves to feel. They look down on
 other men as from the height of empire, they argue with assurance
 and confidence, others with diffidence and fear, and this gaiety
 of countenance often gives the former an advantage in the minds of
 their hearers; such favour do the imaginary wise find from judges
 like-minded. Imagination cannot make fools wise, but it makes them
 content, and so triumphs over reason, which can only make its friends
 miserable; the one covers them with glory, the other with shame.
 
 What but this faculty of imagination dispenses reputation, assigns
 respect and veneration to persons, works, laws, and the great? How
 valueless are all the treasures of earth without her consent!
 
 You would say that this magistrate whose reverend age commands the
 respect of a whole people is swayed by pure and lofty reason, that he
 judges all causes according to their true nature, unmoved by those
 mere accidents which only affect the imagination of the weak. See him
 go to sermon with devout zeal, strengthening his firm and impartial
 reason by the ardour of his divine love. He is ready to listen with
 exemplary respect. The preacher appears; but if nature have given him
 a hoarse voice or a comic face, if his barber have shaven him ill, or
 if his clothes be splashed more than is wont, then however great the
 truths he announces, I wager that our statesman lose his gravity.
 
 Set the greatest philosopher in the world on a plank really wider
 than he needs, but hanging over a precipice, and though reason
 convince him of his security, imagination will prevail. Many will
 scarce bear the thought without a cold sweat.
 
 I will not name all its effects. Every one knows that the sight of
 cats, and rats, or the crushing of a coal, etc., may quite unhinge
 the reason. The tone of voice will affect the wisest and change the
 whole force of a speech or a poem.
 
 Love or hate will change the aspect of justice, and an advocate
 retained with a large fee has an increased confidence in the right
 of the cause he pleads, while the assurance of his demeanour commends
 it to the judges, duped in their turn by appearances. How ridiculous
 is reason, swayed by a breath in every direction!
 
 I should have to enumerate almost every action of men who seldom
 stagger but under her shocks. For reason has been forced to yield,
 and the wisest reason accepts as her own those principles which the
 imagination of men has everywhere casually introduced.
 
 Our magistrates are well aware of this mystery. Their scarlet robes,
 the ermine in which they wrap themselves like furred cats, the halls
 in which they administer justice, the _fleurs-de-lis_, and all their
 august apparatus are most necessary; if the doctors had not their
 cassocks and their mules, if the lawyers had not their square caps,
 and their robes four times too wide, they would never have duped the
 world, which cannot resist so authoritative an appearance. Soldiers
 alone are not disguised after this fashion, because indeed their part
 is the more essential, they establish themselves by force, the others
 by fraud.
 
 So our kings seek out no disguises. They do not mask themselves in
 strange garments to appear such, but they are accompanied by guards
 and halberdiers. Those armed puppets who have hands and power for
 them alone, those trumpets and drums which go before them, and those
 legions round about them, make the firmest tremble. They have not
 dress only, but power; we need an highly refined reason to regard as
 an ordinary man the Grand Turk, in his superb seraglio, surrounded
 with forty thousand janissaries.
 
 We cannot even see an advocate in his long robe and with his cap on
 his head, without an enhanced opinion of his ability.
 
 If magistrates had true justice, and if doctors had the true art of
 healing, they would have no need of square caps, the majesty of these
 sciences were of itself venerable enough. But having only imaginary
 knowledge, they must take these instruments, idle, but striking to
 the imagination with which they have to deal, and by that in fact
 they gain respect.
 
 Imagination is the disposer of all things, it creates beauty, justice
 and happiness, and these are the world's all. I should much like to
 see an Italian work, of which I know the title only, but such a title
 is worth many books: _Della opinione Regina del mondo_. I accept the
 book without knowing it, save the evil in it, if there be any.
 
 These are for the most part the effects of that deceptive faculty,
 which seems to have been given us expressly to lead us into necessary
 error. Of error however we have many other sources.
 
 Not only are old impressions capable of deceiving us, the charms of
 novelty have the same power. Hence arise all the disputes of men,
 who charge each other either with following the false impressions
 of childhood or of running rashly after new. Who rightly keeps a
 middle way? Let him appear and make good his pretensions. There is
 no principle, however natural to us even from childhood, which may
 not be made to pass for a false impression either of education or of
 sense.
 
 "Because," say some, "you have believed from childhood that a box
 was empty when you saw nothing in it, you have therefore believed
 the possibility of a vacuum. This is an illusion of your senses,
 strengthened by custom, which science must correct." "Because," say
 others, "you were taught at school that there is no such thing as
 a vacuum, your common sense, which clearly comprehended the matter
 before, is corrupted, and you must correct this false impression by
 returning to your primitive nature." Which has deceived you, your
 senses or your education?
 
 Diseases are another source of error. They impair our judgment and
 our senses, and if the more violent produce a sensible change, I
 do not doubt that slighter ailments produce each its proportionate
 impression.
 
 Our own interest is again a wonderful instrument for putting out our
 eyes in a pleasant way. The man of greatest probity can not be judge
 in his own cause; I know some who that they may not fall into this
 self love are, out of opposition, thoroughly unjust. The certain way
 of ruining a just cause has been to get it recommended to these men
 by their near relatives.
 
 Justice and truth are two such subtle points, that our instruments
 are too blunt to touch them accurately. If they attain the point
 they cover it so completely that they rest more often on the wrong
 than the right.
 
 
 There is internecine war in man between the reason and the passions.
 
 If he had only reason without passions....
 
 If he had only passions without reason....
 
 But having both he must have continual strife, since he cannot be at
 peace with one unless he be at war with the other. Hence he is always
 divided against and contrary to himself.
 
 
 The habit of seeing kings accompanied by guards, drums, officers
 and all those things which mechanically incline man to respect and
 terror, causes their countenance, when now and then seen alone, and
 without these accompaniments, to impress respect and terror on their
 subjects, because our thought cannot separate their personality from
 those surroundings with which it is ordinarily joined. And the world
 which does not know that the effect arises from habit, believes that
 it arises from natural force, and hence come such expressions as:
 "The character of Divinity is imprinted on his countenance," etc.
 
 
 The power of kings is based both on the reason and the folly of the
 people, and mainly on their folly. The greatest and most important
 matter in the world has weakness for its foundation, and this
 foundation is admirably sure, for there is nothing more sure than
 this, that the people will be weak. What is founded on sound reason
 is very ill founded, as the value of wisdom.
 
 
 The chancellor is grave, and clothed with ornaments, for his position
 is unreal. Not so the king, he has power and nothing to do with
 imagination. Judges, doctors, etc., depend solely on imagination.
 
 
 Empire founded on opinion and imagination lasts some time, the rule
 is gentle and willingly accepted; that founded on power lasts for
 ever. Thus opinion is, as it were, queen of the world, but power is
 its tyrant.
 
 Power is the queen of the world, not opinion, but opinion makes use
 of power.
 
 Power creates opinion. Gentleness is beautiful, as we think. Why?
 Because he who goes to extremes will be alone, and I will make a
 stronger cabal of people who will say it is inexpedient.
 
 
 The cords attached by the respect of man for man, are, for the most
 part, cords of necessity, for there must be different degrees, all
 men wishing to rule, but not all being able to do so, though some are
 able.
 
 Let us suppose then we see men beginning to form a society. They will
 no doubt fight till the stronger party gets the better of the weaker,
 and a dominant party is constituted. But so soon as this is once
 settled, the masters not wishing that the strife should continue,
 declare that the power in their hands shall be transmitted as they
 please, some placing it in the choice of the people, others in the
 succession of birth, etc.
 
 And here imagination begins to play her part. Till now power has
 constrained facts, now power is upheld by imagination in a certain
 party, in France that of the nobles, in Switzerland that of the
 burgesses, etc.
 
 The cords therefore which bind the respect of men to any given man
 are the cords of imagination.
 
 
 Our imagination so enlarges the present by dint of continually
 reflecting on it, and so contracts eternity, by never reflecting on
 it, that we make a nothing of eternity and an eternity of nothing;
 and all this has such living roots in us, that all our reason cannot
 suppress them, and that....
 
 
 The imagination enlarges little objects so as to fill our soul with
 its fantastic estimate, and by a rash insolence belittles the great
 to its own measure, as when it speaks of God.
 
 
 Things which have the greatest hold on us, as the concealing
 our small possessions, are often a mere nothing. It is a nothing
 which our imagination magnifies into a mountain, another turn of
 imagination would make us discover its nothingness without difficulty.
 
 
 Two faces which resemble each other, neither of which alone causes
 our laughter, make us laugh, when together, by their resemblance.
 
 
 Children who are frightened at the face they have daubed are mere
 children, but how shall one who is so weak when a child grow truly
 strong as he grows old? We only change our fancies.
 
 
 All that is brought to perfection by progress perishes also by
 progress. All that has been weak can never be absolutely strong. It
 is in vain to say, "He has grown, he has changed." He is also the
 same.
 
 
 My fancy makes me hate a man who breathes hard when he is eating.
 Fancy has great weight. Will you profit by yielding to this weight
 because it is natural? No; but by resisting it.
 
 
 _Prejudice leading into error._--It is a deplorable thing to see all
 men deliberating on means alone, and not on the end. Every man thinks
 how he may acquit himself in his condition, but as for the choice of
 condition or of country, chance gives them to us.
 
 It is a pitiable thing, to see so many Turks, heretics and infidels,
 follow the way of their fathers for the simple reason that each has
 been told it is the best. And that fixes for each man his condition,
 locksmith, soldier, etc.
 
 Therefore savages would care nothing for Provence.
 
 
 _Ferox gens, nullam esse vitam sine armis rati._ They love death
 rather than peace, other men love death rather than war.
 
 Every opinion may be held in preference to life, of which the love
 seems so strong and so natural.
 
 
 _Thoughts._--All is one, all is diverse. How many natures in that of
 man, how many vocations! And by what a chance does each man take
 ordinarily what he has heard praised. A well turned heel.
 
 
 _The heel of a slipper._--How well this is turned, here is a clever
 workman, how brave is this soldier! Such is the source of our
 inclinations and of the choice of conditions. How much this man
 drinks, how little that man! That is what makes men sober or drunken,
 soldiers, cowards, etc.
 
 
 _Glory._--Admiration spoils everything from infancy. How well said,
 how well done, how clever he is! etc.
 
 The children of Port Royal, who are not urged with this spur of envy
 and glory, become careless.
 
 
 _Glory._--The brutes have no admiration for each other. A horse does
 not admire his companion. Not but that they have their rivalries in
 a race, but that entails no consequences, for once in the stable the
 heaviest and most ill-formed does not yield his oats to another,
 as men would expect from others in their own case. Their virtue is
 satisfied with itself.
 
 
 First degree: to be blamed for doing evil, and praised for doing
 good. Second degree: to be neither praised nor blamed.
 
 
 Brave deeds are most estimable when hidden. When I see some of these
 in history they please me much. But after all they have not been
 wholly hidden, since they have become known. And though all has been
 done to hide them that could be done, the little whereby they have
 appeared has spoiled all, for what was finest in them was the desire
 to hide them.
 
 
 We are not content with the life we have in ourselves and in our
 own being, we wish to live an imaginary life in the idea of others,
 and to this end we strive to make a show. We labour incessantly to
 embellish and preserve this imaginary being, and we neglect the true.
 And if we have either calmness, generosity, or fidelity, we hasten to
 let it be known, that we may attach these virtues to that imaginary
 being; we would even part with them for this end, and gladly become
 cowards for the reputation of valour. It is a great mark of the
 nothingness of our own being that we are not satisfied with the one
 without the other, and that we often renounce one for the other. For
 he would be infamous who would not die to preserve his honour.
 
 
 _Vocations._--The sweetness of glory is so great that join it to what
 we will, even to death, we love it.
 
 
 Evil is easy, and its forms are infinite; good is almost unique. But
 a certain kind of evil is as difficult to find as what is called
 good; and often on this account this particular kind of evil gets
 passed off as good. There is even needed an extraordinary greatness
 of soul to attain to it as well as to good.
 
 
 We are so presumptuous that we would fain be known by the whole
 world, even by those who shall come after, when we are no more. And
 we are such triflers that the esteem of five or six persons about us
 diverts and contents us.
 
 
 Vanity is so anchored in the heart of man that a soldier, a
 camp-follower, a cook, a porter makes his boasts, and is for having
 his admirers; even philosophers wish for them. Those who write
 against it, yet desire the glory of having written well, those who
 read, desire the glory of having read; I who write this have, may be,
 this desire, and perhaps those who will read it....
 
 
 In towns through which we pass we care not whether men esteem us, but
 we do care if we have to live there any time. How long is needed? A
 time in proportion to our vain and fleeting life.
 
 
 The condition of man; inconstancy, weariness, unrest.
 
 
 Whoever will know fully the vanity of man has but to consider the
 causes and the effects of love. The cause is an unknown quantity, and
 the effects are terrible. This unknown quantity, so small a matter
 that we cannot recognise it, moves a whole country, princes, armies,
 and all the world.
 
 Cleopatra's nose: had it been shorter, the face of the world had been
 changed.
 
 
 Nothing better shows the frivolity of men than to consider what are
 the causes and what the effects of love, for all the universe is
 changed by them. Cleopatra's nose.
 
 
 _Frivolity._--The cause and the effects of love. Cleopatra.
 
 
 Pride is a counterpoise, and turns the scale against all woes. Here
 is a strange monster, a very visible aberration. Behold him fallen
 from his place, and anxiously seeking it. That is what all men do.
 Let us see who has found it.
 
 
 _Contradiction._--Pride is a counterpoise to all miseries. Man either
 conceals them, or if he display them, glories in the knowledge of
 them.
 
 
 _Of the desire of being esteemed by those with whom we are._--Pride
 has a natural possession of us in the midst of our miseries, errors,
 etc. We can even lose our life with joy, if men will but talk of it.
 
 Vanity, play, hunting, visiting, false pretences, a lasting name.
 
 
 _Pride._--Curiosity is mere frivolity. For the most part we want to
 know only for the sake of talking. People would not make voyages if
 they were never to speak of them, for the sole pleasure of seeing,
 without hope of ever communicating their impressions.
 
 
 
 
 _OF JUSTICE, CUSTOMS, AND PREJUDICES._
 
 
 On what shall man found the economy of the world which he would
 fain govern? If on the caprice of each man, all is confusion. If on
 justice, man is ignorant of it.
 
 Certainly had he known it, he would not have established the maxim,
 most general of all current among men, that every one must conform to
 the manners of his own country; the splendour of true equity would
 have brought all nations into subjection, and legislators would not
 have taken as their model the fancies and caprice of Persians and
 Germans instead of stable justice. We should have seen it established
 in all the States of the world, in all times, whereas now we see
 neither justice nor injustice which does not change its quality
 upon changing its climate. Three degrees of latitude reverse all
 jurisprudence, a meridian decides what is truth, fundamental laws
 change after a few years of possession, right has its epochs, the
 entrance of Saturn into the Lion marks for us the origin of such and
 such a crime. That is droll justice which is bounded by a stream!
 Truth on this side of the Pyrenees, error on that.
 
 It is admitted that justice is not in these customs, but that it
 resides in natural laws common to every country. This would no
 doubt be maintained with obstinacy if the rash chance which has
 disseminated human laws had lighted upon even one that is universal,
 but the singularity of the matter is that owing to the vagaries of
 human caprice there is not one.
 
 Theft, incest, infanticide, parricide, all have found a place among
 virtuous actions. Can there be any thing more absurd than that a
 man should have the right to kill me because he lives across the
 water, and because his prince has a quarrel with mine, although I
 have none with him? There are no doubt natural laws, but fair reason
 once corrupted has corrupted all. _Nihil amplius nostrum est; quod
 nostrum dicimus, artis est. Ex senatus consultis, et plebiscitis
 crimina exercentur. Ut olim vitiis, sic nunc legibus laboramus_.
 
 From this confusion it results that one declares the essence
 of justice to be the authority of the legislator, another, the
 convenience of the sovereign, another, existing custom, and this is
 the most sure; nothing which follows reason alone is just in itself,
 all shifts and changes with time; custom creates equity, by the
 simple reason that this is received. It is the mystical foundation
 of its authority, whoever carries it back to first principles
 annihilates it. Nothing is so faulty as those laws which correct
 faults. Whoever obeys them because they are just, obeys an imaginary
 justice, not law in its essence; it is altogether self-contained, it
 is law and nothing more. Whoever will examine its motive will find
 it so feeble and so slight that if he be not used to contemplate the
 marvels of human imagination, he will wonder that a single century
 has gained for it so much pomp and reverence. It is the art of
 disturbance and of revolution to shake established customs, sounding
 them to their source, to mark their want of authority and justice. We
 must, it is said, return to the primitive and fundamental laws of the
 State, abolished by unjust custom. It is a game wherein we are sure
 to lose all; in this balance nothing would be true, yet the people
 easily lends an ear to such talk as this. They shake off the yoke as
 soon as they recognise it, and the great profit by its ruin, and by
 the ruin of those who have too curiously examined recognised customs.
 This is why the wisest of law givers said that it was often necessary
 to cheat men for their good, and another, a good politician, _Quum
 veritatem qua liberetur ignoret, expedit quod fallatur_. We ought not
 to feel the truth that law is but usurpation; it was once introduced
 without reason, and has become reasonable; it is necessary to cause
 it to be regarded as eternal and authoritative, and to conceal the
 beginning if we do not wish it should soon come to an end.
 
 
 I have passed much of my life believing that justice existed, and in
 this I did not deceive myself, for there is justice according as God
 has willed to reveal it to us. But I did not take it so, and in that
 I deceived myself, for I believed that our justice was essentially
 just, and that I had that whereby I was able to know and judge of
 it. But I so often find that my right judgment was at fault, that at
 last I have begun to distrust myself, and then others. I saw in all
 countries that men change, and thus after many changes of judgment
 concerning true justice, I recognised that our nature was a continual
 change, and I have not changed since; were I to change I should but
 strengthen my opinion. The sceptic Archesilas became a dogmatist.
 
 
 The most unreasonable things in the world become most reasonable,
 because of the unruly lives of men. What is less reasonable than to
 choose the eldest son of a queen to guide a state? for we do not
 choose as steersman of a ship that one of the passengers who is of
 the best family. Such a law would be ridiculous and unjust; but since
 they are so themselves, and ever will be, it becomes reasonable and
 just. For would they choose the most virtuous and able, we at once
 fall to blows, since each asserts that he is the most virtuous and
 able. Let us then affix this quality to something which cannot be
 disputed. This man is the king's eldest son. That is clear, and there
 is no dispute. Reason can do no better, for civil war is the worst of
 evils.
 
 
 Men of unruly lives assert that they alone follow nature, while those
 who are orderly stray from her paths; as passengers in a ship think
 that those move who stand upon the shore. Both sides say the same
 thing. There must be a fixed point to enable us to judge. The harbour
 decides the question for those who are in the vessel, but where can
 we find the harbour in morals?
 
 
 When all moves equally, nothing seems to move, as in a ship. When all
 tend to vice, none appears to do so. Whoever stops draws attention to
 the onward movement of others, as does a fixed point.
 
 Justice is what is established, and thus all our established laws are
 necessarily held to be just without being examined, because they are
 established.
 
 
 _Justice._--As fashion makes what is agreeable, so it makes what is
 just.
 
 
 Our natural principles are but principles of custom. In children
 natural principles are those which they have received from the habits
 of their fathers, as hunting in animals.
 
 A different custom will produce different natural principles. This
 experience testifies, and if there are some natural principles
 ineradicable by custom, so are there some customs opposed to nature
 ineradicable by nature, or by a second custom. This depends on
 constitution.
 
 
 Fathers fear that the natural love of their children may be effaced.
 Now what sort of thing is that nature which is liable to be effaced.
 Custom is a second nature which destroys the former. But what is
 nature, for is not custom natural? I am greatly afraid that nature
 itself may be only our first custom, as custom is second nature.
 
 
 Montaigne was wrong: custom should only be followed because it is
 custom, and not because it is reasonable or just; but most men follow
 it for the simple reason that they think it just. Otherwise they
 would not follow it though it were the custom, for our only desire is
 to be subjected to reason or to justice. Without this, custom would
 pass for tyranny, but the empire of reason and justice is no more
 tyrannical than that of choice. These are principles natural to man.
 
 It is then good to obey laws and customs because they are laws, but
 we ought to know that there is neither truth nor justice to introduce
 into them, that we know nothing about these, and can therefore only
 follow what is recognised, and thus we should never transgress them.
 But most men cannot receive this doctrine, and since they believe
 that truth can be found, and that it resides in law and custom, they
 believe these laws, and take their antiquity as a proof of their
 truth, and not merely of their authority apart from truth. Thus they
 obey the laws, but are liable to revolt when these are shown to be
 of no value; and this may be proved of all of them, looked at from a
 certain point of view.
 
 
 _Injustice._--The authority of the judge is not given him for his
 sake, but for that of the judged. It is dangerous to say this to the
 people, but the people have too much faith in you; that will not harm
 them, and may serve you. You must then say it openly. _Pasce oves
 meas_, not _tuas_. You owe me pasturage.
 
 
 _Injustice._--It is dangerous to say to the people that the laws
 are not just, for men obey them only because they think them just.
 Therefore it is necessary to say at the same time that they must
 be obeyed because they are laws, as superiors must be obeyed, not
 because they are just, but because they are superiors. All sedition
 is averted, if this principle be established and it be understood
 what is rightly the definition of justice.
 
 
 If God gave us masters direct from himself, how heartily ought we to
 obey them! Circumstances and necessity are infallible masters.
 
 
 Custom is our nature. Whoever is accustomed to the faith believes
 in it, can no longer even fear hell, and believes in nothing else.
 Whoever accustoms himself to believe that the king is terrible ...
 etc. Who doubts then that our soul, being accustomed to see number,
 space, and motion, believes that and nothing else?
 
 
 _Veri juris_; we have it no longer; had we it, we should not take the
 manners of our country as our rule of justice.
 
 Here, not finding justice, we fall back on force, etc.
 
 
 It is a ridiculous thing to consider that there are people in the
 world who, having renounced all the laws of God and nature, have
 yet made laws for themselves which they exactly obey, as, for
 instance, the soldiers of Mahomet, thieves, heretics, etc., and thus
 logicians....
 
 It seems as though their licence must be without limit or barrier,
 since they have broken down so many that are just and holy.
 
 
 _Weakness._--The whole employment of men is to gain wealth; yet
 they have no title to show that they justly possess it but human
 caprice, nor have they power to hold it securely. It is the same with
 knowledge, of which disease deprives us. We are incapable both of
 truth and of goodness.
 
 
 The Swiss are offended if they are called noble, and bring proof of
 their plebeian race that they may be judged worthy of office.
 
 
 When the question is of judging whether we ought to make war and kill
 so many men, condemning so many Spaniards to death, there is only one
 man who is the judge, and he an interested party; there ought to be a
 third, and he disinterested.
 
 
 "Why do you kill me?--What! Do not you live on the other side of the
 stream, my friend? If you lived on this side I should be an assassin,
 and it were unjust to kill you in this fashion, but since you live on
 the other side, I am a brave soldier, and it is just."
 
 
 _Justice, Power._--It is just that what is just should be obeyed, it
 is of necessity that what is strongest should be obeyed.
 
 Justice without power is unavailing, power without justice is
 tyrannical. Justice without power is gainsaid, because the wicked
 always exist, power without justice is condemned. We must therefore
 combine justice and power, making what is just strong, and what is
 strong just.
 
 Justice is subject to dispute, power is easily recognised and cannot
 be disputed. Thus we cannot give power to justice, because power has
 arraigned justice, saying that justice is unjust, and she herself
 truly just; so since we are unable to bring about that what is just
 should be strong, we have made the strong just.
 
 
 The sole universal rules are the laws of the country in ordinary
 affairs, and the law of the majority in others. And this comes from
 the power which is in them.
 
 Thus it comes that kings, whose power is of another kind, do not
 follow the majority of their ministers.
 
 No doubt equality of goods is just, but since they are unable to
 bring about that power should obey justice, people have judged it
 right to obey power; not being able to add power to justice they
 have justified power, so that justice and power should coalesce, and
 peace, the sovereign good, result.
 
 
 Do we follow the majority because they have more reason? No; but
 because they have more power.
 
 Do we follow ancient laws and opinions because they are more sound?
 No; but because they stand alone and take from us the root of
 diversity.
 
 
 _Summum jus, summa injuria._
 
 The way of the majority is the best way, because it is plain, and has
 power to make itself obeyed; yet it is the opinion of the least able.
 
 If men could have done so, they would have placed power in the hands
 of justice, since we cannot deal with power as we please, because it
 is a tangible quality, while justice is a spiritual quality of which
 we dispose as we please, they have placed justice in the hands of
 power, and thus that is called just which we are forced to obey.
 
 Thence arises the right of the sword, for the sword gives a true
 right.
 
 Otherwise we should see violence on one side and justice on the
 other. The end of the twelfth _Provincial_.
 
 Thence the injustice of the Fronde, which raises its so-called
 justice against power.
 
 It is not the same in the Church, for there is true justice and no
 violence.
 
 
 _Injustice._--That presumption should be joined to insignificance is
 extreme injustice.
 
 
 Tyranny consists in the desire of universal rule outside its sphere.
 
 There are different societies, in which are the strong, the fair,
 the judicious, the devout, in which each man rules at home, not
 elsewhere. Sometimes they meet, and the strong and the fair contend
 for the mastery, foolishly, for their mastery is each in a different
 kind. They do not agree, and their fault is that each aims at
 universal dominion. None can obtain this, not even power, which is
 of no avail in the realm of the wise; she is only mistress of our
 external actions.
 
 _Tyranny._--Thus the following expressions are false and tyrannical:
 "I am beautiful, therefore I should be feared; I am strong, therefore
 I should be loved. I am...."
 
 Tyranny is the wishing to have in one way what can only be had in
 another. Divers duties are owing to divers merits, the duty of love
 to the pleasant, of fear to the strong, of belief to the wise.
 
 These duties should be paid, it is unjust to refuse them, unjust also
 to require others. In the same way it is false and tyrannous to say,
 "He is not strong, therefore I will not esteem him; he is not clever,
 therefore I will not fear him."
 
 
 It is necessary that men should be unequal. True; but that being
 granted, the door is open, not only to the greatest domination, but
 to the greatest tyranny.
 
 It is necessary to relax the mind a little, but that opens the door
 to extreme dissipation.
 
 We must mark the limits.--There are no fixed boundaries in these
 matters, law wishes to impose them, but the mind will not bear them.
 
 
 _Mine, Thine._--"This is my dog," say poor children, "that is my
 place in the sunshine." Here is the beginning and the image of the
 usurpation of the whole earth.
 
 
 Good birth is a great advantage, for it gives a man a chance at the
 age of eighteen, making him known and respected as an ordinary man is
 on his merits at fifty. Here are thirty years gained at a stroke.
 
 It is the result of power and not of custom. For those who are able
 to originate are few, the greater number will only follow, and refuse
 glory to those inventors who seek it by their inventions. And if they
 persist in wishing to gain glory, and in despising those who do not
 originate, the others will give them ridicule and would fain give
 them blows. Let no one then pride himself on this subtle capacity, or
 else let him keep his content to himself.
 
 
 _The reason of effects._--It is strange that men would not have me
 honour a man clothed in brocade, and followed by seven or eight
 footmen! Yet he will have them give me the strap if I do not salute
 him. This custom is a power. It is the same with a horse in fine
 trappings compared with another. It is odd that Montaigne does not
 see what difference there is, wonders that we find any, and asks the
 reason. "Indeed," he says, "how comes it," etc....
 
 
 When power attacks craft, when a mere soldier takes the square cap of
 a first president, and flings it out of the window.
 
 
 _Injustice_.--Men have found no means to gratify their sensuality
 without wrong to others.
 
 
 The greatness of man even in his sensuality, to have known how to
 extract from it an admirable code, and to have drawn from it a
 picture of love to others.
 
 
 _Greatness._--The reasons of effects mark the greatness of man, in
 having formed so fair an order out of sensuality.
 
 
 _The reason of effects._--Sensuality and power are the source of all
 our actions; sensuality causes those which are voluntary, power the
 involuntary.
 
 
 From sensuality men have found and drawn excellent rules of policy,
 of morals, and of justice.
 
 But after all, this evil root of man, this _figmentum malum_, is only
 hidden, it is not removed.
 
 All men by nature hate each other. They have used sensuality as best
 they could to make it serve the public weal, but this is only a
 feint, and a false image of charity, for at bottom it is but hate.
 
 
 To pity the unfortunate is not contrary to sensuality, rather is
 it easy to render this evidence of friendship, and to gain the
 reputation of a tender heart, without giving.
 
 The people have very sound opinions, for instance:
 
 1. In having preferred diversion and hunting to poetry. The half
 educated deride this, and are triumphant over the folly of the
 world, but the people are right by a reason which the others do not
 understand.
 
 2. In distinguishing men by outward marks, as birth or wealth. The
 world is again triumphant in showing how unreasonable this is, yet it
 is thoroughly reasonable. Savages laugh at an infant king.
 
 3. In taking offence at a blow, or in desiring glory so strongly.
 
 But it is very desirable, on account of the other essential goods
 which are joined to it, and a man who has received a blow without
 resenting it is overwhelmed with abuse and indignity.
 
 4. In working for an uncertainty, in going on a sea voyage, in
 walking over a plank.
 
 
 _Sound opinions of the people._--Civil wars are the greatest of all
 evils. They are certain, if we try to reward desert, for all will say
 they deserve. The evil to fear from a fool who succeeds by right of
 birth, is neither so great nor so certain.
 
 
 _Sound opinions of the people._--To be well dressed is not altogether
 foolish, for it proves that a great number of people work for us. It
 shows by our hair, that we have a valet, a perfumer, etc.; by our
 band, our thread, our trimming, etc. Now it is not merely superficial
 nor simply outward show to have many arms at our disposal.
 
 The more arms we have the stronger we are. To be well dressed is to
 show our power.
 
 
 _The reason of effects._--Continual alternation of _pro_ and _con._
 
 We have then shown that man is frivolous, by the estimation he has of
 non-essentials. And all these opinions are destroyed. We have next
 shown that all these opinions were perfectly sound, and that thus all
 these frivolities being well founded, the people are not so frivolous
 as is said. And thus we have destroyed the opinion which destroyed
 that of the people.
 
 But we must now destroy this last proposition, and show that it
 remains always true that the people are frivolous, though its opinions
 are sound, because it does not feel the truth where it is, and
 placing it where it is not, its opinions are always very false and
 very unsound.
 
 
 _The reason of effects._--It is, then, true to say that all men are
 under an illusion, for even though the opinions of the people be
 sound, they are not so as they hold them, for they think that truth
 is where it is not. Truth is indeed in their opinions, but not at the
 point where they imagine it.
 
 Thus, it is true that we should honour men of birth, but not because
 good birth is in itself an advantage, etc.
 
 
 _The reason of effects._--Gradation. The people honours persons of
 high birth. The half-educated despise them, saying that birth is
 not a personal, but a chance advantage. The educated honour them,
 not from the motives of the people, but from another motive. Devout
 persons of more zeal than knowledge despise them, in spite of that
 consideration which makes them honoured by the educated, because they
 judge by a new light arising from their piety. But true Christians
 honour them by a still higher light. So there is a succession of
 opinions for and against, according to the measure of our light.
 
 
 How rightly do men distinguish by exterior rather than by interior
 qualities! Which of us twain shall take the lead? Who will give place
 to the other? The least able? But I am as able as he is. We should
 have to fight about that. He has four footmen, and I have but one;
 that is something which can be seen; there is nothing to do but to
 count; it is my place to yield, and I am a fool if I contest it. So
 by this means we remain at peace, the greatest of all blessings.
 
 
 Deference is shown by submitting to personal inconvenience. This
 is apparently foolish but really just, for it is to say, "I would
 certainly put myself to inconvenience did you need it, since I do so
 when it can be of no service to you." Respect, moreover, is for the
 purpose of marking distinctions of rank. Now if it showed respect to
 be seated in an arm-chair, we should pay respect to every body, and
 thus no distinction would be made, but being put to inconvenience we
 distinguish very well.
 
 
 _The reason of effects._--We should keep our own secret thoughts, and
 judge of all by those, while speaking like every one else.
 
 
 _King and tyrant._--I too will have my secret thoughts. I will take
 care on every journey.
 
 
 _The reason of effects._--Epictetus. Those who say "You have a
 headache," this is not the same thing. We are assured of health, and
 not of justice, and indeed his own was folly.
 
 Yet he believed it demonstrable when he said, "it is either in our
 power or it is not."
 
 But he did not see that it is not in our power to regulate the heart,
 and he was wrong to draw this conclusion from the fact that some were
 Christians.
 
 
 _The reason of effects._--It is owing to the weakness of man that so
 many things are esteemed beautiful, as to be well skilled in playing
 the lute.
 
 It is only an evil because of our weakness.
 
 
 
 
 _THE WEAKNESS, UNREST, AND DEFECTS OF MAN._
 
 
 _The Misery of Man._--We care nothing for the present. We anticipate
 the future as too slow in coming, as if we could make it move faster;
 or we call back the past, to stop its rapid flight. So imprudent
 are we that we wander through the times in which we have no part,
 unthinking of that which alone is ours; so frivolous are we that
 we dream of the days which are not, and pass by without reflection
 those which alone exist. For the present generally gives us pain;
 we conceal it from our sight because it afflicts us, and if it be
 pleasant we regret to see it vanish away. We endeavour to sustain
 the present by the future, and think of arranging things not in our
 power, for a time at which we have no certainty of arriving.
 
 If we examine our thoughts, we shall find them always occupied with
 the past or the future. We scarcely think of the present, and if we
 do so, it is only that we may borrow light from it to direct the
 future. The present is never our end; the past and the present are
 our means, the future alone is our end. Thus we never live, but hope
 to live, and while we always lay ourselves out to be happy, it is
 inevitable that we can never be so.
 
 
 We are so unhappy that we cannot take pleasure in a thing, save on
 condition of being troubled if it turn out ill, as a thousand things
 may do, and do every hour. He who should find the secret of rejoicing
 in good without being troubled at its contrary evil, would have hit
 the mark. It is perpetual motion.
 
 
 Our nature exists by motion; perfect rest is death.
 
 
 When we are well we wonder how we should get on if we were sick,
 but when sickness comes we take our medicine cheerfully, into that
 the evil resolves itself. We have no longer those passions and that
 desire for amusement and gadding abroad, which were ours in health,
 but are now incompatible with the necessities of our disease. So then
 nature gives us passions and desires in accordance with the immediate
 situation. Nothing troubles us but fears, which we, and not nature,
 make for ourselves, because fear adds to the condition in which we
 are the passions of the condition in which we are not.
 
 Since nature makes us always unhappy in every condition, our desires
 paint for us a happy condition, joining to that in which we are, the
 pleasures of the condition in which we are not, and were we to gain
 these pleasures we should not therefore be happy, because we should
 have other desires conformable to this new estate.
 
 We must particularize this general proposition....
 
 
 What difference in point of obedience is there between a soldier
 and a Carthusian? For both are alike under rule and dependent, both
 engaged in equally irksome labours. But the soldier always hopes to
 bear rule, and though he never does so, for even captains and princes
 are always slaves and dependents, he ever hopes and ever works to
 attain mastery, whereas the Carthusian makes a vow never to be aught
 else than dependent. Thus they do not differ in their perpetual
 servitude, which is the same always for both, but in the hope which
 one always has, the other never.
 
 
 The example of Alexander's chastity has not made so many continent
 as that of his drunkenness has made intemperate. It is not shameful
 to be less virtuous than he, and it seems excusable to be no more
 vicious. We do not think ourselves wholly partakers in the vices
 of ordinary men, when we see that we share those of the great, not
 considering that in such matters the great are but ordinary men. We
 hold on to them by the same end by which they hold on to the people,
 for at whatsoever height they be, they are yet united at some
 point to the lowest of mankind. They are not suspended in the air,
 abstracted from our society. No, doubly no; if they are greater than
 we, it is because their heads are higher; but their feet are as low
 as ours. There all are on the same level, resting on the same earth,
 and by the lower extremity are as low as we are, as the meanest men,
 as children, and the brutes.
 
 
 Great men and little have the same accidents, the same tempers, the
 same passions, but one is on the felloe of the wheel, the other near
 the axle, and so less agitated by the same revolutions.
 
 
 Would he who had enjoyed the friendship of the King of England, the
 King of Poland, and the Queen of Sweden have thought he should come
 to want, and need a retreat or shelter in the world?
 
 
 Man is full of wants, and cares only for those who can satisfy them
 all. "Such an one is a good mathematician," it is said. But I have
 nothing to do with mathematics, he would take me for a proposition.
 "This other is a good soldier." He would treat me as a besieged city.
 I need then an honourable man who can lend himself generally to all
 my wants.
 
 
 Men say that eclipses presage misfortune, because misfortunes are
 common, so that as evil often happens they often divine it; whereas
 to say that they presage happiness would often prove false. They
 attribute happiness only to rare planetary conjunctions, and thus
 they seldom fail in their divination.
 
 
 We are fools if we rest content with the society of those like
 ourselves; miserable as we are, powerless as we are, they will not
 aid us, we shall die alone. We ought therefore to act as though we
 were alone, and should we in that case build superb mansions, etc.?
 We should search for truth unhesitatingly, and if we refuse it, we
 show that we value the esteem of men more than the search for truth.
 
 
 The last act is tragic, how pleasantly soever the play may have run
 through the others. At the end a little earth is flung on our head,
 and all is over for ever.
 
 
 I feel that I might not have been, for the 'I' consists in my
 thought; therefore I, who think, had not been had my mother been
 killed before I had life. So I am not a necessary being. Neither
 am I eternal nor infinite, but I see plainly there is in nature a
 necessary being, eternal and infinite.
 
 
 As duchies, kingships, and magistracies are real and necessary,
 because power rules all, these exist every where and always. But
 since it is only caprice which makes one or another duke or king, the
 rule is not constant, and may vary, etc.
 
 
 Cromwell was about to ravage the whole of Christendom, the royal
 family had been brought to nought, and his own dynasty for ever
 established, but for a little grain of sand in his bladder. Rome
 herself began to tremble under him, but this scrap of gravel
 having got there, he dies, his family falls from power, peace is
 established, and the king restored.
 
 
 _Scepticism._--Excessive or deficient mental powers are alike accused
 of madness. Nothing is good but mediocrity. The majority has settled
 that, and assails whoever escapes it, no matter by which extreme. I
 make no objection, would willingly consent to be in the mean, and
 I refuse to be placed at the lower end, not because it is low, but
 because it is an extreme, for I would equally refuse to be placed at
 the top. To leave the mean is to leave humanity. The greatness of the
 human soul consists in knowing how to keep the mean. So little is it
 the case that greatness consists in leaving it, that it lies in not
 leaving it.
 
 
 Discourses on humility give occasion for pride to the boastful, and
 for humility to the humble. Those on scepticism give occasion for
 believers to affirm. Few men speak humbly of humility, chastely
 of chastity, few of scepticism doubtingly. We are but falsehood,
 duplicity and contradiction, using even to ourselves concealment and
 guile.
 
 
 There are vices which only take hold of us by means of others, and
 these, like branches, fall with the removal of the trunk.
 
 
 For we must not mistake ourselves, we have as much that is automatic
 in us as intellectual, and hence it comes that the instrument by
 which persuasion is brought about is not demonstration alone. How few
 things are demonstrated! Proofs can only convince the mind; custom
 makes our strongest proofs and those which we hold most firmly, it
 sways the automaton, which draws the unconscious intellect after it.
 Who has demonstrated that there will be a to-morrow, or that we shall
 die; yet what is more universally believed? It is then custom that
 convinces us of it, custom that makes so many men Christians, custom
 that makes them Turks, heathen, artisans, soldiers, etc. Lastly, we
 must resort to custom when once the mind has seen where truth is,
 in order to slake our thirst, and steep ourselves in that belief,
 which escapes us at every hour, for to have proofs always at hand
 were too onerous. We must acquire a more easy belief, that of custom,
 which without violence, without art, without argument, causes our
 assent and inclines all our powers to this belief, so that our soul
 naturally falls into it. It is not enough to believe only by force
 of conviction if the automaton is inclined to believe the contrary.
 Both parts of us then must be obliged to believe, the intellect by
 arguments which it is enough to have admitted once in our lives,
 the automaton by custom, and by not allowing it to incline in the
 contrary direction. _Inclina cor meum, Deus._
 
 
 The intellect believes naturally, and the will loves naturally, so
 that for lack of true objects, they must needs attach themselves to
 the false.
 
 
 _Eritis sicut dii, scientes bonum et malum._--Every one plays the god
 in judging whether anything be good or bad, and in being too much
 afflicted or rejoiced at circumstances.
 
 
 Even if people have no interest in what they say, it must not
 therefore be certainly concluded they are not lying, for there are
 those who lie simply for lying's sake.
 
 
 Men are of necessity so mad, that not to be mad were madness in
 another form.
 
 
 We cannot think of Plato and Aristotle, save in professorial robes.
 They were honest men like others, laughing with their friends,
 and when they amused themselves with writing the _Laws_ or the
 _Politics_, they did it as a pastime. That part of their life was
 the least philosophic and the least serious; the most philosophic
 was to live simply and quietly. If they wrote on politics it was as
 though they were laying down rules for a madhouse, and if they made
 as though they were speaking of a great matter, it was because they
 knew that the madmen to whom they spoke fancied themselves kings and
 emperors. They entered into their views in order to make their folly
 as little harmful as possible.
 
 
 The most important affair in life is the choice of a trade, yet
 chance decides it. Custom makes men masons, soldiers, tilers. "He is
 a good tiler," says one, "and soldiers are fools." But others: "There
 is nothing great but war, all but soldiers are rogues." We choose our
 professions according as we hear this or that praised or despised
 in our childhood, for we naturally love truth and hate folly. These
 words move us, the only fault is in their application. So great is
 the force of custom that out of those who by nature are only men,
 are made all conditions of men. For some countries are full of
 masons, others of soldiers, etc. Nature is certainly not so uniform.
 Custom then produces this effect and gains ascendency over nature,
 yet sometimes nature gets the upper hand, and obliges man to act by
 instinct in spite of all custom, whether good or bad.
 
 
 Men by nature are tilers and of all callings, except in their own
 closets.
 
 
 We never teach men to be gentlemen, but we teach them everything
 else, and they never pique themselves so much on all the rest as on
 knowing how to be gentlemen. They pique themselves only on knowing
 the one thing they have not learnt.
 
 
 People should not be able to say of a man, he is a mathematician,
 or a preacher, or eloquent, but he is a gentleman; that universal
 quality alone pleases me.--When you think of a man's book as soon as
 you see himself, it is a bad sign. I would rather that none of his
 qualities should be recognised till you meet them, or have occasion
 to avail yourself of them. _Ne quid nimis_, for fear some one quality
 gain the mastery and stamp the man. Let not people think of him as an
 orator, unless oratory be in question, then let them think of it.
 
 
 No man passes in the world as an expert in verse unless he hang
 out the sign of a poet, a mathematician, etc. But people who are
 generally accomplished need no sign and scarce recognise any
 difference between the trade of a poet and that of an embroiderer.
 
 People of general accomplishment are not called poets or
 geometricians, etc., though they are so, and judges of all these. You
 do not guess what they are. When they enter a society they join in
 the general conversation. They do not exhibit one quality rather than
 another, except when they have to make use of it. Then we remember
 it, for it is natural to such characters that we do not say of them
 that they are fine speakers when it is not a question of oratory, and
 that we give them the praise of eloquence if occasion call for it.
 
 It is false praise then to say of a man as soon as he enters a
 society that he is a clever poet, and it is a bad sign when a man is
 never called on to give his opinion on such a subject as verse.
 
 
 _Inconstancy._--Things have different qualities, and the soul
 different inclinations; for nothing is simple which presents itself
 to the soul, and the soul never presents itself simply to any
 subject. Hence it comes that men laugh and weep at the same thing.
 
 
 Greatness of establishment, respect for establishment.
 
 The pleasure of the great is to be able to make people happy.
 
 The property of riches is to be given liberally.
 
 The property of each thing should be sought out. The property of
 power is to protect.
 
 
 Saint Augustine saw that we labour for an uncertainty, at sea,
 in a battle, etc.; he did not see the doctrine of chances, which
 demonstrates that we must do so. Montaigne saw that we are disgusted
 at a distorted mind, and that custom can do all things, but he did
 not see the reason of that effect.
 
 All these men saw the effects, but did not see the causes; in
 relation to those who have discovered the causes they are as those
 who have only eyes are in regard to those who have intellect. For the
 effects are as it were sensible, and the causes are visible only to
 the intellect. And though these effects too are apprehended through
 reason, yet is it in relation to the reason which apprehends causes,
 as the bodily senses are to the intellect.
 
 
 Suppose a man puts himself at a window to see the passers by. If I
 pass I cannot say that he stood there to see me, for he does not
 think of me in particular. Nor does any one who loves another on
 account of beauty really love that person, for the small-pox, which
 kills beauty without killing the person, will cause the loss of
 love. Nor does one who loves me for my judgment, my memory, love me,
 myself, for I may lose those qualities without losing my identity.
 Where then is this 'I' if it reside not in the body nor in the soul,
 and how love the body or the soul, except for the qualities which do
 not make '_me_,' since they are perishable? For it is not possible
 and it would be unjust to love the soul of a person in the abstract,
 and whatever qualities might be therein. So then we do not love a
 person, but only qualities. We should not then sneer at those who are
 honoured on account of rank and office, for we love no one save for
 borrowed qualities.
 
 
 Time heals all pain and misunderstanding, because we change and are
 no longer the same persons. Neither the offender nor the offended are
 any more themselves. It is like a nation which we have angered and
 meet again after two generations. They are Frenchmen still, but not
 the same.
 
 
 _Inconstancy and singularity._--To live only by labour, and to reign
 over the most powerful state in the world, are very opposite things.
 They are united in the person of the grand Sultan of the Turks.
 
 It pleases us to say 'Prince' to a king, because it lessens his
 quality.
 
 
 _Epigrams of Martial._--Men like malice, but not against one-eyed
 men, nor against the unfortunate, but against the fortunate and
 proud. Those who think otherwise make a mistake.
 
 For concupiscence is the source of all our movements, and humanity,
 etc.
 
 We must please those whose feelings are humane and tender.
 
 That epigram about the two one-eyed people is valueless, for it
 brings them no consolation, and only gives a point to the author's
 glory. All that is merely for the sake of the author is valueless.
 _Ambitiosa recidet ornamenta._
 
 
 I put it down as a fact that if all men knew what each said of the
 other, there would not be four friends in the world. This is evident
 from the quarrels which arise from indiscreet reports made from time
 to time.
 
 
 Those who are always hopeful in adversity, and rejoice in good
 luck, are suspected of being glad of failure should they not be
 correspondingly depressed under bad luck; they are delighted to find
 pretexts for hoping, in order to show that they are interested, and
 to hide by the joy they pretend to feel that which they really feel
 at the ill success of the affair.
 
 
 Malignity when it has reason on its side becomes proud, and displays
 reason in all its splendour.
 
 If austerity or a rigid choice have not found the true good, and we
 must needs return to follow nature, it becomes proud by reason of
 this return.
 
 
 A maker of epigrams,--a bad man.
 
 
 Do you wish men to believe good of you? Then say none.
 
 
 We ought to be much obliged to those who tell us of our faults, for
 they mortify us, they teach us we have been despised, they do not
 prevent our being so in the future, for we have many other faults
 which are despicable. They prepare for us the exercise of correction,
 and freedom from a fault.
 
 
 If we would reprove with success, and show another his mistake, we
 must see from what side he views the matter, for on that side it is
 generally true, and admitting that truth, show him the side on which
 it is false. He will be satisfied, for he will see that he was not
 mistaken, only that he did not see all sides. Now, no one is vexed
 at not seeing every thing. But we do not like to be mistaken, and
 that perhaps arises from the fact that man by nature cannot see
 everything, and that by nature he cannot be mistaken in the side he
 looks at, since what we apprehend by our senses is always true.
 
 
 I passed a long time in the study of the abstract sciences, and was
 much discouraged at finding how few were my fellow-students. When I
 began the study of man I saw that these abstract sciences were not
 fit for him, and that I was wandering more from my true state in
 investigating them, than others in ignoring them. I forgave their
 scanty knowledge. But I thought at least to find many fellow-students
 in the study of man, and that this was the real study which befits
 us. I was deceived, for there are still fewer than those who study
 mathematics. It is only for want of knowing how to pursue this
 study that we seek others. But is it not that even here is not the
 knowledge that man should have, and that it is better for him to be
 ignorant of himself in order to be happy?
 
 
 _The Vanity of Knowledge._--The knowledge of external things will not
 console me for my ignorance of ethics in time of affliction, but the
 science of morals will always console me for my ignorance of external
 knowledge.
 
 
 There are plants on the earth, we see them, but they could not be
 seen from the moon. On these plants are hairs, and in these hairs
 tiny animals, but beyond that, nothing more. O, presumption! Compound
 bodies are made up of elements, but not the elementary bodies
 themselves. O presumption! Here is a fine distinction. We must not
 assert the existence of what we cannot see, we must then say what
 others say, but not think with them.
 
 
 The world's judgment is right, for it is in that condition of natural
 ignorance which is man's best wisdom. The sciences have two extremes
 which meet. The first is that pure natural ignorance in which every
 man is born. The other extreme is that reached by great minds,
 who having run through all that men can know, find that they know
 nothing, and again come round to the same ignorance from which they
 started; but this is a learned ignorance, conscious of itself. Those
 between the two, who have left their natural ignorance and not been
 able to reach the other, have some tincture of this vain knowledge,
 and assume to be wise. These trouble the world, and judge all things
 falsely. The people and the wise make up the world; these despise it,
 and are despised; they judge ill of all things, and the world rightly
 judges of them.
 
 
 Nature has made all her truths self-contained. Our art encloses them
 one within another, but that is not according to nature. Each holds
 its own place.
 
 
 _Spongia solis._--When we see the same effect invariably recur we
 conclude there is in it a natural necessity, as that there will be
 a to-morrow, etc. But nature often gives us the lie, and will not
 subject herself to her own rules.
 
 
 Nature always begins the same things again, years, days, and hours,
 and in like manner spaces and numbers follow each other, end without
 end. So is made a sort of infinity and eternity, not that any thing
 of these is infinite and eternal, but these finite entities are
 infinitely multiplied.
 
 Thus as it seems to me the number which multiplies them alone is
 infinite.
 
 
 Nature imitates herself. A seed sown in good ground brings forth
 fruit. A principle cast into a good mind brings forth fruit.
 
 Numbers imitate space, which is of an wholly different nature.
 
 All is made and guided by one and the same master, root, branch and
 fruits; principles and consequences.
 
 
 Nature works by progress, _itus et reditus_. It goes and returns,
 then it goes further, then twice as much backwards, then more forward
 than ever, etc.
 
 So is it with the tide of the sea, and so apparently with the course
 of the sun.
 
 
 Every one is all in all to himself, for he being dead, all is dead to
 him. Hence it comes that each man believes that he is all to all. We
 ought not to judge of nature by ourselves, but by it.
 
 
 Self is hateful. You Miton, conceal self, but do not thereby destroy
 it, therefore you are still hateful.
 
 --Not so, for in acting as we do, to oblige every body, we give no
 reason for hating us.--True, if we only hated in self the vexation
 which it causes us.
 
 But if I hate it because it is unjust, and because it makes itself
 the centre of all, I shall always hate it.
 
 In one word Self has two qualities, it is unjust in its essence
 because it makes itself the centre of all, it is inconvenient to
 others, in that it would bring them into subjection, for each 'I' is
 the enemy, and would fain be the tyrant of all others. You take away
 the inconvenience, but not the injustice, and thus you do not render
 it loveable to those who hate injustice; you render it loveable only
 to the unjust, who find in it an enemy no longer. Thus you remain
 unjust and can please none but the unjust.
 
 _Of Self-love._--The nature of self-love and of this human 'I' is to
 love self only, and consider self only. But what can it do? It cannot
 prevent the object it loves from being full of faults and miseries;
 man would fain be great and sees that he is little, would fain be
 happy, and sees that he is miserable, would fain be perfect, and sees
 that he is full of imperfections, would fain be the object of the
 love and esteem of men, and sees that his faults merit only their
 aversion and contempt. The embarrassment wherein he finds himself
 produces in him the most unjust and criminal passion imaginable, for
 he conceives a mortal hatred against that truth which blames him and
 convinces him of his faults. Desiring to annihilate it, yet unable to
 destroy it in its essence, he destroys it as much as he can in his
 own knowledge, and in that of others; that is to say, he devotes all
 his care to the concealment of his faults, both from others and from
 himself, and he can neither bear that others should show them to him,
 nor that they should see them.
 
 It is no doubt an evil to be full of faults, but it is a greater evil
 to be full of them, yet unwilling to recognise them, because that
 is to add the further fault of a voluntary illusion. We do not like
 others to deceive us, we do not think it just in them to require more
 esteem from us than they deserve; it is therefore unjust that we
 should deceive them, desiring more esteem from them than we deserve.
 
 Thus if they discover no more imperfections and vices in us than
 we really have, it is plain they do us no wrong, since it is not
 they who cause them; but rather they do us a service, since they
 help us to deliver ourselves from an evil, the ignorance of these
 imperfections. We ought not to be troubled that they know our faults
 and despise us, since it is but just they should know us as we are,
 and despise us if we are despicable.
 
 Such are the sentiments which would arise in a heart full of equity
 and justice. What should we say then of our own heart, finding in
 it an wholly contrary disposition? For is it not true that we hate
 truth, and those who tell it us, and that we would wish them to have
 an erroneously favourable opinion of us, and to esteem us other than
 indeed we are?
 
 One proof of this fills me with dismay. The Catholic religion does
 not oblige us to tell out our sins indiscriminately to all, it allows
 us to remain hidden from men in general, but she excepts one alone,
 to whom she commands us to open the very depths of our heart, and to
 show ourselves to him as we are. There is but this one man in the
 world whom she orders us to undeceive; she binds him to an inviolable
 secrecy, so that this knowledge is to him as though it were not. We
 can imagine nothing more charitable and more tender. Yet such is the
 corruption of man, that he finds even this law harsh, and it is one
 of the main reasons which has set a large portion of Europe in revolt
 against the Church.
 
 How unjust and unreasonable is the human heart which finds it hard
 to be obliged to do in regard to one man what in some degree it were
 just to do to all men. For is it just that we should deceive them?
 
 There are different degrees in this dislike to the truth, but it may
 be said that all have it in some degree, for it is inseparable from
 self-love. This false delicacy causes those who must needs reprove
 others to choose so many windings and modifications in order to avoid
 shocking them. They must needs lessen our faults, seem to excuse
 them, mix praises with their blame, give evidences of affection and
 esteem. Yet this medicine is always bitter to self-love, which takes
 as little as it can, always with disgust, often with a secret anger
 against those who administer it.
 
 Hence it happens, that if any desire our love, they avoid doing us a
 service which they know to be disagreeable; they treat us as we would
 wish to be treated: we hate the truth, and they hide it from us; we
 wish to be flattered, they flatter us; we love to be deceived, they
 deceive us.
 
 Thus each degree of good fortune which raises us in the world removes
 us further from truth, because we fear most to wound those whose
 affection is most useful, and whose dislike is most dangerous. A
 prince may be the by-word of all Europe, yet he alone know nothing
 of it. I am not surprised; to speak the truth is useful to whom it
 is spoken, but disadvantageous to those who speak it, since it makes
 them hated. Now those who live with princes love their own interests
 more than that of the prince they serve, and thus they take care not
 to benefit him so as to do themselves a disservice.
 
 This misfortune is, no doubt, greater and more common in the higher
 classes, but lesser men are not exempt from it, since there is always
 an interest in making men love us. Thus human life is but a perpetual
 illusion, an interchange of deceit and flattery. No one speaks of us
 in our presence as in our absence. The society of men is founded on
 this universal deceit: few friendships would last if every man knew
 what his friend said of him behind his back, though he then spoke in
 sincerity and without passion.
 
 Man is then only disguise, falsehood, and hypocrisy, both in himself
 and with regard to others. He will not be told the truth, he avoids
 telling it to others, and all these tendencies, so far removed from
 justice and reason, have their natural roots in his heart.
 
 
 
 
 _THE HAPPINESS OF MAN WITH GOD_;
 
 _OR_,
 
 _THAT THE SCRIPTURE SHOWS A
 REDEEMER._
 
 
 
 
 _PREFACE TO THE SECOND PART._
 
 
 To speak of those who have treated of this subject.
 
 I wonder at the boldness with which these persons undertake to speak
 of God, in addressing their words to the irreligious. Their first
 chapter is to prove Divinity by the works of nature. I should not be
 astonished at their undertaking if they addressed their argument to
 the faithful, for it is certain that those who have a lively faith
 in their heart see at once that all that exists is none other than
 the work of the God whom they adore. But for those in whom this light
 is extinguished, and in whom we desire to revive it, men destitute
 of faith and grace who, seeking with all their light whatever they
 see in nature to lead them to this knowledge, find only clouds and
 darkness,--to tell them they need only look at the smallest things
 which surround them in order to see God unveiled, to give them as
 the sole proof of this great and important subject, the course of
 the moon and planets, and to say that with such an argument we have
 accomplished the proof; is to give them ground for belief that the
 proofs of our Religion are very feeble. Indeed I see by reason and
 experience that nothing is more fitted to excite contempt.
 
 Not after this fashion speaks the Scripture, which knows better than
 we the things of God. It says, on the contrary, that God is a God who
 hides himself, and that since nature became corrupt, he has left men
 in a blindness from which they can only escape by Jesus Christ, and
 except through him we are cut off from all communication with God.
 _Nemo novit Patrem, nisi Filius, et cui voluerit Filius revelare._
 
 This is what Scripture indicates when it says in so many places that
 those who seek God find him. It is not of a light like the sun at
 noonday that they thus speak. No one says that those who seek the
 sun at noonday, or water in the sea shall find them, and thus it
 follows that the evidence for God is not of that kind. Therefore it
 says to us elsewhere: _Vere tu es Deus absconditus_.
 
 
 The metaphysical proofs of God are so apart from man's reason, and so
 complicated that they are but little striking, and if they are of use
 to any, it is only during the moment that the demonstration is before
 them, but an hour afterwards they fear they have been mistaken.
 
 _Quod curiositate cognoverint, superbia amiserunt._
 
 Such is the outcome of the knowledge of God gained without Jesus
 Christ, for this is to communicate without a mediator with the God
 whom they have known without a mediator.
 
 Instead of which those who have known God by a mediator know their
 own wretchedness.
 
 
 Jesus Christ is the goal of all, and the centre to which all tends.
 Who knows him knows the reason of all things.
 
 Those who go astray only do so from failing to see one of these
 two things. It is then possible to know God without knowing our
 wretchedness, and to know our wretchedness without knowing God; but
 we cannot know Jesus Christ without knowing at the same time God and
 our wretchedness.
 
 Therefore I do not here undertake to prove by natural reasons either
 the existence of God or the Trinity, or the immortality of the soul,
 nor anything of that sort, not only because I do not feel myself
 strong enough to find in nature proofs to convince hardened atheists,
 but also, because this knowledge without Jesus Christ is useless
 and barren. Though a man should be persuaded that the proportions
 of numbers are immaterial truths, eternal, and dependent on a first
 truth in whom they subsist, and who is called God, I should not
 consider him far advanced towards his salvation.
 
 The God of Christians is not a God who is simply the author of
 mathematical truths, or of the order of the elements, as is the
 god of the heathen and of Epicureans. Nor is he merely a God who
 providentially disposes the life and fortunes of men, to crown his
 worshippers with length of happy years. Such was the portion of the
 Jews. But the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob,
 the God of Christians, is a God of love and consolation, a God who
 fills the souls and hearts of his own, a God who makes them feel
 their inward wretchedness, and his infinite mercy, who unites himself
 to their inmost spirit, filling it with humility and joy, with
 confidence and love, rendering them incapable of any end other than
 himself.
 
 
 All who seek God apart from Jesus Christ, and who rest in nature,
 find no light to satisfy them, but form for themselves a means of
 knowing God and serving him without a mediator. Thus they fall either
 into atheism, or into deism, two things which the Christian religion
 almost equally abhors.
 
 
 The God of Christians is a God who makes the soul perceive that
 he is her only good, that her only rest is in him, her only joy
 in loving him; who makes her at the same time abhor the obstacles
 which withhold her from loving him with all her strength. Her two
 hindrances, self-love and lust, are insupportable to her. This God
 makes her perceive that the root of self-love destroys her, and that
 he alone can heal.
 
 
 The knowledge of God without that of our wretchedness creates pride.
 The knowledge of our wretchedness without that of God creates
 despair. The knowledge of Jesus Christ is the middle way, because in
 him we find both God and our wretchedness.
 
 
 
 
 _OF THE NEED OF SEEKING TRUTH._
 
 
 _Second Part. That man without faith cannot know the true good, nor
 justice._
 
 All men seek happiness. To this there is no exception, what different
 means soever they employ, all tend to this goal. The reason that
 some men go to the wars and others avoid them is but the same desire
 attended in each with different views. Our will makes no step but
 towards this object. This is the motive of every action of every man,
 even of him who hangs himself.
 
 And yet after so many years, no one without faith has arrived at
 the point to which all eyes are turned. All complain, princes and
 subjects, nobles and commons, old and young, strong and weak, learned
 and ignorant, sound and sick, of all countries, all times, all ages,
 and all conditions.
 
 A trial so long, so constant and so uniform, should surely convince
 us of our inability to arrive at good by our own strength, but
 example teaches us but little. No resemblance is so exact but
 that there is some slight difference, and hence we expect that
 our endeavour will not be foiled on this occasion as before. Thus
 while the present never satisfies, experience deceives us, and from
 misfortune to misfortune leads us on to death, eternal crown of
 sorrows.
 
 This desire, and this weakness cry aloud to us that there was once
 in man a true happiness, of which there now remains to him but the
 mark and the empty trace, which he vainly tries to fill from all that
 surrounds him, seeking from things absent the succour he finds not in
 things present; and these are all inadequate, because this infinite
 void can only be filled by an infinite and immutable object, that is
 to say, only by God himself.
 
 He only is our true good, and since we have left him, it is strange
 that there is nothing in nature which has not served to take his
 place; neither the stars, nor heaven, earth, the elements, plants,
 cabbages, leeks, animals, insects, calves, serpents, fever,
 pestilence, war, famine, vices, adultery, incest. And since he has
 lost the true good, all things can equally appear good to him, even
 his own destruction, though so contrary to God, to reason, and to the
 whole course of nature.
 
 Some seek good in authority, others in research and knowledge, others
 in pleasure. Others, who indeed are nearer the truth, have considered
 it necessary that the universal good which all men desire should
 not consist in any of those particular matters which can only be
 possessed by one, and which if once shared, afflict their possessor
 more by the want of what he has not, than they gladden him by the
 joy of what he has. They have apprehended that the true good should
 be such as all may possess at once, without diminution, and without
 envy, and that which none can lose against his will. And their reason
 is that this desire being natural to man, since it exists necessarily
 in all, and that all must have it, they conclude from it....
 
 
 _Infinite, nothing._--The soul of man is cast into the body, in which
 it finds number, time, dimension; it reasons thereon, and calls this
 nature or necessity, and cannot believe aught else.
 
 Unity joined to infinity increases it not, any more than a foot
 measure added to infinite space. The finite is annihilated in
 presence of the infinite and becomes simply nought. Thus our
 intellect before God, thus our justice before the divine justice.
 There is not so great a disproportion between our justice and that of
 God, as between unity and infinity.
 
 The justice of God must be as vast as his mercy, but justice towards
 the reprobate is less vast, and should be less amazing than mercy
 towards the elect.
 
 We know that there is an infinite, but are ignorant of its nature.
 As we know it to be false that numbers are finite, it must therefore
 be true that there is an infinity in number, but what this is we know
 not. It can neither be odd nor even, for the addition of an unit can
 make no change in the nature of number; yet it is a number, and every
 number is either odd or even, at least this is understood of every
 finite number.
 
 Thus we may well know that there is a God, without knowing what he is.
 
 We know then the existence and the nature of the finite, because we
 also are finite and have dimension.
 
 We know the existence of the infinite, and are ignorant of its
 nature, because it has dimension like us, but not limits like us. But
 we know neither the existence nor the nature of God, because he has
 neither dimension nor limits.
 
 But by faith we know his existence, by glory we shall know his
 nature. Now I have already shown that we can know well the existence
 of a thing without knowing its nature.
 
 Let us now speak according to the light of nature.
 
 If there be a God, he is infinitely incomprehensible, since having
 neither parts nor limits he has no relation to us. We are then
 incapable of knowing either what he is or if he is. This being so,
 who will dare to undertake the solution of the question? Not we, who
 have no relation to him.
 
 Who then will blame Christians for not being able to give a reason
 for their faith; those who profess a religion for which they cannot
 give a reason? They declare in putting it forth to the world that it
 is a foolishness, _stultitiam_, and then you complain that they do
 not prove it. Were they to prove it they would not keep their word,
 it is in lacking proof that they are not lacking in sense.--Yes, but
 although this excuses those who offer it as such, and takes away from
 them the blame of putting it forth without reason, it does not excuse
 those who receive it.--Let us then examine this point, and say "God
 is, or he is not." But to which side shall we incline? Reason can
 determine nothing about it. There is an infinite gulf fixed between
 us. A game is playing at the extremity of this infinite distance in
 which heads or tails may turn up. What will you wager? There is no
 reason for backing either one or the other, you cannot reasonably
 argue in favour of either.
 
 Do not then accuse of error those who have already chosen, for you
 know nothing about it.--No, but I blame them for having made, not
 this choice, but a choice, for again both the man who calls 'heads'
 and his adversary are equally to blame, they are both in the wrong;
 the true course is not to wager at all.--
 
 Yes, but you must wager; this depends not on your will, you are
 embarked in the affair. Which will you choose? Let us see. Since
 you must choose, let us see which least interests you. You have two
 things to lose, truth and good, and two things to stake, your reason
 and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has
 two things to avoid, error and misery. Since you must needs choose,
 your reason is no more wounded in choosing one than the other. Here
 is one point cleared up, but what of your happiness? Let us weigh the
 gain and the loss in choosing heads that God is. Let us weigh the
 two cases: if you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing.
 Wager then unhesitatingly that he is.--You are right. Yes, I must
 wager, but I may stake too much.--Let us see. Since there is an equal
 chance of gain and loss, if you had only to gain two lives for one,
 you might still wager. But were there three of them to gain, you
 would have to play, since needs must that you play, and you would be
 imprudent, since you must play, not to chance your life to gain three
 at a game where the chances of loss or gain are even. But there is
 an eternity of life and happiness. And that being so, were there an
 infinity of chances of which one only would be for you, you would
 still be right to stake one to win two, and you would act foolishly,
 being obliged to play, did you refuse to stake one life against three
 at a game in which out of an infinity of chances there be one for
 you, if there were an infinity of an infinitely happy life to win.
 But there is here an infinity of an infinitely happy life to win, a
 chance of gain against a finite number of chances of loss, and what
 you stake is finite; that is decided. Wherever the infinite exists
 and there is not an infinity of chances of loss against that of gain,
 there is no room for hesitation, you must risk the whole. Thus when a
 man is forced to play he must renounce reason to keep life, rather
 than hazard it for infinite gain, which is as likely to happen as the
 loss of nothingness.
 
 For it is of no avail to say it is uncertain that we gain, and
 certain that we risk, and that the infinite distance between the
 certainty of that which is staked and the uncertainty of what
 we shall gain, equals the finite good which is certainly staked
 against an uncertain infinite. This is not so. Every gambler stakes
 a certainty to gain an uncertainty, and yet he stakes a finite
 certainty against a finite uncertainty without acting unreasonably.
 It is false to say there is infinite distance between the certain
 stake and the uncertain gain. There is in truth an infinity between
 the certainty of gain and the certainty of loss. But the uncertainty
 of gain is proportioned to the certainty of the stake, according to
 the proportion of chances of gain and loss, and if therefore there
 are as many chances on one side as on the other, the game is even.
 And thus the certainty of the venture is equal to the uncertainty
 of the winnings, so far is it from the truth that there is infinite
 distance between them. So that our argument is of infinite force, if
 we stake the finite in a game where there are equal chances of gain
 and loss, and the infinite is the winnings. This is demonstrable, and
 if men are capable of any truths, this is one.
 
 I confess and admit it. Yet is there no means of seeing the hands at
 the game?--Yes, the Scripture and the rest, etc.
 
 --Well, but my hands are tied and my mouth is gagged: I am forced to
 wager and am not free, none can release me, but I am so made that I
 cannot believe. What then would you have me do?
 
 True. But understand at least your incapacity to believe, since your
 reason leads you to belief and yet you cannot believe. Labour then
 to convince yourself, not by increase of the proofs of God, but by
 the diminution of your passions. You would fain arrive at faith, but
 know not the way; you would heal yourself of unbelief, and you ask
 remedies for it. Learn of those who have been bound as you are, but
 who now stake all that they possess; these are they who know the way
 you would follow, who are cured of a disease of which you would be
 cured. Follow the way by which they began, by making believe that
 they believed, taking the holy water, having masses said, etc.
 Thus you will naturally be brought to believe, and will lose your
 acuteness.--But that is just what I fear.--Why? what have you to lose?
 
 But to show you that this is the right way, this it is that will
 lessen the passions, which are your great obstacles, etc.--
 
 What you say comforts and delights me, etc.--If my words please you,
 and seem to you cogent, know that they are those of one who has
 thrown himself on his knees before and after to pray that Being,
 infinite, and without parts, to whom he submits all his own being,
 that you also would submit to him all yours, for your own good and
 for his glory, and that this strength may be in accord with this
 weakness.
 
 _The end of this argument._--Now what evil will happen to you in
 taking this side? You will be trustworthy, honourable, humble,
 grateful, generous, friendly, sincere, and true. In truth you will no
 longer have those poisoned pleasures, glory and luxury, but you will
 have other pleasures. I tell you that you will gain in this life, at
 each step you make in this path you will see so much certainty of
 gain, so much nothingness in what you stake, that you will know at
 last that you have wagered on a certainty, an infinity, for which you
 have risked nothing.
 
 
 _Objection._--Those who hope for salvation are so far happy, but they
 have as a counterpoise the fear of hell.
 
 _Answer._--Who has most reason to fear hell, the man who is in
 ignorance if there be a hell, and who is certain of damnation if
 there be; or he who is certainly convinced that there is a hell, and
 has a hope of being saved if there be?
 
 
 "I would soon have given up pleasure," say they, "had I but faith."
 But I say to you, "you would soon have faith did you leave off your
 pleasures. Now it is for you to begin. If I could, I would give you
 faith. I cannot do this, nor discover therefore if what you say is
 true. But you can easily give up pleasure, and discover if what I say
 is true."
 
 
 _Probabilities._--We must live differently in the world, according to
 these different suppositions:
 
 1. That we could always remain in it. 2. That it is certain we cannot
 remain here long, and uncertain if we shall remain here an hour. This
 last supposition is the case with us.
 
 
 _Instability._--It is horrible to feel all that we possess slipping
 away from us.
 
 
 By the law of probabilities you are bound to take pains to seek the
 truth; for if you die without adoring the true source of all things
 you are lost. "But," say you, "had he willed that I should adore him,
 he would have left me tokens of his will." He has done so, but you
 neglect them. Seek them then, it is well worth your while.
 
 
 _Dungeon._--I admit that it is not necessary to fathom the opinion of
 Copernicus, but this:
 
 It is all our life is worth to know if the soul be mortal or immortal.
 
 
 _Fascinatio nugacitatis._--In order that passion may do no hurt, we
 should act as though we had but a week to live.
 
 If we ought to give a week we ought to give our whole life.
 
 
 In short, what is it you promise me if not ten years of self-love
 spent in trying hard to please without success, besides the troubles
 which are certain? For ten years is the probability.
 
 
 Let us imagine a number of men in chains, all condemned to death, of
 whom some are strangled every day in the sight of the others, while
 those who remain see their own condition in that of their fellows,
 and wait their turn looking at each other sorrowfully and without
 hope. This is an image of the lot of man.
 
 
 We must know ourselves, and if that does not serve to discover truth,
 it at least serves to regulate our lives, and there is nothing more
 just.
 
 
 There are but three classes of persons: those who having found God,
 serve him; those who not having found him, diligently seek him; those
 who not having found him, live without seeking him. The first are
 happy and wise, the last are unhappy and fools, those between are
 unhappy, but they are wise.
 
 
 It is certain that there is no good without the knowledge of God,
 that only as we approach him are we happy, and that the ultimate good
 is to know him certainly; that we are unhappy in proportion as we are
 removed from him, and that the greatest evil would be certainty of
 the opposite.
 
 
 The ordinary world has the power of not thinking about what it does
 not choose to think about. "Do not reflect on those passages about
 the Messiah," said the Jew to his son. So our people often act. Thus
 false religions are preserved, and the true also, as regards many
 people.
 
 But there are those who have not thus the power of preventing
 thought, and who think the more the more we forbid them. These get
 rid of false religions, and of the true also, if they do not find
 solid reasons.
 
 
 If we ought to do nothing save on a certainty, we ought to do nothing
 for Religion, for this is not certain. But how much we do on an
 uncertainty, as sea voyages, battles! I say then if this be the case
 we ought to do nothing at all, for nothing is certain, and that
 there is more certainty in Religion than that we shall see another
 day, for it is not certain that we shall see to-morrow, but it is
 certainly possible that we shall not see it. We cannot say so much
 about Religion. It is not certain that it is, but who will dare to
 say that it is certainly possible that it is not? But when we work
 for to-morrow, therefore for the uncertain, we act reasonably.
 
 For we should work for the uncertain by the doctrine of chances
 already laid down.
 
 
 We know truth, not only by the reason, but also by the heart, and
 it is from this last that we know first principles; and reason,
 which has nothing to do with it, tries in vain to combat them. The
 sceptics who desire truth alone labour in vain. We know that we do
 not dream, although it is impossible to prove it by reason, and this
 inability shows only the weakness of our reason, and not, as they
 declare, the general uncertainty of our knowledge. For our knowledge
 of first principles, as _space_, _time_, _motion_, _number_, is as
 distinct as any principle derived from reason. And reason must lean
 necessarily on this instinctive knowledge of the heart, and must
 found on it every process. We know instinctively that there are three
 dimensions in space, and that numbers are infinite, and reason then
 shows that there are no two square numbers one of which is double
 of the other. We feel principles, we infer propositions, both with
 certainty, though by different ways. It is as useless and absurd for
 reason to demand from the heart proofs of first principles before it
 will admit them, as it would be for the heart to ask from reason a
 feeling of all the propositions demonstrated before accepting them.
 
 This inability should serve then only to humiliate reason, which
 would fain judge of all things, but not to shake our certainty, as if
 only reason were able to instruct us. Would to God, on the contrary,
 that we never needed reason, and that we knew every thing by instinct
 and feeling! But nature has denied us this advantage, and has on the
 contrary given us but little knowledge of this kind, all the rest can
 be acquired by reason only.
 
 Therefore those to whom God has given Religion by an instinctive
 feeling, are very blessed, and justly convinced. But to those who
 have it not we can give it only by reasoning, waiting for the time
 when God shall impress it on their hearts, without which faith is
 human only, and useless for salvation.
 
 
 Those to whom God has given Religion by an instinctive feeling are
 very blessed, and quite convinced. But as for those who have it not,
 we can give it them only by reasoning, waiting for the time when
 God himself shall impress it on their heart, without which faith is
 useless for salvation.
 
 
 Is then the soul too noble a subject for the feeble light of man? Let
 us then abase the soul to matter, and see if she knows whereof is
 made the very body which she animates, and those others which she
 contemplates and moves at her will. On this subject what have those
 great dogmatists known who are ignorant of nothing?
 
 _Harum sententiarum._
 
 This would no doubt suffice if reason were reasonable. She is
 reasonable enough to admit that she has never found anything stable,
 but she does not yet despair of reaching it; on the contrary, she is
 as ardent as ever in the search, and is sure that she has in herself
 all the necessary powers for this conquest.
 
 We must therefore make an end, and after having examined these powers
 in their effects, recognise what they are in themselves, and see if
 reason has power and grasp capable of seizing the truth.
 
 
 The Preacher shows that man without God is wholly ignorant, and
 subject to inevitable misery. For to will and to be powerless is to
 be miserable. Now he wills to be happy, and to be assured of some
 truth, yet he can neither know, nor not desire to know. He cannot
 even doubt.
 
 
 This is what I see and what troubles me. I look on all sides, and
 see nothing but obscurity, nature offers me nothing but matter for
 doubt and disquiet. Did I see nothing there which marked a Divinity I
 should decide not to believe in him. Did I see every where the marks
 of a Creator, I should rest peacefully in faith. But seeing too much
 to deny, and too little to affirm, my state is pitiful, and I have
 a hundred times wished that if God upheld nature, he would mark the
 fact unequivocally, but that if the signs which she gives of a God
 are fallacious, she would wholly suppress them, that she would either
 say all or say nothing, that I might see what part I should take.
 Instead of this, in my present state, ignorant of what I am, and of
 what I ought to do, I know neither my condition nor my duty. My heart
 is wholly bent to know where is the true good in order to follow it,
 nothing would seem to me too costly for eternity.
 
 
 
 
 _THE PHILOSOPHERS._
 
 
 The principal arguments of the sceptics--to omit those of less
 importance--are that we have no certainty of the truth of these
 principles apart from faith and revelation, save so far as we
 naturally perceive them in ourselves. Now this natural perception is
 no convincing evidence of their truth, since, having no certainty
 apart from faith, whether man was created by a good God, by an evil
 demon, or by chance, it may be doubted whether these principles
 within us are true or false or uncertain according to our origin.
 
 And more than this: That no one has any certainty, apart from faith,
 whether he wake or sleep, seeing that in sleep we firmly believe we
 are awake, we believe that we see space, figure, and motion, we are
 aware of the lapse and measure of time; in a word we act as though we
 were awake. So that half of our life being passed in sleep, we have
 by our own avowal, no idea of truth, whatever we may suppose. Since
 then all our sentiments are illusions, who can tell but that the
 other half of life wherein we fancy ourselves awake be not another
 sleep somewhat different from the former, from which we wake when we
 fancy ourselves asleep?
 
 And who doubts that if we dreamt in company, and if by chance men's
 dreams agreed, which is common enough, and if we were always alone
 when awake, we should believe that the conditions were reversed?
 In a word, as we often dream that we dream, and heap vision upon
 vision, it may well be that this life itself is but a dream, on
 which the others are grafted, from which we wake at death; having
 in our lifetime as few principles of what is good and true, as
 during natural sleep, the different thoughts which agitate us being
 perhaps only illusions like those of the flight of time and the vain
 fantasies of our dreams....
 
 These are the principal arguments on one side and the other, setting
 aside those of less importance, such as the talk of the sceptics
 against the impressions of custom, education, manners, climate, and
 the like; and these though they influence the majority of ordinary
 men, who dogmatise only on vain foundations, are upset by the least
 breath of the sceptics. We have only to see their books if we are
 not convinced on this point, and we shall soon become assured of it,
 perhaps only too much.
 
 I pause at the only strong point of the dogmatists, namely, that
 speaking sincerely and in good faith we cannot doubt of natural
 principles.
 
 Against this the sceptics set in one word the uncertainty of our
 origin, which includes that of our nature. Which the dogmatists have
 been trying to answer ever since the world began.
 
 So then war is opened among men, in which each must take a side,
 ranging himself either for dogmatism or for scepticism, since
 neutrality, which is the part of the wise, is the oldest dogma of the
 sceptical sect. Whoever thinks to remain neutral is before all things
 a sceptic. This neutrality is the essence of the sect; who is not
 against them is pre-eminently for them. They are not for themselves,
 they are neutral, indifferent, in suspense as to all things,
 themselves included.
 
 What then shall man do in such a state? Shall he doubt of all, doubt
 whether he wake, whether you pinch him, or burn him, doubt whether
 he doubts, doubt whether he is? We cannot go so far as that, and
 I therefore state as a fact that there never has been a perfect
 finished sceptic; nature upholds the weakness of reason, and prevents
 its wandering to such a point.
 
 Shall he say on the contrary that he is in sure possession of truth,
 when if we press him never so little, he can produce no title, and is
 obliged to quit his hold?
 
 What a chimæra then is man! how strange and monstrous! a chaos, a
 contradiction, a prodigy. Judge of all things, yet a weak earth-worm;
 depositary of truth, yet a cesspool of uncertainty and error; the
 glory and offscouring of the Universe.
 
 Who will unravel such a tangle? This is certainly beyond the power
 of dogmatism and scepticism, and all human philosophy. Man is
 incomprehensible by man. We grant to the sceptics what they have so
 loudly asserted, that truth is not within our reach nor to our taste,
 that her home is not on earth but in heaven, that she dwells within
 the breast of God, and that we can only know her so far as it pleases
 him to reveal her. Let us then learn our true nature from truth
 uncreate and incarnate.
 
 Nature confounds the sceptics, and reason the dogmatists. What then
 will become of you, O men! who by your natural reason search out your
 true condition? You can neither avoid both these sects nor live in
 either.
 
 Know then, proud man, how great a paradox thou art to thyself. Bow
 down thyself, weak reason; be silent, thou foolish nature; learn that
 man is altogether incomprehensible by man, and learn from your master
 your true condition which you ignore. Hear God.
 
 For in a word, had man never been corrupt he would innocently and
 securely enjoy truth and happiness. And had man never been other than
 corrupt he would have no idea of virtue or blessedness. But wretched
 as we are, and even more than if there were no greatness in our
 condition, we have an idea of happiness and cannot attain it, we feel
 an image of truth and possess a lie only, alike incapable of absolute
 ignorance and of certain knowledge, so manifest is it that we once
 were in a degree of perfection from which we have unhappily fallen!
 
 Yet it is an astonishing thing that the mystery most removed from
 our knowledge, that of the transmission of sin, should be a thing
 without which we can have no knowledge of ourselves. For it is
 certain that nothing more shocks our reason than to say that the sin
 of the first man rendered those culpable, who, being so distant from
 the source, seem incapable of participation in it. This transfusion
 does not only seem to us impossible, but even most unjust, for there
 is nothing so repugnant to the rules of our miserable justice as to
 damn eternally an infant incapable of will, for a sin in which he
 seems to have so scanty a share, that it was committed six thousand
 years before he was in being. Certainly nothing shocks us more
 rudely than this doctrine, and yet without this mystery, the most
 incomprehensible of all, we are incomprehensible to ourselves. The
 tangle of our condition takes its plies and folds in this abyss, so
 that man is more inconceivable without the mystery than the mystery
 is inconceivable to man.
 
 Whence it appears that God, willing to render the difficulty of our
 being unintelligible to us, has concealed the knot so high, or rather
 so low, that we cannot reach it; so that it is not by the arrogant
 exertion of our reason, but by the simple submission of reason, that
 we can truly know ourselves.
 
 These foundations solidly established on the inviolable authority
 of Religion make us understand that there are two truths of faith
 equally constant--the one, that man in his state at creation or in
 that of grace is elevated above the whole of nature, made like unto
 God and sharer of his divinity--the other, that in the state of
 corruption and sin he has fallen from his former state and is made
 like unto the brutes. These two propositions are equally fixed and
 certain. The Scripture declares this plainly to us when it says in
 some places: _Deliciæ meæ esse cum filiis hominum. Effundam spiritum
 meum super omnen carnem. Dii estis, etc.;_ and in other places,
 _Omnis caro fænum. Homo assimilatus est jumentis insipientibus et
 similis factus est illis. Dixi in corde meo de filiis hominum_....
 Eccles. iii.
 
 By which it clearly appears that man by grace is made like unto God,
 and a sharer in his divinity, and that without grace he is like the
 brute beasts, etc.
 
 
 _Scepticism._--I shall here write my thoughts without order, yet
 not perhaps in undesigned confusion, that is true order, which will
 always denote my object by its very disorder.
 
 I should do too much honour to my subject if I treated it with order,
 because I wish to show that it is incapable of it.
 
 
 _Scepticism._--All things here are true in part, and false in part.
 Essential truth is not thus, it is altogether pure and true. This
 mixture dishonours and annihilates it. Nothing is purely true, and
 therefore nothing is true, understanding by that pure truth. You will
 say it is true that homicide is an evil, yes, for we know well what
 is evil and false. But what can be named as good? Chastity? I say no,
 for then the world would come to an end. Marriage? No, a celibate
 life is better. Not to kill? No, for lawlessness would be horrible,
 and the wicked would kill all the good. To kill then? No, for that
 destroys nature. Goodness and truth are therefore only partial, and
 mixed with what is evil and false.
 
 
 Were we to dream the same thing every night, this would affect us as
 much as the objects we see every day, and were an artisan sure to
 dream every night, for twelve hours at a stretch, that he was a king,
 I think he would be almost as happy as a king who should dream every
 night for twelve hours at a stretch that he was an artisan.
 
 Should we dream every night that we were pursued by enemies, and
 harassed by these painful phantoms, or that we were passing all our
 days in various occupations, as in travelling, we should suffer
 almost as much as if the dream were real, and should fear to sleep,
 as now we fear to wake when we expect in truth to enter on such
 misfortunes. And, in fact, it would bring about nearly the same
 troubles as the reality.
 
 But since dreams are all different, and each single dream is
 diversified, what we see in them affects us much less than what we
 see when awake, because that is continuous, not indeed so continuous
 and level as never to change, but the change is less abrupt, except
 occasionally, as when we travel, and then we say, "I think I am
 dreaming," for life is but a little less inconstant dream.
 
 
 _Instinct, reason._--We have an incapacity of proof which no
 dogmatism can overcome. We have an idea of truth, which no scepticism
 can overcome.
 
 
 Nothing more strengthens scepticism than that some are not sceptics;
 were all so, they would be in the wrong.
 
 
 This sect draw their strength from their enemies more than from their
 friends, for the weakness of man appears much more in those who are
 not, than in those who are conscious of it.
 
 
 _Against scepticism._--We suppose that we all conceive of things in
 the same way, but it is a gratuitous supposition, of which we have
 no proof. I see indeed that the same words are applied on the same
 occasions, and that every time two men see a body change its place,
 they both express their view of the same object by the same word,
 both saying that it has moved, and from this sameness of application
 we have a strong conviction of a sameness of idea; but this, though
 it may be enough to justify us in wagering the affirmative, is not
 finally or completely convincing, since we know that we often draw
 the same conclusions from different premisses.
 
 This is enough, at any rate, to confuse the matter, not that it
 wholly extinguishes the natural light which assures us of these
 things; the academicians would have won, but this obscures it, and
 troubles the dogmatists to the glory of the sceptical cabal, which
 consists in this ambiguous ambiguity, and in a certain doubtful haze,
 from which our doubts cannot take away all the light, nor our natural
 light banish all the darkness.
 
 
 _Good sense._--They are obliged to say, "You do not act in good
 faith; we are not asleep," etc. How I like to see this proud reason
 humiliated and suppliant. For this is not the language of a man whose
 right is disputed, and who defends it with the mailed power of his
 hand. He does not trifle by saying that men are not acting in good
 faith, but he punishes this bad faith with might.
 
 
 It may be that there are true demonstrations, but it is not certain.
 Thus this proves nothing but that it is not certain that all is
 uncertain, to the glory of scepticism.
 
 
 _Ex senatus consultis et plebiscitis scelera exercentur._
 
 _Nihil tam absurde dici potest quod non dicatur ab aliquo

 The falsity of those philosophers who do not discuss the immortality
 of the soul. The falsity of their dilemma in Montaigne.
 
 
 It is beyond doubt that the mortality or immortality of the soul must
 make an entire difference in morals; yet philosophers have treated
 morality independently of the question. They discuss to pass the time.
 
 Plato, to dispose towards Christianity.
 
 
 The soul is immaterial. Philosophers have subdued their passions.
 What matter could do that?
 
 
 Atheists should say things which are perfectly clear, but it is not
 perfectly clear that the soul is material.
 
 
 Atheism is a mark of strength of mind, but only to a certain degree.
 
 
 _Against those philosophers who believe in God without Jesus
 Christ._--They believe that God alone is worthy to be loved and
 admired, and they have desired to be loved and admired of men, and
 know not their own corruption. If they feel themselves full of
 feelings of love and adoration, and if they find therein their chief
 joy, let them think themselves good, and welcome! But if they find
 themselves averse from him, if they have no inclination but the wish
 to establish themselves in the esteem of men, and if their whole
 perfection consists not in constraining, but yet in causing men to
 find their happiness in loving them, I say that such a perfection is
 horrible. What! they have known God, and have not desired solely that
 men should love him, but that men should stop short at loving them.
 They have wished to be the object of the voluntary joy of men.
 
 All the principles of sceptics, stoics, atheists, etc. are true; but
 their conclusions are false, because the opposite principles are also
 true.
 
 
 But perhaps the subject goes beyond the reach of reason. We will
 therefore examine what she has to say on questions within her powers.
 If there be anything to which her own interest must have made her
 apply herself most seriously, it is the search after her sovereign
 good. Let us see then in what these strong and clearsighted souls
 have placed it, and whether they agree.
 
 One says that the sovereign good consists in virtue, another in
 pleasure, another in the knowledge of nature, another in truth:
 _Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas_, another in total
 ignorance, another in indolence, others in neglect of appearances,
 another in the lack of wonder, _nihil mirari prope res una quæ possit
 facere et servare beatum_, the true sceptics in their indifference,
 doubt and perpetual suspense, and others, more wise, think they can
 find a better way. And this is all we get from them!
 
 We must needs see if this fine philosophy has gained nothing certain
 from a research so lengthy and so wide, at least perhaps the soul has
 learned to know herself. We will hear the rulers of the world on this
 matter. What have they thought of her substance?
 
 Have they been more happy in fixing her seat?
 
 What have they discovered about her origin, duration and departure?
 
 
 _Search for the true good._--Ordinary men place their good in fortune
 and external goods, or at least in amusement. Philosophers have shown
 the vanity of all this, and have placed it where best they could.
 
 
 Philosophers reckon two hundred and eighty-eight sovereign goods.
 
 
 _The sovereign good. Dispute about the sovereign good._--_Ut
 sis contentus temetipso et ex te nascentibus bonis._ There is a
 contradiction, for finally they advise suicide. Ah! happy life
 indeed, from which we are to free ourselves as from the plague.
 
 It is well to be weary and harassed by the useless search after the
 true good, that we may stretch our arms to the Redeemer.
 
 
 _Conversation._--Great words: Religion. I deny it.
 
 _Conversation._--Scepticism aids Religion.
 
 
 _Philosophers._--We are full of matters which take us out of
 ourselves.
 
 Our instinct suggests that we must seek our happiness outside
 ourselves; our passions hurry us abroad, even when there are no
 objects to excite them. The objects outside us tempt and call us,
 even when we do not think of them. And thus it is in vain for
 philosophers to say, "Enter into yourselves, and you will find your
 good there;" we believe them not, and those who believe them are the
 most empty and the most foolish.
 
 
 This civil war between reason and passion divides those who desire
 peace into two sects, the one, of those who would renounce their
 passions and become gods, the other, of those who would renounce
 their reason and become brute beasts.--Des Barreaux.--But neither
 has succeeded, and reason still exists, to condemn the baseness
 and injustice of the passions, and to trouble the repose of those
 who give themselves over to their sway, and the passions are still
 vigorous in those who desire to renounce them.
 
 
 _The Stoics._--They conclude that what has been done once may be done
 always, and that because the desire of glory gives some degree of
 power to those possessed by it, others can easily do the same.
 
 These are the movements of fever, which health cannot imitate.
 
 Epictetus concludes that since there are consistent Christians all
 men can easily be so.
 
 
 The three kinds of lust have made three sects, and philosophers have
 done no other thing than follow one of the three lusts.
 
 
 What the Stoics propose is so difficult and so idle.
 
 The Stoics lay down that all who are not at the highest degree of
 wisdom are equally frivolous and vicious, as those who are in two
 inches under water....
 
 
 _Philosophers._--A fine thing to cry to a man who does not know
 himself, that of himself he should come to God. And a fine thing also
 to say to a man who knows himself.
 
 
 
 
 _THOUGHTS ON MAHOMET AND ON CHINA._
 
 
                      Jesus Christ.
           Heathens.       |        Mahomet.
                   \       |       /
                    \      |      /
                     \ Ignorance /
                        of God.
 
 _The foundation of our faith._--The heathen religion has no
 foundation at the present day. We are told that it once had such a
 foundation by the voice of the oracles, but what are the books which
 certify this? Are they worthy of credence on account of the virtue of
 their writers, have they been kept with such care that we may feel
 certain none have tampered with them?
 
 The Mahomedan religion has for its foundation the Koran and Mahomet.
 But was this prophet, who was to be the last hope of the world,
 foretold? What mark has he that every other man has not who chooses
 to call himself prophet? What miracles does he himself tell us that
 he wrought? What mystery has he taught? Even according to his own
 tradition, what was the morality, what the happiness he offered?
 
 The Jewish religion must be differently regarded in the tradition of
 the sacred books and in the tradition of the people. Its morality
 and happiness are ridiculous in the tradition of the people, but
 admirable in that of their saints. The foundation is admirable, it
 is the most ancient book in the world, and the most authentic, and
 whereas Mahomet, in order to ensure the lasting existence of his
 book forbade men to read it, Moses with the same object commanded
 everyone to read his. And it is the same with all religions, for the
 Christianity of the sacred books is quite different to that of the
 casuists.
 
 Our religion is so divine that another divine religion is only the
 foundation of it.
 
 
 _The difference between Jesus Christ and Mahomet._--Mahomet was not
 foretold; Jesus Christ was foretold.
 
 Mahomet that he slew; Jesus Christ that he caused his own to be slain.
 
 Mahomet forbade reading; the apostles ordered it.
 
 
 In fact the two systems are so contrary that if Mahomet took the way,
 humanly speaking, to succeed, Jesus Christ took, humanly speaking,
 the way to perish. And instead of concluding from Mahomet's success
 that Jesus Christ might well have succeeded, we should rather say
 that since Mahomet succeeded, Jesus Christ ought to have perished.
 
 
 The Psalms are chanted throughout all the world.
 
 Who renders testimony to Mahomet? Himself. Jesus Christ wills that
 his testimony to himself should be of no avail.
 
 The quality of witnesses demands that they should exist always and
 everywhere, and the wretch stands alone.
 
 
 _The falsity of other religions._--Mahomet had no authority. His
 reasons ought to be most cogent, having nothing but their own force.
 
 What does he say then in order to make us believe him?
 
 
 Any man can do what Mahomet did, for he wrought no miracles, he was
 confirmed by no prophecies. No man can do what Jesus Christ did.
 
 _Against Mahomet._--The Koran is not more of Mahomet than the Gospel
 is of Saint Matthew, for it is cited by many authors from age to age.
 Even its very enemies, Celsus and Porphyry, never disavowed it.
 
 The Koran says that Saint Matthew was an honest man. Therefore
 Mahomet was a false prophet for calling honest men wicked, or for
 not admitting what they have said of Jesus Christ.
 
 
 It is not by the obscurities in Mahomet which may be interpreted in
 a mysterious sense, that I would have him judged, but in what he
 speaks clearly, as of his paradise, and the rest, he is ridiculous.
 And because what is clear is so absurd, it is not just to take his
 obscurities for mysteries.
 
 It is not the same with the Scripture. It may be admitted that in it
 are obscurities as strange as those of Mahomet, but much is admirably
 clear, and prophecies are manifestly fulfilled. The cases are not the
 same. We must not confound and compare things which only resemble
 each other in their obscurity, and not in that clearness, which
 should induce us to reverence the obscurities.
 
 
 Suppose two persons tell foolish stories, one whose words have a
 two-fold sense, understood only by his own followers, the other which
 has only the one sense, a stranger not being in the secret, who hears
 them both speak in this manner, would pass on them a like judgment.
 But if afterwards in the rest of their conversation one speak with
 the tongue of angels, and the other mere wearisome common-places, he
 will judge that the one spoke in mysteries and not the other; the
 one having sufficiently shown that he was incapable of absurdity,
 and capable of being mysterious, the other that he is incapable of
 mystery, and capable of absurdity.
 
 The Old Testament is a cipher.
 
 
 _History of China._--I believe those histories only, whose witnesses
 let themselves be slaughtered.
 
 It is not a question of seeing this in bulk. I say there is in it a
 something to blind and something to enlighten.
 
 In this one word I destroy all your reasoning. "But China obscures,"
 you say, and I answer, "China obscures, but there is light to be
 found; seek it."
 
 Thus all that you say makes for one of these designs, and not at all
 against the other. So this serves, and does no harm.
 
 We must then look at this in detail, the papers must be laid on the
 table.
 
 
 Against the history of China, the historians of Mexico. The five
 suns, of which the last is but eight hundred years old.
 
 
 
 
 _OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE._
 
 
 I see the Christian Religion founded on an earlier Religion, and this
 is what I find of positive fact.
 
 I do not here speak of the miracles of Moses, of Jesus Christ, and
 of the Apostles, because they do not at first seem convincing, and
 because I only wish here to adduce in evidence all those foundations
 of the Christian Religion which are beyond a doubt, and on which
 doubt cannot be cast by any person soever. It is certain that we see
 in many places in the world a peculiar people, separated from all
 other peoples of the world, which is called the Jewish people.
 
 I see then a mass of religions in many countries, and in all times,
 but they neither please me by their morality, nor convince me by
 their proofs. Thus I should equally have refused the religion of
 Mahomet and of China, of the ancient Romans and of the Egyptians, for
 the sole reason, that none having more marks of truth than another,
 nor any thing which necessarily decides me, reason cannot incline to
 one rather than the other.
 
 But while I consider this vacillating and strange variety of morals
 and beliefs at different times, I find in one corner of the world a
 peculiar people, separated from all other nations upon earth, the
 oldest of all, and whose histories are earlier by many ages than the
 most ancient in our possession.
 
 I find then this great and numerous people, sprung from a single
 man, who adore one God, and guide themselves by a law, given them
 as they say, by his own hand. They maintain that to them alone in
 the world God has revealed his mysteries, that all men are corrupt
 and under the wrath of God, are all abandoned to their senses and
 imagination, whence arise the strange errors and continual changes
 among them, both of religions and of manners, whereas this nation
 remains unshaken in its conduct: but that God will not leave other
 nations in darkness for ever, that there will come a Saviour for
 all, that they are in the world to announce his coming, that they
 were expressly formed to be the forerunners and heralds of this
 great advent, and to call on all nations to join with them in the
 expectation of this Redeemer.
 
 
 _Advantages of the Jewish people._--In this search the Jewish people
 at first attracts my attention by a number of wonderful and singular
 things which appear among them.
 
 I see first that they are a people wholly composed of brethren, and
 whereas all others are formed by the assemblage of an infinity of
 families, this, though so prodigiously fruitful, has sprung from one
 man only, and being thus all one flesh, and members one of another,
 they form a powerful state consisting of one family, a fact without
 example.
 
 This family or nation is the most ancient known to men, a fact which
 seems to invest it with a peculiar veneration, especially in regard
 to our present enquiry, because if God has during all time revealed
 himself to men, these are they from whom we must learn the tradition.
 
 This people is not peculiar only by their antiquity, but also
 remarkable by their duration, which has been unbroken from their
 origin till now. For while the nations of Greece and Italy, of
 Lacedæmon, Athens and Rome, and others who came after, have long been
 extinct, these still remain, and in spite of the endeavours of many
 powerful princes who have a hundred times striven to destroy them,
 as their historians testify, and as we can easily understand by the
 natural order of things during so long a space of years, they have
 nevertheless been preserved, and extending from the earliest times
 to the latest, their history comprehends in its duration all our
 histories.
 
 The Law by which this people is governed is at once the most ancient
 law in the world, the most perfect, and the only one which has
 been kept without interruption in a state. This is what Josephus
 excellently shows, against Apion, as does Philo the Jew in many
 places, where they point out that it is so ancient that the very name
 of _law_ was only known by the men of old more than a thousand years
 afterwards, so that Homer, who has treated the history of so many
 States, has not once used the word. And it is easy to judge of the
 perfection of the Law by simply reading it, for it plainly provides
 for all things with so great wisdom, equity and judgment, that the
 most ancient legislators, Greek and Roman, having had some glimpse
 of it, have borrowed from it their principal laws, as appears by
 those called Of the Twelve Tables, and by the other proofs given by
 Josephus.
 
 Yet this law is at the same time severe and rigorous beyond all
 others in respect to their religious worship, constraining the
 people, in order to keep them in their duty, to a thousand peculiar
 and painful observances, on pain of death. Whence it is a most
 astonishing fact, that it has been constantly preserved during many
 ages by a people so rebellious and impatient, while all other states
 have changed their laws from time to time, although they are far more
 lenient.
 
 The book containing this law, the first of all laws, is itself the
 most ancient book in the world, those of Homer, Hesiod and others
 dating from six or seven hundred years later.
 
 
 _Falsity of other religions._--They have no witnesses; this people
 has them. God challenges other religions to produce such marks. Is.
 xliii. 9,--xliv. 8.
 
 
 This is fact. While all philosophers separate into different sects,
 there is found in one corner of the world, a people, the most ancient
 in the world, declaring that all the world is in error, that God has
 revealed to them the truth, that they will abide always on the earth.
 In fact, all other sects come to an end, this one still endures,
 and has done so for four thousand years. They assert that they hold
 from their ancestors that man has fallen from communion with God, is
 entirely separated from God, but that he has promised to redeem them,
 that their doctrine shall always exist on the earth;
 
 That their law has a twofold sense, that during sixteen hundred years
 they have had people whom they believed prophets foretelling both the
 time and the manner;
 
 That four hundred years after they were scattered everywhere in
 order that Jesus Christ should be everywhere announced, Jesus Christ
 came in the manner and time foretold;
 
 That the Jews have since been scattered abroad under a curse, yet
 nevertheless still exist.
 
 
 The creation and the deluge being past, and God not intending any
 more to destroy the world, nor to create it anew, nor to give any
 such great proofs of himself, he began to establish a people on the
 earth, formed of set purpose, which should last until the coming of
 that people whom Messiah should mould by his spirit.
 
 
 The Jews who were called to subdue the nations and their kings were
 slaves of sin, and the Christians whose calling has been to be
 servants and subjects, are free children.
 
 
 The devil troubled the zeal of the Jews before Jesus Christ, because
 he would have been their salvation, but not since.
 
 The Jewish people mocked of the Gentiles, the Christian people
 persecuted.
 
 
 _Republic._--The Christian and even the Jewish Republic has only had
 God for master, as Philo the Jew notices, _On Monarchy_.
 
 When they fought, they did so for God alone, their chief hope was in
 God alone, they considered their towns as belonging to God, and they
 kept them for God. I Chron. xix. 13.
 
 
 The sceptre was not interrupted by the carrying away into Babylon,
 because the return was promised and foretold.
 
 
 A single phrase of David or of Moses, as for instance that God will
 circumcise the heart, enables us to judge of their spirit. If all
 the rest of their language were ambiguous, and left it doubtful
 whether they were philosophers or Christians, one single sentence of
 this kind would determine all the rest, as one sentence of Epictetus
 determines the character of the rest to be the contrary. So far we
 may be in doubt, but not afterwards.
 
 
 While the prophets were for maintaining the law, the people were
 negligent, but since there have been no more prophets, zeal has taken
 their place.
 
 The zeal of the Jewish people for the law, especially since there
 have been no more prophets.
 
 
 Maccabees after they had no more prophets. The Masorah after Jesus
 Christ.
 
 
 
 
 _THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE SACRED BOOKS._
 
 
 _The Premiss._--Moses was a man of genius. If then he ruled himself
 by his reason, he should say nothing clearly which was directly
 against reason.
 
 So all the apparent weaknesses are strength. Example: the two
 genealogies in Saint Matthew and Saint Luke. What can be more clear
 than that this was not concerted?
 
 
 _Proof of Moses._--Why should Moses make the lives of men so long,
 and their generations so few?
 
 Because it is not the length of years, but the number of generations
 which renders matters obscure.
 
 For truth is impaired only by the change of men. And yet Moses places
 two things, the most memorable that can be imagined, that is to say
 the creation and the deluge, so near that we can reach from one to
 the other.
 
 
 _Another proof._--The longevity of the patriarchs, instead of
 causing the loss of past history, was the rather serviceable for its
 preservation. For if we are not always well instructed in the history
 of our ancestors, it is because we have never lived much with them,
 and because they are often dead before we have ourselves attained the
 age of reason. But when men lived so long, children lived long with
 their parents, and long conversed with them. Now, their conversation
 could only be of the history of their ancestors, since to that all
 history was reduced, and men did not study science or art, which now
 take up so much of our daily discourse. We see also that at that time
 men took special care to preserve their genealogies.
 
 
 Shem, who saw Lamech, who saw Adam, saw also Jacob, who saw those who
 saw Moses; therefore the deluge and the creation are true. This is
 conclusive among certain people who clearly understand it.
 
 
 Josephus conceals the shame of his nation.
 
 Moses does not conceal his own shame nor....
 
 _Quis mihi det ut omnes prophetent?_
 
 He was tired of the people.
 
 
 When the creation of the people began to stand at a distance, God
 provided a single contemporary historian, and appointed a whole
 people as the guardians of this book, in order that the history might
 be the most authentic in all the world, that all men might learn a
 thing so necessary to know, yet so impossible to be known in any
 other way.
 
 
 If the story in Esdras is credible, then it must be believed that
 Scripture is Holy Scripture. For this story is founded only on the
 authority of those who allege that of the Seventy, which shows that
 the Scripture is holy.
 
 Therefore if the tale be true, we find our proof therein, if not
 we have it elsewhere. Thus those who would ruin the truth of our
 Religion, founded on Moses, establish it by the same authority by
 which they attack it. Thus by this providence it still exists.
 
 
 _On Esdras._--The story that the books were burnt with the temple
 shown to be false by The Book of Maccabees. _Jeremiah gave them the
 law._
 
 The story that he recited the whole by heart. Josephus and Esdras
 note _that he read the book_. Baronius, Ann. 180. _Nullus penitus
 Hebræorum antiquorum reperitur qui tradiderit libros periisse et per
 Esdram esse restitutos, nisi in IV. Esdræ._
 
 The story that he changed the letters.
 
 Philo, _in Vita Moysis_: _Illa lingua ac charactere quo antiquitus
 scripta est lex, sic permansit usque ad LXX_.
 
 Josephus says the Law was in Hebrew when it was translated by the
 Seventy.
 
 Under Antiochus and Vespasian, when they wished to abolish the books,
 and when there was no prophet, they could not do so. And under the
 Babylonians when there had been no persecution, and when there were
 so many prophets, would they have allowed them to be burnt?
 
 Josephus derides the Greeks who would not allow....
 
 
 Tertullian.--_Perinde potuit abolefactam eam violentia cataclysmi
 in spiritu rursus reformare, quemadmodum et Hierosolymis Babylonia
 expugnatione deletis, omne instrumentum Judaicæ literaturæ per Esdram
 constat restauratum._ Lib. I. _De Cultu femin._ cap. iii.
 
 He says that Noah might as easily have restored by the spirit the
 book of Enoch, destroyed by the deluge, as Esdras have restored the
 Scriptures lost during the Captivity.
 
 Θεὸς ἐν τῇ ἐπὶ Ναβουχοδονόσορ αἰχμαλωσίᾳ τοῦ λαοῦ διαφθαρεισῶν τῶν
 γραφῶν, ἐνέπνευσε  Ἐσδρᾷ τῷ ἱερεῖ ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς Λεοὶ τοῦς τῶν προγεγονότων
 προφητῶν πάντας ἀναταξάσθαι λόγους, καὶ ἀποκαταστῆσαι τῷ λαῷ
 τὴν διὰ Μωσέως νομοθησίαν. He alleges this to prove that it is not
 incredible that the Seventy should have explained the holy Scriptures
 with that uniformity which we admire in them. Euseb. lib. v. Hist.
 cap. 8. And he took that from Saint Irenæus.
 
 Saint Hilary in his preface to the Psalms says that Esdras arranged
 the Psalms in order.
 
 The origin of this tradition comes from the Book of Esdras.
 
 _Deus glorificatus est, et Scripturæ veræ divinæ creditæ sunt,
 omnibus eandem et eisdem verbis et eisdem nominibus recitantibus
 ab initio usque ad finem, uti et præsentes gentes cognoscerent
 quoniam per inspirationem Dei interpretatæ sunt Scripturæ, et non
 esset mirabile Deum hoc in eis operatum, quando in ea captivitate
 populi quæ facta est a Nabuchodonosor corruptis Scripturis et
 post septuaginta annos Judæis descendentibus in regionem suam, et
 post deinde temporibus Artaxexis Persarum regis inspiravit Hesdræ
 sacerdoti tribus Levi præteritorum prophetarum omnes rememorare
 sermones et restituere populo eam legem quæ data est per Moysen._
 
 
 _Against the Story in Esdras_, II. Maccab. 2. Josephus,
 _Antiquities_, II. 1.--Cyrus took occasion from the prophecy of
 Isaiah to release the people. The Jews held property in peace under
 Cyrus in Babylon, therefore they might well have the Law.
 
 Josephus, in the whole history of Esdras, says not a single word of
 this restoration.--II. Kings, xvii. 37.
 
 
 Scripture has provided passages of consolation and warning for every
 condition of life.
 
 Nature seems to have done the same thing by her two infinities,
 natural and moral, for we shall always have those who are higher and
 lower, who are more and less able, who are noble and in low estate,
 in order to abate our pride, and raise our lowliness.
 
 
 _Order, against the objection that the Scripture has no order._--The
 heart has its own order; the mind too has its own, which is by
 premisses and demonstrations, that of the heart is wholly different.
 It were absurd to prove that we are worthy of love by putting forth
 in order the causes of love.
 
 Jesus Christ and Saint Paul use the order of charity, not of the
 intellect, for they wish to warm, not to teach; the same with Saint
 Augustine. This order consists mainly in digressions on each point
 which may illustrate the main end, and keep it ever in view.
 
 
 God and the Apostles foreseeing that the seed of pride would cause
 heresies to spring up, and not wishing to give them occasion to arise
 by defining them, have placed in the Scripture and the prayers of the
 Church contrary words and sentences to produce their fruit in time.
 
 So in morals he gives charity to produce fruits contrary to lust.
 
 He who knows the will of his master will be beaten with more stripes,
 because of the power he has by his knowledge. _Qui justus est
 justificetur adhuc_, because of the power which he has by justice.
 From him who has received most will the greatest account be demanded,
 because the aid received has given him greater power.
 
 There is an universal and essential difference between the actions of
 the will and all other actions.
 
 The will is one of the chief organs of belief, not that it forms
 belief, but that things are true or false according to the side on
 which we view them. The will which chooses one side rather than the
 other turns away the mind from considering the qualities of all that
 it does not like to see, thus the mind, moving in accord with the
 will, stays to look at the side it chooses, and so judges by what it
 sees.
 
 
 All things work together for good to the elect, even the obscurities
 of Scripture, which they honour because of what is divinely clear.
 And all things work together for evil to the reprobate, even what is
 clear, which they blaspheme because of the obscurities they do not
 understand.
 
 
 How many stars have telescopes discovered for us which did not exist
 for the philosophers of old. Men have roundly taken holy Scripture to
 task in regard to the great multitude of stars, saying: "We know that
 there are only a thousand and twenty-two."
 
 
 The meaning changes according to the words which express it. The
 meaning receives its dignity from words instead of giving it. We must
 seek examples of this.
 
 
 Words differently arranged have different meanings, and meanings
 differently arranged produce different effects.
 
 
 
 
 _THE PROPHECIES._
 
 
 The prophecies are the strongest proofs of Jesus Christ. For these
 therefore God has made the most provision; since the event which has
 fulfilled them is a miracle existing from the birth of the Church
 to the end. Therefore God raised up prophets during sixteen hundred
 years, and during four hundred years afterwards he dispersed all
 these prophecies with all the Jews, who bore them into all regions of
 the world. Such was the preparation for the birth of Jesus Christ,
 whose Gospel exacting belief from every man made it necessary not
 only that there should be prophecies to inspire this belief, but that
 these prophecies should be spread throughout the whole world, so that
 the whole world should embrace it.
 
 _Prophecies._--If one man alone had made a book of predictions
 concerning Jesus Christ, both as to the time and the manner of
 his coming, and if Jesus Christ had come in agreement with these
 prophecies, the fact would have had infinite force.
 
 But in this case there is much more. Here is a succession of men
 for the space of four thousand years, who without interruption or
 variation, follow one another in foretelling the same event. Here is
 a whole people announcing it, existing for four thousand years, to
 testify in a body their certainty, from which they cannot be diverted
 by all the threatenings and persecutions brought to bear against
 them; this is in a far greater degree important.
 
 
 But it was not enough that the prophecies existed, they needed also
 distribution through all places, and preservation through all time.
 And in order that this agreement might not be taken as an effect of
 chance, it was necessary it should be foretold.
 
 It is much more glorious for the Messiah that they should be
 spectators and even instruments of his glory, beyond the fact that
 God had preserved him.
 
 
 _Proof._--Prophecy with accomplishment.
 
 That which preceded, and that which followed Jesus Christ.
 
 
 The prophecies concerning the Messiah are mingled with some
 concerning other matters, so that neither the prophecies of the
 Messiah should be without proof, nor the special prophecies without
 fruit.
 
 
 _Non habemus regem nisi Cæsarem._ Therefore Jesus Christ was the
 Messiah, because they had no longer any king but a stranger, and
 because they would have no other.
 
 
 The eternal kingdom of the race of David, II. Chron., by all the
 prophecies, and with an oath. And it was not temporally accomplished.
 Jer. xxxiii. 20.
 
 
 Zeph. iii. 9.--"I will give my words to the Gentiles, that all may
 serve me with one consent."
 
 Ezekiel xxxvii 25.--"My servant David shall be their prince for ever."
 
 Exodus iv. 22.--"Israel is my first born."
 
 
 We might easily think that when the prophets foretold that the
 sceptre would not depart from Judah until the advent of the eternal
 king, they spoke to flatter the people, and that their prophecy was
 proved false by Herod. But to show that this was not their meaning,
 and that on the contrary they well knew that the temporal kingdom
 should cease, they said they would be without a king, and without a
 prince, and for a long time. Hosea iii. 4.
 
 
 _Prophecies._--That Jesus Christ will sit on the right hand till God
 has put his enemies under his feet.
 
 Therefore he will not subject them himself.
 
 
 The time of the first advent was foretold, the time of the second
 is not so, because the first was to be secret, the second must be
 glorious, and so manifest that even his enemies will recognise it.
 But as his first coming was to be obscure, and to be known only of
 those who searched the Scriptures....
 
 
 The prophecies must be unintelligible to the wicked, Daniel xii. 10,
 Hosea xiv. 9, but intelligible to those who are well instructed.
 
 The prophecies which represent him poor, represent him master of the
 nations.--Is. lii. 16, etc liii. Zech. ix. 9.
 
 The prophecies which foretell the time foretell him only as master of
 the Gentiles and suffering, and not as in the clouds nor as judge.
 And those which represent him thus as judge and in glory do not
 specify the time.
 
 
 Do you think that the prophecies cited in the Gospel were reported to
 make you believe? No, but to prevent your believing.
 
 
 _Prophecies._--The time was foretold by the state of the Jewish
 people, by the state of the heathen world, by the state of the
 temple, by the number of years.
 
 It is daring to predict the same affair in so many ways. It was
 necessary that the four idolatrous or pagan monarchies, the end of
 the kingdom of Judah, and the seventy weeks should coincide, and all
 this before the second temple was destroyed.
 
 
 _Prophecies._--The seventy weeks of Daniel are equivocal in the term
 of commencement, because of the terms of the prophecy, and in the
 term of conclusion because of the differences in the chronologists.
 But all this difference extends only to two hundred years.
 
 
 We understand the prophecies only when we see the events occur, thus
 the proofs of retreat, discretion, silence, etc., are evidence only
 to those who know and believe them.
 
 Joseph so interior in a law so exterior.
 
 Exterior penances dispose to interior, as humiliations to humility.

 The more I examine them the more I find truths in them, both in those
 which preceded and those which followed, both the synagogue which
 was foretold, and the wretches who adhere to it, and who, being our
 enemies, are admirable witnesses of the truth of these prophecies,
 wherein their misery and even their blindness is foretold.
 
 I find this sequence, our Religion wholly divine in its authority, in
 its duration, in its perpetuity, in its morality, in its conduct, its
 doctrine, and its effects.
 
 The frightful darkness of the Jews foretold. _Eris palpans in
 meridie. Dabitur liber scienti literas, et dicet: Non possum legere._
 
 
 Hosea i. 9. "Ye shall not be my people and I will not be your God,"
 when you are multiplied after the dispersion. "In the places where it
 was said: Ye are not my people, I will call them my people."
 
 
 _Predictions._--That under the fourth monarchy, before the
 destruction of the second temple, before the dominion of the Jews was
 taken away, and in the seventieth week of Daniel, while the second
 temple was still standing, the Gentiles should be instructed, and
 brought to the knowledge of the God worshipped by the Jews, that
 those who loved him should be delivered from their enemies, and
 filled with his fear and love.
 
 And it came to pass that under the fourth monarchy, before the
 destruction of the second temple, etc, the Gentiles in crowds
 worshipped God and lived an angelic life. Maidens dedicated their
 virginity and their life to God, men gave up their pleasures, what
 Plato was only able to effect upon a few men, chosen and instructed
 to that end, a secret force, by the power of a few words, now wrought
 upon a hundred million ignorant men.
 
 The rich left their wealth, children left the luxurious homes of
 their parents to go into the austerity of the desert, etc., according
 to Philo the Jew. All this was foretold long ages ago. For two
 thousand years no Gentile had worshipped the God of the Jews, and at
 the time foretold, the crowd of Gentiles worshipped this only God.
 The temples were destroyed, the very kings bowed themselves under the
 cross. All this was of the Spirit of God spread abroad upon the earth.
 
 
 _Holiness._--_Effundam spiritum meum._--All nations had been in
 unbelief and lust; the whole world was now ablaze with love. Princes
 quitted their state, maidens suffered martyrdom. This power sprang
 from the advent of Messiah, this was the effect and these the tokens
 of his coming.
 
 
 _Predictions._--It was foretold that in the time of Messiah he would
 come and establish a new covenant, such as should make them forget
 the coming out from Egypt, Jer. xxiii. 5, Is. xliii. 16, that he
 would put his Law not in externals, but in the heart, that Jesus
 Christ would put his fear, which had been only from without, in the
 midst of the heart. Who does not see the Christian law in all this?
 
 
 _Prophecies._--That the Jews would reject Jesus Christ, and would
 themselves be rejected of God because the choice vine brought
 forth only wild grapes; that the chosen people should be disloyal,
 ungrateful, incredulous, _populum non credentem et contradicentem_;
 that God would strike them with blindness, and that in full mid-day
 they would grope like blind men; that his messenger should go before
 him.
 
 
 "... Then shall a man no more teach his neighbour, saying, There is
 the Lord, _for God will make himself felt by all, your sons shall
 prophesy_. _I will put my spirit and my fear in your heart._"
 
 All that is the same thing. To prophesy is to speak of God, not by
 outward proofs, but by a feeling interior and direct.
 
 
 _Prophecies._--_Transfixerunt_, Zech. xii. 10.
 
 That there should come a deliverer to crush the demon's head, and to
 free his people from their sins, _ex omnibus iniquitatibus_. That
 there should be a new and eternal covenant, and a new and eternal
 priesthood after the order of Melchisedek, that the Christ should be
 glorious, powerful, mighty, and yet so miserable that he would not
 be recognised, nor taken for what he is, but be rejected and slain,
 that his people which denied him should be no more his people, that
 the idolaters would receive him and trust in him, that he would quit
 Zion to reign in the centre of idolatry, that the Jews should exist
 for ever, that he would spring from Judah, and at a time when there
 should be no longer a king.
 
 
 That Jesus Christ would be small in his beginnings, and afterwards
 would increase. The little stone of Daniel.
 
 
 That he would teach men the perfect way,
 
 And never has there come before him nor after him any man who has
 taught anything divine approaching this.
 
 
 That then idolatry would be overthrown, that the Messiah would cast
 down all idols, and would bring men into the worship of the true God.
 
 That the idol temples would be overthrown, and that among all
 nations and in all places of the world men would offer to God a pure
 sacrifice, not of beasts.
 
 That he would be king of the Jews and Gentiles. And we see this king
 of Jews and Gentiles oppressed by both, both equally conspiring
 his death, we see him bear rule over both, destroying the worship
 established by Moses in Jerusalem its centre, where he placed his
 earliest Church, as well as the worship of idols in Rome its centre,
 where he placed his chief Church.
 
 
 No Gentile from Moses to Jesus Christ according to the Rabbis
 themselves. The crowd of the Gentiles after Jesus Christ believed in
 the books of Moses and observed their essence and spirit, casting
 away only what was useless.

 Moses first taught the Trinity, original sin, the Messiah.
 
 David was a great witness.
 
 A king, good, merciful, a fair soul, a fine mind, powerful. He
 prophesied, and his wonders came to pass. This is infinite.
 
 He had only to say that he was the Messiah, had he been vain enough,
 for the prophecies are clearer about him than about Jesus Christ. The
 same with Saint John.
 
 
 _Special predictions._--They were strangers in Egypt without any
 private possessions, in that country or in any other, when Jacob
 dying and blessing his twelve children declared to them that they
 should possess a great land, and foretold in particular to the family
 of Judah that the kings who would one day govern them should be of
 his race, and that all his brethren should be subject to him.
 
 This same Jacob disposing of the future land as though he were its
 master, gave a portion to Joseph more than to the others. "I give
 thee," said he, "a portion more than to thy brethren." And blessing
 his two children, Ephraim and Manasseh, whom Joseph had presented to
 him, the elder, Manasseh, on his right, and the young Ephraim on his
 left, he put his arms cross-wise, and placing his right hand on the
 head of Ephraim, and the left on Manasseh, he blessed them thus. And
 when Joseph represented to him that he was preferring the younger he
 answered him with admirable decision, "I know it well, my son, I know
 it, but Ephraim shall increase in a way quite other than Manasseh."
 This has been in fact so true in the result that, being alone almost
 as abundant as the two entire lines which compose a whole kingdom,
 they have been usually called by the name of Ephraim alone.
 
 This same Joseph when dying commanded his children to bear his bones
 with them into that land to which they did not come for two hundred
 years afterwards.
 
 Moses, who wrote all these things so long before they happened,
 himself made for each family the partition of the land before they
 entered it, as though he had been master of it.
 
 He gave them judges to divide it, he prescribed the entire political
 form of government which they should observe, the cities of refuge
 which they should build, and....
 
 
 Daniel ii. "All thy sooth-sayers and wise men cannot show unto thee
 the secret which thou hast demanded.
 
 "But there is a God in heaven, who can do so, and he has revealed in
 thy dream the things which shall be in the latter days." _This dream
 must have caused him great uneasiness._
 
 "And it is not by my own wisdom that I have knowledge of this secret,
 but by the revelation of this same God who has discovered it to me,
 to make it manifest in thy presence.
 
 "Thy dream was of this kind. Thou sawest a great image, high and
 terrible, which stood before thee. His head was of gold, his breast
 and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass. His legs
 of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.
 
 "Thus thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands, which smote
 the image upon his feet, that were of iron and clay and brake them to
 pieces.
 
 "Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold,
 broken to pieces together, and the wind carried them away, but this
 stone which smote the image became a great mountain, and filled
 the whole earth. This is the dream, and now I will give thee the
 interpretation.
 
 "Thou who art the greatest of kings, and to whom God has given a
 power so extended that thou art renowned among all people, art the
 golden head of the image which thou hast seen.
 
 "But after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and
 another of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.
 
 "But the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, and even as iron
 breaketh in pieces, and subdueth all things, so this empire shall
 break in pieces and bruise.
 
 "And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of clay and part of
 iron, the kingdom shall be divided; and it shall be partly strong and
 partly broken.
 
 "But as iron cannot be firmly mixed with clay, so they who are
 represented by the iron and by the clay, cannot cleave one to another
 though united by marriage.
 
 "Now in the days of these kings will God raise up a Kingdom, which
 shall never be destroyed, nor ever be delivered up to another people.
 
 "It shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it
 shall stand for ever, according as thou sawest that the stone was
 cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it fell from the
 mountain, and brake in pieces the iron, the clay, the silver and
 the gold. This is what God has revealed to thee of the things
 which must come in the fulness of time. This dream is true and the
 interpretation thereof is faithful. Then Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his
 face towards the earth, etc."
 
 
 Daniel viii. "Daniel having seen the combat of the ram and of the
 he-goat, who vanquished him and ruled over the earth, whereof the
 principal horn being broken four others came up towards the four
 winds of heaven, and out of one of them came forth a little horn,
 which waxed exceeding great toward the South and toward the East, and
 toward the land of Israel, and it waxed great, even to the host of
 heaven, and it cast down some of the stars, and stamped upon them,
 and at last overthrew the prince, and by him the daily sacrifice was
 taken away and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
 
 "This is what Daniel saw. He asked the explanation and a voice cried
 in this manner, 'Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.'
 And Gabriel said,
 
 "The ram which thou sawest is the king of the Medes and Persians, and
 the he-goat is the king of Greece, and the great horn that is between
 his eyes is the first king of this monarchy.
 
 "Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms
 shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his strength.
 
 "Now in the latter time of their kingdom when iniquities shall be
 grown up, there shall arise a king insolent and strong, but his power
 shall be not his own. To him all things shall succeed after his will,
 and he shall destroy the holy people, and through his policy also he
 shall cause craft to prosper in his hand, and he shall destroy many.
 He shall also stand up against the Prince of Princes, but he shall
 perish miserably, and nevertheless by a violent hand."
 
 Daniel ix. 20.
 
 "As I was praying God with all my heart, and confessing my sin and
 the sin of all my people, and prostrating myself before God, even
 Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, came to
 me and touched me about the time of the evening oblation, and he
 informed me and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to teach thee
 that thou mightest understand. At the beginning of thy prayer I came
 to show thee that which thou didst desire, for thou art greatly
 beloved: therefore understand the matter and consider the vision.
 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy
 city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and
 to abolish iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness; to
 accomplish the vision and the prophecies, and to anoint the Most Holy.
 
 "After which this people shall be no more thy people, nor this city
 the holy city. The times of wrath are passed and the years of grace
 shall come for ever.
 
 "Know therefore, and understand, that from the going forth of the
 commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the
 Prince, shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks: the
 street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times."
 
 The Hebrews were accustomed to divide numbers, and to place the
 smaller first, so that seven and sixty-two make sixty-nine. Of this
 seventy there will then rest the seventieth: that is to say the seven
 last years of which he will speak next, and after these sixty-two
 weeks which have followed the seven first, the Christ should be
 killed, and a people would come with its prince, who should destroy
 the city, and the sanctuary, and overwhelm all, and the end of that
 war will accomplish the desolation. Christ shall be killed after the
 sixty-nine weeks, that is to say, in the last week.
 
 "Now one week, which is the seventieth, which remains, shall confirm
 the covenant with many, and in the midst of the week, that is to say
 the last three years and a half, he shall cause the sacrifice and the
 oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall
 make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined
 shall be poured upon the desolate."
 
 Daniel xi. The angel said to Daniel:
 
 "There shall stand up yet,"--after Cyrus, under whom all this still
 is,--"three kings in Persia,"--Cambyses, Smyrdis, Darius;--"and the
 fourth,"--Xerxes, who shall then come,--"shall be far richer than
 they all, and far stronger, and shall stir up all his people against
 the Greeks, and a mighty king shall stand up,"--Alexander,--"that
 shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. And
 when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be
 divided in four parts toward the four winds of heaven,"--see also
 vii. 6 vii. 8--"but not to his posterity, and his successors shall
 not equal his power, for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for
 others beside these,"--his four principal successors.
 
 "And the king--Ptolemy son of Lagos,--of the south,"--Egypt,--"shall
 be strong,--but one of his princes shall be strong above
 him,"--Seleucus king of Syria,--"and his dominion shall be a great
 dominion,"--Appian says that he was the most powerful of Alexander's
 successors.
 
 "And in the end of years they shall join themselves together, and
 the king's daughter of the South,"--Berenice, daughter of Ptolemy
 Philadelphus, son of the other Ptolemy--"shall come to the king of
 the North to make peace between these princes"--to Antiochus Deus,
 king of Syria and of Asia, son of Seleucus Lagidas.
 
 "But neither she nor her seed shall have a long authority, for she
 and they that sent her and they that brought her, and her children
 and her friends, shall be delivered to death,"--Berenice and her son
 were killed by Seleucus Callinicus.
 
 "But out of a branch of her roots"--Ptolemy Euergetes was the son of
 the same father as Berenice--"shall one stand up in his estate, who
 shall come with an army into the land of the king of the north, and
 shall put all under subjection, and carry captives into Egypt their
 gods, their princes, their gold, their silver, and all their precious
 spoils, and shall continue many years when the king of the North can
 do nought against him."--If he had not been called into Egypt by
 domestic reasons, says Justin, he would have entirely ruined Seleucus.
 
 "And thus he shall return into his kingdom, but his sons shall be
 stirred up and shall prepare an exceeding great multitude"--Seleucus
 Ceraunus, Antiochus the Great.
 
 "And their army shall come and overthrow all, whereat the king of
 the South being moved with choler, shall come forth and fight with
 him and conquer,"--Ptolemy Philopator against Antiochus the Great at
 Raphia--"and his troops shall become insolent, and his heart shall be
 lifted up,"--this Ptolemy desecrated the temple--Josephus--"and he
 shall cast down many ten thousands, but he shall not be strengthened
 by it.
 
 "For the king of the North"--Antiochus the Great--"shall return
 with a greater multitude than before,"--in the reign of the young
 Ptolemy Epiphanes--"and then a great number of enemies shall stand
 up against the king of the south, also the apostates and robbers of
 thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they
 shall perish"--those who abandon their religion to please Euergetes,
 when he will send his troops to Scopas. For Antiochus will again take
 Scopas and conquer them.
 
 "And the king of the North shall destroy the fenced cities and the
 armies of the south shall not withstand, and all shall yield to his
 will. He shall stand in the land of Israel and it shall yield to him.
 
 "And thus he will think to render himself master of all the empire of
 Egypt,"--despising the youth of Epiphanes, says Justin.
 
 "And for that he will make alliance with him and give his
 daughter,"--Cleopatra, in order that she may betray her husband. On
 which Appian says that doubtful of being able to make himself master
 of Egypt by force, because of the protection of the Romans, he wished
 to attempt it by craft. "He would fain corrupt her, but she shall not
 stand on his side, neither be for him. After this shall he turn his
 face unto the isles,"--that is to say, the sea-ports,--"and shall
 take many,"--as Appian relates.
 
 "But a prince shall oppose his conquests and cause the reproach
 offered by him to cease,"--Scipio Africanus, who stopped the progress
 of Antiochus the Great because he offended the Romans in the person
 of their allies.--"He will return into his kingdom and perish and be
 no more."--He was killed by his soldiers.
 
 "And he who stands in his place shall be a tyrant, a raiser of taxes
 in the glory of the kingdom," that is the people, Seleucus Philopator
 or Soter, the son of Antiochus the Great--"but within a few days he
 shall be destroyed, neither in anger nor in battle;
 
 "And in his place shall stand up a vile person, unworthy of the
 honour of the kingdom, but he shall come in by skilful flatteries.
 
 "All armies shall bend before him, he will conquer them, and even the
 prince with whom he has made a league. For having renewed the league
 with him, he will deceive him, and come in with a few tribes into
 his province, calm and without fear. He will take the best places,
 and shall do that which his fathers have not done, and ravage on all
 sides. He will forecast devices, during his time."
 
 
 The zeal of the Jews for their law and their temple. Josephus and
 Philo the Jew _ad Caium_.
 
 What other people has so great a zeal, but for them it was a
 necessity.

 leader taken from the thigh, and the fourth monarchy.
 
 How fortunate we are to have such light amid such darkness.
 
 How grand it is to see by the eye of faith, Darius and Cyrus,
 Alexander, the Romans, Pompey and Herod working, though
 unconsciously, for the glory of the Gospel!
 
 
 How grand to see by the eye of faith the histories of Herod, of
 Cæsar....
 
 
 _The reprobation of the Jews and conversion of the Gentiles._--Isaiah
 lxv. "I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them
 that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that
 did not call upon my name.
 
 "I have spread out my hands all the day unto an unbelieving people,
 which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;
 a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that
 sacrificeth to idols, etc.
 
 "These shall be scattered like smoke in the day of my wrath, etc.
 
 "Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers will I gather,
 and will requite you according to your works.
 
 "Thus saith the Lord, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and
 one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it.
 
 "So will I take a seed of Jacob and Judah to possess my mountains,
 and mine elect and my servants shall inherit it, and my fertile and
 abundant plains, but I will destroy all others, because you have
 forgotten your God to follow strange gods. I have called you and you
 have not answered, I have spoken and you have not heard, and you have
 chosen the things which I forbade.
 
 "Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye
 shall be hungry; my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed;
 my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry and howl
 for vexation of spirit.
 
 "And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the
 Lord shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name, that he
 who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in God, etc.;
 because the former troubles are forgotten.
 
 "For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former
 things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
 
 "But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for,
 behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. And I
 will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of
 weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying....
 
 "Before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I
 will hear. The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion
 shall eat straw like the ox: and dust shall be the serpent's meat.
 They shall not hurt nor kill in all my holy mountain."
 
 Is. lvi. "Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for
 my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.
 
 "Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that keepeth
 my salvation and holdeth his hand from doing any evil.
 
 "Neither let the strangers, that have joined themselves to the Lord,
 say, God will separate me from his people. For thus saith the Lord:
 Whoso will keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me,
 and take hold of my covenant; Even unto them will I give in mine
 house a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will
 give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off....
 
 "Therefore is judgment far from us: we wait for light, but behold
 obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness. We grope for the
 wall like the blind: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are
 in desolate places as dead men.
 
 "We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for
 judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far from us."
 
 Isaiah lxvi. 18. "But I know their works and their thoughts: I come
 that I may gather all nations and tongues, and they shall see my
 glory.
 
 "And I will set a sign among them, and I will send of them that shall
 be saved unto the nations, to Africa, to Lydia, to Italy, to Greece,
 and to the people that have not heard my name, neither have seen my
 glory. And they shall bring your brethren."
 
 Jer. vii. _Reprobation of the Temple._
 
 "But go ye to Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what
 I did to it for the wickedness of my people. And now, because ye have
 done all these works, saith the Lord, I will do unto this house, in
 which my name is called upon, wherein ye trust, and unto the place
 which I gave to your priests, as I have done to Shiloh." For I have
 rejected it and made myself a temple elsewhere.
 
 "And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your
 brethren, the whole seed of Ephraim." Rejected absolutely.
 
 "Therefore pray not thou for this people."
 
 Jer. vii. 21. "What avails it you to add sacrifice to sacrifice? For
 I spake not unto your fathers, when I brought them out of the land
 of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices: But this thing
 commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and
 ye shall be my people. For it was only after they had sacrificed to
 golden calves that I gave myself sacrifices to turn into good an evil
 custom." Jer. vii. 4. "Trust not in lying words, saying, The temple
 of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, are
 these."

 able to escape."
 
 _Types._--Isaiah v. "The Lord had a vineyard from which he looked for
 grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. I will therefore uproot and
 destroy it, the earth shall produce nothing but thorns, and I will
 forbid the heaven....
 
 "The vineyard of the Lord is the house of Israel, and the men of
 Judah his pleasant plant. I looked that they should do justice, and
 they bring forth only iniquities."
 
 Isaiah viii. "Sanctify the Lord with fear and trembling, and let him
 be your fear; but he shall be for a stone of stumbling and for a rock
 of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare
 to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many among them shall stumble
 against that stone, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be
 taken, and perish. Hide my words and cover my law for my disciples.
 
 "And I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the house
 of Jacob."
 
 Isaiah xxix. "Be astonished, and wonder, O people of Israel; waver
 and stagger: be drunken, but not with wine; stagger, but not with
 strong drink. For the Lord hath mingled for you the spirit of deep
 sleep. He will shut up your eyes: he will cover your prophets
 and princes that see visions." Daniel xii. "The wicked shall not
 understand, but the wise shall understand." Hosea, the last chapter,
 the last verse, after many temporal blessings says: "Who is wise, and
 he shall understand these things," etc.
 
 "And the visions of all the prophets are become unto you as a book
 that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, and who
 can read: and he saith, I cannot read it; for it is sealed: And when
 the book is delivered to him that is not learned, he saith, I am not
 learned.
 
 "Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people with their lips
 do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me,"--there is
 the reason and the cause, for they adore God in their heart, and
 understand the prophecies,--"and their fear toward me is taught by
 the precept of men.
 
 "Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do among this people a
 marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall
 perish, and the understanding...."

 are gods: and we will incline our heart unto your words. Teach us the
 things that have been from the beginning and prophecy those that are
 to come.
 
 "By this we shall know that ye are gods. Yea, do good, or do evil, if
 you can. Come now and let us reason together.
 
 "Behold, ye are of nothing, and an abomination, etc. Who hath
 declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that
 we may say, He is righteous? yea, there is none that sheweth, yea,
 there is none that declareth the future."
 
 Is. xlii. "I am the Lord: and my glory will I not give to another. I
 have foretold the former things which have come to pass, and declare
 those which are to come. Sing a new song to God in all the earth."
 
 "Bring forth the blind people that have eyes and see not, and the
 deaf that have ears and hear not. Let all the nations be gathered
 together. Who among them and their Gods can declare this, and shew
 us former things, and things to come? Let them bring forth their
 witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It
 is truth.
 
 "Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have
 chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he.
 
 "I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed wonders in your
 eyes: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.
 
 "For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all

 "Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of
 old.

 me." Is. xliv. "I am the first and the last, saith the Lord. Whoso
 will equal himself to me, let him declare the order of things since I
 formed the first peoples, and the things which are to come. Fear ye
 not, have I not declared all these things, ye are my witnesses."

 and I shewed them; and they came to pass. Because I knew that thou
 art obstinate, that thy spirit is rebellious, and thy brow brass; I
 have even before it came to pass shewed it thee: lest thou shouldst
 say, that it was the work of thy Gods and the effect of their
 commands.
 
 "Thou hast seen all this; and will not ye declare it? I have shewed
 thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst
 not know them. They are created now, and not from the beginning; even
 before the day when thou heardst them not; lest thou shouldst say,
 Behold, I knew them.
 
 "Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time
 that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldst deal very
 treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb."

 It is a tradition among us that when the Messiah shall come, the
 house of God, destined for the dispensation of his word, shall be
 full of filth and impurity, that the wisdom of the scribes shall be
 corrupt and rotten; that those who fear to sin shall be reproved by
 the people, and treated as fools and madmen.
 
 
 Is. xlix.
 
 "Listen, O isles, unto me, and hearken ye people from far: The Lord
 hath called me by my name even from the womb of my mother; he hath
 hid me in the shadow of his hand, he hath made my words like a sharp
 sword, and said: Thou art my servant, in whom I will be glorified.
 And I said, Lord, have I laboured in vain? have I spent my strength
 for nought? yet is my judgment with thee, O Lord, and my work before
 thee. When the Lord, who has formed me from the womb of my mother to
 be wholly for himself, in order to bring Jacob and Israel again to
 him, said unto me: Thou shalt be glorious in my sight, and I will
 be thy strength. It is a light thing that thou shouldst convert the
 tribes of Jacob; I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles,
 that thou mayest be my salvation unto the ends of the earth. These
 are the things which the Lord hath said to him that humbleth his soul
 to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers. Princes
 and kings shall worship thee because the Lord is faithful that hath
 chosen thee.
 
 "Again the Lord said unto me: I have heard thee in the days of
 salvation and of mercy, and I have established thee for a covenant of
 the people, and to cause thee to inherit the desolate nations, that
 thou mayest say to those who are in chains: Go forth, and to those
 that are in darkness: Come into the light, and possess these abundant
 and fertile lands. They shall no more labour, nor hunger, nor thirst,
 neither shall the sun smite them; for he that hath mercy on them
 shall lead them, even by the springs of waters shall he guide them,
 and make the mountains plain before them. Behold, the peoples shall
 come from all parts, from the East and from the West, from the North
 and from the South. Let the heaven give glory to God, let the earth
 rejoice, for it hath pleased the Lord to comfort his people, and he
 will have mercy on the poor who hope in him.
 
 "Yet Sion hath dared to say: The Lord hath forsaken and hath
 forgotten me. Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should
 not have compassion on the son of her womb, but if she forget, yet
 will I not forget thee, O Sion. I will bear thee always between my
 hands, and thy walls shall be ever before me. Thy builders are come,
 thy destroyers shall go forth of thee. Lift up thy eyes round about,
 and see all these are gathered together, to come to thee: as I live,
 saith the Lord, thou shall be clothed with all these as with an
 ornament, thy deserts, and thy desolate places, and the land of thy
 destruction shall now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants,
 and the children of thy barrenness shall still say in thy ears: the
 place is too strait for me, make me room to dwell in. And thou shall
 say in thy heart: Who hath begotten these? I was barren and brought
 not forth, led away, and captive: and who hath brought up these? I
 was destitute and alone: and these, where were they? And the Lord
 shall say: Behold, I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and will
 set up my standard to the people. And they shall bring thy children
 in their arms, and in their bosoms. And kings shall be thy nursing
 fathers, and queens thy nursing mothers: they shall worship thee with
 their face toward the earth, and they shall lick up the dust of thy
 feet. And thou shall know that I am the Lord, for they shall not be
 confounded that wait for him. Shall the prey be taken from the strong
 and mighty? But even if the captivity be taken away from the strong:
 nothing can hinder me to judge those that have judged thee, and thy
 children I will save. And all flesh shall know, that I am the Lord
 thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer the mighty One of Jacob.
 
 "Thus saith the Lord: What is this divorcement, wherewith I have put
 away the synagogue, and why have I delivered it into the hands of
 your enemies; is it not for your iniquities and your transgressions
 that I have put it away?
 
 "For I came, and no man would receive me, I called and none would
 hear. Is my arm shortened that I cannot save?
 
 "Therefore will I show the tokens of my anger, I will clothe the
 heavens with darkness, and will make sackcloth their covering.
 
 "The Lord hath given me the tongue of the learned that I should know
 how to uphold by word him that is weary. He hath wakened my ear, and
 I have heard him as a master.
 
 "The Lord hath revealed his will and I was not rebellious.
 
 "I gave my body to the smiters, and my cheeks to outrage, I hid
 not my face from shame and spitting, but the Lord has helped me,
 therefore I was not confounded.
 
 "He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me, and accuse
 me of sin, since God himself is my protector?
 
 "All men shall pass and be consumed by time, let those that fear the
 Lord hearken to the words of his servant, let him that languisheth in
 darkness put his trust in the Lord. But as for you, you do but set
 alight upon you the wrath of God, you walk upon the coals and among
 the flames you have kindled. This ye have of my hand, ye shall perish
 in sorrow.
 
 "Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek
 the Lord: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of
 the pit whence ye are digged. Look unto Abraham your father, and
 unto Sarah that bare you: for I called him when he was alone, and
 childless, and increased him. For the Lord has comforted Zion: and
 has heaped on her blessings and consolations.
 
 "Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, for a law shall
 proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of
 the Gentiles."
 
 Amos viii. The prophet having enumerated the sins of Israel, said
 that God had sworn to take vengeance on them.
 
 He saith also: "And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the
 Lord, that the sun shall go down at mid-day, and I will make the
 earth dark in the day of light: And I will turn your feasts into
 mourning, and all your songs into lamentation.
 
 "You shall have sorrow and suffering, and I will make the sorrow as
 the mourning of an only son, and the latter end thereof as a bitter
 day. Behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will send forth a
 famine into the land: not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water,
 but of hearing the words of the Lord. And they shall move from sea to
 sea, and from the North to the East: they shall go about seeking the
 word of the Lord, and shall not find it.
 
 "In that day their fair virgins, and their young men shall faint
 for thirst. They that have followed the idols of Samaria, and sworn
 by the god of Dan; who have followed the worship of Beersheba; they
 shall fall, and shall rise no more."

 reign, says, "All these things shall be done when the dispersion of
 my people shall be accomplished."
 
 Haggai ii. 3. "You who compare this second house with the glory of
 the first and despise it. Yet now take courage, O Zerubbabel, saith
 the Lord, and take courage O Jesus the high priest, and take courage,
 all ye people of the land, and cease not to work. The word that I
 covenanted with you when you came out of the land of Egypt stands
 yet: and my spirit shall be in the midst of you: Lose not hope. For
 thus saith the Lord of hosts: Yet one little while, and I will move
 the heaven and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land,"--a mode of
 speech to denote a great and extraordinary change. "And I will move
 all nations: and the desired of all nations shall come: and I will
 fill this house with glory: saith the Lord.
 
 "The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord,"--that is
 to say, it is not by that that I will be honoured, as it is said in
 another place. All the beasts of the field are mine, what good is
 it to me that they are offered me in sacrifice?--"Greater shall be
 the glory of this latter house than of the first, saith the Lord of
 hosts: and in this place I will establish my house, saith the Lord."
 
 "According to all that you desired of the Lord God in Horeb in the
 day of the assembly, saying, Let us not hear again the voice of the
 Lord, neither let us see this fire any more, that we die not. And
 the Lord said unto me, Their prayer is just. I will raise them up a
 prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and I will put my
 words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall
 command him. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not
 hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require
 it of him."
 
 Genesis xlix. "Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise, and

 _OF TYPES IN GENERAL AND OF THEIR LAWFULNESS._
 
 
 _Proof of the two Testaments at once._--To prove both the Testaments
 at one stroke we need only see if the prophecies in one are
 accomplished in the other.
 
 To examine the prophecies we must understand them.
 
 For if we believe they have only one sense it is certain that Messiah
 has not come; but if they have two senses, it is certain that he has
 come in Jesus Christ.
 
 The whole question then is to know if they have two senses....
 
 That the Scripture has two senses, which Jesus Christ and his
 Apostles have given, the following are the proofs:
 
 1. Proof by Scripture itself.
 
 2. Proofs by the Rabbis. Moses Maimonides says that it has two faces,
 and that the prophets have prophesied Jesus Christ only.
 
 3. Proofs by the Cabala.
 
 4. Proofs by the mystical interpretation which the rabbis themselves
 have given to the Scripture.
 
 5. Proofs by the principles laid down by the rabbis that there are
 two senses, that there are two advents of the Messiah; one in glory,
 and one in humiliation, according to their deserts; that the prophets
 have prophesied of Messiah only. The Law is not eternal, but must
 change when Messiah comes; that then they shall no more remember the
 Red Sea; that the Jews and the Gentiles shall be mingled.
 
 
 It is as those among whom there is a certain secret language.
 
 Those who do not understand it can see in it only a foolish sense.
 
 
 _Typical._--The figures of a sword, a shield.
 
 _Potentissime._
 
 
 To change the type, because of our weakness.
 
 
 _Types._--The prophets prophesied by figures of a girdle, a beard and
 burnt hair, etc.
 
 
 Two errors: 1, to take all literally; 2, to take all spiritually.
 
 
 The veil which is upon these books for the Jews is there also for bad
 Christians, and for all who do not hate themselves.
 
 But those who truly hate themselves are in a disposition to
 understand the Scriptures and to know Jesus Christ.
 
 
 _Types_.--To show that the Old Testament is only figurative, and
 that by temporal possessions the prophets understood others, this
 is the proof: 1, that this were unworthy of God; 2, that their
 discourses express very clearly the promise of temporal possessions,
 and that they say nevertheless that their discourses are obscure,
 and that their sense will not be understood. Whence it appears that
 this secret sense is not that which they openly expressed, and that
 consequently they meant to speak of other sacrifices, of another
 deliverer, etc. They say that they will be understood only in the
 fulness of time. Jer. xxxiii.
 
 The third proof is that their discourses are contradictory and
 destroy each other, so that if we think they did not mean by the
 words law and sacrifice aught else than those of Moses, there is a
 gross and obvious contradiction. Therefore they meant something else,
 occasionally contradicting themselves in the same chapter.
 
 Now to understand the sense of an author....
 
 
 _A type brings with it absence and presence, pleasure and pain._
 
 A cipher with a double sense, one clear, and in which it is said that
 the sense is hidden....
 
 
 A portrait brings with it absence and presence, pleasure and pain.
 The reality excludes absence and pain.
 
 _Types._--To know if the law and the sacrifices are real or
 figurative, we must see if the prophets in speaking of these things
 limited their view and their thoughts to them, so that they saw only
 the old covenant; or if they saw in them somewhat else of which they
 were the semblance, for in a portrait we see the thing figured. For
 this we need only examine what they say.
 
 When they speak of it as eternal, do they mean that same covenant
 which they elsewhere say will be changed; so of the sacrifices, etc.?
 
 A cipher has two senses. If we intercept an important letter in which
 we see an obvious meaning, wherein it is nevertheless declared that
 the sense is veiled and obscure, that it is concealed, so that the
 letter might be read without discovering it, and understood without
 understanding, we can but think that here is a cipher with a double
 sense, and all the more if we find manifest contradictions in the
 literal sense. How greatly we ought to value those who interpret
 the cipher, and explain to us the hidden sense, especially if the
 principles they extract are wholly natural and clear. This is what
 Jesus Christ did, and the Apostles. They broke the seal, he rent
 the veil, and revealed the spirit. They have thereby taught us that
 man's enemies are his passions; that the Redeemer is to be spiritual
 and his reign spiritual; that there are to be two advents, one in
 lowliness to abase the proud, the other in glory to exalt the humble;
 that Jesus Christ is God and man.
 
 The prophets said clearly that Israel would be always the beloved of
 God, that the law would be eternal, they have said also that their
 meaning would not be understood, and that it was veiled.
 
 
 _Types._--When the word of God, which cannot lie, is false literally,
 it is true spiritually. _Sede a dextris meis_, is false literally,
 therefore it is true spiritually.
 
 In these expressions God is spoken of after the manner of men, and
 this means only that the intention which men have in giving a seat
 at their right hand, God will also have. It is then a mark of the
 intention of God, not of his mode of carrying it out.
 
 Thus when it is said "God has received the odour of your incense
 and will in return give you a fat land," this means that the same
 intention which a man will have, who, pleased with your perfumes,
 will give you a fat land, God will have towards you, because you have
 had towards him the same intention as a man has for him to whom he
 offers a sweet savour. So _iratus est_, a jealous God, etc., for the
 things of God being inexpressible, they cannot be said otherwise. And
 the Church uses them still: _Quia confortavit seras_, etc.
 
 
 Difference between dinner and supper.
 
 In God the word differs not from the intention, for he is true, nor
 the word from the effect, for he is powerful, nor the means from the
 effect, for he is wise. Bern. _ult. sermo in Missam_.
 
 Aug., _de Civit._ v. 10. This rule is general. God can do all, except
 those things which if he could do he would not be almighty, as dying,
 being deceived, lying, etc.
 
 Many evangelists for the confirmation of the truth. Their differences
 are useful.
 
 The Eucharist after the Lord's Supper. Truth after the type.
 
 The ruin of Jerusalem, a type of the ruin of the world, forty years
 after the death of Jesus.
 
 "I know not" as a man or as an ambassador. Matt. xxiv. 36.
 
 Jesus condemned by the Jews and the Gentiles.
 
 The Jews and the Gentiles figured by the two sons.
 
 Aug. _de Civit._ xx. 29.
 
 
 The figures of the Gospel for the state of the sick soul are sick
 bodies, but because one body cannot be sufficiently sick to express
 it well, several are needed. Thus there are the deaf, the dumb, the
 blind, the paralytic, the dead Lazarus, the possessed; all this
 together is in the sick soul.
 
 Isaiah, li. The Red Sea an image of the Redemption.
 
 "_Ut sciatis quod filius hominis habet potestatem remittendi peccata,
 tibi dico: Surge._"
 
 God, willing to show that he was able to form a people holy with an
 invisible holiness, and to fill them with an eternal glory, made
 visible things. As nature is an image of grace, he has done in the
 excellences of nature what he would accomplish in those of grace, in
 order that men might judge that he could make the invisible since he
 made the visible so well.
 
 Thus he saved this people from the deluge, he has raised them up from
 Abraham, redeemed them from their enemies, and caused them to enter
 into rest.
 
 The object of God was not to save them from the deluge, and raise up
 a whole people to Abraham, only in order to bring them into a fat
 land.
 
 And so grace itself is but the figure of glory, for it is not the
 ultimate end. It was symbolised by the law, and itself symbolises
 grace, but it is the figure of it, and the origin or cause.
 
 The ordinary life of man is like that of the saints. They all seek
 their satisfaction, and differ only in the object wherein they place
 it; they call those their enemies who hinder them, etc. God then has
 shown the power which he has to give invisible possessions, by the
 power which he has shown over things visible.
 
 
 And yet this covenant, made to blind some and enlighten others,
 marked in those very men whom it blinded the truth which should be
 recognised by others. For the visible possessions which they received
 from God were so great and so divine that it certainly appeared he
 was able to give them those which are invisible, as well as a Messiah.
 
 For nature is an image of grace, and visible miracles are the image
 of the invisible. _Ut sciatis, tibi dico: Surge._
 
 Isaiah, li., says that Redemption will be as the passage of the Red
 Sea.
 
 God then has shown by the deliverance from Egypt, and from the sea,
 by the defeat of the kings, by the manna, by the whole genealogy of
 Abraham, that he was able to save, to send down bread from heaven,
 etc., so that the people at enmity with him is the type and the
 representation of the very Messiah whom they know not, etc.
 
 He has then shown us at last that all these things were only types,
 and what is true freedom, a true Israelite, true circumcision, true
 bread from heaven, etc.
 
 In these promises each man finds what he chiefly desires, temporal
 possessions or spiritual, God or the creatures; but with this
 difference, that those who therein seek the creatures find them, but
 attended by many contradictions, with a prohibition against loving
 them, with the injunction to worship God only, and to love him only,
 which is the same thing, and finally that the Messiah came not for
 them; whilst on the contrary those who therein seek God find him,
 without any contradiction, with the injunction to love him only,
 and that the Messiah came in the time foretold, to give them the
 possessions which they ask.
 
 Thus the Jews had miracles and prophecies, of which they saw the
 accomplishment, and the teaching of their law was that they should
 love and worship God alone; it was also perpetual. Thus it had
 all the marks of the true religion, as indeed it was, but we must
 distinguish between the teaching of the Jews, and the teaching of
 the Jewish law. Now the teaching of the Jews was not true, although
 it had miracles and prophecy and perpetuity, because it had not this
 further point, the worship and love of God only.
 
 
 _The reason of types._
 
 They had to deal with a carnal people, and to render them the
 depositary of a spiritual covenant.
 
 To give faith in the Messiah it was necessary there should have been
 antecedent prophecies, in the charge of persons above suspicion,
 diligent, faithful, singularly zealous, and known to all the world.
 
 That all this might be accomplished, God chose this carnal people,
 to whom he entrusted the prophecies which foretell the Messiah as a
 deliverer, and as a dispenser of those carnal possessions which the
 people loved. And thus they have had an extraordinary zeal for their
 prophets, and, in sight of the whole world, have had charge of these
 books which foretell their Messiah, assuring all the nations that he
 should come, and in the manner foretold in their books, which they
 held open to all the world. But this people deceived by the poor and
 ignominious advent of the Messiah have been his most cruel enemies.
 So that they, who were of all nations in the world the least open to
 the suspicion of favouring us, the most scrupulous and most zealous
 that can be named for their law and their prophets, have kept the
 records incorrupt.
 
 
 Therefore the prophecies have a hidden and spiritual sense, which
 this people hated, under the carnal sense which they loved. Had the
 spiritual sense been disclosed, it being such as they were unable to
 love, or even to bear, they would not have been zealous to preserve
 their books and their ceremonies; and if they had loved these
 spiritual promises, and had preserved them incorrupt till Messiah
 came, their witness would have had no force, because they had been
 his friends. Therefore it was well that the spiritual sense should
 be concealed; but on the other hand, had the sense been so hidden as
 not to be at all apparent, it could not have served as a proof of the
 Messiah. What then was done? In a crowd of passages the spiritual was
 concealed under the temporal sense, and has been clearly revealed in
 a few; again, the time and the state of the world were so clearly
 foretold that the sun is not so evident. And in some passages this
 spiritual sense is so dearly expressed that no less a blindness than
 that which the flesh imposes on the spirit when enslaved, can keep us
 from discerning it.
 
 See then what God has done. This sense is concealed under another
 in an infinite number of passages, in some, though rarely, it is
 revealed, yet so that the passages in which it is concealed are
 equivocal, and can suit both senses, while those in which it is
 disclosed are unequivocal, and can agree with the spiritual sense
 alone.
 
 So that this cannot lead us into error, and could only be
 misunderstood by so carnal a people.
 
 For when possessions are promised in abundance, what could
 hinder them from understanding the true possessions, save their
 covetousness, which limited the sense to the good things of this
 world? But those whose only good was in God referred the sense to
 him alone. For there are two qualities which divide the will of man,
 covetousness and charity. Not that covetousness cannot coexist with
 faith in God, nor charity with worldly possessions, but covetousness
 uses God, and enjoys the world, while the opposite is the case with
 charity.
 
 Now the end we pursue gives names to things. All which hinders the
 attainment of this end, is said to be at enmity with us. Thus the
 creatures, however good, are the enemies of the just, when they turn
 them aside from God, and God himself is the enemy of those whose
 greed he opposes.
 
 Hence the word enemy being interpreted according to the end
 proposed, the just understood by it their passions, and the carnal
 understood the Babylonians, so that the term is obscure only for the
 unrighteous. And this is what Isaiah says: _Signa legem in electis
 meis_, and that Jesus Christ shall be a stone of stumbling. But,
 "Blessed are they who shall not be offended in him!" Hosea, xiv. 9,
 says excellently: "Where is the wise, and he shall understand these
 things. The just shall know them, for the ways of God are right, but
 the transgressors shall fall therein."
 
 So that those who rejected and crucified Jesus Christ, being offended
 at him, are the same people who bear the books which witness of him,
 and which say that he will be rejected and a stumbling stone, so that
 their refusal has given an additional mark that it is he, and he has
 been proved both by the just Jews who received him, and the unjust
 Jews who rejected him, both of whom were foretold.
 
 
 One of the main reasons why the prophets put a veil on the spiritual
 possessions which they promised under the figure of temporal
 possessions is, that they had to do with a carnal people whom they
 must make the keepers of the spiritual covenant.
 
 
 Jesus Christ, prefigured by Joseph, the beloved of his father, sent
 by his father to visit his brethren, etc., innocent, sold by his
 brethren for twenty pieces of silver, and thereby becoming their
 lord, their saviour, the saviour of strangers, and the saviour of
 the world; all which had not been brought about but for the plot for
 his destruction, their sale and rejection of him.
 
 In prison Joseph innocent between two criminals; Jesus Christ on
 the cross between two thieves. Joseph foretold deliverance to the
 one, and death to the other, from the same omens. Jesus Christ saves
 the elect, and condemns the reprobate after the same crimes. Joseph
 foretold only, Jesus Christ acts. Joseph asked of him who is saved to
 be mindful of him when he has come into his glory, and he whom Jesus
 Christ saved asked that he would remember him when he came into his
 Kingdom.
 
 
 _Types._--Saviour, father, sacrificer, sacrifice, food, king, wise,
 lawgiver, afflicted, poor, having to create a people, which he must
 lead and nourish, and bring into the land.
 
 
 Fascination.--_Somnum suum. Figura hujus mundi._
 
 The Eucharist.--_Comedes panem tuum. Panem nostrum._
 
 _Inimici Dei terram lingent._ The sinners lick the dust, that is to
 say, love earthly pleasures.
 
 The Old Testament contained the types of future joy, and the New
 contains the means of attaining it.
 
 The types were of joy, the means of penitence, and nevertheless the
 Paschal Lamb was eaten with bitter herbs, _cum amaritudinibus_.
 
 _Singularis sum ego donec transeam._ Jesus Christ before his death
 was almost the only martyr.
 
 
 To speak against too greatly figurative expressions.
 
 
 There are some types clear and demonstrative, but others which seem
 far-fetched, and which bring proof only to those already persuaded.
 These may seem like the sayings of the Apocalyptics. But the
 difference is that these have none which are not doubtful, so that
 nothing is so unjust as to pretend that theirs are as well founded as
 some of ours, for they have none so demonstrative as some of ours.
 There is no comparison possible. We have no right to compare and
 confound things because they agree in one point, while they are so
 different in another. What is clear in things divine forces us to
 revere what is obscure.
 
 
 I do not say that the _mem_ is a mystery.
 
 
 We may not attribute to the Scripture the sense which it has not
 revealed to us that it contains. Thus, to say that the closed _mem_
 of Isaiah means six hundred, has not been revealed. It might be said
 that the final _tsadé_ and the _he deficientes_ signify mysteries.
 But we are not allowed to say so, and still less to say this is the
 way of the philosopher's stone. But we say that the literal sense is
 not the true sense, because the prophets said so themselves.
 
 
 _Extravagances of the Apocalyptics, Preadamites, Millenarians,
 etc._--Whoever would found extravagant opinions on the Scripture will
 for instance found them on the fact that:
 
 It is said that "This generation shall not pass away till all these
 things be fulfilled." On that I will say that after that generation
 will come another generation, and so in constant succession.
 
 The Second Book of Chronicles speaks of Solomon and the King as if
 they were two different persons. I say that they were two.
 
 
 _Against those who misuse passages of Scripture, and who are puffed
 up when they find one which seems to favour their error._
 
 The chapter for Vespers, on Passion Sunday, the prayer for the King.
 
 Explanation of these words: "He that is not with me is against me."
 And these others: "He that is not against you is with you." A person
 who says: I am neither for nor against; we ought to answer him....
 One of the Antiphons for Vespers at Christmas: _Exortum est in
 tenebris lumen rectis corde_.
 
 
 
 
 _THAT THE JEWISH LAW WAS FIGURATIVE._
 
 
 _Contradiction._--It is not possible to give a good expression to
 a portrait save by bringing all contraries into harmony, and it is
 not enough to dwell upon a series of accordant qualities, without
 reconciling the contraries. To understand the meaning of an author we
 must harmonise all the contrary passages.
 
 Thus, to understand Scripture, we must find a sense in which all
 the contrary passages are reconciled; it is not enough to have one
 which agrees with many consonant passages, but we must find one which
 reconciles even dissonant passages.
 
 Every author has a sense in which all the contradictory passages
 agree, or he has no meaning at all. The latter cannot be said of
 Scripture and the prophets, which assuredly abound in good sense. We
 must then seek for a meaning which harmonises all contraries.
 
 The true sense then is not that of the Jews, but in Jesus Christ all
 dissonances are brought into harmony.
 
 The Jews could not make the cessation of the royalty and principality
 foretold by Hosea accord with the prophecy of Jacob.
 
 If we take the law, the sacrifices, the kingdom as realities, we
 cannot reconcile all the passages. Of necessity then they are but
 figures. We cannot even reconcile the passages of the same author,
 nor of the same book, nor sometimes of the same chapter, which
 abundantly denotes what was the meaning of the author. As when
 Ezekiel, chap. xx., says that man will live by the commandments of
 God and will not live by them.
 
 
 It was not lawful to sacrifice elsewhere than at Jerusalem, the
 place which the Lord had chosen, nor even to eat the tithes in any
 other place. Deut. xii. 5, etc.; Deut. xiv. 23, etc.; xv. 20; xvi.
 2-15.
 
 Hosea foretold that the Jews should be without king, without prince,
 without sacrifice and without idols, which is accomplished at this
 day, since they are not able to make a lawful sacrifice out of
 Jerusalem.
 
 _Types._--If the law and the sacrifices are the truth it must be
 pleasing to God, and not displeasing to him. If they are figures they
 must be both pleasing and displeasing.
 
 Now through the whole of Scripture they are both pleasing and
 displeasing. It is said that the law shall be changed, that the
 sacrifice shall be changed, that they shall be without law, without
 a prince and without sacrifices, that a new covenant shall be made,
 that the law shall be renewed, that the precepts which they have
 received are not good, that their sacrifices are abominations, that
 God has required none of them.
 
 It is said, on the contrary, that the law shall abide for ever, that
 the covenant shall be eternal, that sacrifice shall be eternal, that
 the sceptre shall never depart from among them, because it shall not
 depart from them till the coming of the eternal King.
 
 Now are all these passages obviously literal? No. Are they obviously
 typical? No, they are obviously either real or typical. But the first
 set, which bar a literal interpretation, prove that the whole are
 typical.
 
 All these passages together cannot apply to the thing signified, all
 can apply to the type, therefore they are not spoken of the thing
 signified, but of the type.
 
 _Agnus occisus est ab origine mundi._ A sacrificing judge.
 
 
 _Types._--God willing to form to himself an holy people, whom he
 should separate from all other nations, whom he should deliver from
 their enemies, and should establish in a place of rest, has not
 only promised this, but has foretold by his prophets the time and
 the manner of his coming. And yet, to confirm the hope of his elect
 through all ages, he made them to see it in a figure, but never left
 them without assurances of his power and of his will to save them.
 For at the creation of man, Adam was the witness, and the guardian
 of the promise made concerning the Saviour who should be born of the
 woman, when men were still so near the creation that they could not
 have forgotten their creation and their fall. When those who had seen
 Adam were no longer in the world, God sent Noah, whom he saved, and
 drowned the whole earth by a miracle which marked sufficiently both
 the power which he had to save the world, and the will which he had
 to do so; and to raise up of the seed of the woman him whom he had
 promised.
 
 This miracle was enough to confirm the hope of men. The memory of the
 deluge being fresh among men while Noah was still living, God made
 promises to Abraham, and while Shem was still living God sent Moses,
 etc....
 
 
 _Types._--God, willing to deprive his own of perishable possessions,
 made the Jewish people in order to show that this arose from no lack
 of power.
 
 
 The Jews had grown old in these earthly thoughts, that God loved
 their father Abraham, his flesh, and all that would spring from it;
 that for this reason he had multiplied them, and set them apart
 from all other peoples, without allowing them to intermingle; that
 when they were languishing in Egypt he brought them out with many
 wonderful signs in their favour; that he fed them with manna in the
 wilderness, and brought them out into a very fat land; that he gave
 them kings and a well-built temple, there to offer beasts before
 him, by the shedding of whose blood they were purified; that at last
 he would send Messiah to make them masters of the whole world, and
 foretold the time of his coming.
 
 The world having grown old in these carnal errors, Jesus Christ came
 at the time foretold, but not with the expected glory, and therefore
 men did not think it was he. After his death Saint Paul came to teach
 that all these things had happened in figures, that the Kingdom of
 God was not in the flesh, but in the spirit; that the enemies of
 men were not the Babylonians, but the passions; that God delighted
 not in temples made with hands, but in a pure and contrite heart;
 that bodily circumcision was unprofitable, but that of the heart was
 needed; that Moses gave them not that bread from heaven, etc.
 
 But God, not willing to disclose these things to a people unworthy
 of them, yet nevertheless willing to foretell them, in order that
 they might be believed, foretold the time dearly, and expressed the
 things sometimes clearly, but generally in figures, so that those who
 loved the emblems might rest in them, and those who loved the things
 figured might see them therein.
 
 All that tends not to charity is figurative.
 
 The sole aim of the Scripture is charity.
 
 All which tends not to that only end is figurative, for since there
 is but one end, all which does not refer to it in express terms is
 figurative.
 
 God has so varied that sole precept of charity to satisfy our
 curiosity, which seeks for diversity, by that diversity which still
 leads us to the one thing needful. For one only thing is needful, yet
 we love diversity, and God satisfies both by these diversities, which
 lead to the one thing needful.
 
 The Jews so loved the mere shadows, and waited for them so entirely,
 that they misunderstood the substance, when it came in the time and
 manner foretold.
 
 The rabbis take the breasts of the Spouse for figures, as they do
 every thing which does not express the only aim they had, that of
 temporal good.
 
 And Christians take even the Eucharist as a type of the glory for
 which they strive.
 
 
 Charity is no figurative precept. It is horrible to say that Jesus
 Christ, who came to take away the figure and establish the truth,
 came only to establish the type of charity and take away the existing
 reality.
 
 If the light be darkness, what must the darkness be?
 
 
 When David foretold that Messiah would deliver his people from their
 enemies, we may believe that these according to the flesh were the
 Egyptians, and then I know not how to show that the prophecy was
 fulfilled. But we may well believe also that the enemies were their
 sins, for in truth the Egyptians were not their enemies, and their
 sins were. This word enemies is therefore equivocal.
 
 But if he say, as in fact he does elsewhere, that he will save his
 people from their sins, as do also Isaiah and others, the ambiguity
 is removed, and the double sense of enemies is reduced to the single
 sense of iniquities. For if he had sins in his mind he might well
 denote them by the word enemies, but if he thought of enemies, he
 could not designate them by the word iniquities.
 
 Now Moses, David, and Isaiah employ the same terms. Who will say then
 that they have not all the same meaning, and that the sense of David
 which is plainly that of iniquities when he spoke of enemies, is not
 the same as that of Moses when speaking of enemies.
 
 Daniel prays that the people may be delivered from the captivity of
 their enemies, but he was thinking of sins, and to show this, he
 says that Gabriel came to tell him that his prayer was heard, and
 that there were only seventy weeks to wait, after which the nation
 would be delivered from iniquity, that sin would have an end, and the
 Redeemer, the Most Holy, should bring in eternal righteousness, not
 legal, but eternal.
 
 
 The Jews had a doctrine of God as we have one of Jesus Christ, and
 confirmed by miracles; they were forbidden to believe every worker of
 miracles, and more, they were ordered to have recourse to the chief
 priests, on whom only they should rely.
 
 Thus, in regard to their prophets, they had all those reasons which
 we have for refusing to believe the workers of miracles.
 
 And yet they were very blameworthy in refusing the prophets because
 of their miracles, and had not been blameworthy had they not seen the
 miracles. _Nisi fecissem, peccatum non haberent._
 
 Therefore all belief rests on miracles.
 
 
 Whoever estimates the Jewish religion by its coarser minds will
 know it but ill. It is to be seen in the sacred books, and in the
 tradition of the prophets, who have made it plain enough that they
 did not understand the law according to the letter. So our Religion
 is divine in the Gospel, in the Apostles, and in tradition, but
 ridiculous in those who corrupt it.
 
 The Messiah, according to the carnal Jews, was to be a mighty
 temporal prince. Jesus Christ, according to carnal Christians, has
 come to dispense us from the love of God, and to give us sacraments
 which shall operate without our concurrence. This is no more the
 Christian religion than was the other the Jewish.
 
 True Jews and true Christians have always expected a Messiah who
 should inspire them with the love of God, and by that love should
 make them triumph over all their enemies.
 
 
 The carnal Jews hold a midway place between Christians and Pagans.
 The Pagans know not God, and love this world only. The Jews know the
 true God, and love this world only. Christians know the true God,
 and love not the world. Jews and Pagans love the same good. Jews and
 Christians know the same God.
 
 The Jews were of two kinds, one having merely Pagan, the other having
 Christian affections.
 
 
 The carnal Jews understood neither the greatness nor the humiliation
 of Messiah as foretold by their prophecies. They misunderstood him in
 his foretold greatness, as when he said that Messiah should be lord
 of David, through his son, and that he was before Abraham who yet had
 seen him. They did not believe him so great as to be eternal, and
 so too they misunderstood him in his humiliation and in his death.
 Messiah, said they, abideth for ever, and this man has said that he
 shall die. They believed him then neither mortal nor eternal, and
 they only looked in him for a carnal greatness.
 
 
 _Typical._--God availed himself of the lust of the Jews to make them
 avail for Jesus Christ.
 
 
 _Typical._--Nothing is so like charity as covetousness, and nothing
 is so contrary to it. Thus the Jews, full of possessions which
 flattered their covetousness, were very like Christians and very
 contrary. And by this means they had the two qualities which were
 necessary to them, to be very like the Messiah in order to be figures
 of him, and very contrary that they might not be suspected witnesses.
 
 
 _Antiquity of the Jews._--What difference there is between book and
 book. I am not surprised that the Greeks made the Iliad, nor the
 Egyptians and the Chinese their histories.
 
 We have only to see how this comes about. These fabulous historians
 are not contemporaneous with the facts they narrate. Homer writes a
 romance, which he puts forth as such, and which is received as such,
 for no one supposed that Troy or Agamemnon existed more than did the
 golden apple. So he thought not of making a history, but solely a
 book to amuse; he is the only man who wrote in his time, the beauty
 of his work has made it last, every one learns it and talks of it, we
 are bound to know it, and we each get it by heart. Four hundred years
 afterwards the witnesses of these things are no more, no one knows of
 his own knowledge if it be fable or history; he has only learnt it
 from his ancestors, and this may pass for true.
 
 
 _The sincerity of the Jews._--They preserve with faithfulness and
 zeal the book in which Moses declares that they have been all their
 life ungrateful to God, and that he knows they will be still more so
 after his death; that he therefore calls heaven and earth to witness
 against them, and that he has taught them enough.
 
 He declares that finally God, being angry with them, would scatter
 them among all the nations of the earth, that as they have angered
 him, in worshipping gods who were not their God, so he will provoke
 them by calling a people which is not his people, and wills that
 all his words shall be eternally preserved, and that his book shall
 be placed in the Ark of the Covenant to serve for ever as a witness
 against them.
 
 Isaiah says the same thing, xxx. 8.
 
 
 However, they have kept at the cost of their life this very book
 which dishonours them in so many ways. This is a sincerity which has
 no example in the world, and no root in nature.
 
 
 Every history which is not contemporaneous is open to suspicion, thus
 the books of the Sibyls and Trismegistus and so many others which
 have been credited by the world are false, and found to be false in
 course of time. It is not so with contemporaneous authors.
 
 There is a great difference between a book written by a private man,
 and dispersed among a whole people, and a book which itself creates a
 people. We cannot doubt that the book is as old as the people.
 
 
 The sincerity of the Jews.
 
 Defective and final letters.
 
 Sincere against their honour, and dying in its defence; this has no
 example in the world's history, and no root in nature.
 
 
 They are visibly a people expressly formed to serve as witnesses to
 the Messiah, Isaiah xliii. 9; xliv. 8, they bear the books, and love
 them while they understand them not. And all this was foretold, that
 God's judgments might be entrusted to them, but as a sealed book.
 
 
 _Types._--When once the secret is disclosed it is impossible not to
 see it If the Old Testament be read in this light, we shall see if
 the sacrifices were real; if the fatherhood of Abraham was the true
 cause of the friendship of God; that the promised land was not the
 true place of rest. These were then but types. If in the same way we
 examine all those ordained ceremonies, and all those commandments
 which are not of charity, we shall see that they are types.
 
 All these sacrifices and ceremonies were then either figures or
 absurdities. But there are things which are clear, and yet too lofty
 for us to think them absurdities.
 
 
 Adam _forma futuri_. Six days to form the one, six ages to form the
 other. The six days which Moses represents for the formation of
 Adam, are but the representation of the six ages to form Jesus Christ
 and the Church. If Adam had not sinned, and Jesus Christ had not
 come, there had been only one covenant, only one age of men, and the
 creation would have been represented as done at one single time.
 
 
 The six ages, the six Fathers of the six ages, the six miracles at
 the opening of the six ages, the six mornings at the opening of the
 six ages.
 
 
 _Types._--The Jewish and Egyptian peoples were visibly foretold by
 the two men whom Moses met, the Egyptian beating the Jew, Moses
 avenging him and slaying the Egyptian while the Jew was ungrateful.
 
 
 The conversion of the Egyptians, Isaiah xix. 19. An altar in Egypt to
 the true God.
 
 
 The sabbath was only a sign, Exodus xxxi. 13, and in memory of
 the deliverance from Egypt. Deut. v. 19. Therefore it is no more
 necessary, for we ought to forget Egypt.
 
 Circumcision was only a sign, Gen. xvii. 13, therefore it came to
 pass that in the desert they were not circumcised, because they could
 not be confounded with other peoples, and after Jesus Christ came it
 was no longer needful.
 
 
 Those who ordained these sacrifices knew their uselessness, and those
 who have declared their uselessness, ceased not to practise them.
 
 
 Your name shall be accursed to my elect, and I will give them another
 name.
 
 Harden their heart. How? By flattering their lust, and making them
 hope to accomplish it.
 
 
 _Fac secundum exemplar quod tibi ostensum est in monte._
 
 The Jewish religion then was formed on its likeness to the truth
 of the Messiah, and the truth of the Messiah was recognised by the
 religion of the Jews which was the figure of it.
 
 Among the Jews the truth was only prefigured. In heaven it is
 revealed.
 
 In the Church it is hidden, yet recognised by its correspondence with
 the type.
 
 The type was made according to the truth, and the truth is recognised
 according to the type.
 
 Saint Paul says himself that people would forbid to marry, and he
 himself speaks to the Corinthians, in a way which is a trap. For if
 a prophet had said the one, and Saint Paul had afterwards said the
 other, he would have been accused.
 
 
 _Typical._--Make all things like unto the pattern which was showed
 thee in the mount. On which Saint Paul says that the Jews shadowed
 forth heavenly things.
 
 
 _Typical._ The key of the cipher. _Veri adoratores. Ecce agnus Dei
 qui tollit peccata mundi._
 
 
 _That the law was typical. Types._--The letter kills. All happened in
 a figure. This is the cipher which Saint Paul gives us. Christ must
 suffer. An humiliated God. Circumcision of the heart, a true fast, a
 true sacrifice, a true temple. The prophets indicated that all these
 must be spiritual.
 
 Not the meat which perishes, but that which perishes not.
 
 You shall be free indeed. Then the former liberty was only a type of
 liberty.
 
 I am the true bread from heaven.
 
 
 _Particular types._-- A double law, double tables of the law, a
 double temple, a double captivity.
 
 
 The Synagogue did not perish because it was a type, but because it
 was no more than a type it fell into servitude. The type subsisted
 till the reality came, in order that the Church should be always
 visible, either in the representation which promised it, or in the
 substance.
 
 
 In the time of the Messiah the people were divided. Those that were
 spiritual embraced the Messiah, the carnal remained to serve as
 witnesses of him.
 
 
 
 
 _OF THE TRUE RELIGION AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS._
 
 
 _For Port Royal. The Beginning, after having explained the
 incomprehensibility._--Since the greatness and the vileness of man
 are so evident, it is necessary that the true religion should declare
 both that there is in man some great principle of greatness, and a
 great principle of vileness.
 
 It must therefore explain these astonishing contradictions.
 
 In order to make man happy, it must show him that there is a God;
 that we ought to love him; that our true happiness is to be in him,
 our sole evil to be separated from him; it must recognise that we
 are full of darkness which hinders us from knowing and loving him;
 and that thus, as our duties oblige us to love God, and our lusts
 turn us from him, we are full of injustice. It must explain to us
 our opposition to God and to our own good; it must teach us the
 remedies for these infirmities, and the means of obtaining them. We
 must therefore examine all the religions of the world from this point
 of view, and see if there be any other than the Christian which is
 sufficient for this end.
 
 Shall it be that of the philosophers, who proposed as the only good
 the good which is in ourselves? Is this the true good? Have they
 found a remedy for our evils? Is the pride of man cured by equalling
 him with God? Have those who would level us to the brutes, or the
 Mahomedans who present us with pleasures of the world as the sole
 good, even in eternity, found any remedy for our lusts? What religion
 then will teach us to cure our pride and our lust? What religion will
 teach us our good, our duty, the infirmity which turns us from it,
 the cause of this infirmity, the remedies which can cure it, and the
 means of obtaining those remedies? All other religions have failed,
 let us see what the wisdom of God can do.
 
 "Look neither for truth," she says, "nor consolation from men. I am
 she who framed you, and who alone can teach you what you are. But
 you are not now in the state in which I framed you. I created man
 holy, innocent, perfect; I filled him with light and intelligence;
 I communicated to him my glory and my wondrous acts. The eye of man
 beheld then the majesty of God; he was not then in the darkness which
 blinds him, nor subject to death and the miseries which afflict him.
 But he could not bear so great a glory without falling into pride.
 He would make himself his own centre, and independent of my aid. He
 withdrew himself from my rule; and when he made himself equal to me
 by the desire of finding his happiness in himself, I gave him over to
 self. Then setting in revolt the creatures that were subject to him,
 I made them his enemies; so that man is now become like the beasts,
 and removed from me until there scarce remains to him a confused ray
 of his Creator, so far has all his knowledge become extinguished or
 disturbed. His senses, never the servants, and often the masters of
 reason, have carried him astray in pursuit of pleasure. All creatures
 either torment or tempt him; and have dominion over him, either as
 they subdue him by their strength, or as they melt him by their
 charms, a tyranny more terrible and more imperious.
 
 "Such is the present state of man. There remains to him some feeble
 instinct of the happiness of his primitive nature, and he is plunged
 in the misery of his blindness and his lusts, which have become his
 second nature.
 
 "From this principle which I have here laid open to you, you may
 discern the cause of those contradictions which, while they astonish
 all men, have divided them among such various opinions. Now mark all
 the movements of greatness and glory which the trials of so many
 miseries are unable to stifle, and see if the cause of them must not
 be in another nature...."
 
 _For Port Royal to-morrow. Prosopopæa._--"It is in vain, O men, that
 you seek from yourselves the remedy for your miseries. All your
 light can only enable you to know that not in yourselves will you
 find truth or good. The Philosophers promised you these, but gave
 them not. They neither apprehend what is your true good nor what
 is....
 
 "How could they then apply remedies to your diseases, since they did
 not even know them? Your chief maladies are pride, which alienates
 you from God, and lust, which binds you down to earth; and they do
 nought else but nourish one or the other of these disorders. If they
 presented God as your end it was only done to gratify your pride; by
 making you think that you are by nature like him and conformed to
 him. Those who saw the extravagance of such an assertion did but set
 you on an opposite precipice, by tempting you to believe that your
 nature was of a piece with that of the beasts, and by inclining you
 to seek your good in the lusts which are shared by brutes. This is
 not the way to cure you of your unrighteousness, which these sages
 never knew. I alone can teach you who you are....
 
 "If you are united to God it is by grace, not by nature.
 
 "If you are abased it is by penitence, not by nature. So this twofold
 capacity....
 
 "You are not in the state wherein you were created.
 
 "These two states being presented to you, you cannot but recognise
 them.
 
 "Follow your own movements, observe yourselves, and see if you do not
 trace the lively characters of these two natures.
 
 "Could so many contradictions be found in a subject that was simple?"
 
 
 I do not mean that you should submit your belief to me without
 reason, neither do I aim at your subjection by tyranny. I do not
 aim at giving you a reason for everything. And to reconcile these
 contradictions, I wish to make you see by convincing proofs, those
 divine tokens in me, which will assure you who I am and will verify
 my authority by wonders and proofs which you cannot reject; so that
 you may then have a reasonable belief in what I teach you, when you
 find no other ground for refusing it, but that you cannot know of
 yourselves whether it is true or not.
 
 
 The true nature of man, his true good, true virtue and true religion
 are things of which the knowledge is inseparable.
 
 
 _After having understood the whole nature of man._--That a religion
 may be true, it must show knowledge of our nature. It must know its
 greatness and meanness, and the cause of both. What religion but the
 Christian has shown this knowledge?
 
 
 The true religion teaches our duties; our weaknesses, pride and lust;
 and the remedies, humility and mortification.
 
 The true religion must teach greatness and misery; must lead to the
 esteem and despising of self; to love and to hate.
 
 
 The note of true religion must be that it obliges man to love his
 God. This is very right, and yet no other religion than ours has thus
 commanded; ours has done so. It must also be cognizant of man's lust
 and weakness, ours is so. It must have applied remedies for these
 defects; one is prayer. No other religion has asked of God the power
 to love and obey him.
 
 
 If there be one only origin of all things, there must be one only
 end of all things; all by him, all for him. The true religion then
 must teach us to adore him only, and to love him only. But since we
 find ourselves unable to adore what we know not, or to love aught but
 ourselves, the same religion which instructs us in these duties must
 instruct us also of this inability, and teach us also the remedies
 for it. It teaches us that by one man all was lost, and the bond
 broken between God and us, and that by one man the bond has been
 repaired.
 
 We are born so contrary to this love of God, and it is so necessary
 that we must be born sinful, or God would be unjust.
 
 
 Every religion is false which as to its faith does not adore one God
 as origin of all things, and as to its morals does not love one sole
 God as the object of all things.
 
 
 In every religion we must be sincere, true heathens, true Jews, true
 Christians.
 
 
 
 
 _THE EXCELLENCE OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION._
 
 
 When I see the blindness and the misery of man, when I survey the
 whole dumb Universe, and man without light, left to himself, and
 lost, as it were, in this corner of the Universe, not knowing who
 has placed him here, what he has come to do, what will become of
 him when he dies, and incapable of any knowledge whatever, I fall
 into terror like that of a man who, having been carried in his sleep
 to an island desert and terrible, should awake ignorant of his
 whereabouts and with no means of escape; and thereupon I wonder how
 those in so miserable a state do not fall into despair. I see other
 persons around me, of like nature, I ask them if they are better
 informed than I am, and they say they are not; and thereupon these
 miserable wanderers, having looked around them, and seen some objects
 pleasing to them, have given and attached themselves to these. As
 for me, I cannot attach myself to them, and considering how strongly
 appearances show that there is something else than what is visible
 to me, I have sought to discover whether this God have not left some
 impress of himself.
 
 I see many contrary religions, and consequently all false but one.
 Each wishes to be believed on its own authority, and menaces the
 unbeliever, but I do not therefore believe them. Every one can say
 the same, and every one can call himself a prophet. But I see the
 Christian religion fulfilling prophecy, and that is what every one
 can not do.
 
 
 Without this divine knowledge what could men do but either uplift
 themselves by that inward conviction of their past greatness
 still remaining to them, or be cast down in view of their present
 infirmity? For, not seeing the whole truth, they could not attain
 to perfect virtue. Some considering nature as incorrupt, others as
 incurable, they could not escape either pride or idleness, the two
 sources of all vice; since they cannot but either abandon themselves
 to it by cowardice, or escape it by pride. For if they were aware
 of the excellency of man, they were ignorant of his corruption, so
 that they very easily avoided idleness, but only to fall into pride.
 And if they recognized the infirmity of nature, they knew not its
 dignity, so that though they might easily avoid presumption, it was
 only to plunge into despair.
 
 Thence come the various sects of the Stoics and Epicureans, the
 Dogmatists, Academicians, etc. The Christian religion alone has
 been able to cure these two distempers, not so as to drive out the
 one by the other according to the wisdom of the world, but so as to
 expel them both by the simplicity of the Gospel. For it teaches the
 righteous that it lifts them even to a participation of the divine
 nature; that in this exalted state they still bear within them the
 fountain of all corruption, which renders them during their whole
 life subject to error and misery, to death and sin; and at the same
 time it proclaims to the most wicked that they can receive the grace
 of their Redeemer. Thus making those tremble whom it justifies, and
 consoling those whom it condemns, religion so justly tempers fear
 with hope by means of that double capacity of grace and of sin which
 is common to all, that it abases infinitely more than reason alone,
 yet without despair; and exalts infinitely higher than natural pride,
 yet without puffing up: hereby proving that alone being exempt
 from error and vice, it alone has the office of instructing and of
 reforming men.
 
 Who then can withhold credence and adoration to so divine a light?
 For it is clearer than day that we feel within ourselves indelible
 characters of goodness; and it is equally true that we experience
 every hour the effects of our deplorable condition. This chaos then,
 this monstrous confusion, does but proclaim the truth of these two
 states, with a voice so powerful that it cannot be resisted.
 
 
 The Philosophers never prescribed feelings proper to these two
 states.
 
 They inspired motions of simple greatness, and that is not the state
 of man.
 
 They inspired motions of simple vileness, and that is not the state
 of man.
 
 There must be motions of abasement, yet not from nature, but from
 penitence, not to rest in them, but to go onward to greatness. There
 must be motions of greatness, not from merit, but from grace, and
 after having passed through abasement.
 
 
 This double nature of man is so evident, that there are those who
 have imagined us to have two souls.
 
 One single subject seemed to them incapable of so great and sudden
 variations from unmeasured pride to an horrible dejection of spirit.
 
 
 All these contradictions which seemed to have taken me further from
 the knowledge of religion, are what most rapidly led me into truth.
 
 
 Did we not know ourselves full of pride, ambition, lust, weakness,
 misery and injustice, we were indeed blind. And if knowing this we
 did not desire deliverance, what could be said of a man.... What then
 can we feel but esteem for that Religion which is so well acquainted
 with the defects of man, and desire for the truth of a religion which
 promises remedies so precious.
 
 
 The corruption of reason is shown by the number of differing and
 extravagant customs; it was necessary that truth should come in order
 that man should no longer live in himself.
 
 
 _Incomprehensible._--Not all that is incomprehensible is therefore
 non existent. Infinite number. An infinite space equal to a finite.
 
 _It is incredible that God should unite himself to us._--This
 consideration is drawn only from the view of our vileness. But if it
 be sincere, follow it as far as I have done, and recognise that we
 are in fact so vile as to make us by ourselves incapable of knowing
 whether his mercy may not render us capable of him. For I would
 know how this animal, who is aware of his weakness, has the right
 to measure the mercy of God and set to it bounds suggested by his
 fancy. He knows so little what God is that he does not even know
 what himself is, and troubled with the view of his own state, boldly
 declares that God cannot render man capable of communion with him.
 
 But I would ask if God demands aught else from him than to know him
 and to love him, and why, since man is by nature capable of love and
 knowledge, he believes that God cannot make himself known and loved
 by him. He certainly knows at least that he is, and that he loves
 something. Therefore if he see anything in his darkness, and if
 among the things of earth he find any subject of his love, why, if
 God impart to him some ray of his essence, should he not be capable
 of knowing and of loving him in the manner in which it shall please
 him to communicate himself to us? There must be then an intolerable
 arrogance in these sort of arguments, though they seem founded on
 apparent humility, which is neither sincere nor reasonable, unless it
 makes us confess that not knowing of ourselves what we are, we can
 learn it from God alone.
 
 
 For myself, I declare that so soon as the Christian religion reveals
 the principle that human nature is corrupt and fallen from God, my
 eyes are opened to see everywhere the characters of this truth: for
 nature is such that she everywhere indicates, both within man and
 without him, a God whom he has lost and a corrupt nature.
 
 
 Whatever may be said, it must be conceded that the Christian religion
 has something astonishing in it. Perhaps someone will say: "This
 is because you were born in it." It may be: then I stiffen myself
 against it by this very reason, for fear this prejudice should bias
 me; but although I am born in it I cannot but find it so.
 
 
 The whole course of things must have for its object the establishment
 and the grandeur of Religion: that there should be implanted in men
 sentiments conformable to its precepts, and in a word, that it
 should be so completely the aim and the centre to which all things
 tend, that whoever understands its principles can give an explanation
 as of human nature in particular, so in general of the whole order of
 the world.
 
 
 Our religion is wise and foolish. Wise, because it is the most
 learned, and the most founded on miracles, prophecies, etc. Foolish,
 because it is not all this which causes us to belong to it; this
 makes us indeed condemn those who are not of it, but is not the cause
 of belief in those who are. It is the cross that makes them believe,
 _ne evacuata sit crux_. And thus Saint Paul, who came with wisdom
 and signs, says that he came neither with wisdom nor with signs, for
 he came to convert. But those who come only to convince may say that
 they come with wisdom and with signs.
 
 
 That religion, great as she is in miracles, with holy and blameless
 Fathers, learned and great witnesses, with martyrs and kings, as
 David, and Isaiah, a prince of the blood; great as she is in science,
 after having displayed all her miracles and all her wisdom, rejects
 it all, and says she has neither wisdom nor signs, but only the cross
 and foolishness.
 
 For those, who by these signs and that wisdom have deserved your
 belief, and who have proved to you their character, declare to you
 that nothing of all this can change you, and render you capable of
 knowing and loving God, but the power of the foolishness of the cross
 without wisdom and signs, and not the signs without this power. Thus
 our Religion is foolish when we consider the effective cause, wise
 when we consider the wisdom which has prepared it.
 
 
 How strange is Christianity! It enjoins man to acknowledge himself
 vile, even abominable, and enjoins him to aspire to be like God.
 Without such a counterpoise, this elevation would make him horribly
 vain, or that vileness would make him terribly abject
 
 
 Misery counsels despair, pride counsels presumption.
 
 
 The incarnation shows man the greatness of his misery by the
 greatness of the remedy of which he stood in need.
 
 
 Not a vileness such as renders us incapable of good, nor a holiness
 exempt from evil.
 
 
 No doctrine is more suited to man than this; for it teaches him his
 double capacity of receiving and losing grace, because of the double
 peril to which he is always exposed, of despair and of pride.
 
 
 No other religion has enjoined hate of self. No other religion
 then can be pleasing to those who hate themselves, and who seek a
 Being wholly to be loved. And these, if they had never heard of the
 religion of an humiliated God, would embrace it at once.
 
 
 No other has recognised that man is of all creatures the most
 excellent. Some, having apprehended the reality of his excellence,
 have blamed as mean and ungrateful the low opinion which men
 naturally have of themselves, and others, well aware how real is this
 vileness, have treated with haughty ridicule those sentiments of
 greatness which are no less natural to man.
 
 "Lift your eyes to God," say these, "see him in whose image you are,
 who has made you to worship him. You can make yourselves like unto
 him; wisdom will equal you to him if you will follow it." But others
 say: "Bend your eyes to the earth, poor worm that you are, and look
 upon the brutes your comrades." What then will man become? Will he
 equal God or the brutes? What an awful gulf! What then shall we be?
 Who does not see from all this that man has gone astray, that he has
 fallen from his place, that he seeks it with disquiet, that he cannot
 regain it? And who shall direct him, since the greatest men have not
 availed?
 
 
 What men could scarcely know by their greatest light, this Religion
 has taught to babes.
 
 
 Other religions, as those of heathendom, are more popular since they
 consist only in externals, but they have no effect on the educated. A
 purely intellectual religion would be more adapted to the educated,
 but it would be of no use to the people. The Christian religion alone
 is fitted for all, being composed of externals and internals. It
 elevates the people to interior acts, it abases the proud to external
 rites, and it is not complete without both, for the people must
 understand the spirit which is in the letter, and the educated must
 submit their spirit to the letter.
 
 
 Philosophers have consecrated vices in attributing them to God
 himself, Christians have consecrated virtues.
 
 
 
 
 _OF ORIGINAL SIN._
 
 
 There are two truths of faith equally sure: the one, that man in the
 state of creation, or in that of grace, is raised above all nature,
 is made like unto God and is a sharer in divinity; the other, that
 in the state of corruption and sin, he has fallen from the higher
 state and is made like unto the beasts. These two propositions are
 equally firm and certain. The Scripture declares it plainly, as when
 it says in certain places: _Deliciæ meæ, esse cum filiis hominum.
 Effundam spiritum meum super omnem carnem. Dii estis, etc._; and when
 it says in others: _Omnis caro fænum. Homo comparatus est jumentis
 insipientibus, et similis factus est illis. Dixi in corde meo de
 filiis hominum, ut probaret eos Deus et ostenderet similes esse
 bestiis, etc._
 
 
 The wicked, who abandon themselves blindly to their passions, without
 the knowledge of God, and without taking the trouble to seek him,
 themselves confirm this foundation of the faith which they attack,
 that the nature of man is corrupt. And the Jews, who so obstinately
 assail the Christian religion, again confirm that other foundation of
 the same faith which they assail, namely, that Jesus Christ is the
 true Messiah, who has come to redeem men, and deliver them from the
 corruption and misery in which they were, as much by the condition
 in which we see them at this day, and which was foretold by the
 prophets, as by these same prophecies which they possess and keep so
 inviolably as the tokens whereby the Messiah is to be recognised.
 
 
 I would ask them if it is not true that they themselves confirm this
 foundation of the faith they assail, which is that the nature of man
 is corrupt.
 
 
 Marton sees indeed that nature is corrupt, and that men are opposed
 to honourable conduct, but he knows not why they cannot fly higher.
 
 
 The meaning of the words _good_ and _evil_.
 
 
 Original sin is foolishness to men, but it is admitted to be so. This
 doctrine must not then be reproached with want of reason, since I
 admit that it has no reason. But this foolishness is wiser than all
 the wisdom of men, _sapientius est hominibus_. For without this how
 can we say what man is? His whole state depends on this imperceptible
 point, and how should it be perceived by his reason, since it is a
 thing against reason, and since reason, far from finding it out by
 her own ways, revolts from it when it is offered her?
 
 
 There is nothing on earth which does not show either human misery or
 divine mercy; either the weakness of man without God, or the power of
 man with God.
 
 
 Thus the whole universe teaches man, either that he is corrupt,
 or that he is redeemed; every thing teaches him his greatness or
 his misery; the abandonment by God is shown in the heathen, the
 protection of God is shown in the Jews.
 
 
 Nature has her perfections to show that she is the image of God, and
 her defects to show that she is no more than his image.
 
 Men being unaccustomed to form merit, but only to recompense it when
 they find it formed, judge of God by themselves.
 
 
 When we wish to think of God, there is a something which turns us
 aside, and tempts us to think on other subjects; all this is evil and
 born with us.
 
 
 Lust has become natural to us, and has made our second nature. Thus
 there are two natures in us, one good, the other evil.--Where is
 God? Where you are not, and the kingdom of God is within you.--_The
 Rabbis._
 
 
 It is then true that everything instructs man concerning his
 condition, but the statement must be clearly understood, for it is
 not true that all reveals God, and it is not true that all hides
 him. But it is true both that he hides himself from those who tempt
 him, and that he reveals himself to those who seek him, because men
 are both unworthy and capable of God; unworthy by their corruption,
 capable by their original nature.
 
 
 We cannot conceive the glorious state of Adam, nor the nature of his
 sin, nor the transmission of it to us. These things took place under
 the conditions of a nature quite different to our own, transcending
 our present capacity.
 
 The knowledge of all this would be of no use in helping us to escape
 from it, and all we need know is that we are miserable, corrupt,
 separate from God, but ransomed by Jesus Christ, and of this we have
 on earth wonderful proofs.
 
 Thus the two proofs of corruption and redemption are drawn from the
 wicked, who live indifferent to religion, and from the Jews who are
 its irreconcilable enemies.
 
 
 All faith consists in Jesus Christ and in Adam, and all morality in
 lust and in grace.
 
 
 Shall he only who knows his nature know it only to his misery? Shall
 he alone who knows it be alone miserable?
 
 He must not see nothing whatever, nor must he see so much as to
 believe he possesses it, but he must see enough to know that he has
 lost it; for to be aware of loss he must see and not see, and that is
 precisely the state in which he is by nature.
 
 
 We wish for truth, and find in ourselves only uncertainty.
 
 We seek after happiness, and find only misery and death.
 
 We cannot but wish for truth and happiness, and we are incapable
 neither of certainty nor of happiness. This desire is left to us, as
 much to punish us as to make us feel whence we are drawn.
 
 
 Will it be asserted that because men have spoken of righteousness
 as having fled from the earth, therefore they knew of original
 sin?--_Nemo ante obitum beatus est._--That therefore they knew death
 to be the beginning of eternal and essential happiness?
 
 
 The dignity of man while innocent consisted in using and having
 dominion over the creatures, but now in separating himself from them,
 and subjecting himself to them.
 
 
 _Source of contradictions._--A God humbled, even to the death of the
 cross, a Messiah by his death triumphing over death. Two natures in
 Jesus Christ, two advents, two states of human nature.
 
 
 _Of original sin.--Ample tradition of original sin according to the
 Jews._
 
 On the word in Genesis, viii. 21. The imagination of man's heart is
 evil from his youth.
 
 R. Moses Haddarschan: This evil leaven is placed in man from the time
 that he is formed.
 
 _Massechet Succa_: This evil leaven has seven names in Scripture.
 It is called evil, an unclean prepuce, an enemy, a scandal, a heart
 of stone, the north wind; all this signifies the malignity which is
 concealed and ingrained in the heart of man.
 
 _Midrasch Tillim_ says the same thing, and that God will free the
 good nature of man from the evil.
 
 This malignity is renewed every day against man, as it is written,
 Psalm xxxvii. The wicked watcheth the just, and striveth to kill him,
 but God will not abandon him.
 
 This malignity tries the heart of man in this life, and will accuse
 him in the other.
 
 All this is found in the _Talmud_.
 
 _Midrasch Tillim_ on Ps. iv.: "Stand in awe and sin not." Stand in
 awe and be afraid of your lust, and it will not lead you into sin.
 And on Ps. xxxvi. "The wicked has said in his heart: Let not the fear
 of God be before me." That is to say that the malignity natural to
 man has said that to the wicked.
 
 _Misdrasch el Kohelet_: "Better is a poor and a wise child than an
 old and foolish king who cannot foresee the future." The child is
 virtue, and the king is the malignity of man. It is called king
 because all the members obey it, and old because it is in the heart
 of man from infancy to old age, and foolish because it leads man in
 the way of perdition which he does not foresee.
 
 The same thing is in _Misdrasch Tillim_.
 
 _Bereschist Rabba_ on Ps. xxxv.: "Lord, all my bones shall bless
 thee, who deliverest the poor from the tyrant." And is there a
 greater tyrant than the evil leaven? And on Proverbs xxv., "If thine
 enemy be hungry, feed him." That is to say, if the evil leaven
 hunger, give him the bread of wisdom of which speaks Prov. ix., and
 if he be thirsty, give him the water of which speaks Isaiah lv.
 
 _Misdrasch Tillim_ says the same thing, and that the Scripture in
 that passage speaking of our enemy, means the evil leaven, and that
 in giving it that bread and that water, we heap coals of fire on his
 head.
 
 _Misdrasch Kohelet_ on Ecclesiastes ix. "A great king besieged a
 little city." This great king is the evil leaven, the great engines
 with which he surrounds it are temptations, and there has been found
 a poor wise man who has delivered it, that is to say virtue.
 
 And on Ps. xli. "Blessed is he that considereth the poor."
 
 And on Ps. lxxviii. The spirit goeth and returneth not again, whereof
 some have taken occasion of error concerning the immortality of the
 soul; but the sense is that this spirit is the evil leaven, which
 accompanies man till death, and will not return at the resurrection.
 
 And on Ps. ciii. the same thing.
 
 And on Ps. xvi.

 _THE PERPETUITY OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION._
 
 
 _Perpetuity._--That religion has always existed on earth, which
 consists in believing that man has fallen from a state of glory
 and of communion with God into a state of sorrow, penitence, and
 estrangement from God, but that after this life we shall be restored
 by a Messiah who was to come. All things have passed away, and this
 has subsisted for which are all things.
 
 Men in the first age of the world were carried away into every
 kind of misconduct, and yet there were holy men, as Enoch, Lamech
 and others, who awaited with patience the Christ promised from the
 beginning of the world. Noah saw the evil of men at its height; and
 he was found worthy to save the world in his person, by the hope of
 the Messiah of whom he was the type. Abraham was compassed round
 about by idolaters, when God revealed to him the mystery of the
 Messiah, whom he greeted from afar. In the days of Isaac and Jacob
 abomination was spread over the whole earth, but these holy men
 lived in faith, and Jacob dying and blessing his children, cried in
 a transport which made him break off his discourse, "I await, O my
 God, the Saviour whom thou hast promised. _Salutare tuum expectabo,
 Domine_." The Egyptians were infected both with idolatry and magic,
 even the people of God were led astray by their example. Yet Moses
 and others saw him whom they saw not, and adored him, looking to
 the eternal gifts which he was preparing for them. The Greeks and
 Latins then enthroned false deities, the poets made a hundred divers
 theologies, the philosophers separated into a thousand different
 sects, and yet in the heart of Judæa were always chosen men who
 foretold the advent of this Messiah, known to them alone. He came
 at length in the fulness of time, and since then, notwithstanding
 the birth of so many schisms and heresies, so many revolutions in
 government, such great changes in all things, this Church, adoring
 him who has ever been adored, has subsisted without a break. It is a
 wonderful, incomparable and wholly divine fact, that this Religion
 which has ever endured, has ever been assailed. A thousand times has
 it been on the eve of an universal ruin, and whenever it has been in
 that state God has restored it by extraordinary manifestations of
 his power. This is marvellous, so also that it has survived without
 yielding to the will of tyrants. For it is not strange that a State
 subsists when its laws sometimes give way to necessity, but that....
 
 
 States would perish if they did not often make their laws bend to
 necessity, but Religion has never suffered this or practised it. And
 indeed there must be either compromise or miracles. There is nothing
 unusual in being saved by yielding, and strictly speaking this is
 not endurance, besides in the end they perish utterly: there is none
 which has endured a thousand years. But that this Religion, although
 inflexible, should always have been maintained, shows that it is
 divine.
 
 
 The religion which alone is contrary to our nature, to common sense,
 and to our pleasures, is that alone which has always existed.
 
 
 The science which alone is contrary to common sense and human nature,
 is that alone which has always subsisted among men.
 
 
 _To show that the true Jews and the true Christians have one and
 the same Religion._--The religion of the Jews seemed to consist
 essentially in the fatherhood of Abraham, in circumcision, sacrifices
 and ceremonies, in the ark, in the temple at Jerusalem, and lastly,
 in the Law, and the Covenant with Moses.
 
 I say that it consisted in none of these, but solely in the love of
 God, and that all else was rejected by him;
 
 That God did not accept the posterity of Abraham;
 
 That the Jews if they transgressed were to be punished like
 strangers. Deut. viii. 19. "If thou at all forget the Lord thy God,
 and walk after other gods, I testify against you this day that ye
 shall surely perish as the nations which God has destroyed before
 you."
 
 That strangers if they loved God were to be received by him as the
 Jews. Isaiah lvi. 3. "Let not the stranger say, The Lord will not
 receive me.--The strangers that join themselves unto the Lord God
 to serve him and love him, will I bring unto my holy mountain, and
 accept their sacrifices, for mine house is an house of prayer."
 
 That the true Jews ascribed all their merit to God, and not to
 Abraham. Isaiah lxiii. 16. "Doubtless thou art our Father, though
 Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not. Thou art
 our Father and our Redeemer."
 
 Moses himself said that God would not accept the person of any.
 
 Deut. x. 17. "God," said he, "accepteth neither persons nor
 sacrifices."
 
 That the circumcision commanded was that of the heart. Deut. x.
 16; Jeremiah iv. 4. "Be ye circumcised in heart. Cut off the
 superfluities of your heart, harden not your hearts, for your God is
 a great God, strong and terrible, who accepteth not the person of
 any."
 
 That God said he would one day do it. Deut. xxx. 6. "God will
 circumcise thine heart, and thy children's heart, that thou mayest
 love him with all thine heart."
 
 That the uncircumcised in heart should be judged.
 
 Jer. ix. 26. For God will judge the uncircumcised peoples, and all
 the people of Israel, because he is uncircumcised in heart.
 
 That the exterior is nothing in comparison of the interior. Joel. ii.
 13. _Scindite corda vestra_, etc. Isaiah lviii. 3,4, etc.
 
 The love of God is commanded in the whole of Deuteronomy, Deut. xxx.
 19: "I call heaven and earth to witness that I have set before you
 death and life, that you may choose life, and that you may love God,
 and obey him, for God is your life."
 
 That the Jews, for lack of their love, should be rejected for their
 crimes, and the Gentiles chosen in their stead.
 
 Hosea i. 10.
 
 Deut. xxxii. 20. "I will hide myself from them in view of their
 latter sins, for they are a froward generation. They have provoked
 me to anger by things which are no gods, and I will provoke them
 to jealousy by a people which is not my people, by an ignorant and
 foolish nation."
 
 Isaiah lxv. 1. That temporal goods are false, and that the true good
 is to be united to God.
 
 Psalm cxliii. 15. That their feasts were displeasing to God.
 
 Amos v. 21. That the sacrifices of the Jews were displeasing to God.
 
 Isa. lxvi. 1-3; l. 11; Jerem. vi. 20.
 
 David, _Miserere_. Even on the part of the good, _Expectavi_.
 
 Psalm xlix. 8-14. That he has established them only for their
 hardness. Micah, admirably, vi. 6-8.
 
 I. Kings xv. 22; Hosea vi. 6.
 
 That the sacrifices of the Gentiles should be accepted of God, and
 that God would none of the sacrifices of the Jews. Malachi i. 11.
 
 That God would make a new covenant with the Messiah, and that the Old
 should be disannulled. Jer. xxxi. 31.
 
 _Mandata non bona._ Ezek. xx. 25.
 
 That the old things should be forgotten. Isa. xliii. 18, 19; lxv. 17,
 18.
 
 That the ark should come no more to mind. Jer. iii. 15, 16.
 
 That the temple should be rejected. Jer. vii. 12-14.
 
 That the sacrifices should be rejected, and purer sacrifices
 established. Malachi i. 11.
 
 That the order of Aaron's priesthood should be rejected and that of
 Melchizedek introduced by the Messiah. _Dixit Dominus._
 
 That this sacrifice should be eternal. _Ib._
 
 That Jerusalem should be rejected, and Rome admitted.
 
 That the name of the Jews should be rejected and a new name given.
 Isa. lxv. 15.
 
 That this new name should be more excellent than that of the Jews,
 and eternal. Isa. lvii. 5.
 
 That the Jews should be without prophets, Amos, without a king,
 without princes, without sacrifice, without an idol.
 
 That the Jews should nevertheless always remain a people. Jer. xxxi.
 36.
 
 
 _Perpetuity._--Men have always believed in a Messiah. The tradition
 from Adam was still fresh in Noah and in Moses. After these the
 prophets bore witness, at the same time foretelling other things
 which being from time to time fulfilled in the eyes of all,
 demonstrated the truth of their mission, and consequently that of
 their promises touching the Messiah. Jesus Christ worked miracles,
 and the Apostles also, who converted all the Gentiles; and the
 prophecies being thus once accomplished, the Messiah is for ever
 proved.
 
 
 ... On that account I reject all other religions.
 
 In that I find an answer to all objections.
 
 It is just that a God so pure should only disclose himself to those
 whose hearts are purified.
 
 Therefore that religion is lovable to me, and I find it sufficiently
 authorized by so divine a morality, but I find yet more....
 
 I find it a convincing fact that since the memory of man has lasted,
 it was constantly declared to men that they were universally corrupt,
 and that a Redeemer should come;
 
 That it was not one man who said it, but an infinity of men, and
 a whole nation lasting for four thousand years, prophesying, and
 created for that very purpose.... So I stretch out my arms to my
 Redeemer, who having been foretold for four thousand years, has come
 to suffer and to die for me on earth at the time and under all the
 circumstances which had been foretold, and by his grace I await death
 in peace, in the hope of being eternally united to him; yet I live
 with joy, whether in the good which it pleases him to bestow on me,
 or in the ill which he sends for my good, and which he has taught me
 to bear by his example.
 
 
 The Synagogue preceded the Church, the Jews preceded the Christians,
 the prophets foretold the Christians, Saint John foretold Jesus
 Christ.
 
 
 No religion but our own has taught that man is born in sin; no sect
 of philosophers ever said this, therefore none has said the truth.
 
 No sect or religion has always existed on earth, except the Christian
 religion.
 
 
 The Christian religion is that alone which renders man lovable and
 happy at once. Living in the world he cannot be lovable and happy at
 the same time.
 
 
 In all times either men have spoken of the true God, or the true God
 has spoken to men.
 
 There are two foundations, one interior and the other exterior, grace
 and miracles, and both are supernatural.
 
 
 
 
 _PROOFS OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION._
 
 
 _Proofs of Religion._
 
 Morals--Doctrine--Miracles--Prophecies--Figures.
 
 
 _Proof_--1. The Christian religion having established itself so
 strongly, yet so quietly, whilst contrary to nature.--2. The
 sanctity, the dignity, and the humility of a Christian soul.--3. The
 wonders of holy Scripture.--4. Jesus Christ in particular.--5. The
 apostles in particular.--6. Moses and the prophets in particular.--7.
 The Jewish people.--8. The Prophecies.--9. Perpetuity. No religion
 has perpetuity.--10. The Doctrine, which explains all.--11. The
 sanctity of this law.--12. By the course of the world.
 
 It is beyond doubt that after considering what is life and what is
 religion we cannot refuse to act on the inclination to follow it, if
 it comes into our heart, and it is certain there is no ground for
 jeering at those who follow it.
 
 
 _The general conduct of the world towards the Church._--God willing
 both to blind and enlighten.--The event having proved that these
 prophecies were divine, the remainder ought to be believed, and hence
 we see that the order of the world is on this manner.
 
 The miracles of the creation and the deluge being forgotten, God
 sent the law and the miracles of Moses, the prophets who prophesied
 particular things, and to prepare an abiding miracle he prepares
 prophecies and their fulfilment. But as the prophecies might be
 suspected he wishes to make them beyond suspicion, etc.
 
 
 ... But even those who seem most opposed to the glory of religion are
 not in that respect useless for others. We draw from them the first
 argument, that here is something supernatural, for a blindness of
 that kind is not natural, and if their folly renders them so opposed
 to their own good, it will serve to guarantee others against it, by
 the horror of an example so deplorable, and a folly so worthy of
 compassion.
 
 
 ... Men revile what they do not understand. The Christian religion
 consists in two points. It is of equal moment to men to know them
 both, and equally dangerous to ignore either. And it is equally of
 God's mercy that he has given marks of both.
 
 Yet they take occasion to conclude that one of these points does not
 exist from that which is intended to make them certain of the other.
 Those sages who have said there is a God have been persecuted, the
 Jews were hated, and still more the Christians. They saw by the light
 of nature, that if there be a true religion on earth, the course of
 all things must tend to it as to a centre. And on this ground they
 venture to revile the Christian religion because they misunderstand
 it. They imagine that it consists simply in the adoration of a God
 conceived as great, powerful and eternal; which is in fact deism,
 almost as far removed from the Christian religion as atheism, its
 exact opposite. And hence they infer the falsehood of our religion,
 because they do not see that all things concur to the establishment
 of this point, that God does not manifest himself to man with all the
 evidence which is possible.
 
 But let them conclude what they will against deism, they can conclude
 nothing on that account against the Christian religion, which
 properly consists in the mystery of the Redeemer, who, uniting in
 himself the two natures human and divine, has withdrawn men from the
 corruption of sin that he might in his divine person reconcile them
 to God.
 
 True religion then teaches these two truths to men, that there is
 a God whom they are capable of knowing, and that there is such
 corruption in their nature as to render them unworthy of him. It is
 of equal importance to men that they should apprehend the one and the
 other of these points, and it is alike dangerous for man to know God
 without the knowledge of his own worthlessness, and to know his own
 worthlessness without the knowledge of the Redeemer who may deliver
 him from it. To apprehend the one without the other begets either the
 pride of philosophers, who knew God, but not their own wretchedness;
 or the despair of atheists, who know their own wretchedness, but not
 the Redeemer. And as it is alike necessary for man to know these
 two points, so it is alike of the mercy of God to have given us the
 knowledge. The Christian religion does this; it is in this that it
 consists. Let us herein examine the order of the world, and see if
 all things do not tend to establish these two main points of our
 Religion.
 
 
 It is a remarkable fact that no canonical writer has ever employed
 nature to prove God. All tend to make him be believed. David, Solomon
 and others have never said: "There is no vacuum, therefore there is a
 God." They must have been cleverer than the cleverest in after days
 who have all used this argument.
 
 This is well worth considering.
 
 
 If it be a mark of weakness to prove God by nature, despise not the
 Scripture for not doing so: if it be a mark of power to know these
 contradictions, value the Scriptures on that account.
 
 
 What! Do you not say yourself that the sky and the birds prove
 God?--No.--And does not your religion say so?--No. For however it may
 be true in a sense for some souls to whom God has given this light,
 it is nevertheless false in regard to the majority.
 
 
 Think you it is impossible that God is infinite, without
 parts?--Yes.--I will then make you see something which is infinite
 and indivisible. A point moving everywhere with infinite swiftness,
 for it is in all places, and is whole and entire in each situation.
 
 Perhaps this effect of nature, which seems to you impossible
 beforehand, may teach you to know that there may be others also which
 you know not as yet. Do not then draw this conclusion from your
 apprenticeship, that nothing remains for you to know, but rather that
 an infinity remains for you to know.
 
 
 It is incomprehensible that there should be a God, and
 incomprehensible that there should not be; that there should be a
 soul in the body, and that we should have no soul; that the world
 should have been created, and that it should not, etc.; that original
 sin should be, and that it should not be.
 
 
 If we choose to say that man is too little to merit communion with
 God, we must be indeed great to form a judgment on the subject.
 
 
 The Eternal is for ever, if he is at all.
 
 
 But it is impossible that God should ever be the end, if he is not
 the beginning. We look above, but lean upon the sand, and the earth
 will melt, and we shall fall whilst looking towards heaven.
 
 
 _Objection._ The Scripture is plainly full of matters which were not
 dictated by the Holy Spirit.
 
 _Answer._ Then they do no harm to faith.
 
 _Objection._ But the Church has decided that all is of the Holy
 Spirit.
 
 _Answer._ I answer two things: 1. That the Church has never so
 decided; 2. That if she should so decide it might be maintained.
 
 
 My God! what trash is all this talk: "Has God made the world but
 to condemn it? will he ask so much of creatures so weak?" etc.
 Scepticism is the remedy for this evil, and will lower this vanity.
 
 
 God has willed to redeem mankind and to open salvation to those who
 seek him. But men render themselves so unworthy of it, that it is
 just that God should refuse to some because of their hardness of
 heart what he grants to others out of a mercy not their due. Had it
 been his will to overcome the stubbornness of the most hardened, he
 could have rendered them unable to doubt the truth of his essence, in
 revealing himself manifestly to them as he will appear at the last
 day, amid thunderings and lightnings, and so great a convulsion of
 nature, that the dead will rise again, and the blindest shall see
 him.
 
 Not thus willed he to appear in his gentle advent, because since so
 many men make themselves unworthy of his mercy, he willed to leave
 them deprived of the good which they refuse. It had not then been
 just that he should appear in a manner plainly divine, and wholly
 capable of convincing all men, but neither had it been just that he
 should come in so hidden a manner as not to be recognised of those
 who sincerely sought him. He has willed to reveal himself wholly to
 these, and thus willing to appear openly to those who seek him with
 their whole heart, and to hide himself from those who fly him with
 all their heart, he has so tempered the knowledge of himself as to
 give signs of himself visible to those who seek him, and obscure to
 those who seek him not.
 
 There is enough light for those who wish earnestly to see, and enough
 obscurity for those of a contrary mind.
 
 
 Therefore let men recognise the truth of religion in the very
 obscurity of religion, in the little light we have of it, and in our
 indifference to the knowledge of it.
 
 
 The prophecies, the very miracles and proofs of our Religion, are
 not of such a nature that we can say they are absolutely convincing.
 But they are also of such a kind, that none can say that it is
 unreasonable to believe in them. Thus there is both evidence and
 obscurity to enlighten some and blind others; but the evidence
 is such that it surpasses or at least equals the evidence to the
 contrary, so that it is not reason which can determine us not to
 follow it, and therefore it can only be lust and malice of heart. And
 by this means there is evidence enough to condemn, and not enough to
 convince; so it appears in those who follow it, that it is grace and
 not reason which causes them to follow it; and in those who fly it,
 it is lust, not reason, which causes them to fly it.
 
 
 Who can help admiring and embracing a religion which thoroughly knows
 that which we recognise more and more in proportion to our light?
 
 
 _That God has willed to hide himself._--If there were only one
 Religion God would certainly be manifest; so also if there were no
 martyrs but in our own Religion.
 
 God being thus hidden, every religion which does not say that God
 is hidden is not the true religion, and every religion which does
 not show the reason of it is unedifying. Our religion does all this:
 _Vere tu es Deus absconditus_.
 
 
 Religion is so great a thing, that it is right that those who will
 not take the trouble to seek if it be obscure should be deprived of
 it. Why then should any complain, if it be such as to be found by
 seeking?
 
 
 The obscurity would be too great, if truth had not visible signs.
 This is a marvellous one, that it has always been preserved in a
 Church and a visible assembly. The clearness would be too great if
 there were only one opinion in this Church, but to recognise what is
 true is only to see what has always existed, for it is certain that
 truth has always existed, and that nothing false has been always in
 existence.
 
 
 Recognise then the truth of religion even in the obscurity of
 religion, in the little light we have of it, and in the indifference
 we have to its knowledge.
 
 
 God chooses rather to sway the will than the intellect. Perfect
 clearness would be useful to the intellect but would harm the will.
 To humble pride.
 
 
 Were there no obscurity man would not be sensible of his corruption;
 were there no light man would despair of remedy. Thus it is not only
 just, but useful for us, that God should be partly hidden and partly
 revealed, because it is equally dangerous for man to know God without
 the knowledge of his misery, and to know his misery without the
 knowledge of God.
 
 
 If the mercy of God is so great that his teaching is salutary even
 when he hides himself, what great light may we not expect when he
 reveals himself?
 
 
 We shall understand nothing of the works of God if we do not take it
 as a principle that he has willed to blind some and enlighten others.
 
 
 What say the prophets of Jesus Christ? That he will be manifestly
 God? No: but that he is a God truly hidden, that he will be
 misunderstood; that none would think it was he; that he would be a
 stone of stumbling on which many would fall, etc. Let us no longer
 then be reproached with want of clearness, since we make profession
 of it.
 
 But, it is said, there are obscurities.--And without that, no one
 would have stumbled at Jesus Christ, which is one of the formal
 announcements of the prophets: _Excæca_....
 
 
 Instead of complaining that God is hidden, you will give him thanks
 for having revealed so much of himself; and you will give him thanks
 again for not having revealed himself to the proudly wise, who are
 unworthy to know so holy a God.
 
 Two sorts of persons know: those whose heart is humble, and who love
 lowliness, whatever their order of intellect, whether high or low,
 and those who have understanding enough to see the truth, whatever
 opposition they may feel to it.
 
 
 I may well love total darkness, but if God keep me in a state of
 semi-obscurity, this partial darkness is unpleasant to me, and
 because I do not see in it the advantages of total darkness it
 pleases me not. This is a fault, and a proof that I am making an idol
 of darkness apart from God's order. Now his order alone is to be
 worshipped.
 
 
 Did the world exist to instruct man concerning God, his divinity
 would shine out incontestably from every part of it, but as it exists
 only by Jesus Christ, and for Jesus Christ, and to instruct men
 concerning their corruption and their redemption, proofs of these two
 truths start up everywhere.
 
 What is seen does not denote either the total exclusion or the
 manifest presence of divinity, but the presence of a God who hides
 himself. All bears this character.
 
 
 Had nought of God ever appeared, this eternal deprivation would have
 been equivocal, and might as well be interpreted of the total absence
 of divinity, as of man's unworthiness to know him; but by occasional
 and not continual appearances he has taken away all ambiguity. If he
 have appeared once, he is for ever, and thus it must be concluded
 both that there is a God, and that men are unworthy of him.
 
 
 God, that he may reserve to himself alone the right to instruct us
 and that he may render the difficulty of our being unintelligible to
 us, has hidden the knot so high, or rather so low, that we cannot
 reach it. So that it is not by the efforts of our reason, but by the
 simple submission of our reason, that we can truly know ourselves.
 
 
 Wisdom sends us to childhood: _nisi efficiamini sicut parvuli_.
 
 
 "A miracle," says one, "would strengthen my faith." He says so when
 he does not see one. Reasons seen from afar seem to limit our view,
 but as we reach them we begin to see beyond. Nothing stops the
 activity of our spirit. There is no rule, we say, which has not its
 exception, no truth so general but that there is a side on which it
 is lacking. If it be not absolutely universal, we have a pretext for
 applying the exception to the matter in hand, and for saying: _This
 is not always true, hence there are cases in which it is not so. It
 only remains to show that this is one of them._ And we must be very
 awkward or unlucky if we do not find one some day.
 
 
 _Contradictions._
 
 Infinite wisdom and wisdom of Religion.
 
 
 Contradiction is a bad mark of truth.
 
 Much that is certain is contradicted.
 
 Much that is false passes without contradiction.
 
 Contradiction is not a mark of falsehood, nor the want of
 contradiction a mark of truth.
 
 
 There is a pleasure in being in a vessel beaten about by a storm,
 provided we are certain it will not founder. The persecutions which
 try the Church are of this kind.
 
 The history of the Church should rightly be called the history of
 truth.
 
 
 Those who find difficulties of belief seek an excuse in the unbelief
 of the Jews. "If it was so clear," say they, "why did not the Jews
 believe?" And they almost wish the Jews had believed, that they
 might not be deterred by the example of their refusal. But their
 very unbelief is the foundation of our faith. We should be much less
 disposed to believe if they were on our side. We should then have a
 far more ample pretext. This is the wonderful point, to have made the
 Jews great lovers of the things foretold, and great enemies of their
 accomplishment.
 
 
 What could the Jews, his enemies, do? Receiving him they give proof
 of him by that reception, for then the Messiah is acknowledged by
 those to whom was committed the expectation of his coming; rejecting
 him they prove his truth by that rejection.
 
 
 _On the fact that the Christian Religion does not stand alone._--This
 is so far from being a reason against believing it the true one that,
 on the contrary, it proves it to be so.
 
 
 Those who love not the truth take as a pretext that it is contested,
 and that a multitude deny it; and thus their error comes from this
 alone, that they love neither truth nor charity. So they are without
 excuse.
 
 
 The wicked who profess to follow reason, ought to be extremely strong
 in reason.
 
 What then do they say?
 
 Do we not see, say they, beasts live and die like men, and Turks
 like Christians? They have their ceremonies, their prophets, their
 doctors, their saints, their religious, as well as we, etc. _But how
 is this contrary to the Scripture? Does it not say all this?_
 
 If you care but little to know the truth, here is enough for your
 peace. But if you desire to know it with your whole heart, this is
 not enough, look to the details. This would suffice for a question in
 philosophy, but not here, where your all is concerned. And yet, after
 a slight meditation of this kind, we shall go off to amuse ourselves,
 etc. We should acquaint ourselves with this religion; even if it does
 not disclose the reason for such obscurity, it will perhaps teach it
 to us.
 
 
 If God had permitted one only Religion, it would have been too easily
 recognised. But when we look at it near we can easily see the true
 through the confusion.
 
 
 
 
 _PROOFS OF THE DIVINITY OF JESUS CHRIST._
 
 
 _Perpetuity._--Let it be considered that from the beginning of the
 world the expectation or the worship of the Messiah has subsisted
 without a break; that there have been men who said that God had
 revealed to them the future birth of a Redeemer who should save his
 people; that afterwards came Abraham saying he had had a revelation
 that the Messiah was to spring from him by a son who should be born;
 that Jacob declared that of his twelve sons the Messiah would spring
 from Judah; that Moses and the prophets then came to declare the
 time and the manner of his advent; that they said their law was only
 provisional till that of the Messiah, that it should last till then
 but the other should endure eternally; that thus either their law or
 that of the Messiah, of which it was the promise, would be always
 upon earth; that in fact it has always endured; that at last Jesus
 Christ has come with all the circumstances foretold. How wonderful is
 this!
 
 
 The two most ancient books in the world are those of Moses and Job,
 the one a Jew, the other a Gentile, both of whom regard Jesus Christ
 as their common centre and object: Moses in reporting the promises of
 God to Abraham, Jacob, etc., and his prophecies. And Job, _Quis mihi
 det ut, etc. Scio enim quod redemptor meus vivit, etc._
 
 
 I believe that Joshua was the first of God's people who had this
 name, as Jesus Christ was the last of God's people.
 
 
 What man had ever so great renown! The whole Jewish people foretold
 him before his coming. The Gentile world worships him after his
 coming. The two worlds, Gentile and Jewish, regard him as their
 centre.
 
 Yet what man ever had less enjoyment of his renown! Of thirty-three
 years he spent thirty in retirement. For three years he passed as
 an impostor, the priests and rulers rejected him, his friends and
 kinsmen despised him. At the end he died, betrayed by one of his own
 disciples, denied by another, abandoned by all.
 
 What part then had he in all this renown? Never man had more glory,
 never man more ignominy. All this renown was for our sakes, to enable
 us to recognise him, he took none of it for himself.
 
 
 _Office of Jesus Christ._--He alone was to produce a great people,
 elect, holy, and chosen, to lead it, to nourish it, to bring it into
 a place of rest and holiness, to make it holy to God, to make it the
 temple of God, to reconcile it to God, to save it from the wrath of
 God, to deliver it from the slavery of sin, which visibly reigns in
 man, to give laws to this people, to engrave these laws on their
 heart, to offer himself to God for them, to sacrifice himself for
 them, to be a victim without spot, himself the priest, needing to
 offer himself, his body and his blood, and yet to offer bread and
 wine to God....
 
 
 After many persons had come before, at last came Jesus Christ,
 to say: "Here am I and this is the hour, that which the prophets
 had said was to come in the fulness of time. I tell you what my
 apostles will do. The Jews shall be cast out, Jerusalem shall be soon
 destroyed, and the Gentiles shall enter into the knowledge of God. My
 apostles shall do this after you have slain the heir of the vineyard."
 
 Then the Apostles said to the Jews, "You shall be accursed," and to
 the Gentiles, "You shall enter into the knowledge of God;" and that
 came to pass. _Celsus laughed at it._
 
 
 Then Jesus Christ came to tell men that they had no enemies but
 themselves, that their passions cut them off from God, that he
 came to destroy these, and give them his grace to unite them all
 in an holy Church, that he came to call into this Church Gentiles
 and Jews, that he came to destroy the idols of the former and the
 superstition of the latter. To this all men are opposed, not only
 by the natural opposition of lust; but above all, the kings of the
 earth, as had been foretold, gathered together to destroy this
 religion in its infancy. _Quare fremuerunt gentes. Reges terræ
 adversus Christum._
 
 All that was great on earth was united together, the learned, the
 wise, the kings. The first wrote, the second condemned, the last
 slew. Yet notwithstanding all these oppositions, these men, so simple
 and so weak, resisted all these forces, subduing even the mighty, the
 learned and the wise, and removed idolatry from all the earth. And
 all this was done by the power which had foretold it
 
 
 And prediction crowns all this, so that none may say that chance has
 done it all.
 
 Whosoever having only a week to live, does not perceive that belief
 is the right side to take, and that all this is not a stroke of
 chance....
 
 Now were we not slaves to passion, a week and a hundred years would
 seem one and the same thing.
 
 
 The prophets foretold, and were not foretold. The saints were
 foretold, but were not foretellers. Jesus Christ was foretold and
 foreteller.
 
 
 If I had never heard anything of the Messiah, yet after the admirable
 predictions of the course of the world which I see accomplished, I
 see that it is divine. And if I knew that these same books foretold a
 Messiah, I should be certain that he would come. And seeing that they
 place his time before the destruction of the second temple, I should
 say that he had come.
 
 
 _Ingrediens mundum._
 
 Stone upon stone.
 
 That which preceded, that which followed. All the Jews still exist,
 and are wanderers.
 
 
 Why did not Jesus Christ come in a visible manner, instead of drawing
 proof from the prophecies which went before him?
 
 And why did he cause himself to be foretold in figures?
 
 
 God, to enable the Messiah to be recognised by the good and
 unrecognised by the wicked, caused him to be so foretold. If the
 manner of the Messiah had been clearly foretold there had been no
 obscurity, even for the wicked. If the time had been obscurely
 foretold, there had been obscurity even for the good, for their
 goodness of heart would not have made them understand, for instance,
 that the closed _mem_ means six hundred years. But the time has been
 foretold clearly and the manner in figures only.
 
 By this means the wicked, mistaking the promised for material
 blessings, have gone astray, in spite of clear indications of the
 time, and the good have not gone astray; for the interpretation of
 the promised blessings depends on the heart, wont to call that _good_
 which it loves, but the interpretation of the promised time does not
 depend on the heart. Thus the clear prediction of the time, and the
 obscure intimation of the blessings, deceives only the wicked.
 
 
 If Jesus Christ had come only for sanctification, the whole of
 Scripture and all things would tend to this end, and it would be easy
 to convince unbelievers. If Jesus Christ had come only to blind,
 all his conduct would be confused, and we should have no means of
 convincing unbelievers. But as he came _in sanctificationem et in
 scandalum_, as says Isaiah, we cannot convince unbelievers, and they
 cannot convince us; but by that very fact we overcome them because we
 say that there is nothing in his conduct conclusive on one side or
 the other.
 
 
 Jesus Christ has come to blind those who saw clearly, and to give
 sight to the blind; to heal the sick and let the sound perish; to
 call sinners to repentance and justification, and leave the just in
 their sins; to fill the hungry with good things and to send the rich
 empty away.
 
 
 We can have nothing but veneration for a man who clearly foretells
 events which take place, and who declares his design both to blind
 and to enlighten, and who mixes obscurities among the clear things
 which happen.
 
 
 _During the life of the Messiah.--Ænigmatis._--Ezek. xvii.--His
 forerunner. Malachi ii.
 
 He will be born an infant. Is. ix. 6.
 
 He will be born at Bethlehem. Micah v. He will appear chiefly in
 Jerusalem, and will spring from the family of Judah and of David.
 
 He will blind the learned and the wise, Is. vi 8, 29, and preach the
 Gospel to the poor and the lowly, will open the eyes of the blind,
 restore health to the sick, and bring light to those who languish in
 darkness. Is. lxi.
 
 He must show the perfect way, and be the teacher of the Gentiles. Is.
 lv.
 
 The prophecies must be unintelligible to the wicked, Dan. xii., Hos.
 xiv. 10, but intelligible to those who are well instructed.
 
 He must be the precious corner stone. Is. xxviii. 16.
 
 He must be the stone of stumbling and offence. Is. viii.
 
 Jerusalem must dash against this stone.
 
 The builders must reject this stone. Ps. cxvii. 22.
 
 God will make of this stone the head of the corner.
 
 And this stone will grow into a mountain, and fill the whole earth.
 Dan. ii.
 
 Thus he must be rejected, disowned, betrayed, sold, Zach. xi. 12,
 spit upon, buffeted, mocked, afflicted in a thousand ways, be given
 gall to drink, Ps. lxviii., pierced, Zach. xii., his feet and his
 hands pierced, killed, and lots cast upon his vesture.
 
 He must rise again, Ps. xv., the third day. Hos. vi. 3.
 
 He must ascend to heaven to sit on the right hand. Ps. cx.
 
 The kings will arm themselves against him. Ps. ii.
 
 Being on the right hand of the Father, he will have victory over all
 his enemies.
 
 The kings of the earth, and all nations shall worship him. Is. lx.
 
 The Jews will remain as a nation. Jer.
 
 They will be dispersed, without kings, etc., Hos. iii; without
 prophets. Amos;
 
 Waiting for salvation and finding it not. Is.
 
 The calling of the Gentiles by Jesus Christ. Is. lii., Ps. lxxi.
 
 
 The Jews in slaying him that they might not receive the Messiah,
 stamped him with the final proof of his Messiahship.
 
 And by continuance in denial, they made themselves unimpeachable
 witnesses; and in slaying him, and continuing to reject him, they
 have fulfilled the prophecies.
 
 
 The word _Galilee_, which the Jewish rabble pronounced as if by
 chance, in their accusation of Jesus Christ before Pilate, gave
 Pilate a reason for sending Jesus Christ to Herod, so that the
 mystery was accomplished, that he should be judged by Jews and
 Gentiles. Chance was apparently the cause that the mystery was
 accomplished.
 
 
 The conversion of the Gentiles was only reserved for the grace of
 the Messiah. The Jews so long opposed them without success; all that
 Solomon and the prophets had said was useless. Wise men like Plato
 and Socrates could not persuade them.
 
 
 If this was so clearly foretold to the Jews, why did they not believe
 it, or why were they not exterminated for resisting what was so clear?
 
 I answer first: it was foretold both that they would not believe what
 was so clear, and that they would not be exterminated. And nothing is
 more glorious to the Messiah, for it is not enough that there should
 be prophets, they must be kept above suspicion. Now, etc.
 
 
 Had the Jews been all converted by Jesus Christ, we should have none
 but doubtful witnesses, and had they been entirely destroyed we
 should have had no witnesses at all.
 
 
 The Jews rejected him, but not all. The saints receive him, but not
 carnal men. Yet this is far from being against his glory, it is the
 last stroke which perfects it. The argument on their side, the only
 one which is found in the Talmud and the rabbinical writings, is that
 Jesus Christ has not subdued the nations sword in hand, _gladium
 tuum, potentissime_. Is this all they can allege? Jesus Christ has
 been slain, they say, he was subdued, he has not had dominion over
 the heathen by his power, he has not distributed the spoil among us,
 he does not give riches. Is this all they have to allege? This is
 the very point wherein he seems to me so lovable. I would none of
 such an one as they represent. It is plain that his life only hinders
 them from receiving him, by their refusal they become irreproachable
 witnesses, and what is more, they thereby fulfil the prophecies.
 
 
 There are those who see clearly that man has no other enemy than
 lust, which turns him from God, and not God, and that there is no
 other good but God, not a fat land. Let those who believe that the
 good of man is in the flesh, and evil that which turns him away from
 sensual pleasures, besot themselves with them and die in them. But
 those who seek God with their whole heart, whose only ill is not to
 see him, whose only desire is to possess him, whose only enemies are
 those who would turn them from him, who are afflicted when they are
 surrounded and overwhelmed by such enemies, may take comfort, for I
 declare to them this joyful news: there is for them a Redeemer, whom
 I will show them; I will show them that there is for them a God, and
 I will not show him to others. I will show them that a Messiah has
 been promised, who will deliver them from their enemies, and that
 one has come to deliver them from their iniquities, not from their
 enemies.
 
 
 It is a wonderful thing, and worthy of all attention, to see the
 Jewish nation existing so many years in constant misery, it being
 necessary as a proof of Jesus Christ, both that they should exist
 to be his witnesses, and should be miserable because they crucified
 him, and though to be miserable and to exist, are contradictory, this
 nation still exists in spite of its misery.
 
 
 When Nebuchadnezzar carried away the people, for fear they should
 believe that the sceptre had departed from Judah, they were assured
 beforehand that they would be but a short time in captivity, and
 would be restored.
 
 They were never without the comfort of their prophets, or the
 presence of their kings. But the second destruction is without
 promise of restoration, without prophets, without kings, without
 comfort, without hope, for the sceptre is taken away for ever.
 
 
 _Proofs of Jesus Christ._--To have been captive with the assurance of
 deliverance in seventy years was no true captivity. But now they are
 captives without hope.
 
 God has promised them that even though he should disperse them to
 the ends of the earth, nevertheless if they were faithful to the law
 he would gather them together. They are now very faithful to it, yet
 remain oppressed.
 
 
 _Blindness of Scripture._--The Scripture, say the Jews, says that we
 know not whence Christ should come.
 
 John vii. 27 and xii 34.
 
 The Scripture says that Christ abideth for ever, and he said that
 he should die. Therefore, says Saint John, they believed him not,
 though he had done so many miracles, that the word of Isaiah might be
 fulfilled: _He hath blinded them, etc._
 
 
 _Contradictions._--The sceptre until Messiah come. Without king or
 prince.
 
 The eternal law, changed.
 
 The eternal covenant, a new covenant.
 
 The good law, evil precepts, Ezekiel xx.
 
 
 Apparent discord of the Evangelists.
 
 
 _Proofs of Jesus Christ._
 
 Why the book of Ruth was preserved.
 
 Why the story of Tamar.
 
 
 The genealogy of Jesus Christ in the Old Testament is intermixed with
 so many that are useless, that it cannot be distinguished. If Moses
 had kept only the register of the ancestors of Jesus Christ, that had
 been too plain. If he had not marked that of Jesus Christ, it had not
 been plain enough. But after all, whoso looks closely sees that of
 Jesus Christ distinctly traced through Tamar, Ruth, etc.
 
 
 Jesus Christ in an obscurity--as the world calls obscurity--so great,
 that the historians who wrote only the important matters of States
 hardly perceived him.
 
 
 _On the fact that neither Josephus, nor Tacitus, nor other
 historians, have spoken of Jesus Christ._--So far from this being any
 argument against, it is rather one for us. For it is certain that
 Jesus Christ has existed, that his religion has made a great noise,
 and that these people were not ignorant of it; thus it is plain that
 they designedly concealed it, or perhaps that they did speak of it,
 and what they said has been suppressed or altered.
 
 
 When Augustus learnt that Herod's own son was among the children
 under the age of two years whom he had commanded to be slain, he said
 that it was better to be Herod's pig than his son. Macrob. _Saturn_.

 Herod believed to be the Messiah. He had taken away the sceptre of
 Judah, but he was not of Judah. This was held by a considerable sect.
 
 Both Barcoseba and another received by the Jews. And the rumour which
 was everywhere in those times. Suetonius, Tacitus, Josephus.
 
 In what sort should Messiah come, seeing that by him the sceptre
 should be eternally in Judah, and at his coming the sceptre should
 depart from Judah?
 
 To the end that seeing they should not see, and understanding they
 should not understand, nothing could be better done.
 
 Curse of the Greeks against those who count periods of time.
 
 
 _Proofs of Jesus Christ._--Jesus Christ said great things so simply
 that he seems not to have considered them, and yet so tersely that
 it is clear he had considered them. This clearness joined with
 simplicity is wonderful.
 
 
 Who taught the evangelists the qualities of an entirely heroic soul,
 that they should paint it so perfectly in Jesus Christ? Why did they
 describe him weak in his agony? Did they not know how to paint a
 steadfast death? No doubt they did, for the same Saint Luke paints
 the death of Saint Stephen as braver than that of Jesus Christ.
 
 They describe him therefore as capable of fear before the need of
 dying came, and then wholly strong.
 
 But when they represent him as so afflicted, it is when he afflicts
 himself, and when men afflict him, then is he wholly strong.
 
 
 The style of the Gospel is wonderful in many ways, and in this among
 others, that it contains no invectives against the executioners and
 enemies of Jesus Christ. The historians do not rail against Judas,
 Pilate, nor any of the Jews.
 
 If this modesty of the evangelical writers had been simulated, as
 well as many other traits of a beautiful character, and they had
 only simulated it to attract observation, even if they had not dared
 to draw attention to it themselves, they would not have failed to
 procure friends, who would have remarked on it to their advantage.
 But as they acted thus without dissimulation, and from perfectly
 disinterested motives, they pointed it out to no one, and I believe
 that many points of this kind have never been noticed till now, which
 is an evidence of how dispassionately all was done.
 
 
 The apostles were either deceived or deceivers. Both hypotheses are
 difficult; for it is not possible to mistake a man raised from the
 dead....
 
 While Jesus Christ was with them, his presence might sustain them,
 but after that, what gave them force to act if he did not appear to
 them?
 
 
 _Proof of Jesus Christ._--The supposition that the apostles were
 deceivers is thoroughly absurd. Suppose we follow it out, and imagine
 these twelve men assembled after the death of Jesus Christ, making
 a plot to say that he was risen again. By this they attack all
 earthly powers. The heart of man is strangely inclined to fickleness
 and change, swayed by promises and by wealth. Had one of these men
 contradicted themselves under these temptations, nay more, had they
 done so in prison, in torture and in death, they were lost. Let that
 be followed out.
 
 
   Hypothesis that the apostles were deceivers.
   The time clearly.
   The manner obscurely.
   Five typical proofs.
         1,600 prophets.
   2,000
           400 scattered.
 
 
 _Atheists._--What reason have they to say it is not possible to rise
 again? Which is the more difficult, to be born or to rise again; that
 that which has never been should be, or that what has been should be
 again? Is it more difficult to come into being than to return to it?
 Habit causes the one to seem easy to us, the want of habit causes the
 other to seem impossible. The popular way of judging.
 
 Why should not a virgin bear a child? does not a hen lay eggs without
 a cock? What distinguishes these outwardly from others? and who has
 told us that the hen may not form the germ as well as the cock?
 
 
 What have they to say against the resurrection, or against the
 child-bearing of the Virgin? which is the more difficult; to produce
 a man or an animal, or to reproduce it? And if they had never seen
 any species of animal, could they guess that they were not produced
 without connection with each other?
 
 
 How I hate these follies of not believing in the Eucharist, etc....
 If the Gospel be true, if Jesus Christ be God, what difficulty is
 there?
 
 
 It is impiety not to believe in the Eucharist on the ground that we
 do not see it.
 
 
 
 
 _THE MISSION AND GREATNESS OF JESUS CHRIST._
 
 
 We know God only by Jesus Christ. Without this mediator all communion
 with God is taken away, by Jesus Christ we know God. All who have
 thought to know God, and to prove him without Jesus Christ, have
 had but feeble proofs. But for proof of Jesus Christ we have
 the prophecies, which are solid and palpable proofs. And these
 prophecies, accomplished and proved true by the event, mark the
 certainty of these truths, and consequently the divinity of Jesus
 Christ. In him then, and by him we know God; apart from him, and
 without the Scripture, without original sin, without a necessary
 mediator, foretold and come, we could not absolutely prove God, nor
 teach sound doctrine and sound morality. But by Jesus Christ, and
 in Jesus Christ we prove God and teach morality and doctrine. Jesus
 Christ is then the true God of men.
 
 But we know at the same time our misery, for this God is none other
 than he who repairs our misery. Thus we can only know God well by
 knowing our sins. Therefore those who have known God without knowing
 their misery, have not glorified him, but have glorified themselves.
 _Quia non cognovit per sapientiam, placuit Deo per stultitiam
 prædicationis salvos facere._
 
 
 Not only do we know God by Jesus Christ alone, but we know ourselves
 by Jesus Christ alone. We know life and death by Jesus Christ alone.
 Apart from Jesus Christ we know not what is our life, nor our death,
 nor God, nor ourselves.
 
 Thus without the Scripture, which has Jesus Christ alone for its
 object, we know nothing, and see only obscurity and confusion in the
 nature of God, and in our own nature.
 
 
 Without Jesus Christ man must be plunged in vice and misery; with
 Jesus Christ man is free from vice and misery, in him is all our
 virtue and all our happiness. Apart from him is nought but vice and
 misery, error and darkness, death and despair.
 
 
 Without Jesus Christ the world would not exist, for it could only be
 either destroyed, or a very hell.
 
 
 It is not only impossible but useless to know God without Jesus
 Christ. They have not withdrawn from him, but drawn near; they have
 not abased themselves, but....
 
 _Quo quisque optimus est, pessimus, si hoc ipsum, quod sit optimus,
 ascribat sibi._
 
 
 The Gospel only speaks of the virginity of the Virgin up to the time
 of the birth of Jesus Christ. All with reference to Jesus Christ
 
 
 Jesus Christ, whom the two Testaments regard, the Old as its end, the
 New as its model, both as their centre.
 
 
 Scepticism is the truth. For, after all, men before Jesus Christ did
 not know either where they were or if they were great or little. And
 those who said one or the other knew nothing about it, and guessed
 without reason and by chance, yet they always erred in excluding one
 or the other.
 
 _Quod ergo ignorantes quæritis, Religio annuntiat vobis._
 
 
 If Epictetus had seen the way with certainty he would have said to
 men: "You follow a false road"; he shows that there is another, but
 he does not lead there; it is the way of willing what God wills;
 Jesus Christ alone leads thither, _via_, _veritas_.
 
 
 Jesus Christ did nothing but teach men that they were lovers of
 themselves, that they were slaves, blind, sick, miserable, and
 sinners, that he would deliver them, enlighten, bless, and heal them,
 that this would be brought about by hatred of self, and by following
 him through poverty and the death of the cross.
 
 
 An artisan who speaks of riches, a lawyer who speaks of war, or of
 kingship, etc., but the rich man rightly speaks of riches, a king
 speaks slightingly of a great gift he has just made, and God rightly
 speaks of God.

 Man is not worthy of God, but he is not incapable of being rendered
 worthy.
 
 It is unworthy of God to unite himself to miserable man, but it is
 not unworthy of God to raise him from his misery.
 
 
 The infinite distance between body and mind is a figure of the
 infinitely more infinite distance between mind and charity, for this
 is supernatural.
 
 All the splendour of greatness has no lustre for those who seek
 understanding.
 
 The greatness of men of understanding is invisible to kings, to the
 rich, to conquerors, and to all the great according to the flesh.
 
 The greatness of wisdom, which has no existence save in God, is
 invisible to the carnal and to men of understanding. These are three
 orders differing in kind.
 
 Men of great genius have their empire, their glory, their grandeur,
 their victory, their lustre, and do not need worldly greatness, with
 which they have nothing to do. They are seen, not by the eye, but by
 the mind; and that is enough.
 
 The saints have their empire, their glory, their victory, their
 lustre, and want no glory of the flesh or of the mind, with which
 they have nothing to do, for these add nothing to them neither do
 they take away. They are seen of God and the angels, and not by the
 bodily eye, nor by the curious spirit; God suffices them.
 
 Archimedes without worldly pomp would have had the same reverence. He
 fought no battles for the eye to gaze on, but he left his discoveries
 to all minds. O! how brilliant was he to the mind.
 
 Jesus Christ, without riches, and without any exterior manifestation
 of science, is in his own order of holiness. He gave forth no
 scientific inventions to the world, he never reigned; but he was
 humble, patient, holy; holy before God, terrible to devils, without
 spot of sin. O! in what great pomp, and with what transcendent
 magnificence did he come to the eyes of the heart, which discern
 wisdom.
 
 It would have been needless for Archimedes, though of princely birth,
 to have played the prince in his books on geometry.
 
 It would have been needless to our Lord Jesus Christ for the purpose
 of shining in his kingdom of holiness, to come as kings come; but he
 did come in the glory proper to his order.
 
 It is most unreasonable to be offended at the lowliness of Jesus
 Christ, as if this lowliness were in the same order as was the
 greatness which he came to display. Let us consider this greatness
 in his life, in his passion, in his obscurity, in his death, in the
 choice of his disciples, in their desertion of him, in the secrecy of
 his resurrection, and the rest, and it will seem so vast as to give
 no room for offence at a lowliness in another order.
 
 But there are those who can only admire carnal as though there were
 no mental greatness, and others who only admire mental greatness, as
 though there were not infinitely greater heights in wisdom.
 
 All bodies, the firmament, the stars, the earth and the kingdoms
 thereof, are not comparable to the lowest mind, for mind knows all
 these, and itself; the body nothing.
 
 All bodies together and all minds together, and all they can effect,
 are not worth the least motion of charity. This is of an order
 infinitely more exalted.
 
 From all bodies together, we cannot extract one little thought:
 this is impossible and in another order. From all bodies and minds
 it is impossible to produce a single motion of true charity, it is
 impossible, it is in another and a supernatural order.
 
 
 The Jews, in testing if he were God, have shown that he was man.
 
 
 The Church has had as much difficulty in showing that Jesus Christ
 was man, against those who denied it, as in showing that he was God.
 And the evidences were equally great.
 
 
 Jesus Christ is a God to whom we draw near without pride, and before
 whom we abase ourselves without despair.
 
 
 Jesus Christ for all, Moses for a people.
 
 The Jews were blessed in Abraham. "I will bless those that bless
 thee." But all nations are blessed in his seed.
 
 _Parum est ut_, etc. Isaiah.
 
 _Lumen ad revelationem gentium._
 
 _Non fecit taliter omni nationi_, said David in speaking of the Law.
 But in speaking of Jesus Christ it must be said: _Fecit taliter omni
 nationi_.
 
 So it is the property of Jesus Christ to be universal; even the
 Church offers the sacrifice only for the faithful. Jesus Christ
 offered that of the cross for all.
 
 
 The victory over death. What advantageth it a man that he gain the
 whole world and lose his own soul? He that will save his soul shall
 lose it.
 
 I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil. Lambs took not away
 the sins of the world, but I am the lamb who take away sins. Moses
 gave you not that bread from heaven. Moses has not led you out of
 captivity, and made you truly free.
 
 
 _Types._--Jesus Christ opened their mind to understand the Scriptures.
 
 There are two great revelations.
 
 1. All things happened to them in figures: _vere Israelitæ, vere
 liberi_, true bread from heaven.
 
 2. A God humbled to the cross. It was necessary that Christ should
 suffer and enter into glory, that he should conquer death by death.
 Two advents.
 
 
 The types of the completeness of redemption, as that the sun gives
 light to all, denote only completeness, but they figuratively imply
 exclusions, as the Jews elected to the exclusion of the Gentiles
 denote exclusion.
 
 
 Jesus Christ the Redeemer of all.--Yes, for he has offered, like
 a man who has ransomed all who willed to come to him. It is the
 misfortune of those who die on the way, but as far as he is
 concerned, he offers them redemption.--That holds good in the
 example, where he who ransoms and he who hinders from dying are two,
 but not in Jesus Christ, who does both one and the other.--No, for
 Jesus Christ in his quality of Redeemer, is not perhaps master of
 all, and thus so far as in him lies, he is the Redeemer of all.
 
 
 Jesus Christ would not be slain without the forms of justice, for it
 is much more ignominious to die by justice than by an unjust sedition.
 
 
 The elect will be ignorant of their virtues and the reprobate of the
 greatness of their crimes. "Lord, when saw we thee an hungered or
 athirst?" etc.
 
 Jesus Christ would none of the testimony of devils, nor of those who
 were not called, but of God and John the Baptist.
 
 
 Jesus Christ says not that he is not of Nazareth, to leave the wicked
 in their blindness; nor that he is not the son of Joseph.

 The ruin of the Jews and heathen by Jesus Christ.
 
 
 
 
 _THE MYSTERY OF JESUS._
 
 
 Jesus suffered in his passion the torments which men inflicted on
 him, but in his agony he suffered torments which he inflicted on
 himself: _turbare semetipsum_. This is a suffering from no human, but
 an almighty hand, and he who bears it must also be almighty.
 
 Jesus sought some comfort at least in his three dearest friends, and
 they were asleep. He prayed them to watch with him awhile, and they
 left him with utter carelessness, having so little compassion that it
 could not hinder their sleeping even for a moment. And thus Jesus was
 left alone to the wrath of God.
 
 Jesus was without one on the earth not merely to feel and share his
 suffering, but even to know of it; he and heaven were alone in that
 knowledge.
 
 Jesus was in a garden, not of delight as the first Adam, in which he
 destroyed himself and the whole human race; but in one of agony, in
 which he saved himself and the whole human race.
 
 He suffered this sorrow and this desertion in the horror of night.
 
 I believe that Jesus never complained but on this single occasion,
 but then he complained as if he could no longer restrain his extreme
 sorrow. "My soul is sorrowful, even unto death."
 
 Jesus sought companionship and consolation from men. This was the
 only time in his life, as it seems to me; but he received it not, for
 his disciples were asleep.
 
 Jesus will be in agony even to the end of the world. We must not
 sleep during that time.
 
 Jesus in the midst of this universal desertion, even that of his
 own friends chosen to watch with him, finding them asleep, was
 vexed because of the danger to which they exposed, not him, but
 themselves; he warned them of their own safety and of their good,
 with a heartfelt tenderness for them during their ingratitude, and
 warned them that the spirit is willing and the flesh weak.
 
 Jesus, finding them still sleeping, unrestrained by any consideration
 for themselves or for him, had the tenderness not to wake them but to
 let them sleep on.
 
 Jesus prayed, uncertain of the will of his Father, and feared death;
 but so soon as he knew it he went forward to offer himself to death:
 _Eamus. Processit._ John.
 
 Jesus asked of men, and was not heard.
 
 Jesus, while his disciples slept, wrought their salvation. He has
 wrought that of each of the just while they slept both in their
 nothingness before their birth, and in their sins after their birth.
 
 He prayed only once that the cup should pass away, and then with
 submission; but twice that it should come if need were.
 
 Jesus was weary.
 
 Jesus, seeing all his friends asleep and all his enemies wakeful,
 gave himself over entirely to his Father.
 
 Jesus did not regard in Judas his enmity, but God's order, which he
 loves and admits, since he calls him friend.
 
 Jesus tore himself away from his disciples to enter into his agony;
 we must tear ourselves from our nearest and dearest to imitate him.
 
 Jesus being in agony and in the greatest sorrow, let us pray
 longer....
 
 Console thyself, thou wouldest not seek me hadst thou not found me.
 
 I thought of thee in mine agony, such drops of blood I shed for thee.
 
 It is tempting me rather than proving thyself, to think if thou
 wouldest act well in a case which has not occurred, I will act in
 thee if it occur.
 
 Let my rules guide thy conduct; see how I have led the Virgin and the
 saints who have let me act in them.
 
 The Father loves all that I do.
 
 Must I ever shed the blood of my humanity and thou give no tears?
 
 Thy conversion is my affair; fear not and pray with confidence as for
 me.
 
 I am present with thee by my word in the Scriptures, by my Spirit
 in the Church and by inspiration, by my power in the priest, by my
 prayer in the faithful.
 
 Physicians will not heal thee, for thou wilt die at last. But it is I
 who heal thee and make the body immortal.
 
 Suffer chains and bodily servitude, I deliver thee now only from what
 is spiritual.
 
 I am to thee more a friend than such or such an one, for I have done
 for thee more than they; they have not borne what I have borne from
 thee, they have not died for thee as I have done in the time of thine
 infidelities and thy cruelties, and as I am ready to do and do in my
 elect and at the Holy Sacrament.
 
 If thou knewest thy sins thou wouldest lose heart.--I shall lose it
 then O Lord, for on thy word I believe their malice.--No, for I by
 whom thou learnest it can heal thee of them, and what I tell thee
 is a sign that I will heal thee. As thou dost expiate them, thou
 wilt know them, and it will be said to thee: "Behold, thy sins are
 forgiven thee!"
 
 Repent then for thy secret sins, and for the hidden malice of those
 which thou knowest.
 
 Lord, I give thee all.--
 
 I love thee more ardently than thou hast loved thine uncleannesses,
 _ut immundus pro luto_.
 
 To me be the glory, not to thee, thou worm of earth.
 
 Ask thy director, when my own words are to thee occasion of evil, or
 vanity, or curiosity.
 
 I see the depths which are in me of pride, curiosity and lust. There
 is no relation between me and God, nor Jesus Christ the Just One. But
 he has been made sin for me, all thy scourges are fallen upon him. He
 is more abominable than I, and far from abhorring me he holds himself
 honoured that I go to him and succour him.
 
 But he has healed himself, and still more will he heal me.
 
 I must add my wounds to his, and join me to him, and he will save me
 in saving himself.
 
 But this must not be put off to a future day.
 
 Do little things as though they were great, because of the majesty of
 Jesus Christ who does them in us, and who lives our life; do great
 things as though they were small and easy, because of his omnipotence.
 
 
 _The Sepulchre of Jesus Christ._--Jesus Christ was dead, but seen on
 the Cross. He was dead, and hidden in the sepulchre.
 
 Jesus Christ was buried by the saints alone.
 
 Jesus Christ worked no miracles at the sepulchre.
 
 Only the saints entered it.
 
 There, not on the Cross, Jesus Christ took a new life.
 
 It is the last mystery of the passion and the redemption.
 
 Jesus Christ had no where to rest on earth but in the sepulchre.
 
 His enemies only ceased to persecute him at the sepulchre.
 
 
 I consider Jesus Christ in all persons and in ourselves. Jesus Christ
 as a father in his father, Jesus Christ as a brother in his brethren,
 Jesus Christ as poor in the poor, Jesus Christ as rich in the rich,
 Jesus Christ as doctor and priest in priests, Jesus Christ as
 sovereign in princes, etc. For by his glory he is all that is great,
 since he is God; and he is by his mortal life all that is miserable
 and abject. Therefore he has taken this wretched state, to enable him
 to be in all persons, and the model of all conditions.
 
 
 The false justice of Pilate only caused the suffering of Jesus
 Christ; for he caused him to be scourged by his false justice, and
 then slew him. It would have been better that he had slain him at
 first. Thus is it with those who are falsely just. They do good works
 or evil to please the world, and show that they are not altogether
 of Jesus Christ, for they are ashamed of him. Then at last in great
 temptations and on great occasions, they slay him.
 
 
 It seems to me that Jesus Christ after his resurrection allowed his
 wounds only to be touched: _Noli me tangere_. We must unite ourselves
 to his sufferings only.
 
 
 At the Last Supper he gave himself in communion as one about to die;
 to the disciples at Emmaus as one risen from the dead; to the whole
 Church as one ascended into heaven.
 
 
 Compare not thyself with others, but with me. If thou findest me not
 in those with whom thou comparest thyself, thou comparest thyself
 with him that is abominable. If thou findest me there compare thyself
 to me. But who is it that thou dost compare? Thyself, or me in thee?
 If it be thyself it is one that is abominable; if it be me thou
 comparest me to myself. Now I am God in all.
 
 I speak and often counsel thee because thy Guardian can not speak to
 thee, for I will not that thou shouldest lack a guide.
 
 And perhaps I do so at his prayers, and thus he leads thee without
 thy seeing it.
 
 Thou wouldest not seek me unless thou didst possess me.
 
 Therefore be not troubled.
 
 
 Be comforted; it is not from yourself that you must expect it; but on
 the contrary, expecting nothing from yourself, you must await it.
 
 
 Pray that ye enter not into temptation. It is dangerous to be
 tempted, and those alone are tempted who do not pray.
 
 _Et tu conversus confirma fratres tuos._ But before, _conversus Jesus
 respexit Petrum_.
 
 Saint Peter asked permission to strike Malchus, and struck before
 having the answer; Jesus Christ answered afterwards.
 
 
 I love poverty because he loved it. I love wealth because it gives
 the power of helping the miserable. I keep my troth to everyone;
 rendering not evil to those who do me wrong; but I wish them a lot
 like mine, in which I receive neither good nor evil from men. I try
 to be just, true, sincere, and faithful to all men; I have a tender
 heart for those to whom God has more closely bound me; and whether I
 am alone or seen of men I place all my actions in the sight of God,
 who shall judge them, and to whom I have consecrated them all.
 
 Such are my opinions, and each day of my life I bless my Redeemer
 who has implanted them in me, who has transformed me, a man full of
 weakness, misery, and lust, of pride and ambition, into a man exempt
 from all these evils, by the power of his grace, to which all the
 glory is due; since of myself I have only misery and sin.
 
 
 
 
 _OF THE TRUE RIGHTEOUS MAN AND OF THE TRUE CHRISTIAN._
 
 
 _Members. To begin with that._--To regulate the love which we owe
 to ourselves, we must imagine a body full of thinking members, for we
 are members of the whole, and see how each member should love itself,
 etc....
 
 
 If the feet and the hands had each a separate will they could only be
 in their order in submitting this separate will to the primary will
 which governs the whole body. Apart from that they are in disorder
 and misfortune, but in willing only the good of the body they find
 their own good.
 
 
 _Morality._--God having made the heavens and the earth, which cannot
 feel the happiness of their being, he has been pleased to make
 beings who should know it, and who should compose a body of thinking
 members. For our members do not feel the happiness of their union,
 of their admirable intelligence, of the care which nature has taken
 to infuse into them a mind, and to make them grow and endure. How
 happy would they be if they could see and feel it. But in order to
 this they must needs have intelligence to know it, and good will
 to consent to that of the universal soul. For if, having received
 intelligence, they used it to retain nourishment for themselves
 without allowing it to pass to the other members, they would be not
 only unjust but also miserable, and would hate rather than love
 themselves, their blessedness as well as their duty consisting in
 their consent to the guidance of the general soul to which they
 belong, who loves them better than they love themselves.
 
 
 To be a member, is to have neither life, being, nor movement save by
 the spirit of the body, and for the body; the separate member, seeing
 no longer the body to which it belongs, has only a waning and dying
 existence. Yet it believes it is a whole, and seeing not the body
 on which it depends, it believes it depends only on self and wills
 to constitute itself both centre and body. But not having in itself
 a principle of life, it only goes astray, and is astonished in the
 uncertainty of its being; fully aware that it is not a body, yet not
 seeing that it is a member of a body. Then when at last it arrives at
 the knowledge of self, it has returned as it were to its own home,
 and loves itself only for the body's sake, bewailing that in the past
 it has gone astray.
 
 It cannot by its nature love aught else, if not for itself and to
 subject it to self, since each thing loves itself above all. But in
 loving the body it loves itself, because it has no being but in it,
 by it, and for it. _Qui adhæret Deo unus spiritus est._
 
 The body loves the hand, and the hand, if it had a will, should love
 itself in the same proportion as that in which it is loved by the
 soul. All love beyond this is unjust.
 
 _Adhærens Deo unus spiritus est._ We love ourselves because we are
 members of Jesus Christ. We love Jesus Christ because he is the body
 of which we are members. All is one, one is in the other, like the
 Three Persons.
 
 
 The examples of the noble deaths of the Lacedæmonians and others
 scarce touch us, for what good do they to us? But the example of the
 death of the martyrs touches us, for they are our members. We have
 a common tie with them, their resolution can form ours, not only by
 example, but because it has perhaps merited ours. There is nothing
 of this in the examples of the heathen; there is no bond between us.
 As we do not become rich by seeing a rich stranger, but by seeing a
 father or a husband who is so.
 
 
 We must love God only, and hate self only.
 
 If the foot had always been ignorant that it belonged to the body,
 and that there was a body on which it depended, if it had only had
 the knowledge and the love of self, and if it came to know that it
 belonged to a body on which it depended, what regret, what confusion
 for the past life, for having been useless to the body from which its
 whole life was derived, which would have reduced it to nothing if it
 had rejected it and separated it from itself, as it held itself apart
 from the body. What prayers for its preservation in the body, with
 what submission would it allow itself to be governed according to
 the will which rules the body, even to consent, if need be, that it
 should be cut off, or it would lose its character of member. For each
 member must be content to perish for the body, for which alone the
 whole exists.
 
 
 To ensure the happiness of the members, they must have one will, and
 submit it to the body.
 
 
 It is false that we are worthy of the love of others, it is unjust
 that we should desire it. If we were born reasonable and impartial,
 knowing ourselves and others, we should not give this bias to our
 will. But we are born with it; we are therefore born unjust, for all
 tends to self. This is contrary to all order. We should look to the
 general advantage, and the inclination to self is the beginning of
 all disorder, in war, in politics, in economy, and in man's own body.
 
 The will therefore is depraved. If the members of natural and civil
 communities tend towards the well-being of the body, the communities
 themselves should tend to the welfare of another more general body of
 which they are members. We should therefore look to the whole. We are
 therefore born unjust and depraved.
 
 
 He who hates not in himself his self-love, and that instinct which
 leads him to make himself a God, is indeed blinded. All must see
 that nothing is so opposed to justice and truth. For it is false
 that we deserve this, and it is unjust and impossible to attain it,
 since all demand the same. Manifestly then injustice is innate in us,
 from which we cannot free ourselves, yet from which we ought to free
 ourselves.
 
 But no religion has pointed out that this is a sin, or that we are
 born in it, or that we are bound to resist it, or has thought of
 offering us a cure.
 
 
 It is unjust that any should attach themselves to me, even though
 they do it with pleasure, and voluntarily. I should deceive those
 in whom I aroused this desire, for I am not the final end of any,
 nor have I that which can satisfy them. Am I not about to die? And
 thus the object of their attachment will die. Thus as it would
 be blameworthy in me to cause a falsehood to be believed, though
 I should gently insinuate it, though it should be believed with
 pleasure, and though it should give me pleasure; in like manner it
 is blameworthy in me if I make myself beloved, and if I draw persons
 to attach themselves to me. I ought to warn those who are ready to
 consent to a lie, that they should not believe it, whatever advantage
 accrues to me from it; and in the same way that they should not
 attach themselves to me; for they ought to spend their life and their
 pains in pleasing God, or in seeking him.
 
 
 Self-will never will be satisfied, though it should have power for
 all it would; but we are satisfied from the moment we renounce it.
 Without it we cannot be discontented, with it we cannot be content.
 
 
 To hate self, and to seek a truly lovable being to love, is therefore
 the true and only virtue, for we are hateful because of lust. But as
 we cannot love what is outside us, we must love a being which is in
 us, yet not ourselves, and that is true of each and all men. Now the
 universal Being is alone such. The Kingdom of God is within us; the
 universal good is within us, is our very selves, yet not ourselves.
 
 
 If there be a God we ought to love him alone, and not the creatures
 of a day. The reasoning of the wicked in the _Book of Wisdom_ is
 only founded on the non-existence of God. "Given that there is no
 God," say they, "let us take delight in the creature. It is because
 there is nothing better." But were there a God to love they would not
 have come to this conclusion, but to the contrary. And this is the
 conclusion of the wise: "There is a God, therefore we ought not to
 take delight in the creature."
 
 Therefore all that leads us to attach ourselves to the creature is
 evil, because it hinders us from serving God if we know him, and from
 seeking him if we know him not. Now we are full of lust. Therefore we
 are full of evil, therefore we should hate ourselves and all which
 urges us to attach ourselves to aught but God only.
 
 
 That we must love one God only is a thing so plain, that no miracles
 are needed to prove it.
 
 That is a good state of the Church in which it is upheld by God alone.
 
 
 Two laws suffice to regulate the whole Christian republic better than
 all political laws.
 
 
 _Against those who trusting in the mercy of God live carelessly,
 without doing good works._--As the two sources of our sins are pride
 and indolence, God has revealed to us two of his attributes for their
 cure, mercy and justice. The property of justice is to abase our
 pride, however holy may be our works, _et non intres in judicium,
 etc._; and the property of mercy is to combat indolence by exciting
 to good works, according to that passage: "The goodness of God leads
 to repentance," and that other of the Ninevites: "Let us do penance
 to see if peradventure he will pity us." Thus mercy is so far from
 authorising slackness, that it is on the contrary the quality which
 formally assails it, so that instead of saying: "Were there not mercy
 in God, we must make every effort after virtue," we should say, on
 the contrary, that because there is mercy in God we must make every
 effort.
 
 
 The world exists for the exercise of mercy and judgment, not as if
 men were in it as they came from the hands of God, but as the enemies
 of God, to whom he gives by grace light enough to return, if they
 will seek him and follow him, and to punish them, if they refuse to
 seek him and follow him.
 
 
 We implore the mercy of God, not that he may leave us in peace in our
 vices, but that he may free us from them.
 
 
 There are but two kinds of men, the righteous, who believe themselves
 sinners, and sinners, who believe themselves righteous.
 
 
 _There are two kinds of men in each religion._--Among the heathen,
 worshippers of beasts, and the worshippers of the one God revealed by
 natural religion.
 
 Among the Jews, the carnal and the spiritual, who were the Christians
 of the old law.
 
 Among the Christians, those coarser ones, who are the Jews of the new
 law.
 
 The carnal Jews looked for a carnal Messiah, and the coarser
 Christians believe that the Messiah has dispensed them from the love
 of God. True Jews and true Christians adore a Messiah who makes them
 love God.
 
 
 Carnal Jews and the heathen have their miseries, and Christians also.
 There is no Redeemer for the heathen, for they do not even hope for
 one. There is no Redeemer for the Jews, who hope for him in vain.
 There is a Redeemer only for the Christians.
 
 
 The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, pride, etc.
 
 There are three orders of things: the flesh, the spirit, and the will.
 
 The carnal are the rich and kings, who have the body as their object.
 
 Enquirers and men of science, who have mind for their object.
 
 The wise, who have right for their object.
 
 God must reign over all, and all must be referred to him. In things
 of the flesh lust reigns especially, in men of intellect curiosity
 especially, in wisdom pride especially.
 
 Not that a man may not boast of wealth or knowledge, but there is no
 room for pride, for in granting that a man is learned there will be
 no difficulty in proving to him that he is wrong to be proud. Pride
 finds its proper place in wisdom, for it cannot be granted to a man
 that he has made himself wise and that he is wrong to be proud of
 it. For that is just. Now God alone gives wisdom, and therefore _qui
 gloriatur in Domino, glorietur_.
 
 
 All that is in the world is the lust of the flesh, the lust of the
 eyes, or the pride of life; _libido sentiendi, libido sciendi,
 libido dominandi_. Woe to the accursed land which these three rivers
 of flame enkindle rather than moisten. Happy they who are on these
 rivers, not overwhelmed nor carried away, but immovably fixed upon
 the floods, not standing, but seated, and on a firm and sure base,
 whence they rise not before the dawn; but where, having rested in
 peace, they stretch forth their hands to him who will lift them
 up, and cause them to stand firm and upright in the porches of the
 heavenly Jerusalem, where pride may no more assail nor cast them
 down; and who yet weep, not to see all those perishable things
 crumble which the torrents sweep away, but at the remembrance of
 their dear country, that heavenly Jerusalem, which they remember
 without ceasing while the days of their exile are prolonged.
 
 
 The rivers of Babylon rush and fall and sweep away.
 
 O holy Sion, where all is firm and nothing falls.
 
 We must sit upon the floods, not under them or in them, but on them;
 not standing but seated, being seated to be humble, and above them in
 security. But in the porches of Jerusalem we shall stand.
 
 Let us see if our pleasure is stable or transitory, if it pass away,
 it is a river of Babylon.
 
 
 There are few true Christians, I say this even in regard to faith.
 There are many who believe, but from superstition. There are many who
 believe not, out of reckless living; few are between the two.
 
 I do not include here those whose morality is true holiness, nor
 those whose belief springs from the heart.
 
 
 It is not a rare thing to have to blame the world for too much
 docility, it is a vice as natural as unbelief, and as pernicious.
 Superstition.
 
 
 Abraham took nothing for himself, but only for his servants; so the
 just man takes for himself nothing of the world, nor of the applause
 of the world, but only for his passions, which he uses as their
 master, saying to the one, 'Go,' and to another, 'Come.' _Sub te erit
 appetitus tuus._ The passions thus subdued are virtues. God himself
 attributes to himself avarice, jealousy, anger; and these are virtues
 as well as kindness, pity, constancy, which are also passions. We
 must treat them as slaves, and leaving to them their food hinder the
 soul from taking any of it. For when the passions gain the mastery
 they are vices, then they furnish nutriment to the soul, and the soul
 feeds on it and is poisoned.
 
 
 The just man acts by faith in the smallest things; when he blames his
 servants, he wishes for their conversion by the spirit of God, and
 prays God to correct them; for he expects as much from God as from
 his own blame, and he prays God to bless his corrections. And so with
 all his other actions.
 
 
 Of all that is in the world he takes part only in what is unpleasant,
 not in what is pleasant. He loves his neighbours, but his charity
 does not restrict itself within these bounds, but flows out to his
 enemies, and then to those of God.
 
 
 This is common to ordinary life and that of the saints, that all
 endeavour after happiness, and differ only in the object in which
 they place it. Both call those their enemies who hinder them from
 attaining it.
 
 We should judge of what is good or bad by the will of God, who cannot
 be either unjust or blind; and not by our own will, which is always
 full of malice and error.
 
 
 Joh. viii. _Multi crediderunt in eum. Dicebat ergo Jesus: "Si
 manseritis..., vere mihi discipuli eritis, et veritas liberabit
 vos." Responderunt: Semen Abrahae sumus et nemini servimus unquam._
 
 There is a great difference between disciples and true disciples.
 They are recognised by saying to them that the truth will make them
 free; for if they answer that they are free, and that it is in their
 power to come out of slavery to the devil, they are indeed disciples,
 but not true disciples.
 
 
 "Might I but see a miracle," men say, "I would become a Christian."
 How can they be sure they would do that of which they are ignorant?
 Men imagine that conversion consists in making of the worship of God
 such a transaction and way of life as they picture to themselves.
 True conversion consists in the annihilation of self before that
 universal Being whom we have so often provoked, and who might with
 justice destroy us at any moment; in recognising that we can do
 nought without him, and have merited nothing from him but his wrath.
 It consists in knowing that there is unconquerable opposition between
 us and God, and that without a mediator there could be no communion
 with him.
 
 
 _Comminutum cor._ Saint Paul. There is the Christian character.
 _Albe vous a nommé, je ne vous connais plus._ Corneille. That is the
 inhuman character. The human character is the contrary.
 
 
 With how little pride a Christian believes himself united to God,
 with how little abasement does he rank himself with the worms of
 earth. What a way is this to receive life and death, good and evil.
 
 
 It is true there is difficulty in entering into a devout life, but
 this difficulty does not arise from the religion which begins in us,
 but from the irreligion which is still there. If our senses were
 not opposed to penitence, and if our corruption were not opposed to
 the purity of God, there would be nothing in this painful to us. We
 suffer only in proportion as the vice which is natural to us resists
 supernatural grace; our heart feels torn asunder by these conflicting
 efforts, but it would be most unjust to impute this violence to God,
 who draws us, instead of attributing it to the world, which holds us
 back. As a child which a mother tears from the robbers' arms, in the
 anguish it suffers should love the loving and legitimate violence
 of her who procures its liberty, and detest only the imperious and
 tyrannical violence of those who retain it unjustly. The most cruel
 war which God can make against men in this life is to leave them
 without that war which he came to bring. "I came to bring war," he
 says, and to inform them of this war, "I came to bring fire and the
 sword." Before him the world lived in a false peace.
 
 
 The exterior must be joined to the interior to obtain aught from God,
 that is to say, we must kneel, pray with the lips, etc., in order
 that proud man, who would not submit himself to God, should now be
 subject to the creature. To expect succour from these externals is
 superstition, to refuse to join them to interior acts is pride.
 
 
 _External works._--There is nothing so perilous as that which is
 pleasing to God and to man; for those conditions which are pleasing
 to God and man, have one side which is pleasing to God, and another
 which is pleasing to man; as the greatness of Saint Theresa. That
 which was pleasing to God was her profound humility under her
 revelations, what was pleasing to men was her light. And thus we
 torment ourselves to imitate her discourses, thus thinking to imitate
 her condition, and thereby to love what God loves, and to place
 ourselves in a state which God loves.
 
 It is better not to fast, and be thereby humbled, than to fast and be
 puffed up therewith.
 
 The pharisee and the publican.
 
 
 What will memory avail me if it be alike hurtful and helpful, since
 all depends upon the blessing of God, who gives only to things done
 for him according to his rules and in his ways, the manner being thus
 as important as the thing, and perhaps more; since God can bring good
 out of evil, and because without God we bring evil out of good.
 
 
 The hope which Christians have of possessing an infinite good is
 mingled with actual enjoyment as well as with fear; for it is not
 as with those who should hope for a kingdom, of which they being
 subjects would have nothing; but they hope for holiness, and freedom
 from injustice, of which they possess somewhat.
 
 
 None is so happy as a true Christian, none so reasonable, none so
 virtuous, none so amiable.
 
 
 We remove ourselves from God only by removing ourselves from love.
 
 Our prayers and our virtues are abomination before God if they are
 not the prayers and the virtues of Jesus Christ. And our sins will
 never be the object of the mercy, but of the justice of God, if they
 are not those of Jesus Christ.
 
 He has adopted our sins, and has admitted us into covenant with him,
 for virtues are his own, and sins are strange to him; while virtues
 are strange to us, and sins are our own.
 
 Let us change the rule which we have hitherto adopted for judging
 what is good. We have had our own will as our rule in this respect,
 let us now take the will of God, all that he wills is good and right
 to us, all that he wills not is evil.
 
 All that God allows not is forbidden; sins are forbidden by the
 general declaration that God has made, that he allows them not.
 Other things which he has left without general prohibition, and
 which for that reason are said to be permitted, are nevertheless not
 always permitted; for when God removes any one of them from us, and
 when, by the event, which is a manifestation of the will of God, it
 appears that God allows not that we should have a thing, that is then
 forbidden to us as sin, since the will of God is that we should not
 have one more than the other. There is this sole difference between
 these two things, that it is certain God will never allow sin, while
 it is not certain that he will never allow the other. But so long
 as God allows it not, we must look upon it as sin, so long as the
 absence of God's will, which alone is all goodness and all justice,
 renders it unjust and evil.
 
 
 True Christians nevertheless submit to folly, not because they
 respect folly, but the commandment of God, who for the punishment of
 men has put them in subjection to their follies. _Omnis creatura
 subjecta est vanitati. Liberabitur._ Thus Saint Thomas explains the
 passage in Saint James on giving place to the rich, that if they do
 it not in the sight of God the commandment of religion is set at
 naught.
 
 
 All great amusements are dangerous to the Christian life, but among
 all those which the world has invented none is so much to be feared
 as the theatre. It is so natural and so delicate a representation
 of the passions that it moves them, and makes them spring up in our
 heart, above all that of love, principally when it is represented as
 very chaste and very honourable. For the more innocent it seems to
 innocent souls, the more are they capable of being touched by it; its
 violence pleases our self-love, which at once forms the desire of
 causing the same effects which we see so well represented, and at the
 same time we make for ourselves a conscience founded on the honour of
 the feelings which we see there. And this extinguishes the fear of
 pure souls which imagine there is no harm to purity in loving with a
 love which seems to them so moderate.
 
 Thus we leave the theatre with our heart so full of all the beauty
 and tenderness of love, the soul and the mind so persuaded of
 its innocence, that we are fully prepared to receive its first
 impressions, or rather to seek occasion to let them be born in the
 heart of some one, in order that we may receive the same pleasures
 and the same sacrifices which we have seen so well depicted in the
 theatre.
 
 
 The circumstances in which it is easiest to live according to the
 world are those in which it is most difficult to live according to
 God, and _vice versâ_. Nothing is so difficult according to the world
 as the religious life; nothing is more easy according to God. Nothing
 is easier than to live in great office and great wealth according to
 the world; nothing is more difficult than to live in them according
 to God, and not to take part in them and love them.
 
 
 Those who believe without having read the Old and New Testaments, do
 so because they have a saintly frame of mind, with which all that
 they hear of our Religion agrees. They feel that a God has made them;
 their will is to love God only, their will is to hate themselves
 only. They feel that they have no power of themselves, that they are
 unable to come to God, and if God come not to them, they can have
 no communion with him. And they hear our Religion declare that men
 must love God only, and hate self only, but that all being corrupt,
 and unfit for God, God made himself man to unite himself to us. No
 more is needed to convince men who have such a disposition and have a
 knowledge of their duty and of their incompetence.
 
 
 Those whom we see to be Christians without the knowledge of the
 prophecies and evidences, are able to judge of their religion as well
 as those who have that knowledge. They judge of it by the heart, as
 others by the understanding. God himself inclines them to believe,
 and thus they are effectually persuaded.
 
 I admit that one of those Christians who believe without proof is not
 perhaps qualified to convince an infidel who will say the same of
 himself; but those who know the proofs of religion can prove without
 difficulty that such a believer is truly inspired by God, though he
 cannot prove it himself.
 
 For God having said by his prophets, who are beyond a doubt prophets,
 that in the reign of Jesus Christ he will spread his spirit abroad
 among all nations, that the young men and maidens and the children of
 the Church will prophesy, there is no doubt that the spirit of God is
 upon these, and not upon the others.
 
 
 Wonder not to see simple souls believe without reasoning. God gives
 to them the love of him, and the hate of self, he inclines their
 heart to belief. No man will ever believe with true and saving faith
 if God incline not the heart, but each will believe as soon as he
 inclines it And this is what David knew well: _Inclina cor meum,
 Deus, in testimonia tua_.
 
 
 Romans iii. 27: Boasting is excluded, by what law? Of works? no, but
 by that of faith. Therefore faith is not in our power, like the
 works of the law, and it is given us in another way.
 
 
 Faith is a gift of God, do not suppose us to say it is a gift
 of reason. Other religions do not say this of their faith, they
 proffered only reason as a means of attaining to it, which after all
 does not lead to it.
 
 
 Faith, it is true, says what the senses do not say, but not the
 contrary of what they perceive. It is above them, not contrary to
 them.
 
 
 I am envious of those whom I see professing the true faith, but
 living and abusing a gift of which it seems to me I should make a
 very different use.
 
 
 The law imposed what it did not bestow; grace bestows that which it
 imposes.
 
 
 The law has not destroyed Nature, but has instructed it; grace has
 not destroyed the law, but has called it into action.
 
 Faith received at baptism is the source of the whole life of the
 Christian and of the converted.
 
 
 We make an idol of truth itself, for truth apart from charity is not
 God, it is his image and idol, which we must neither love nor adore;
 still less must we love and adore its opposite, which is falsehood.
 
 
 Submission and use of reason, in which consists true Christianity.
 
 
 The last process of reason is to recognise that there is an infinity
 of things which transcend it; it is but weak if it does not go so far
 as to know that.
 
 And if natural things transcend it, what shall we say of the
 supernatural?
 
 
 _Submission._--We must know when to doubt, when to feel certain,
 when to submit. Who fails in this understands not the force of
 reason. There are those who offend against these three rules, either
 by accepting everything as evidence, for want of knowing what
 evidence is; or by doubting everything, for want of knowing when to
 submit; or by yielding in everything, for want of knowing when to use
 their judgment.
 
 
 There are three means of belief; reason, habit, inspiration. The
 Christian religion, which only has reason, does not admit as her true
 children those who believe without inspiration; not that she excludes
 reason or habit, rather the contrary, but it is necessary to open
 the mind to proofs, to confirm ourselves by habit, and then to offer
 ourselves humbly to inspiration, which alone can produce a true and
 salutary effect. _Ne evacuetur crux Christi._
 
 
 There are two ways of urging the truths of our religion; one by the
 force of reason, the other by the authority of the speaker.
 
 We use not the last, but the first. We do not say: "You must believe
 this, for the Scripture which says so is divine," but we say: You
 must believe for such and such a reason, which are weak arguments,
 since reason bends itself to all.
 
 
 If we submit all to reason our religion will have nothing in it
 mysterious or supernatural. If we violate the principles of reason,
 our religion will be absurd and ridiculous.
 
 
 Saint Augustine. Reason would never submit if it did not judge that
 on some occasions submission is a duty.
 
 It is then right that it should submit, when it judges that it ought
 to submit.
 
 
 Piety is different from superstition.
 
 To carry piety as far as superstition is to destroy it.
 
 Heretics reproach us with this superstitious submission. This is to
 do that with which they reproach us.
 
 There is nothing so conformable to reason as the disavowal of reason.
 
 Two excesses: to exclude reason, and to admit reason only.
 
 
 Superstition and lust. Scruples, evil desires, evil fear.
 
 Fear, not such as arises from a belief in God, but that which springs
 from doubt whether he is or is not. True fear comes from faith, false
 fear from doubt. True fear is allied to hope, because it is born of
 faith, and because men hope in the God in whom they behave; false
 fear is allied to despair, because they fear the God in whom they do
 not believe. The one class fears to lose him, the other fears to find
 him.
 
 
 A person said to me one day that when he came from confession he
 felt great joy and confidence. Another said to me that he was still
 fearful, whereupon I thought that these two together would make one
 good man, and that each was so far wanting in that he had not the
 feelings of the other. The same is often true in other matters.
 
 
 The knowledge of God is very far from the love of him.
 
 
 We are not wearied of eating and sleeping every day, because hunger
 and drowsiness are renewed; without that we should be weary of them.
 Thus without the hunger of spiritual things we grow weary of them.
 Hunger after righteousness, the eighth beatitude.
 
 
 The conduct of God, who disposes all things gently, is to put
 religion into the mind by reason, and into the heart by grace. But to
 will to put it into the mind and heart by force and menace is not to
 put religion there, but terror, _terrorem potius quam religionem_.
 
 
 
 
 _THE ARRANGEMENT._
 
 
 _First part_: Misery of man without God.
 
 _Second part_: The happiness of man with God.
 
 Or. _First part_: That Nature is naturally corrupt.
 
 _Second part_: That the Scripture shows a Redeemer.
 
 
 _The arrangement by dialogues._--What ought I to do? I see only
 obscurity everywhere. Shall I believe that I am nothing, shall I
 believe that I am God?
 
 All things change and succeed each other.--You are mistaken; there
 is....
 
 
 A letter to lead to the search after God.
 
 And then to cause him to be sought for among the philosophers,
 sceptics and dogmatists, who trouble all who seek them.
 
 
 To pity those atheists who seek, for are they not unhappy enough?--To
 rail against those who make a boast of it.
 
 
 To begin by pitying unbelievers, they are miserable enough by their
 condition. We ought not to revile them except where it may be
 serviceable, but it does them harm.
 
 
 _The arrangement._ A letter of advice to a friend to lead him to
 seek, and he will answer: What is the good of seeking, since nothing
 comes to light.--Then to answer him: "Do not despair."--And he will
 answer that he would be glad to find some light, but that according
 to this very Religion, thus to believe, will be of no use to him: and
 that therefore he would as soon not seek. And to answer to that: The
 machine.
 
 
 _The arrangement._ After the letter _that we ought to seek God_,
 to write the letter on _the removal of obstacles_; which is the
 discourse on the machine, on preparing the machine, on seeking by
 reason.
 
 
 _The letter which shows the use of proofs by the machine._ Faith is
 different from proof; the one is human, the other the gift of God.
 _Justus ex fide vivit._ It is this faith that God himself puts into
 the heart, of which the proof is often the instrument, _fides ex
 auditu_; but this faith is in the heart, and makes us say not _scio_,
 but _credo_.
 
 
 In the letter _on Injustice_ may come the absurdity of the rule
 that the elder takes all. My friend, you were born on this side the
 mountain, it is therefore just that your elder brother should take
 all.
 
 
 _The arrangement._--Why should I take on myself to divide my moral
 qualities into four rather than into six? Why should I rather
 establish virtue in four, in two, in one? Why into _Abstine et
 sustine_ rather than into _Follow nature_, or, _Conduct your private
 affairs without injustice_, as Plato, or anything else?
 
 But there, you will say, is everything contained in one word. Yes,
 but that is useless, if not explained, and when we begin to explain
 it, as soon as the precept is opened which contains all the others,
 they issue in that first confusion which you wished to avoid. Thus
 when they are all enclosed in one they are concealed and useless, as
 in a box, and never appear but in their natural confusion. Nature has
 established them all without enclosing one in the other.
 
 
 _The arrangement._--Men despise Religion, they hate it, and fear it
 may be true. To cure this we must begin by showing that Religion is
 not contrary to reason; then that it is venerable, to give respect
 for it; then to make it lovable, to make good men hope that it is
 true; then to show that it is true.
 
 Venerable because it knows man well, lovable because it promises the
 true good.
 
 
 _The arrangement._--I should be far more afraid of making a mistake
 myself, and of finding that the Christian religion was true, than of
 not deceiving myself in believing it true.
 
 
 _The arrangement._--_After_ corruption to say: "It is right that
 those who are in that state should know it, both those who are
 contented with it, and those who are discontented; but it is not
 right that all should see Redemption."
 
 
 _The arrangement._--To see what is clear and indisputable in the
 whole state of the Jews.
 
 
 To the chapter on _Fundamentals_ must be added that on _Things
 figurative_ touching the reason of types. Why Jesus Christ was
 foretold at his first coming, why foretold obscurely as to the manner.
 
 
 A letter, on the folly of human knowledge and philosophy.
 
 This letter before _Diversion_.
 
 
 _The arrangement._--I might well have taken this discourse in some
 such order as the following: To show the vanity of every state of
 life, to show the vanity of ordinary lives, and then the vanity of
 philosophic lives, sceptics, stoics; but the order would not have
 been kept. I know a little what it is, and how few people know it. No
 human science can keep it. Saint Thomas did not keep it. Mathematics
 keep it, but these are useless by reason of their depth.
 
 
 Without examining each particular occupation it will be enough to
 class them under Diversion.
 
 
 
 
 _OF MIRACLES IN GENERAL._
 
 _THE MIRACLE OF THE HOLY THORN._
 
 
 _The beginning._--Miracles are the test of doctrine, and doctrine is
 the test of miracles.
 
 Of these there are false and true. There must be a mark whereby to
 know them, or they would be useless.
 
 Now they are not useless, and are on the contrary fundamental Now
 it must be that the rule which he gives us be such as shall not
 impair the proof afforded by true miracles to the truth, which is the
 principal end of miracles.
 
 Moses has given two; that the prediction does not come to pass, Deut.
 xviii., and that they do not lead to idolatry, Deut. xiii.; and Jesus
 Christ one.
 
 If doctrine regulate miracles, miracles are useless for doctrine.
 
 If miracles regulate....
 
 _Objection to the rule._
 
 Discrimination between times. One rule in Moses's day, another at
 present.
 
 
 Miracle. An effect which exceeds the natural force of the means
 employed, and non-miracle an effect not exceeding the natural force
 of the means employed. Thus those who heal by invocation of the devil
 work no miracle, for that does not exceed the natural power of the
 devil But....
 
 
 The combinations of miracles.
 
 A second miracle may suppose a first, but a first cannot suppose a
 second.
 
 
 No one has ever suffered martyrdom for the miracles he says he has
 seen; the folly of men would perhaps go as far as martyrdom, for
 those which the Turks believe by tradition, but not for those they
 have seen.
 
 
 Were there no false miracles there would be certainty.
 
 Were there no rule to test them, miracles would be useless, and there
 would be no reason for belief.
 
 Now, humanly speaking, there is no human certainty, but reason.
 
 
 It is said: _Believe the Church_, but it is not said: _Believe in
 Miracles_, because the last is natural and not the first. The one had
 need of a precept, not the other.
 
 
 _Miracles._--How I hate those who make men doubt of miracles.
 Montaigne speaks of them as he should in the two passages. In one we
 see how careful he is, yet in the other he believes, and laughs at
 unbelievers.
 
 However it may be, the Church has no proofs if they are right.
 
 
 Montaigne against miracles.
 
 Montaigne for miracles.
 
 
 _The reason why men do not believe._
 
 Joh. xii. 37. _Cum autem tanta signa fecisset, non credebant in eum,
 ut sermo Isaye impleretur. Excecavit, etc._
 
 _Hæc dixit Isaias, quando vidit gloriam ejus, et locutus est de eo._
 
 --_Judæi signa petunt, et Græci sapientiam quærunt._
 
 _Nos autem Jesum crucifixum._
 
 _Sed plenum signis, sed plenum sapientia._
 
 _Vos autem Christum non crucifixistis, et religionem sine miraculis
 et sine sapientia._
 
 The ground of disbelief in true miracles is want of charity. Joh.
 _Sed vos non creditis quia non estis ex ovibus._ The ground of belief
 in false miracles is want of charity.
 
 2 Thess. ii.
 
 The foundation of religion. This is miracle. Does God then speak
 against miracles, against the foundations of the faith which we have
 in him?
 
 If there be a God, faith in God must exist on earth. Now the miracles
 of Jesus Christ are not foretold by Antichrist, but the miracles
 of Antichrist are foretold by Jesus Christ. Thus if Jesus Christ
 were not the Messiah he would have certainly led into error, but
 Antichrist could not certainly lead into error.
 
 When Jesus Christ foretold the miracles of Antichrist, did he think
 of destroying faith in his own miracles?
 
 Moses foretold Jesus Christ, and commanded to follow him; Jesus
 Christ foretold Antichrist, and forbade to follow him.
 
 It was impossible that in the time of Moses any should assert their
 faith in Antichrist, who was unknown to them, but it is easy in the
 time of Antichrist to believe in Jesus Christ, already known.
 
 There is no reason to believe in Antichrist which there is not to
 believe in Jesus Christ, but there are reasons for believing in Jesus
 Christ, which do not exist for the other.
 
 
 _Title: How it happens that men believe so many liars, who say they
 have seen miracles, and do not believe any of those who say they have
 secrets to make men immortal or render them young again._--Having
 considered how it happens that men have believed so many impostors,
 who pretend they have remedies, often to the length of putting their
 lives into their hands, it appears to me that the true cause is that
 there are true remedies. For it would not be possible there should
 be so many false, to which so much credence is given, were there
 none true. Were there no remedy for any evil, and were all diseases
 incurable, it is impossible that men should ever have imagined that
 they could give remedies, and still more impossible that so many
 others should have believed those who boasted that they had them.
 Just as if a man boasted that he could prevent death, no one would
 believe him because there is no example of this. But as there are a
 number of remedies which are approved as true, even by the knowledge
 of the greatest men, the belief of men is thereby inclined; and
 since the thing was known to be possible, it has been therefore
 concluded that it was. For the public as a rule reasons thus: A thing
 is possible, therefore it is; because the thing cannot be denied
 generally, since there are particular effects which are true, the
 people, who cannot discriminate which among particular effects are
 true, believe them all. This is the reason that so many false effects
 are attributed to the moon, because there are some true, such as the
 tide.
 
 It is the same with prophecies, miracles, divination by dreams,
 casting lots, etc. For if in all these matters nothing true had ever
 taken place, nothing of them had ever been believed; and so instead
 of concluding that there are no true miracles, because so many are
 false, we must on the contrary say that there are certainly true
 miracles because there are false, and that the false only exist
 because some are true. We must reason in the same way about Religion,
 for it would not be possible that men should have imagined so many
 false religions had there not been one that is true. The objection to
 this is that savages have a religion, but we answer that they have
 heard speak of the true, as appears by the deluge, circumcision,
 Saint Andrew's cross, etc.
 
 
 Having considered how it comes that there are so many false miracles,
 false revelations, castings of lots, etc., it has appeared to me
 that the real cause is that there are true ones, for it would not be
 possible that there should be so many false miracles unless there
 were true, nor so many false revelations unless there were true,
 nor so many false religions unless there were one that is true. For
 if all this had never been, it is impossible that men should have
 imagined it, and still more impossible that so many others should
 have believed it. But as there have been very great things which are
 true and as they have been believed by great men; this impression
 has been produced, that almost everybody has been made capable of
 believing the false also; and thus instead of concluding that there
 are no true miracles since there are so many false, we must on the
 contrary say that there are true miracles since there are so many
 false, and that false miracles only exist for the reason that there
 are true; so also that there are false religions only because there
 is one that is true.--The objection to this is that savages have a
 religion. But this is because they have heard speak of the true,
 as appears by Saint Andrew's cross, the deluge, the circumcision,
 etc.--This comes from the fact that the spirit of man, finding
 itself inclined to that side by truth, becomes therefore susceptible
 of all the falsehoods of that....
 
 
 I should not be a Christian were it not for the miracles, said Saint
 Augustine.
 
 
 But for the miracles there would have been no sin in not believing in
 Jesus Christ.
 
 
 It is not possible to believe reasonably against miracles.
 
 
 Miracles have so great a force that it was needful that God should
 warn us not to credit them against him, clear as it may be that there
 is a God; without this they would have been able to disturb.
 
 And thus so far from these passages, Deut. xiii., making against the
 authority of miracles, nothing more marks their force. The same with
 Antichrist; "to seduce if it were possible even the very elect."
 
 
 Abraham and Gideon are above revelation.
 
 The Jews blinded themselves in judging of miracles by the Scripture.
 God has never left his true worshippers.
 
 I prefer to follow Jesus Christ than any other, because he has
 miracle, prophecy, doctrine, perpetuity, etc.
 
 The Donatists. No miracle which obliged them to say it was the devil.
 
 The more we specialise God, Jesus Christ and the Church.
 
 
 Jesus Christ worked miracles, then the apostles, and the early saints
 in great number, because the prophecies not being yet fulfilled,
 but only in the way of fulfilment by them, miracles were their only
 witness. It was foretold that the Messiah should convert the nations,
 and this prophecy could not be fulfilled without the conversion of
 the nations. Nor could the nations be converted to Messiah unless
 they saw the final effect of the prophecies concerning him. Till
 therefore he died and rose again, and had converted the nations, all
 was not fulfilled, wherefore miracles were needed during that time.
 We now need no more miracles against the Jews, for the fulfilment of
 prophecy is an enduring miracle.
 
 
 Prophecy is not called _miracle_, as Saint John speaks of the first
 miracle in Cana, then of what Jesus Christ said to the woman of
 Samaria, revealing to her all her hidden life. Then he healed the
 centurion's son, and Saint John calls this the second sign.
 
 
 Jesus Christ has verified that he was the Messiah, never in verifying
 his doctrine by Scripture and the prophecies, but always by his
 miracles.
 
 He proves by a miracle that he remits sins.
 
 Rejoice not that you work miracles, said Jesus Christ, but rather
 that your names are written in heaven.
 
 If they believe not Moses, neither will they believe one risen from
 the dead.
 
 Nicodemus recognised by his miracles, that his doctrine was of God.
 _Scimus quia venisti a Deo, magister, nemo enim potest facere quæ tu
 facis, nisi Deus fuerit cum eo._ He judged not of the miracles by the
 doctrine, but of the doctrine by the miracles.
 
 
 Here is no country for truth, she wanders unknown among men. God has
 covered her with a veil which leaves her unrecognised by those who
 hear not her voice; the way is open for blasphemy even against those
 truths which are at the least very apparent. If the truths of the
 Gospel are published, the contrary is also published, and questions
 are obscured, so that the people cannot discern, and they ask us,
 "What have you to make you believed rather than others? what sign
 do you give? you have words only, so have we, if you have miracles,
 good." That doctrine must be supported by miracle is a truth of which
 they make a pretext to blaspheme against doctrine. And if miracles
 happen, it is said that miracles are not enough without doctrine, and
 that is another way of blaspheming against miracles.
 
 Jesus Christ healed the man born blind, and worked many miracles
 on the sabbath day, and thus he blinded the Pharisees who said that
 miracles must be tested by doctrine.
 
 "We have Moses, but as for this man, we know not whence he is." It
 is wonderful that you know not whence he is, and yet he works such
 miracles.
 
 Jesus Christ spoke neither against God, nor against Moses.
 
 Antichrist and the false prophets foretold by both Testaments, will
 speak openly against God, and against Jesus Christ, who is not
 hidden. Whoever will be a secret enemy, God will not permit that he
 work miracles openly.
 
 In a public dispute where the two parties declare themselves on the
 side of God, of Jesus Christ, or the Church, there have never been
 miracles on the side of the false Christians, while the other party
 has remained without miracle.
 
 "He hath a devil," John x. 21. "And others said, Can a devil open the
 eyes of the blind?"
 
 The proofs which Jesus Christ and the Apostles draw from Scripture
 are not decisive, for they say only that Moses foretold that a
 prophet would come; but they do not thereby prove that Jesus Christ
 was that prophet, which is the whole question. These passages, then,
 serve only to show that we are not contrary to Scripture, and that
 there is no contradiction, not that there is accord. Now this is
 enough, there is no contradiction; and there are miracles.
 
 It follows, then, that he judged miracles to be certain proofs of
 what he taught, and that the Jews were bound to believe him. And as a
 fact, it was the miracles especially which made the unbelief of the
 Jews so blameworthy.
 
 There is a reciprocal duty between God and men. We must forgive him
 this saying: _Quid debui_. "Accuse me," said God in Isaiah.
 
 God must accomplish his promises, etc.
 
 Men owe it to God to receive the Religion which he sends them. God
 owes it to men not to lead them into error. Now they would be led
 into error, if the workers of miracles should announce a doctrine
 which did not appear visibly false to the light of common sense, and
 if a greater worker of miracles had not already given warning not to
 believe in them.
 
 Thus if there were division in the Church, and the Arians, for
 example, who no less than Catholics said they were founded on
 Scripture, had worked miracles, and the Catholics had worked none,
 men had been led into error.
 
 For, as a man, who announces to us the secret things of God is not
 worthy to be believed on his private testimony, and on that very
 ground the wicked doubt him; so when a man as a sign of the communion
 which he has with God raises the dead, foretells the future, moves
 the seas, heals the sick, there is none so wicked as not to yield,
 and the incredulity of Pharaoh and the Pharisees is the effect of a
 supernatural hardening.
 
 When, therefore, we see miracles and doctrine not open to suspicion
 both on one side, there is no difficulty. But when we see miracles
 and suspicious doctrine on the same side we must see which is the
 clearest. Jesus Christ was suspected.
 
 Barjesus was blinded. The power of God is above that of his enemies.
 
 The Jewish exorcists were beaten by devils, who said, "Jesus we know,
 and Paul we know, but who are ye?"
 
 Miracles are for doctrine, and not doctrine for miracles.
 
 But if miracles are true we cannot persuade men of all doctrine, for
 that will not come to pass: _Si angelus_....
 
 _Rule._ We must judge of doctrine by miracles, we must judge of
 miracles by doctrine. All this is true, but there is no contradiction.
 
 For we must distinguish the times.
 
 You are glad to know general rules, thinking by that to introduce
 difficulties, and render all useless. We shall stop you, my good
 father; truth is one, and strong.
 
 It is impossible from the duty God owes us, that a man, concealing
 his evil doctrine, and only allowing the good to appear, pretending
 that he is in conformity with God and the Church, should work
 miracles to insinuate insensibly a false and subtle doctrine. This
 cannot be.
 
 Still less, that God who knows the heart, should work miracles in
 favour of such an one.
 
 
 There is much difference between temptation and leading into error.
 God tempts, but he leads not into error. To tempt is to present
 occasions which impose no necessity; if we love not God we shall do a
 certain thing. To lead into error, is to place a man in a necessity
 of forming and following false conclusion.
 
 
 This is what God cannot do, which nevertheless he would do, if in an
 obscure question he wrought miracles on the side of falsehood.
 
 
 In the Old Testament, when they would turn you from God, in the New
 when they would turn you from Jesus Christ.
 
 Such are the occasions on which we exclude certain miracles from
 credence. There need be no other exclusions.
 
 But it does not therefore follow that they had the right to exclude
 all the prophets who came to them. They would have sinned in not
 excluding those who denied God, and would also have sinned in
 excluding those who denied him not.
 
 So soon, then, as we see a miracle we should at once either acquiesce
 or have signal marks against it. We must see if it denies either a
 God, or Jesus Christ, or the Church.
 
 
 Miracles avail not for conversion, but for condemnation. I P. ix.

 _Volumus signum videre de cœlo tentantes eum._ Luc. xi. 16.
 
 _Generatio prava signum quærit; sed non dabitur._
 
 _Et ingemiscens ait; Quid generatio ista signum quærit._ Marc. viii.
 12. They asked a sign with a bad intent. _Et non poterat facere._
 And nevertheless he promises them the sign of Jonah, the great and
 incomparable evidence of his resurrection.
 
 _Nisi videritis signa non creditis._ He does not blame them for not
 believing without there having been miracles, but without their
 having been themselves witnesses of them.
 
 Antichrist _in signis mendacibus_, says St Paul. 2 Thess. ii.
 
 _Secundum operationem Satanæ. In seductione ii qui pereunt eo quod
 charitatem veritatis non receperunt ut salvi fierent. Ideo mittet
 illis Deus operationem erroris ut credant mendacia._
 
 As in the passage of Moses: _Tentat enim vos Deus, utrum diligatis
 eum_.
 
 _Ecce prædixi vobis, vos ergo videte._
 
 
 The Church has three kinds of enemies, the Jews, who have never
 been of her body; the heretics, who have withdrawn from it; and bad
 Christians, who rend her from within.
 
 These three different kinds of enemies generally assail her in
 different ways, but here they assail her in the same fashion. As they
 are all without miracles, and as the Church has always had miracles
 against them, they have all had the same interest in eluding them;
 and all avail themselves of this pretext, that we must not judge of
 doctrine by miracles, but of miracles by doctrine. There were two
 parties among those who heard Jesus Christ, those who followed his
 doctrine by reason of his miracles; others who said.... There were
 two parties in the time of Calvin. There are now the Jesuits, etc.
 
 
 Miracles are the test in doubtful matters, between Jew and Gentile,
 Jew and Christian, catholic and heretic, slanderer and slandered,
 between the two crosses.
 
 But miracles would be useless to heretics, for the Church, authorised
 by miracles which have already obtained credence, tells us that they
 have not the true faith. There is no doubt that they are not in it,
 because the first miracles of the Church exclude belief in theirs.
 Thus there is miracle against miracle, and the first and greatest are
 on the side of the Church.
 
 
 _Controversy._ Abel, Cain;--Moses, the Magicians;--Elijah, the false
 prophets;--Jeremiah, Hananiah;--Micaiah, the false prophets;--Jesus
 Christ, the Pharisees;--Saint Paul, Barjesus;--the Apostles,
 the Exorcists;--the Christians and the infidels;--Catholics,
 heretics;--Elijah, Enoch, Antichrist.
 
 In the trial by miracles truth always prevails. The two crosses.
 
 
 Miracles are no longer needful, because they have already been. But
 when we listen no more to tradition, when the pope alone is proposed
 to us, when he has been taken by surprise, and when the true source
 of truth, which is tradition, is thus excluded, the pope, who is its
 guardian, is thus prejudiced, truth is no longer allowed to appear;
 then, since men speak no longer of truth, truth herself must speak to
 men. This is what happened in the time of Arius.
 
 
 Religion is adapted to every kind of intellect. Some consider
 only its establishment, and this Religion is such that its very
 establishment is enough to prove its truth. Some trace it as far as
 the apostles; the more learned go back to the beginning of the world;
 the angels see it better still, and from earlier time.
 
 
 1. Objection. _An angel from heaven._
 
 We must not judge of truth by miracles, but of miracles by truth.
 
 Therefore miracles are useless.
 
 Now they serve, and cannot be against the truth.
 
 Therefore what Father Lingende says, that God will not allow a
 miracle to lead into error....
 
 When there shall be a dispute in the same Church, miracle will decide.
 
 2. Objection.
 
 _But Antichrist will work miracles._
 
 The Magicians of Pharaoh did not lead into error. Thus on Antichrist
 we cannot say to Jesus Christ: You have led me into error. For
 Antichrist will work them against Jesus Christ, and thus they cannot
 lead into error. Either God will not permit false miracles, or he
 will procure greater.
 
 If in the same Church a miracle should occur on the side of those in
 error, men would be led into error.
 
 A schism is visible, a miracle is visible. But a schism is more a
 mark of error than a miracle is a mark of truth, therefore a miracle
 cannot lead into error.
 
 But apart from schism the error is not so visible as the miracle is
 visible.
 
 Therefore miracle may lead into error.
 
 _Ubi est Deus tuus?_--Miracles show him and are a light to him.
 
 Joh. vi. 26. _Non quia vidisti signum, sed quia saturati estis._
 
 Those who follow Jesus Christ because of his miracles honour his
 power in all the miracles which it produces. But those who, making
 profession to follow him because of his miracles, only follow him
 indeed because he consoles them and satisfies them with worldly
 goods, disparage his miracles when they are contrary to their own
 convenience.
 
 Joh. ix: _Non est hic homo a Deo, quia sabbatum non custodit_. _Alii:
 Quomodo potest homo peccator hæc signa facere?_
 
 Which is the most clear?
 
 This house is not of God, for they do not there believe that the five
 propositions are in Jansenius.
 
 Others: This house is of God, for in it strange miracles are done.
 
 Which is the most clear?
 
 _Tu quid dicis? Dico quia propheta est.--Nisi esset hic a Deo, non
 poterat facere quidquam._
 
 
 There is much difference between not being for Jesus Christ, and
 saying it, and not being for Jesus Christ, yet feigning to be so. The
 one party can work miracles, not the others, for it is clear that the
 one party are against the truth, but not that the others are; and
 thus miracles are the more clear.
 
 
 "If you believe not in me, believe at least in the miracles." He puts
 them forward as the strongest.
 
 He had said to the Jews as well as to the Christians, that they
 should not always believe the prophets; but nevertheless the
 pharisees and scribes made much of his miracles, and tried to show
 that they were false or worked by the devil, since they were bound to
 be convinced, if they admitted that these were of God.
 
 
 We are not in these days obliged so to discriminate. Yet it is very
 easy to do so; those who deny neither God nor Jesus Christ work no
 miracles which are not quite certain.
 
 _Nemo facit virtutem in nomine meo, et cito possit de me male loqui._
 
 But we have not to use this discrimination. Here is a sacred relic,
 here is a thorn from the crown of the Saviour of the world, on whom
 the prince of this world has no power, which works miracles by the
 immediate power of the blood that was shed for us. Thus God has
 himself chosen this house wherein openly to show forth his power.
 
 Here are not men who work miracles by an unknown and doubtful virtue,
 obliging us to a difficult discrimination; it is God himself, it is
 the instrument of the passion of his only Son, who being in many
 places chose this, and made men come from all sides, there to receive
 miraculous succour in their weaknesses.
 
 
 If the devil were to favour the doctrine which destroys him, he would
 be divided against himself, as Jesus Christ said. If God favoured
 the doctrine which destroys the Church, he would be divided against
 himself. _Omne regnum divisum._
 
 For Jesus Christ acted against the devil, and destroyed his empire
 over the heart, of which exorcism is the figure, to establish the
 kingdom of God. And so he adds: _Si in digito Dei, regnum Dei ad vos_.
 
 Either God has confounded the false miracles or he has foretold them,
 and both by the one and the other he has raised himself above the
 supernatural in regard to us, and has raised us also.
 
 
 Jer. xxiii. 32. The _miracles_ of the false prophets. In the Hebrew
 and Vatable they are called _trifles_.
 
 _Miracle_ does not always mean miracle. 1 Kings xiv. 15. _Miracle_
 signifies _fear_, and is the same in Hebrew.
 
 The same plainly in Job xxxiii. 7.
 
 So in Isaiah xxi. 4. Jeremiah xliv. 12.
 
 _Portentum_ means _images_, Jer. l. 38, and it is the same in Hebrew
 and Vatable. Isaiah viii. 18. Jesus Christ says that he and his will
 be in _miracles_.
 
 
 Jesus Christ said that the Scriptures bear witness of him, but he did
 not show in what respect.
 
 Even the prophecies could not prove Jesus Christ during his life,
 and thus if miracles had not sufficed without doctrine, men would
 not have been blameworthy who did not believe in him before his
 death. Now those who did not believe in him during his life were
 sinners, as he says himself, and without excuse. Therefore they must
 have resisted a conclusive proof. Now they had not our proof, but
 only miracles, therefore miracles are enough when doctrine is not
 contrary, and they ought to be believed.
 
 John vii. 40. _Controversy among the Jews as among Christians of our
 day._ The one party believed in Jesus Christ, the other believed not,
 because of the prophecies which said he should be born in Bethlehem.
 They should have enquired more diligently whether he was not. For
 his miracles being convincing, they ought to have been quite certain
 of these alleged contradictions of his doctrine to the Scripture,
 and this obscurity did not excuse, but blinded them. Thus those who
 refuse to believe miracles in our day on account of an alleged but
 unreal contradiction, are not excused.
 
 When the people believed on him because of his miracles, the
 pharisees said: "This people, which doeth not the law, is accursed,
 but there is none of the princes or the pharisees who has believed on
 him, for we know that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet." Nicodemus
 answered, "Doth our law judge any man before it heareth him?"
 
 
 Judges xiii. 23. "If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he would not
 have shewed us all these things."
 
 Hezekiah, Sennacherib.
 
 Jeremiah, Hananiah, the false prophet, died in seven months.
 
 2 Macc. iii. The temple, ready for pillage, miraculously
 succoured.--2 Macc. xv.
 
 1 Kings xvii. The widow to Elijah, who had restored her son. "By this
 I know that thy words are true."
 
 1 Kings xviii. Elijah, with the prophets of Baal.
 
 Never in a contention concerning the true God or of the truth of
 Religion has any miracle happened on the side of error and not of
 truth.
 
 
 _Miracle._--The people believe this of themselves, but if the reason
 must be given you....
 
 It is troublesome to be an exception to the rule. We ought strictly
 to hold the rule and oppose the exception, yet as it is certain there
 are exceptions to every rule, we ought with this strictness to be
 just.
 
 
 Is it not enough that miracles are done in one place, and that God's
 providence is shown on one people?
 
 Good breeding goes so far as to have no politeness, and true piety to
 have politeness for others.
 
 This is not well bred.
 
 
 The incredulous are the most credulous. They believe the miracles of
 Vespasian in order that they may not believe those of Moses.
 
 
 _On the Miracle._--As God has made no family more happy, he should
 also find none more grateful.
 
 
 
 
 _JESUITS AND JANSENISTS._
 
 
 The Church has always been assailed by contrary errors, but perhaps
 never at the same time, as now; and if she suffer more because of the
 multiplicity of errors, she receives this advantage from it, that
 they destroy each other.
 
 She complains of both, but much the most of the Calvinists, because
 of the schism.
 
 It is certain that many of the two opposite parties are deceived;
 they must be disabused.
 
 Faith embraces many truths which seem contradictory. _There is a time
 to laugh, and a time to weep, etc._ _Responde, ne respondeas, etc._
 
 The source of this is the union of the two natures in Jesus Christ.
 
 And also the two worlds. The creation of a new heaven and a new
 earth, a new life, a new death, all things double, and the same names
 remaining.
 
 And finally, the two natures which are in the righteous man, for they
 are the two worlds, and a member and image of Jesus Christ. And thus
 all the names suit them, righteous, sinners; dead though living,
 living though dead, elect, reprobate, etc.
 
 There are then a great number of truths in faith and in morals, which
 seem contrary to each other, which yet all subsist together in a
 wonderful order.
 
 The source of all heresies is the exclusion of some of these truths.
 
 And the source of all the objections made by heretics against us is
 the ignorance of some of these truths.
 
 And for the most part it happens that, unable to conceive the
 relation of two opposite truths, and believing that admission of one
 involves the exclusion of the other, they embrace the one and exclude
 the other, thinking that we on the other hand.... Now exclusion is
 the cause of their heresy, and ignorance that we hold the other truth
 causes their objections.
 
 1st example: Jesus Christ is God and man. The Arians, unable to
 reconcile these things which they believe incompatible, say that he
 is man, and so far they are Catholics. But they deny that he is God,
 and so far they are heretics. They assert that we deny his humanity,
 and so far they are ignorant
 
 2nd example, on the subject of the Holy Sacrament. We believe that
 the substance of bread being changed, and consubstantially that of
 the body of our Lord Jesus Christ is therein really present. That is
 one truth. Another is that this sacrament is also a figure of that of
 the cross and of glory, and a commemoration of the two. That is the
 Catholic faith, which comprehends these two truths which seem opposed.
 
 The heresy of our day, not conceiving that this sacrament contains
 at one and the same time both the presence of Jesus Christ and a
 figure of his presence, that it is a sacrifice and a commemoration of
 a sacrifice, believes that neither of these truths can be admitted
 without, by this very reason, the exclusion of the other.
 
 They adhere to this only point, that this sacrament is figurative,
 and so far they are not heretics. They think that we exclude this
 truth, hence it comes that they found so many objections on those
 passages of the Fathers which assert it. Lastly they deny the
 presence, and so far they are heretics.
 
 3rd example. Indulgences.
 
 Therefore the shortest way to hinder heresies is to teach all truths,
 and the surest means of refuting them is to declare them all. For
 what will the heretics say?
 
 If the ancient Church was in error, the Church is fallen; if she is
 so now it is not the same thing, for she has always the superior
 maxim of tradition from the hand of the ancient Church; and thus this
 submission and conformity to the ancient Church prevails and corrects
 all. But the ancient Church did not postulate the future Church, and
 did not regard her, as we postulate and regard the ancient.
 
 
 All err the more dangerously because they follow each a truth, their
 fault is not that they follow an error, but that they do not follow
 another truth.
 
 
 That which hinders us in comparing what formerly took place in the
 Church with what we now see, is that we are wont to regard Saint
 Athanasius or Saint Theresa and others as crowned with glory, and
 acting in regard to us as gods. Now that time has cleared our vision
 we see that they are so. But when this great saint was persecuted he
 was a man called Athanasius, and Saint Theresa was a nun. "Elias was
 a man like ourselves and subject to the same passions as ourselves,"
 says Saint Peter, to disabuse Christians of that false notion that
 we must reject the examples of the saints as disproportioned to our
 state. They were saints, say we, they are not like us. What was the
 case then? Saint Athanasius was a man called Athanasius, accused of
 many crimes, condemned by such and such a council for such and such
 a crime. All the bishops assented to it, and at last the pope. What
 did they say to those who resisted his condemnation? That they were
 disturbing the peace, that they were creating a schism, etc.
 
 Four lands of persons: zeal without knowledge, knowledge without
 zeal, neither knowledge nor zeal, zeal and knowledge. The first three
 condemned him, the last absolved him, were excommunicated by the
 Church and yet saved the Church.
 
 
 The three notes of Religion: perpetuity, a good life, miracles.
 
 They destroy perpetuity by probability, good life by their morality,
 miracles in destroying either their truth or their consequence.
 
 If we believe them, the Church has nothing to do with perpetuity, a
 holy life, or miracles.
 
 Heretics deny them or deny the consequences; they do the same. But
 those must be devoid of sincerity who deny them or again have lost
 their senses if they deny the consequences.
 
 
 _Perpetuity._--Is your character founded on Escobar?
 
 Perhaps you have reasons for not condemning them; it is enough that
 you approve of those I address to you on the subject.
 
 Would the pope be dishonoured by gaining his light from God and
 tradition; and does it not dishonour him to separate him from this
 sacred union and....
 
 Tertullian: _Nunquam Ecclesia reformabitur._
 
 Perpetuity.
 
 Molina.
 
 Novelty.
 
 Heretics have always assailed these three notes which they have not.
 
 
 Those wretches, who have obliged me to speak on the foundations of
 Religion.
 
 Sinners purified without penitence, just men sanctified without
 charity, all Christians without the grace of Jesus Christ, God
 without power over the will of men, a predestination without mystery,
 a redemption without certainty.
 
 
 Sinners without penitence, just men without charity, a God without
 power over the wills of men, a predestination without mystery.
 
 
 Those who love the Church complain that they see morals corrupted,
 but laws at least exist. But these corrupt the laws. The model is
 spoiled.
 
 
 There is a contradiction; for on the one side they say tradition must
 be followed, and would not dare disavow it, and on the other they
 will say whatever pleases them. The former will always be believed
 in, and indeed it would be going against them not to believe it.
 
 
 _Politics._--We have found two obstacles to the design of comforting
 men. The one the interior laws of the Gospel, the other the exterior
 laws of the State and of Religion.
 
 We are masters of the one set of laws, the others we have dealt with
 in this wise: _Amplienda, restringenda, a majori ad minus._
 
 _Junior._
 
 
 _Generals._--It is not enough for them to introduce such morals into
 our churches, _templis inducere mores_. Not only do they wish to be
 tolerated in the Church, but as though they had become the stronger,
 they would expel those who are not of them....
 
 Mohatra. He who is astonished at this is no theologian.
 
 Who would have told your generals that the time was so near when they
 would give laws to the Church universal, and would call the refusal
 of such disorders war, _tot et tanta mala pacem_.
 
 
 They cannot have perpetuity, and they seek universality; therefore
 they make the whole Church corrupt, that they may be saints.
 
 
 You abuse the credence which the people has in the Church, and make
 them believe untruth.
 
 
 I suppose that men believe the miracles:
 
 You corrupt Religion either in favour of your friends, or against
 your enemies. You dispose of all at your will.
 
 
 So that if it be true on the one hand that some lax religious, and
 some corrupt casuists, who are not members of the hierarchy, are
 steeped in these corruptions, it is on the other hand certain that
 the true pastors of the Church, who are the true depositories of the
 divine word, have preserved it unchangeably against the efforts of
 those who have striven to ruin it.
 
 And thus the faithful have no pretext to follow that laxity which is
 only offered them by the stranger hands of these casuists, instead of
 the sound doctrine which is presented to them by the fatherly hands
 of their own pastors. And the wicked and heretics have no reason to
 put forward these abuses as marks of the defective providence of
 God over his Church, since the Church having her true existence in
 the body of the hierarchy, it is so far from the present condition
 of things being a proof that God has abandoned her to corruption,
 that it has never so plainly appeared as at the present day that God
 visibly defends her from corruption.
 
 For if some of these men, who by an extraordinary vocation have
 made profession of retirement from the world, and have adopted
 the religious dress, that they might live in a more perfect state
 than ordinary Christians, have fallen into disorders which horrify
 ordinary Christians, and have become among us what the false prophets
 were among the Jews; this is a private and personal matter, which we
 must indeed deplore, but from which we can conclude nothing against
 the care which God takes for his Church; since all these things
 are so clearly foretold, and it has been long since announced that
 temptations would arise on account of such persons, so that when we
 are well instructed we see therein rather the notes of the guidance
 of God than his forgetfulness in regard to us.
 
 
 You are ignorant of the prophecies if you do not know that all this
 must needs happen, princes, prophets, pope, and even the priests.
 And yet the Church must abide. By the grace of God we are not so far
 gone. Woe to these priests. But we hope that God will of his mercy
 grant us that we be not among them.
 
 2 Saint Peter ii. False prophets in the past the image of the future.
 
 
 Is _Est and non est_ received in faith as well as in miracles, and is
 it inseparable in the others?...
 
 When Saint Xavier works miracles....
 
 Saint Hilary.--These wretches who have obliged us to speak of
 miracles.
 
 _Væ qui conditis leges iniquas._
 
 Unjust judges, make not your laws on the moment, judge by those which
 are established, and by yourselves.
 
 To weaken your adversaries you disarm the whole Church.
 
 If they say that our safety depends on God, they are heretics.
 
 If they say they are under obedience to the pope, that is hypocrisy.
 
 If they are ready to assent to all the articles, that is not enough.
 
 If they say that no man should be killed for an apple, they assail
 the morality of Catholics.
 
 If miracles are wrought among them, it is no mark of holiness, but
 rather a suspicion of heresy.
 
 
 The hardness of the Jesuits therefore surpasses that of the Jews,
 since those refused to believe Jesus Christ innocent only because
 they doubted if his miracles were of God. But on the contrary, though
 the Jesuits cannot doubt that the Port Royal miracles were of God,
 they still continue to doubt the innocency of that house.
 
 
 Men never commit evil so fully and so gaily as when they do so for
 conscience sake.
 
 
 Experience shows us a vast difference between devoutness and goodness.
 
 
 The two contrary reasons. We must begin with that; without that we
 understand nothing and all is heretical; in the same way we must
 even add at the close of each truth that the opposite truth is to be
 remembered.
 
 
 If there was ever a time in which it were necessary to make
 profession of two contraries, it is when we are reproached for
 omitting one. Therefore the Jesuits and the Jansenists are wrong in
 concealing them, but the Jansenists most, for the Jesuits have better
 made profession of the two.
 
 M. de Condran. There is, he says, no comparison between the union
 of the saints and that of the Holy Trinity. Jesus Christ says the
 opposite.
 
 
 That we have treated them as kindly as is possible while keeping
 ourselves in the mean, between the love of truth and the duty of
 charity.
 
 That piety does not consist in never opposing our brethren, it would
 be very easy, etc.
 
 It is false piety to keep peace to the prejudice of the truth. It is
 also false zeal to keep truth and wound charity.
 
 Neither have they complained.
 
 Their maxims have their time and place.
 
 He will be condemned indeed who is so by Escobar.
 
 Their vanity tends to grow out of their errors.
 
 Conformed to the fathers by their faults, and to the martyrs by their
 sufferings.
 
 Moreover they do not disavow any of....
 
 They had only to take the passage, and disavow it.
 
 _Sanctificavi prælium._
 
 M. Bourseys. At least they cannot disavow that they are opposed to
 the condemnation.
 
 
 I have re-read them since, for I had not known them....
 
 
 The world must be blind indeed if it believe you.
 
 
 If men knew themselves, God would heal and pardon. _Ne convertantur,
 et sanem eos, et dimittantur eis peccata._ Isaiah. Matt. xiii.
 
 
 Truth is so obscure in these days, and falsehood so established, that
 unless we love the truth we shall be unable to know it.
 
 
 As Jesus Christ remained unknown among men, so his truth remains
 among ordinary opinions without external difference. Thus the
 Eucharist among ordinary bread. All faith consists in Jesus Christ
 and in Adam, and all morals in lust and in grace.
 
 
 "I have reserved me seven thousand." I love the worshippers unknown
 to the world and even to the prophets.
 
 
 To trust in forms is superstition, but to refuse to submit to forms
 is pride.
 
 
 As peace in States has for its sole object the safe preservation
 of the property of the people, so the peace of the Church has for
 its sole object the safe preservation of truth, her property and
 the treasure where her heart is. And as to allow the enemy to enter
 into a State, and pillage without opposition, for fear of troubling
 repose, would be to work against the good of peace, because peace,
 being only just and useful for the security of property, it becomes
 unjust and harmful when it suffers property to be destroyed, while
 war in the defence of property becomes just and necessary. So in the
 Church, when truth is assailed by the enemies of faith, when men
 would tear it from the heart of the faithful, and cause error to
 reign there, to remain in peace is rather to betray than to serve
 the Church, to ruin rather than defend. And as it is plainly a crime
 to trouble peace where truth reigns, so is it also a crime to rest
 in peace when truth is destroyed. There is then a time when peace is
 just, and another when it is unjust. And it is written that there
 is a time for peace and a time for war, and it is the interest of
 truth to discern them. But there is not a time for truth and a time
 for error, and it is written, on the contrary, that the truth of God
 abideth for ever; and this is why Jesus Christ, who said that he came
 to bring peace, said also that he came to bring war. But he did not
 say that he came to bring both truth and falsehood. Truth is then the
 first rule and the ultimate end of things.
 
 
 As the two principal interests of the Church are the preservation
 of the piety of the faithful and the conversion of heretics, we are
 overwhelmed with grief at the sight of factions now arising, to
 introduce those errors which more than any others may close for ever
 against heretics the entrance into our communion, and fatally corrupt
 those pious and catholic persons who remain to us. This enterprise,
 made at the present day so openly against those truths of Religion
 most important for salvation, fills us not only with displeasure, but
 also with fear and even terror, because, besides the feeling which
 every Christian must have of these disorders, we have further an
 obligation to remedy them, and to employ the authority which God has
 given, to cause that the peoples which he has committed to us, etc.
 
 
 We must let heretics know, who gain advantage from the doctrine of
 the Jesuits, that it is not that of the Church ... the doctrine of
 the Church, and that our divisions separate us not from the altar.
 
 They hide themselves in the crowd, and call numbers to their aid.
 
 Tumult.
 
 
 In corrupting the bishops and the Sorbonne, if they have not had the
 advantage of making their judgment just, they have had that of making
 their judges unjust. And thus, when in future they are condemned,
 they will say _ad hominem_ that they are unjust, and thus will refute
 their judgment. But that does no good. For as they cannot conclude
 that the Jansenists are rightly condemned because they are condemned,
 so they cannot conclude then that they themselves will be wrongly
 condemned because they will be so by corruptible judges. For their
 condemnation will be just, not because it will be given by judges
 always just, but by judges just in that particular, which will be
 shown by other proofs.
 
 
 These are the effects of the sins of the peoples and of the Jesuits,
 great men have wished to be flattered, the Jesuits have wished to be
 loved by the great. They have all been worthy to be given up to the
 spirit of lying, the one party to deceive, the others to be deceived.
 They have been greedy, ambitious, pleasure loving: _Coacervabunt tibi
 magistros_.
 
 
 _The Jesuits._
 
 The Jesuits have wished to unite God and the world, and have gained
 only the scorn of God and the world. For, on the side of conscience
 this is plain, and on the side of the world they are not good
 partisans. They have power, as I have often said, but that is in
 regard to other religious. They will have interest enough to get a
 chapel built, and to have a jubilee station, not to make appointments
 to bishoprics and government offices. The position of a monk in
 the world is a most foolish one, and that they hold by their own
 declaration.--Father Brisacier, the Benedictines.--Yet ... you yield
 to those more powerful than yourselves, and oppress with all your
 little credit those who have less power for intrigue in the world
 than you.
 
 
 _Venice._--What advantage will you draw from it, except the princes'
 need of it, and the horror the nations have had of it. If these had
 asked you and, in order to obtain it, had implored the assistance of
 all Christian princes, you might have boasted of this importunity.
 But not that during fifty years all the princes have exerted
 themselves for it in vain, and that it required such a pressing need
 to obtain it
 
 
 If by differing we condemned, you would be right. Uniformity without
 diversity is useless to others, diversity without uniformity is
 ruinous for us. The one injures us without; the other within.
 
 
 We ought to hear both parties, and on this point I have been careful.
 
 When we have heard only one party we are always on that side, but
 the adverse party makes us change, whereas in this case the Jesuit
 confirms us.
 
 Not what they do, but what they say.
 
 They cry out against me only. I am content I know whom to blame for
 it.
 
 Jesus Christ was a stone of stumbling.
 
 Condemnable, condemned.
 
 
 Jesus Christ never condemned without a bearing. To Judas: _Amice, ad
 quid venisti_? To him who had not on the wedding garment, the same.
 
 
 Unless they give up probability their good maxims are as little holy
 as the bad. For they are founded on human authority, and thus if they
 are more just they will be more reasonable, but not more holy, they
 take after the wild stock on which they are graffed.
 
 If what I say serves not to enlighten you, it will aid the
 people.--If these hold their peace, the stones will cry out.
 
 Silence is the greatest persecution; the saints never held their
 peace. It is true that a vocation is needed, it is not from the
 decrees of the Council that we must learn whether we are called, but
 from the compulsion to speak. Now after Rome has spoken, and we
 think that she has condemned the truth, and they have written it,
 and the books which have said the contrary are censured; we must cry
 so much the louder the more unjustly we are censured, and the more
 violently they try to stifle speech, until there come a pope who
 listens to both sides, and who consults antiquity to do justice.
 
 So good popes will find the Church still in an uproar.
 
 The Inquisition and the Society are the two scourges of the truth.
 
 Why do you not accuse them of Arianism? For if they have said that
 Jesus Christ is God, perhaps it is not with a natural meaning, but as
 it is said: _Dii estis_.
 
 If my Letters are condemned at Rome, what I condemn in them is
 condemned in heaven.
 
 _Ad tuum, Domine Jesu, tribunal appello._
 
 You are yourselves corruptible.
 
 I feared that I had written ill when I saw myself condemned, but the
 example of so many pious writings makes me believe the contrary.
 Good writing is no longer permitted, so corrupt or ignorant is the
 Inquisition.
 
 It is better to obey God than men.
 
 I have neither fear nor hope. Not so the bishops. Port Royal fears,
 and it is a bad policy to dissolve the community, for they will fear
 no longer and will inspire greater fear.
 
 I fear not even your censures, ... if they be not founded on those of
 tradition.
 
 Do you censure all? What, even my respect?--No.--Say then, what it
 is, or you will do nothing, since you do not point out the evil, and
 why it is evil. And this is what they will have some trouble to do.
 
 
 Unjust persecutors of those whom God visibly protects.
 
 If they reproach you with your excesses they speak as do the heretics.
 
 If they say that the grace of Jesus Christ separates us, they are
 heretics.
 
 If miracles are wrought, it is the mark of their heresy.
 
 Ezekiel,
 
 They say, these are the people of God who thus speak.
 
 Hezekiah,
 
 My reverend father, all this was done in figures. Other religions
 perish, this one perishes not.
 
 Miracles are more important than you think, they have served for the
 foundation, and will serve for the continuance of the Church till the
 coming of Antichrist, till the end.
 
 The two witnesses.
 
 In the Old Testament and the New, miracles are wrought in connection
 with types. Salvation or an useless thing, if not to show that we
 must submit to the creature.--Figure of the sacraments.
 
 The synagogue was a figure and so it perished not, and it was only
 the figure and so it has perished. It was a figure which contained
 the truth, and so it subsisted till it contained the truth no longer.
 
 
 The exaggerated notion which you have of the importance of your
 society has made you establish these horrible ways. It is very plain
 that it has made you follow the way of slander, since you blame in
 me as horrible the same impostures which you excuse in yourselves,
 because you regard me as a private person, and yourselves as _imago_.
 
 It plainly appears that your praises are follies, by those which are
 crazy, as the privilege of the uncondemned.
 
 Is this giving courage to your children to condemn them when they
 serve the Church?
 
 It is an artifice of the devil to turn in another direction the arms
 with which these people used to combat heresies.
 
 You are bad politicians.
 
 The history of the man born blind.
 
 What says Saint Paul? Does he constantly speak of the bearing of
 prophecies? No, but of his miracles.
 
 What says Jesus Christ? Does he expound the bearing of the
 prophecies? No, his death had not fulfilled them; but he says, si non
 fecissem: believe the works.
 
 _Si non fecissem quæ alius non fecit._
 
 These wretches who have obliged us to speak of miracles!
 
 Abraham and Gideon confirmed faith by miracles.
 
 There are two supernatural foundations of our wholly supernatural
 Religion, the one visible, the other invisible.
 
 Miracles with grace, miracles without grace.
 
 The synagogue, which has been treated with love as a figure of the
 Church, and with hatred because it was only the figure, has been
 restored, being about to fall when it was well with God, and thus a
 figure.
 
 The miracles prove the power which God has over hearts by that which
 he exercises over the body.
 
 The Church has never approved a miracle among heretics.
 
 Miracles are a support of religion. They have been the test of Jews,
 of Christians, of saints, of innocents, and of true believers.
 
 
 A miracle among schismatics is not much to be feared, for schism
 which is more evident than miracle, evidently marks their error; but
 when there is no schism, and error is in question, miracle is the
 test.
 
 Judith. God speaks at length in their extreme oppression.
 
 If because charity has grown cold the Church is left almost without
 true worshippers, miracles will raise them up.
 
 This is one of the last effects of grace.
 
 If only a miracle were wrought among the Jesuits!
 
 When a miracle deceives the expectation of those in whose presence
 it occurs, and when there is a disproportion between the state of
 their faith and the instrument of the miracle it must lead them to
 change; but with you it is the opposite. There would be as much
 reason in saying that if the Eucharist raised a dead man one ought
 to turn Calvinist rather than remain a Catholic. But when he crowns
 the expectation, and those who have hoped that God would bless the
 remedies see themselves cured without remedies....
 
 _The wicked._--No sign was ever given on the part of the devil
 without a stronger sign on the part of God, at least unless it were
 foretold that this would be so.
 
 
 These nuns, amazed at what is said, that they are in the way of
 perdition, that their confessors are leading them to Geneva, and
 teach them Jesus Christ is not in the Eucharist, nor on the right
 hand of the Father, know all this to be false, and offer then
 themselves to God in that state. _Vide si via iniquitatis in me est._
 What happens thereupon? The place, which is said to be the temple of
 the devil, God makes his own temple. It is said that the children
 must be taken away, God heals them there. It is said to be hell's
 arsenal, God makes of it the sanctuary of his graces. Lastly, they
 are threatened with all the furies and all the vengeance of heaven,
 and God loads them with favours. Those must have lost their senses,
 who therefore believe them in the way of perdition.--_We have,
 without doubt, the same tokens as Saint Athanasius._--
 
 The five propositions were equivocal; they are so no longer.
 
 
 With so many other signs of piety they have that of persecution also,
 which is the best mark of piety.
 
 
 By showing the truth we gain belief for it, but by showing the
 injustice of ministers, we do not correct it. Conscience is made
 secure by a demonstration of falsehood; our purse is not made secure
 by the demonstration of injustice.
 
 Miracles and truth are both needful, as we have to convince the whole
 man, body and soul alike.
 
 
 It is good that their deeds should be unjust, for fear it should not
 appear that the Molinists have acted justly. Thus there is no need to
 spare them, they are worthy to commit them.
 
 
 _The Church, the Pope._--Unity, plurality. Considering the Church as
 unity, the pope its head, is as the whole; considered as plurality,
 the pope is only a part of it. The Fathers have considered the Church
 now in this way, now in that, and thus they have spoken in divers
 ways of the pope.
 
 Saint Cyprian, _sacerdos Dei_.
 
 But in establishing one of these two truths, they have not excluded
 the other.
 
 Plurality which cannot be reduced to unity is confusion. Unity which
 depends not on plurality is tyranny.
 
 There is scarce any where left but France in which it is allowable to
 say that a council is below the pope.
 
 We may not judge of what the pope is by some words of the Fathers--as
 the Greeks said in a council, important rules--but by the acts of the
 Church and the Fathers, and by the canons.
 
 Unity and plurality: _Duo aut tres in unum_. It is an error to
 exclude one of the two, as the papists do who exclude plurality, or
 the Huguenots who exclude unity.
 
 
 The pope is chief, who else is known of all, who else is recognised
 by all? Having power to insinuate himself into all the body, because
 he holds the leading shoot, which extends itself everywhere.
 
 How easy to cause this to degenerate into tyranny. This is why Jesus
 Christ has laid down for them this precept: _Vos autem non sic_.
 
 
 God works not miracles in the ordinary conduct of his Church. It
 would be a strange miracle, did infallibility reside in one, but that
 it should dwell in a multitude appears so natural that the ways of
 God are concealed under nature, as all his other works.
 
 
 Men desire certainty, they like the pope to be infallible in faith,
 grave doctors to be infallible in morals, in order to have certainty.
 
 
 The pope hates and fears men of science, who are not at once
 submissive to him.
 
 
 Kings are masters of their own power, not so the popes.
 
 
 Whenever the Jesuits take the pope unawares, they will make all
 Christendom perjured.
 
 It is very easy to take the pope unawares, because of his
 occupations, and the trust which he has in the Jesuits, and the
 Jesuits are very capable of taking him unawares by means of calumny.
 
 
 The five propositions condemned, yet no miracle, for truth was not
 attacked, but the Sorbonne and the bull.
 
 It is impossible that those who love God with all their heart, should
 misunderstand the Church, which is so evident.
 
 It is impossible that those who love not God should be convinced of
 the Church.
 
 
 Let us look to the discourses on the 2nd, 4th, and 5th of the
 Jansenist. They are lofty and grave.
 
 We would not make a friend of either.
 
 The ear only is consulted because the heart is wanting.
 
 Beauty of omission, of judgment.
 
 The rule is that of honourable conduct.
 
 Poet and not honourable man.
 
 
 These men want heart.
 
 We would not make a friend of him.
 
 For this name of honourable man.
 
 
 _Canonical._--The heretical books in the early age of the Church
 serve to prove the canonical.
 
 
 _Heretics._--Ezekiel. All the heathens spake evil of Israel, and the
 Prophet did the same, yet the Israelites were so far from having a
 right to say to him, "You speak as the heathen," that he made it his
 strongest point that the heathens said the same as he.
 
 
 Those are feeble souls who know the truth, and uphold it only so far
 as their interest is concerned, but beyond that abandon it.
 
 
 Annat. He makes the disciple without ignorance, and the master
 without presumption.
 
 
 There is such great disproportion between the merit which he thinks
 he has and his stupidity, that it is hard to believe he mistakes
 himself so completely.
 
 
 And will this one scorn the other?
 
 Who should scorn? Yet he scorns not the other, but pities him.
 
 
 Port Royal is surely as good as Voltigerod.
 
 So far as your proceeding is just according to this bias, so far is
 it unjust on the side of Christian piety.
 
 
 _Montalte._--Lax opinions are so pleasing to men, that it is strange
 that theirs displease. It is because they have exceeded all bounds;
 and more, there are many persons who see the truth, yet cannot attain
 to it; but there are few who do not know that the purity of religion
 is contrary to our corruptions. It is absurd to say that eternal
 reward is offered to the morals of Escobar.
 
 
 But is it _probable_ that _probability_ gives certainty?--Difference
 between rest and security of conscience. Nothing but truth gives
 certainty. Nothing gives rest but a sincere search after truth.
 
 
 _Probability._ They have oddly explained certainty, for after having
 established that all their ways are sure, they no longer call that
 sure which leads to heaven without danger of not arriving thereby,
 but that which leads there without danger of going out of the road.
 
 
 Now probability is necessary for the other maxims, as for that of the
 friend and the slanderer.
 
 _A fructibus eorum_, judge of their faith by their morals.
 
 Probability is little without corrupt means, and means are nothing
 without probability.
 
 There is pleasure in being able to do good, and in knowing how to do
 good, _scire et posse_. Grace and probability give this pleasure, for
 we can render our account to God in reliance upon their authors.
 
 
 _Probability._
 
 Everyone can impose it, none can take it away.
 
 
 _Probable._--If as bad reasons as these are probable, all would be so.
 
 1. Reason. _Dominus actuum conjugalium._ Molina.
 
 2. Reason. _Non potest compensari._ Lessius.
 
 To oppose not with holy, but with abominable maxims.
 
 They reason as those who prove that it is night at midday.
 
 Bauny, the burner of barns.
 
 ... The Council of Trent for priests in mortal sin: _quam primum_....
 
 
 _Probable._--Let us see if we seek God sincerely, by the comparison
 of things we love.
 
 It is probable that this meat will not poison me.
 
 It is probable that I shall not lose my law suit if I do not bring it.
 
 If it were true that grave authors and reasons would suffice, I say
 that they are neither grave nor reasonable. What! a husband may
 make profit of his wife according to Molina. Is the reason he gives
 reasonable, and the contrary one of Lessius reasonable also?
 
 Would you dare thus to trifle with the edicts of the King, as by
 saying that to go for a walk in a field and wait for a man is not to
 fight a duel;
 
 That the Church has indeed forbidden duelling, but not taking a walk?
 
 And usury too, but not....
 
 And simony, but not....
 
 And vengeance, but not....
 
 And unnatural crime, but not....
 
 And _quam primum_, but not....
 
 
 Take away _probability_, and you can no longer please the world, give
 _probability_, and you can no longer displease it.
 
 
 _Universal._--Morals and language are special but universal sciences.
 
 _Probability._--The zeal of the saints to seek the truth, was useless
 if the probable is certain.
 
 The fear of the saints who have always followed the surest way.
 
 Saint Theresa having always followed her confessor.
 
 
 _Probability._--They have some true principles, but they abuse them.
 Now the abuse of truth should be as much punished as the introduction
 of falsehood.
 
 As if there were two hells, one for sins against charity, the other
 for sins against justice.
 
 
 Men who do not keep their word, without faith, without honour,
 without truth, double hearted, double tongued, like the reproach once
 flung at that amphibious creature in the fable, who kept itself in a
 doubtful position between the fish and the birds.
 
 It is of importance to kings and princes to be supposed pious, and
 therefore they must take you for their confessors.
 
 
 _State super vias et interrogate de semitis antiquis, et ambulate
 in eis. Et dixerunt: Non ambulabimus, sed post cogitationem nostram
 ibimus._ They have said to the nations: Come to us, we will follow
 the opinions of the new authors, reason shall be our guide, we
 will be as the other nations who follow each their natural light.
 Philosophers have....
 
 All religions and sects in the world have had natural reason for a
 guide. Christians alone have been obliged to take their rules from
 without themselves, and to acquaint themselves with those which Jesus
 Christ left to men of old time to be transmitted to the faithful.
 This constraint is wearisome to these good fathers. They desire like
 the rest of the world to have liberty to follow their imaginations.
 In vain we cry to them, as the prophets to the Jews of old: "Enter
 into the Church, enquire of the ways which men of old have left to
 her, and follow those paths." They have answered, as did the Jews,
 "We will not walk in them, but we will follow the thoughts of our
 hearts;" and they have said, "We will be as the nations round about
 us."
 
 
 Can it be any thing but the desire to please the world which makes
 you find things probable? Will you make us believe that it is truth,
 and that if duelling were not the fashion, you would find it probable
 they might fight, looking at the matter in itself?
 
 
 The whole society of their casuists cannot give assurance to a
 conscience in error, and therefore it is important to choose safe
 guides.
 
 Thus they will be doubly guilty, both in having followed ways which
 they should not follow, and in having hearkened to teachers to whom
 they should not hearken.
 
 
 Casuists submit the decision to corrupt reason, and the choice of
 decisions to corrupt will, so that all that is corrupt in the nature
 of man may help to rule his conduct.
 
 
 They allow lust free play, and restrict scruples, whereas they should
 do the exact contrary.
 
 
 Must we slay in order that the wicked may cease to be? This is
 to make two wicked instead of one. _Vince in bono malum._ Saint
 Augustine.
 
 
 The servant does not know what the master does, for the master tells
 him only the act and not the purpose; this is why he is so often
 slavishly obedient and often sins against the purpose. But Jesus
 Christ tells us the purpose.
 
 And you destroy this purpose.
 
 
 Art thou less a slave because thy master loves and caresses thee?
 Thou art indeed well off, slave. Thy master caresses thee, he will
 presently beat thee.
 
 
 Those who wrote thus in Latin speak in French.
 
 The evil having been done of patting these things in French, we ought
 to do the good of condemning them.
 
 There is one only heresy, which is differently explained in the
 schools and in the world.
 
 
 _On confessions and absolutions without signs of regret._ God looks
 at the heart alone, the Church looks at outward actions; God absolves
 as soon as he sees penitence in the heart, the Church when she
 sees it in works. God will make a Church pure within, which puts
 to confusion by its interior and perfect spiritual holiness the
 interior impiety of proud philosophers and Pharisees, and the Church
 will make an assembly of men whose external morals are so pure that
 they put to confusion heathen morals. If some are hypocrites, but so
 well disguised that she does not recognise their venom, she bears
 with them, for though they are not accepted of God, whom they cannot
 deceive, they are of men, whom they deceive. And thus she is not
 dishonoured by their conduct which appears holy. But you will have it
 that the Church should judge neither of the heart, for that belongs
 to God alone, nor of works, because God looks at the heart alone; and
 so taking away from her all choice of men, you retain in the Church
 the most debauched and those who so greatly dishonour her, that the
 synagogues of the Jews and the sects of the philosophers would have
 cast them out as unworthy, and have abhorred them as impious.
 
 
 God has not willed to absolve without the Church. As she has part
 in the offence he wills that she should have part in the pardon. He
 associates her with this power as kings their parliaments; but if she
 binds or looses without God, she is no more the Church, as in the
 case of parliament. For even if the king have pardoned a man, it is
 necessary that it should be ratified; but if the parliament ratifies
 without the king, or refuses to ratify on the order of the king, it
 is no more the parliament of the king, but a revolutionary body.
 
 
 The Church teaches and God inspires, both infallibly. The operation
 of the Church serves only to prepare for grace or for condemnation.
 What it does suffices for condemnation, not for inspiration.
 
 The Church has in vain established these words, anathema, heresies.
 They are used against herself.
 
 
 It is not absolution only which remits sins by the Sacrament of
 Penance, but contrition, which is not a true contrition if it does
 not frequent the sacrament.
 
 Thus, again, it is not the nuptial benediction which hinders sin in
 generation, but the desire of begetting children for God, which is no
 true desire except in marriage.
 
 And as a contrite man without the sacrament is more disposed for
 absolution than an impenitent man with the sacrament, so the
 daughters of Lot, for instance, who had only the desire for children,
 were more pure without marriage than married persons without desire
 for children.
 
 
 _Casuists._--Much almsgiving, reasonable penance; even when we cannot
 assign what is just, we see plainly what is not. It is strange that
 casuists believe they can interpret this as they do.
 
 People who accustom themselves to speak ill and to think ill.
 
 Their great number, far from marking their perfection, marks the
 contrary.
 
 The humility of one makes the pride of many.
 
 
 They make a rule of the exception. If the ancient fathers gave
 absolution before penance; do this only as an exception. But of the
 exception you make a rule without exception, so that you will not
 even have it that the rule is exceptional.
 
 
 Priest still who will, as under Jeroboam.
 
 It is a horrible thing that they submit to us the discipline of the
 Church in our days as so excellent that it is made a crime to wish to
 change it Formerly it was infallibly good, and it was found it might
 be changed without sin, and now, such as it is, we ought not to wish
 it changed!
 
 It has indeed been allowed to change the custom of not making priests
 save with such great circumspection, that there were scarcely any
 who were worthy, yet we are not allowed to complain of the custom
 which makes so many who are unworthy.
 
 
 Two sorts of people place things on the same level, as feasts and
 working days, Christians and priests, all sins among themselves, etc.
 Therefore the one set conclude that what is bad for priests is so
 for Christians, and the other that what is not bad for Christians is
 permissible for priests.
 
 
 The Jansenists are like the heretics in the reformation of their
 morals, but you are like them in evil.
 
 
 Superstition to believe propositions, etc.
 
 Faith, etc.
 
 
 If Saint Augustine came at this day, and was as little authorised as
 his defenders, he would do nothing. God governs his Church well, in
 that he sent him before with authority.
 
 
 Grace is needed to make a man into a saint, and if any man doubt this
 he knows not what is a saint, nor what is a man.
 
 
 The motions of grace, hardness of heart, external circumstances.
 
 
 Grace will ever be in the world, and nature also, so that grace is
 in some sort natural. Thus there will be always Pelagians, always
 Catholics, always strife.
 
 Because the first birth constitutes the one, and the grace of
 regeneration the other.
 
 
 It will be one of the confusions of the damned to see themselves
 condemned by their own reason, by which they have thought to condemn
 the Christian religion.
 
 
 When it is said that Jesus Christ died not for all, you take
 advantage of a defect inherent in men who immediately apply this
 exception to themselves, which is to favour despair instead of
 turning men from it to favour hope. For so we accustom ourselves to
 interior virtues by exterior customs.
 
 
 There is heresy in always explaining omnes by 'all,' and heresy in
 not explaining it sometimes by 'all.' _Bibite ex hoc omnes_, the
 Huguenots are heretics in explaining it by 'all.' _In quo omnes
 peccaverunt_, the Huguenots are heretics in excepting the children of
 the faithful. We must then follow the Fathers and tradition to know
 when to do so, since there is heresy to be feared on one side or the
 other.
 
 
 _A point of form._--When Saint Peter and the apostles consulted about
 the abolition of circumcision, when it was a question of acting in
 contradiction to the law of God, they did not consult the prophets,
 but considered simply the reception of the Holy Spirit in the persons
 uncircumcised. They judged it more certain that God approved those
 whom he filled with his spirit, than it was that the law must be
 observed.
 
 They knew that the end of the Law was none other than the Holy
 Spirit, and thus as men certainly had this without circumcision,
 circumcision was not needful.
 
 
 But to preserve pre-eminence to himself he gives prayer to whom he
 pleases.
 
 Why God has established prayer.
 
 1. To communicate to his creatures the dignity of causality.
 
 2. To teach us from whom our virtue comes.
 
 3. To make us deserve other virtues by work.
 
 _Objection._ But we believe that prayer comes from ourselves.
 
 This is absurd, for since before we have faith, we cannot have
 virtues, how should we have faith? Is there a greater distance
 between infidelity and faith than between faith and virtue?
 
 _Merit._ This word is ambiguous.
 
 _Meruit habere Redemptorem._
 
 _Meruit tam sacra membra tangere._
 
 _Digna tam sacra membra tangere._
 
 _Non sum dignus, qui manducat indignus._
 
 _Dignus est accipere._
 
 _Dignare me._
 
 God is only bound according to his promises.
 
 He has promised to do justice to prayer, he has never promised prayer
 only to the children of promise.
 
 
 _Si_ does not mark indifference. Malachi, Isaiah.
 
 Isaiah. _Si volumus_, etc.
 
 _In quacumque die._
 
 
 _Ne timeas, pusillus grex. Timore et tretmore.--Quid ergo? Ne timeas,
 modo timeas._
 
 Fear not, provided you fear, but if you fear not, then fear.
 
 _Qui me recipit, non me recipit, sed eum qui me misit._
 
 _Nemo scit neque Filius._
 
 _Nubes lucida obumbravit._
 
 Saint John was to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and
 Jesus Christ was to sow division. In this there is no contradiction.
 
 
 The effects _in communi_ and _in particulari_. The semi-Pelagians err
 in saying of _in communi_ what is true only _in particulari_, and the
 Calvinists in saying _in particulari_ what is true _in communi_. So
 it seems to me.
 
 
 Saint Augustine has said expressly that power would be taken away
 from the righteous. But it is by chance that he said it, for it
 might have been that the chance of saying it did not occur. But
 his principles make us see that when the occasion for it presented
 itself, it was impossible he should not say so, or that he should say
 anything to the contrary. It is then rather that he was forced to
 say it, when the occasion offered itself, than that he said it, the
 occasion having offered itself, the one being of necessity, the other
 of chance. But the two are all that we could ask.
 
 
 _The end_. Are we certain? Is this principle certain? Let us examine.
 
 
 The testimony of a man's self is naught Saint Thomas.
 
 
 The image alone of all these mysteries has been openly showed to the
 Jews and by Saint John the forerunner, and then the other mysteries,
 to mark that in each man as in the world at large this order must be
 observed.
 
 
 It is, in technical language, _wholly_ the body of Jesus Christ, but
 it cannot be said to be the _whole_ body of Jesus Christ.
 
 The union of two things without change cannot enable us to say that
 one becomes the other.
 
 Thus the soul is united to the body, the fire to the fuel, without
 change.
 
 But change is necessary to make the form of the one become the form
 of the other.
 
 Thus the union of the Word to man.
 
 Because my body without my soul would not make the body of a man,
 then my soul united to any matter whatsoever would make my body.
 
 It distinguishes for me the necessary condition with a sufficient
 condition, the union is necessary, but not sufficient.
 
 The left arm is not the right.
 
 Impenetrability is a property of matter.
 
 Identity of number in regard to the same time requires the identity
 of matter.
 
 Thus if God united my soul to a body in China, the same body, _idem
 numero_ would be in China.
 
 The same river which runs there is _idem numero_ as that which runs
 at the same time in China.
 
 
 
 
 _THOUGHTS ON STYLE._
 
 
 Eloquence is an art of saying things in such a manner, 1, that those
 to whom we speak can hear them without pain, and with pleasure; 2,
 that they feel themselves interested, so that self-love leads them
 more willingly to reflect upon what is said. It consists therefore
 in a correspondence which we endeavour to establish between the mind
 and the heart of those to whom we speak on the one hand, and, on the
 other, the thoughts and the expressions employed; this supposes that
 we have thoroughly studied the heart of man so as to know all its
 springs, and to find at last the true proportions of the discourse we
 wish to suit to it. We should put ourselves in the place of those who
 are to listen to us, and make experiment on our own heart of the turn
 we give to our discourse, to see whether one is made for the other,
 and whether we can be sure that our auditor will be as it were forced
 to yield. So far as possible we must confine ourselves to what is
 natural and simple, not aggrandise that which is little, or belittle
 that which is great. It is not enough that a phrase be beautiful, it
 must be fitted to the subject, and not have in it excess or defect.
 
 
 Eloquence is painted thought, and thus those who, after having
 painted it, add somewhat more, make a picture, not a portrait.
 
 
 _Eloquence._--We need both what is pleasing and what is real, but
 that which pleases must itself be drawn from the true.
 
 
 Eloquence, which persuades by gentleness, not by empire, as a tyrant,
 not as a king.
 
 
 There is a certain pattern of charm and beauty which consists in a
 certain relation between our nature, such as it is, whether weak or
 strong, and the thing which pleases us.
 
 Whatever is formed on this pattern delights us, whether house, song,
 discourse, verse, prose, woman, birds, rivers, trees, rooms, dresses,
 etc.
 
 Whatever is not made on this pattern displeases those who have good
 taste.
 
 And as there is a perfect relation between a song and a house which
 are made on a good pattern, because they are like this unique
 pattern, though each after its kind, there is also a perfect relation
 between things made on a bad pattern. Not that the bad is unique, for
 there are many; but every bad sonnet, for instance, on whatever false
 pattern it is constructed, is exactly like a woman dressed on that
 pattern.
 
 Nothing makes us understand better the absurdity of a false sonnet
 than to consider nature and the pattern, and then to imagine a woman
 or a house constructed on that pattern.
 
 
 When a natural discourse paints a passion or an effect, we feel in
 our mind the truth of what we read, which was there before, though we
 did not know it, and we are inclined to love him who makes us feel
 it. For he has not made a display of his own riches, but of ours, and
 thus this benefit renders him pleasant to us, besides that such a
 community of intellect necessarily inclines the heart to love.
 
 
 All the false beauties which we blame in Cicero have their admirers
 and in great number.
 
 
 The last thing we decide on in writing a book is what shall be the
 first we put in it.
 
 
 _Language._--We ought not to turn the mind from one thing to another
 save for relaxation, at suitable times, and no other, for he that
 diverts out of season wearies, and he who wearies us out of season
 repels us, and we simply turn away. So much it pleases our wayward
 lust to do the exact contrary of what those seek to obtain from us
 who give us no pleasure, the coin for which we will do whatever we
 are asked.
 
 
 When we meet with a natural style, we are charmed and astonished, for
 we looked for an author, and we found a man. But those who have good
 taste, and who seeing a book expect to find a man, are altogether
 surprised to find an author: _plus poetice quam humane locatus es_.
 Those pay great honour to nature, who show her that she is able to
 discourse on all things, even on theology.
 
 
 Languages are ciphers, where letters are not changed into letters,
 but words into words, so that an unknown language can be deciphered.
 
 
 When in a discourse we find words repeated, and in trying to
 correct them find we cannot change them for others without manifest
 disadvantage, we must let them stand, for this is the true test;
 our criticism came of envy which is blind, and does not see that
 repetition is not in this place a fault, for there is no general rule.
 
 
 _Miscellaneous. Language._--Those who force words for the sake of
 antitheses are like those who make false windows for symmetry.
 
 Their rule is not to speak accurately, but in accurate form.
 
 
 To put a mask on nature and disguise her. No more King, pope, bishop,
 but _sacred majesty_, no more Paris, but _the capital of the Kingdom_.
 
 There are places in which we should call Paris, Paris, and others in
 which we ought to call it the capital of the Kingdom.
 
 
 There are those who speak well and write ill. Because the place and
 the audience warm them, and draw from their minds more than would
 have been produced without that warmth.
 
 
 _Miscellaneous._--A figure of speech, "I should have wished to apply
 myself to that."
 
 
 The _aperitive_ virtue of a key, the _attractive_ virtue of a crook.
 
 
 To guess. _The part that I take in your sorrow._ The Cardinal did not
 choose to be guessed.
 
 _My mind is disquieted within me._ I am disquieted is better.
 
 
 _To extinguish the torch of sedition_, too luxuriant.
 
 _The restlessness of his genius._ Two striking words too much.
 
 
 A coach _upset_ or _overturned_, according to the meaning.
 
 _Spread abroad_, or _upset_, according to the meaning.
 
 The argument by force of M. le M. over the friar.
 
 
 Symmetry.
 
 Is what we see at one glance.
 
 Founded on the fact that there is no reason for any difference.
 
 And founded also on the face of man.
 
 Whence it comes that symmetry is only wanted in breadth, not in
 height or depth.
 
 
 Sceptic, for obstinate.
 
 Descartes useless and uncertain.
 
 No one calls another a courtier but he who is not one himself, a
 pedant save a pedant, a provincial but a provincial, and I would
 wager it was the printer who put it on the title of _Letters to a
 Provincial_.
 
 
 The chief talent, that which rules all others.
 
 
 If the lightning were to strike low-lying places, etc., poets, and
 those whose only reasonings are on things of that nature would lack
 proofs.
 
 
 _Poetical beauty._--As we talk of poetical beauty, so ought we to
 talk of mathematical beauty and medical beauty; yet we do not use
 those terms, because we know perfectly the object of mathematics,
 that it consists in proofs, and the object of medicine, that it
 consists in healing, but we do not understand wherein consists charm
 which is the object of poetry. We do not know what is the natural
 model to be imitated, and for want of that knowledge we invent a set
 of extravagant terms, "_the golden age_, _the wonder of our times_,
 _fatal_," etc., and fall this jargon poetic beauty.
 
 But if we imagine a woman on that pattern, which consists in saying
 little things in great words, we shall see a pretty girl bedecked
 with mirrors and chains absurd to our taste, because we know better
 wherein consists the charm of woman than the charm of verse. But
 those who do not know, would admire her in such trimmings, and in
 many villages she would be taken for the queen, wherefore sonnets
 made on such a pattern have been called _The Village Queens_.
 
 
 Those who judge of a work without rule are in regard to others as
 those who possess a watch are in regard to others. One says, "it was
 two hours ago," another, "it is only three-quarters of an hour." I
 look at my watch and say to the one, "you are weary of us," and to
 the other, "time flies fast with you, for it is only an hour and
 a half." And I laugh at those who say that time goes slowly with
 me, and that I judge by fancy. They do not know that I judge by my
 watch.
 
 
 
 
 _VARIOUS THOUGHTS._
 
 
 _Mathematics, Tact._--True eloquence makes light of eloquence, true
 morality makes light of morality, that is to say, the morality of the
 judgment makes light of the morality of the intellect, which has no
 rules.
 
 For perception belongs to judgment, as science belongs to the
 intellect. Tact is the part of judgment, mathematics of the intellect.
 
 To make light of philosophy is to be a true philosopher.
 
 The nourishment of the body is little by little, too much nourishment
 gives little substance.
 
 
 There is an universal and essential difference between the actions of
 the will and all others.
 
 The will is one of the principal organs of belief, not that it forms
 belief, but because things are true or false according to the side
 from which we regard them. The will, pleased with one rather than the
 other, turns the mind from the consideration of that which has the
 qualities it cares not to see, and thus the intellect, moving with
 the will, stays to regard the side it loves, and thus judges by what
 it sees.
 
 
 The heart has its reasons, which reason knows not, as we feel in a
 thousand instances. I say that the heart loves the universal Being
 naturally, and itself naturally, according as it gives itself to
 each, and it hardens itself against one or the other at its own will.
 You have rejected one and kept the other, does reason cause your love?
 
 It is the heart which is conscious of God, not the reason. This then
 is faith; God sensible to the heart, not to the reason.
 
 
 Reason acts slowly and with so many views, on so many principles,
 which it ought always to keep before it, that it constantly slumbers
 and goes astray, from not having its principles at hand. The heart
 does not act thus, it acts in a moment, and is always ready to act.
 We must then place our faith in the heart, or it will be always
 vacillating.
 
 
 Men often mistake their imagination for their heart, and they believe
 they are converted as soon as they think of being converted.
 
 
 Those who are accustomed to judge by the heart do not understand
 the process of reasoning, for they wish to understand at a glance,
 and are not accustomed to seek for principles. And others on the
 contrary, who are accustomed to reason by principles, do not at all
 understand the things of the heart, seeking principles and not being
 able to see at a glance.
 
 
 If we wished to prove those examples by which we prove other things,
 we should have to take those other things to be examples. For as we
 always believe the difficulty is in the matter we wish to prove, we
 find the examples clearer and aids to demonstration.
 
 Thus when we wish to demonstrate a general proposition, we must
 give the rule special to a case, but if we wish to demonstrate a
 particular case, we must begin with the particular rule. For we
 always find the thing obscure which we wish to prove, and that clear
 which we employ as proof; for when a matter is proposed for proof
 we first fill ourselves with the imagination that it is therefore
 obscure, and on the contrary that what is to prove it is clear, and
 so we understand with ease.
 
 
 Far from believing a thing because you have heard it, you ought to
 believe nothing without having put yourself in the same position as
 if you had never heard it.
 
 What should make you believe is your own assent to yourself, and the
 constant voice of your reason, not that of others.
 
 Belief is so important!
 
 A hundred contradictions might be true.
 
 If antiquity were the rule of faith then the men of old time had no
 rule. If general consent, if men had perished....
 
 False humility is pride.
 
 Lift the curtain.
 
 You may try as you please. You must either believe, or deny, or doubt.
 
 Have we then no rule?
 
 We judge that animals do well what they do. Is there no rule whereby
 to judge men?
 
 To deny, to believe, and to doubt well are to a man what paces are to
 a horse.
 
 
 Memory is necessary for every operation of the reason.
 
 
 Memory and joy are feelings, and even mathematical propositions
 become so, for reason makes what is felt natural, and natural
 feelings are effaced by reason.
 
 
 All our reasoning is reduced to yielding to feeling.
 
 But fancy is like yet contrary to feeling, so that we cannot
 distinguish between these contraries. One man says that my feeling is
 fancy, another that his fancy is feeling. We must have a rule. Reason
 offers herself, but she is pliable in all directions, and so there is
 no rule.
 
 
 Reason commands us much more imperiously than a master, for in
 disobeying the one we are unhappy, and in disobeying the other we are
 fools.
 
 
 When we are accustomed to use bad reasons for proving natural
 effects, we do not wish to receive good reasons even when they are
 discovered. An example may be taken from the circulation of the
 blood, to give a reason why the vein swells below the ligature.
 
 
 We are usually better persuaded by reasons which we have ourselves
 discovered, than by those which have come into the mind of others.
 
 
 M. de Roannez said: "Reasons come afterwards, but at first a thing
 pleases or shocks me, without my knowing the reason, and yet it
 displeased me for the reason which I only discover later." But I
 believe, not that he was displeased for those reasons which he
 afterwards discovered, but that those reasons were only discovered
 because the thing was displeasing.
 
 
 _The difference between the mathematical mind and the practical
 mind._--In the one the premisses are palpable, but removed from
 ordinary use, so that from want of habit it is difficult to look in
 that direction, but if we take the trouble to look, the premisses are
 fully visible, and we must have a totally incorrect mind if we draw
 wrong inferences from premisses so plain that it is scarce possible
 they should escape our notice.
 
 But in the practical mind the premisses are taken from use and wont,
 and are before the eyes of every body. We have only to look that way,
 there is no difficulty in seeing them; it is only a question of good
 eyesight, but it must be good, for the premisses are so numerous and
 so subtle, that it is scarce possible but that some escape us. Now
 the omission of one premiss leads to error, thus we must have very
 clear sight to see all the premisses, and then an accurate mind not
 to draw false conclusions from known premisses.
 
 All mathematicians would then be practical if they were
 clear-sighted, for they do not reason incorrectly on premisses known
 to them. And practical men would be mathematicians if they could
 turn their eyes to the premisses of mathematics to which they are
 unaccustomed.
 
 The reason therefore that some practical men are not mathematical
 is that they cannot at all turn their attention to mathematical
 premisses. But the reason that mathematicians are not practical is
 that they do not see what is before them, and that, accustomed to
 the precise and distinct statements of mathematics and not reasoning
 till they have well examined and arranged their premisses, they are
 lost in practical life wherein the premisses do not admit of such
 arrangement, being scarcely seen, indeed they are felt rather than
 seen, and there is great difficulty in causing them to be felt by
 those who do not of themselves perceive them. They are so nice and
 so numerous, that a very delicate and very clear sense is needed
 to apprehend them, and to judge rightly and justly when they are
 apprehended, without as a rule being able to demonstrate them in an
 orderly way as in mathematics; because the premisses are not before
 us in the same way, and because it would be an infinite matter to
 undertake. We must see them at once, at one glance, and not by
 process of reasoning, at least up to a certain degree. And thus it
 is rare that mathematicians are practical, or that practical men
 are mathematicians, because mathematicians wish to treat practical
 life mathematically; and they make themselves ridiculous, wishing to
 begin by definitions and premisses, a proceeding which this way of
 reasoning will not bear. The mind does indeed the same thing, but
 tacitly, naturally and without art, in a way which none can express,
 and only a few can feel.
 
 Practical minds on the contrary, being thus accustomed to judge at a
 glance, are amazed when propositions are presented to them of which
 they understand nothing and the way to which is through sterile
 definitions and premisses, which they are not accustomed to see thus
 in detail, and therefore are repelled and disheartened.
 
 But inaccurate minds are never either practical or mathematical.
 Mathematicians who are only mathematicians have exact minds, provided
 all things are clearly set before them in definitions and premisses,
 otherwise they are inaccurate and intolerable, for they are only
 accurate when the premisses are perfectly clear.
 
 And practical men, who are only practical, cannot have the patience
 to condescend to first principles of things speculative and abstract,
 which they have never seen in the world, and to which they are wholly
 unaccustomed.
 
 
 There are various kinds of good sense, there are some who judge
 correctly in a certain order of things, and are lost in others.
 
 Some are able to draw conclusions well from a few premisses, and this
 shows a penetrative intellect.
 
 Others draw conclusions well where there are many premisses.
 
 For instance, the first easily understand the laws of hydrostatics,
 where the premisses are few, but the conclusions so nice, that only
 the greatest penetration can reach them. And these persons would
 perhaps not necessarily be great mathematicians, because mathematics
 embrace a great number of premisses, and perhaps a mind may be so
 formed that it searches with ease a few premisses to the bottom,
 yet cannot at all comprehend those matters in which there are many
 premisses.
 
 There are then two kinds of mind, the one able to penetrate
 vigorously and deeply into the conclusions of certain premisses,
 and these are minds true and just. The other able to comprehend a
 great number of premisses without confusion, and these are the minds
 for mathematics. The one kind has force and exactness, the other
 capacity. Now the one quality can exist without the other, a mind may
 be vigorous and narrow, or it may have great range and no strength.
 
 
 When we do not know the truth of a thing, it is not amiss that there
 should be a common error to fix the mind of men, as for instance the
 moon, to which is attributed the change of seasons, the progress
 of diseases, etc. For the principal malady of man is that restless
 curiosity about matters which he can not understand, and it is not so
 bad for him to be mistaken, as to be so idly curious.
 
 The way in which Epictetus, Montaigne, and Salomon de Tultie wrote,
 is the most usual, the most insinuating, the most easily remembered,
 and the most often quoted; because it is wholly composed of thoughts
 which arise out of the ordinary conversations of life. As when a man
 speaks of the vulgar error that the moon is the cause of all, we
 never fail to say that Salomon de Tultie says, that when we know not
 the truth of a matter, it is well there should be a common error,
 etc; which is the thought above.
 
 
 To write against those who plunged too deep into science. Descartes.
 
 
 Descartes.
 
 We must say in general: "This is made by figure and motion for it is
 true." But to say what these are, and to compose the machine, is
 ridiculous, for it is useless, uncertain, and painful. And if it were
 true we do not think that all philosophy is worth one hour of pain.
 
 
 I cannot forgive Descartes.
 
 
 If an animal did by mind what it does by instinct, and if it spoke
 by mind what it speaks by instinct, in hunting, and warning its
 companions that the quarry is found or lost, it would certainly also
 speak in regard to those things which affect it more strongly, as
 for instance, "Gnaw me this cord which hurts me, and which I cannot
 reach."
 
 
 The story of the pike and frog of Liancourt. They do it always and
 never otherwise, nor any other thing of mind.
 
 
 The calculating machine works results which approach nearer to
 thought than any thing done by animals, but it does nothing which
 enables us to say it has any will, as animals have.
 
 
 When it is said that heat is only the motion of certain molecules,
 and light the _conatus recedendi_ which we feel, we are surprised.
 And shall we think that pleasure is but the buoyancy of our spirits?
 We have conceived so different an idea of it, and these sensations
 seem so removed from those others which we say are the same as those
 with which we compare them. The feeling of fire, the warmth which
 affects us in a manner wholly different from touch, the reception of
 sound and light, all this seems to us mysterious, and yet it is as
 material as the blow of a stone. It is true that the minuteness of
 the spirits which enter into the pores touch different nerves, yet
 nerves are always touched.
 
 
 What is more absurd than to say that inanimate bodies have passion,
 fear, horror, that insensible bodies, without life, and even
 incapable of life, have passions, which presuppose at least a
 sensitive soul to feel them, nay more, that the object of their
 terror is a vacuum? What is there in a vacuum which should make them
 afraid? What can be more base and more ridiculous? Nor is this all;
 it is said they have in themselves a principle of motion to avoid a
 vacuum. Have they arms, legs, muscles, nerves?
 
 
 How foolish is painting, which draws admiration by the resemblance of
 things of which we do not admire the originals.
 
 
 In the same way that we injure the understanding we injure the
 feelings also.
 
 The feelings and the understanding are formed by society, and are
 perverted by society. Thus good or bad society forms or perverts
 them. It is then of the first importance to know how to choose in
 order to form and not to pervert them, and we cannot make this choice
 if they be not already formed and not perverted. Thus a circle is
 formed, and happy are those who escape it.
 
 
 Have you never seen persons, who, in order to complain of the little
 you make of them, bring before you the example of people in high
 position who esteem them? To such I answer, "Show me the merit by
 which you have charmed these persons, and I will esteem you too."
 
 
 The world is full of good maxims. All that is needed is their right
 application. For instance, no one doubts that we ought to risk our
 lives for the common weal, and many do so. But for Religion, none.
 
 
 Nature diversifies and imitates, art imitates and diversifies.
 
 
 The more intellect we have ourselves, the more originality do we
 discover in others. Ordinary people find no difference between men.
 
 
 Since we cannot be universal, and know all that is to be known of
 everything, we should know a little of everything. For it is far
 better to know something of all than to know the whole of one thing,
 this universality is the best. If we can have both, still better,
 but if we must choose, let us choose the first. The world feels and
 acts on this, and the world is often a good judge.
 
 
 Certain authors speaking of their works, say: "My book, my
 commentary, my history, etc." They are like the middle-class people
 who have a small house of their own, and have "my house" always on
 the tongue. They would do better to say: "Our book, our commentary,
 our history, etc."; because there is in them generally more of other
 people's than their own.
 
 
 A true friend is so great an advantage, even for the greatest lords,
 in order that he may speak well of them, and uphold them in their
 absence, that they ought to do all that is possible to have one. But
 they should choose well, for spite of all they may do for fools,
 whatever good these say of them would be useless, and they would not
 even speak well of them if they found themselves in the minority, for
 they are without authority. And thus they would abuse them in company.
 
 
 "You are ungraceful, excuse me, I beg." Without that excuse I had not
 known there was aught amiss. "With reverence be it spoke...." The
 only evil is the excuse.
 
 
 I always dislike such compliments as these: _I have given you a great
 deal of trouble._ _I fear I am tiring you._ _I fear this is too
 long._ For we either have our audience with us, or we provoke them.
 
 
 Rivers are roads which move and carry us whither we wish to go.
 
 
 In every action we must look beyond the action at our past, present
 and future state, and at others whom it affects, and see the
 relations of all these things. And then we shall be very careful.
 
 
 In every dialogue and discourse we ought to be able to say to those
 who are offended, "Of what do you complain?"
 
 
 There are many people who listen to the sermon as they listen to
 vespers.
 
 
 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace.

 P. 2. _Pascal's Profession of Faith._ A few days after Pascal's
 death, a servant discovered this profession sewed into a fold of his
 master's waistcoat, _pourpoint_. It was written on parchment, with a
 copy on paper. His family believed that he had carefully placed this
 in each new garment, desiring to have always about him the memorial
 of the great spiritual crisis.

 P. 3. _General Introduction._ In this are apparently two drafts of
 the same preface, the second beginning with the paragraph "Before
 entering," p. 9, l. 6. M. Faugère was the first to recognize the true
 character of this sketch, which has borne various titles. The Port
 Royal edition called it: "Against the Indifference of Atheists;"
 Condorcet headed it: "On the Need of Concern for the Proofs of a
 Future Life;" Bossut: "On the Need of a Study of Religion." See note
 on p. 61.

 no where._ Voltaire attributed this famous saying to the
 pseudo-Timæus of Locris, an abridgement of Plato's _Timæus_, but in
 neither work is the whole sentence to be found. The saying, however,
 is not originally Pascal's. It is probably borrowed from Mlle. de
 Gournay's preface to her edition of Montaigne, Paris, 1635, and was
 taken by her from Rabelais, bk. iii. ch. 13, where it is attributed
 to Hermes Trismegistus. M. Havet, who gives these, and many more
 details, finally traces it, on the authority of Vincent de Beauvais,
 1200-1264, to Empedocles.

 S. Aug. _De Civitate Dei_, v. 8, a translation by Cicero of two
 lines in the _Odyssey_, xviii. 136. The quotation is borrowed from
 Montaigne, _Essais_, l. ii. ch. xii.
 
 P. 27, l. 20. _a fly is buzzing._ Borrowed from Montaigne, _Essais_,
 l. iii. ch. xiii.
 
 P. 27, l. 26. _flies which win battles._ Montaigne relates that the
 Portuguese besieging the town of Tamly were obliged to raise the
 siege on account of the clouds of flies. _Essais_, l. ii. ch. xii.
 
 P. 28, l. 12. _Memoria hospitis unius diei prætereuntis._ Lib. Sap.
 v. 14.
 
 P. 30, l. 4. _Plerumque gratæ_, altered from Hor. _Carm._ iii. 29, v.
 13. _plerumque gratæ_ divitibus _vices_.
 
 P. 30, l. 13. _Epaminondas._ The example is taken from Montaigne,
 _Essais_, l. ii. ch. xxxvi.
 
 P. 31, l. 22. _Sneezing absorbs all the faculties._ A paraphrase of a
 passage in Montaigne, _Essais_, l. iii. ch. v.
 
 P. 31, l. 28. _Scaramouch_. One of the traditional parts in Italian
 Comedy, at that time played by the well-known actor Tiberio Fiorelli,
 whom Pascal had probably seen.
 
 P. 31, l. 29. _The doctor_, also a common character in Italian
 forces. Molière has borrowed from the Italian stage his doctor,
 so often a pedant and a fool, of whom le docteur Pancrace, in _Le
 Marriage Forcé_, is perhaps the most notable example, though that
 comedy was produced after the death of Pascal.
 
 P. 32, l. 11. _the Condrieu, the Desargues._ Gerard Desargues was
 a mathematician at Condrieu on the Rhone, who had been Pascal's
 teacher. Among the Muscat grapes grown at Condrieu, Pascal
 distinguishes a special variety of Desargues, and among these a
 particular vine.
 
 P. 32, l. 28. _the Passion of Cleobuline._ In _Artamène, on le
 Grand Cyrus_, the celebrated romance of Mademoiselle de Scudery,
 Cleobuline, princess, afterwards queen of Corinth, is one of the
 principal characters. She is represented as in love with Myrinthe,
 one of her subjects, but "she loved him without thinking of love; and
 remained so long in her error, that when she became aware of it, her
 affection was no longer in a condition to be overcome."
 
 P. 33. _Diversion._ Under this heading Pascal comprises not only
 trivial occupations, and the distractions of idle society, but all
 which, save truth alone, can form the study or the research of man.
 The main idea of the chapter is borrowed from Montaigne, _Essais_, l.
 iii. chap. x.
 
 P. 35. l. 17. _The counsel given to Pyrrhus._ _Ib._, l. i. ch. xliii.
 
 P. 36, l. 11. _as children are frightened at a face._ Borrowed from
 Montaigne, _Essais_, l. ii. ch. iii., and Montaigne in his turn
 borrowed it from Seneca, _Ep._ 24.
 
 P. 36, l. 28. _superintendent._ Of finances. The last who held this
 office was Fouquet, still in office when this was written. He was
 dismissed in disgrace in 1661.
 
 P. 36, l. 29. _first president._ Of the Parliament of Paris.
 
 P. 36, l. 32. _dismissed to their country houses._ At that date, and
 for a long time afterwards, a Minister of State rarely fell from
 Office without receiving a _Lettre de cachet_ which banished him to
 the seclusion of his country estate.
 
 P. 39, l. 17. _In omnibus requiem quæsivi._ Eccles. xxiv. 7.
 
 P. 40, l. 9. _will arise weariness._ Compare Montaigne, _Essais_, l.
 iii.
 
 P. 41, l. 7. _Cæsar was too old._ See Montaigne, _Essais_, l. ii. ch.
 xxxiv.
 
 P. 43. _The Greatness and Littleness of Man._ The title suggested by
 Pascal, in many passages of the autograph MS.
 
 P. 43, l. 11. _for Port Royal._ The letters A. P. R. occur in several
 places in Pascal's MS. It is generally thought that they mean _à
 Port-Royal_, and are intended to indicate subjects to be developed
 later in _conférences_ or lectures at that house.
 
 P. 45, l. 1. _Man is neither angel nor brute._ This is closely
 borrowed from Montaigne, _Essais_, l. iii. ch. xiii.
 
 P. 46, l. 15. _Corrumpunt mores bonos colloquia prava._ 1 ad Cor. xv.
 33, but the Vulgate reading has _mala_.
 
 P. 47, l. 18. _Paulus Emilius._ The example is taken from Montaigne,
 _Essais_, l. i. ch. xix. See also Cic. _Tuscul._ v. 40.
 
 P. 47, l. 31. _Ego vir videns_, Lament, iii. 1. _Ego vir videns
 paupertatem meam in virga indignationis ejus._
 
 P. 51. _Of the deceptive powers_, etc. This is Pascal's own title for
 this section.
 
 P. 51, l. 14. _Imagination._ Pascal uses this word in an extended
 sense already given to it by Montaigne, and means that faculty by
 which we attribute a value to those things which in fact have none.
 
 P. 53, l. 11. _furred cats._ Rabelais, bk. v. ch. 11.
 
 P. 54, l. 2. _Della Opinione._ No work is known under this name.
 Pascal possibly means a work of Carlo Flosi, _L'Opinione tiranna,
 moralmente considerata ne gli affari del mondo_, Mondovi, 1690. But
 it is not certain that this edition is the reprint of a work extant
 before Pascal wrote.
 
 P. 54, l. 27. _Diseases are another source of error._ Taken from
 Montaigne, _Essais_, l. ii. ch. xii.
 
 P. 56, l. 20. _in Switzerland that of the burgesses._ This may be
 compared with p. 66, l. 6. In the majority of Swiss towns every
 candidate for municipal office must needs possess the freedom of the
 town, but the intention was not to set aside those of noble birth, as
 Pascal supposes, but foreigners, and those of other towns, each of
 which was considered as a separate state.
 
 P. 57, l. 27. _would care nothing for Provence._ Compare Montaigne,
 _Essais_, l. i. ch. xxii. "_C'est par l'entremise de la coustume que
 chascun est contant du lieu où nature l'a planté: et les sauvages
 d'Escosse n'ont que faire de la Touraine, ny les Scythes de la
 Thessalie._"
 
 P. 57, l. 28. _Ferox gens._ Livy, l. xxxiv. c. 17.
 
 P. 58. l. 20. _Brave deeds._ Borrowed from Montaigne, _Essais_, l. i.
 ch. xl.
 
 P. 61. _Of Justice_, etc. These fragments, now among the best known
 of Pascal's Thoughts, but for the most part brought to notice in the
 Edition of Bossut, 1779, have their present arrangement and title
 from Molinier.
 
 P. 61, l. 30. _Nihil amplius._ These sentences, borrowed from
 Montaigne, are quoted, the first of them wrongly, from Cicero, _De
 Finibus_, v. 21; the second from Seneca, _Ad Lucilium_, _Ep._ 95;
 the third from Tacitus, _Annales_, iii. 25. Compare with the whole
 passage Montaigne, _Essais_, l. ii. ch. xii. and l. iii. ch. xiii.
 
 P. 62, l. 29. _Quum veritatem._ S. Aug., _De Civit. Dei_, iv. 31.
 From Montaigne, _Essais_, l. ii. ch. iii.
 
 P. 62, l. 27. _the wisest of law givers._ Socrates, in the _Republic_
 of Plato.
 
 P. 63, l. 9. _Archesilas._ Born at Pitane in Æolis of a Scythian
 father, about 300 B.C. He was founder of the School known as the
 Second Academy. See Montaigne, _Essais_, l. ii. ch. iii.
 
 P. 64, l. 19. For all that is here said on Custom, see Montaigne,
 _Essais_, l. i. ch. xxii.
 
 P. 65, l. 7. _Pasce oves meas._ Joh. xxi. 17. The words are those
 taken as the foundation of papal authority. You owe me pasturage,
 _i.e._ you owe me justice.
 
 P. 65, l. 30. _the soldiers of Mahomet, thieves, heretics._ Pascal
 boldly joins heretics and thieves, for those who did not hold his
 creed appeared to him as men _sans foi ni loi_, faithless and
 lawless. In his eyes a Turk was scarce a man. See the _Provincial
 Letters_, let. xiv. "_Sont-ce des religieux et des prêtres qui
 parlent de cette sorte? Sont-ce des Chrétiens? Sont-ce des Tures?
 Sont-ce des demons?_" And _Thoughts_, p. 211, l. 30. "Do we not see
 beasts live and die like men, and Turks like Christians."
 
 P. 66, l. 6. _The Swiss._ See note on p. 56, l. 20.
 
 P. 66, l. 10. _condemning so many Spaniards to death._ Possibly an
 allusion to the battle of the Dunes, 1659, which led to the Peace
 of the Pyrenees, so long desired by all but Spain, then obliged to
 consent.
 
 P. 67, l. 13. _Summum jus, summa injuria._ Charron, _Traité de la
 Sagesse_, etc. ch. xxvii. art. 8.
 
 P. 67, l. 26. _The end of the Twelfth Provincial._ The following is
 the passage to which Pascal alludes. "_C'est une etrange et longue
 guerre que celle où la violence essaye d'opprimer la vérité. Tons
 les efforts de la violence ne peuvent affaiblir la vérité, et ne
 servent qu'à la relever davantage. Toutes les lumières de la vérité
 ne peuvent rien pour arrêter la violence et ne font que l'irriter
 encore plus ... la violence et la vérité ne peuvent rien l'une sur
 l'autre._"
 
 P. 67, l. 27. _The Fronde._ This was the name given to the party
 which rose against Mazarin and the Court during the minority of Louis
 XIV., and plunged France into civil war.
 
 P. 69, l. 10. _give me the strap._ This is no exaggeration, since
 fifty years after Pascal wrote, Voltaire was beaten by the servants
 of the Duc de Rohan.
 
 P. 69, l. 12. _It is odd that Montaigne._ _Essais_, l. i. ch. xlii.
 
 P. 69, l. 16. _When power attacks craft._ _Satyre Menippée_, Harangue
 du Sire de Rieux: "_il n'y a ny bonnet quarré, ny bourlet, que je ne
 face voler_."
 
 P. 69, l. 30. _figmentum malum._ Ps. ciii. 13. _Quomodo miseretur
 pater filiorum, misertus est Dominus timentibus se: Quoniam ipse
 cognovit figmentum nostrum._
 
 P. 70, l. 14. _Savages laugh at an infant king._ Pascal is alluding
 to the story in Montaigne, _Essais_, l. i. ch. xxx., of the savages
 presented to Charles IX. at Rouen, who were astonished to see bearded
 men obey a child.
 
 P. 72, l. 16. _Epictetus._ See p. 45, l. 30, in order to understand
 this somewhat enigmatic fragment. In the next paragraph is an
 allusion to the passage in which Epictetus says, l. iv. ch. 7, that
 the philosopher may well be constant and detached from life by
 wisdom, as were the Galilæans by their fanaticism.
 
 P. 73. _Weakness, unrest, and defects of man._ The arrangements of
 these fragments under this title is Molinier's.
 
 P. 73, l. 1. _We anticipate the future._ Compare Montaigne, _Essais_,
 l. i. ch. iii.
 
 P. 74, l. 28. _Alexander's chastity._ To attribute this virtue to
 Alexander is strange, but no doubt the circumstance in Pascal's
 thought was his generous conduct to the family of Darius, after the
 battle of Issus.
 
 P. 75, l. 12. _the King of England._ Probably Charles II., then
 living in exile, rather than Charles I. The King of Poland was Jean
 Casimir, driven from his throne by Charles X. of Sweden, after the
 battle of Warsaw in 1656. The Queen of Sweden was Christina, daughter
 of Gustavus Adolphus, who abdicated in favour of her cousin, Charles
 X., in 1654.
 
 P. 75, l. 29. _we shall die alone_, "on mourra seul." It is a curious
 instance of the fact how little Pascal is known in England, that
 Keble having quoted this sentence wrongly, probably from memory, in
 the first edition of the _Christian Year_, as "Je mourrai seul," it
 has remained uncorrected and apparently unnoticed to this day.
 
 P. 76, l. 12. _Cromwell._ As Charles II. was restored in 1660, this
 fragment was written about that date, two years before Pascal's
 death. Cromwell's death did not arise from the cause stated in the
 text.
 
 P. 77, l. 8. _the automaton._ The expression of Descartes and his
 school for the animal body.
 
 P. 77, l. 25. _Inclina cor meum, Deus._ Ps. cxix. 36. "_Inclina cor
 meum in testimonia tua, et non in avaritiam._"
 
 P. 77, l. 30. _Eritis sicut dii._ Gen. iii. 5.
 
 P. 79, l. 30. _men laugh and weep at the same thing._ The thought is
 from Charron, _Traité de la Sagesse_, l. i. ch. xxxviii.
 
 P. 80, l. 35. _the grand Sultan._ None of Pascal's editors have
 discovered whence he drew this purely fictitious description of the
 Sultan.
 
 P. 81, l. 9. _That epigram about the two one-eyed people._ This is
 not Martial's. It is found in _Epigrammatum Delectus_, published by
 Port Royal in 1659.
 
     _Lumine Acon dextro, capta est Leonilla sinistro,
       Et potis est forma vincere uterque Deos.
     Blande puer, lumen quod habes concede parenti;
       Si tu cæcus Amor, sic erit illa Venus._
 
 P. 81, l. 12. _Ambitiosa recidet ornamenta._ Horace, _De Arte
 Poetica_, v. 447.
 
 P. 83, l. 22. _Spongia solis._ The spots on the sun. Du Cange
 explains _spongia_ by _macula_. Pascal seems to mean that the spots
 on the sun prepare us for its total extinction; that the sun will
 eventually expire, so that, contrary as it seems to the course of
 nature, there will come a day when there will be no sun.
 
 P. 89. The title given to this second part is furnished by Pascal. In
 the first part he has wished to prove the fallen state of man, and
 his weakness; he now maintains that man may be restored by faith in
 Jesus Christ, and the practice of religion.
 
 P. 91, l. 26. _Nemo novit._ Matt. xi. 27. _Et nemo novit Filium nisi
 Pater: neque Patrem quis novit, nisi Filius, et cui voluerit Filius
 revelare._
 
 P. 92, l. 3. _Vere tu es._ Is. xlv. 15, see p. 3, l. 8.
 
 P. 92, l. 10. _Quod curiositate cognoverint._ Probably cited from
 recollection of Saint Augustine, but the passage is not verbally to
 be found.
 
 P. 96, l. 6. _neither the stars._
 
     _Porrum et cæpe nefas violare et frangere morsu
     O sanctas gentes, quibus hæc nascuntur in hortis
     Numina!_     Juvenal, _Sat._ xv. 9.
 
 See also Montaigne, _Essais_, l. i. ch. xlii.
 
 P. 97, l. 28. _stultitiam._ 1 Cor. i. 19.
 
 P. 101, l. 12. _the opinion of Copernicus._ Pascal no doubt refers
 to a passage in Montaigne, _Essais_, l. ii. ch. xii., in which he
 abstains from deciding between the rival systems of astronomy.
 Pascal, however, had no doubt on the matter himself, as is plain from
 the passage on Galileo in the Eighteenth _Provincial_.
 
 P. 101, l. 16. _Fascinatio nugacitatis._ Lib. Sap. iv. 12.
 _Fascinatio enim nugacitatis obscurat bona._ See note on p. 165.
 
 P. 102, l. 12. _So our people often act._ Fénélon, _Lettre à l'Evêque
 d'Arras_, says, "_Toutes les difficultés s'evanouissent sans peine
 des qu'on a l'esprit gueri de la présomption. Alors suivant le règle
 de Saint Augustin_, Epist. ad Hier., _on passe sur tout ce que l'on
 n'entend pas, et on s'edifie de tout ce qu'on entend_."
 
 See also _De Imitatione Christi_, l. i. ch. v.
 
 P. 104, l. 4. _Harum sententiarum. Harum sententiarum quæ vera sit
 Deus aliquis viderit._ Cic. _Tuscul._ i. 11.
 
 P. 104, l. 14. _The Preacher shows._ The precise thought as Pascal
 has it here is not easy to find in Ecclesiastes. It is probably a
 reminiscence of Eccles. viii. 17.
 
 P. 105. _The Philosophers._ The title of this chapter is that
 given by Molinier to the collection of fragments contained in it.
 A few expressions and thoughts are from Montaigne, many more from
 Descartes, _Discours de la Méthode_.
 
 P. 108, l. 16. _Deliciæ meæ._ Prov. viii. 31.
 
 P. 108, l. 17. _Effundam spiritum._ Joel ii. 28.
 
 P. 108, l. 17. _Dii estis_, Ps. lxxxii. 6.
 
 P. 108, l. 18. _Omnis caro fœnum._ Is. xl. 6.
 
 P. 108, l. 18. _Homo assimilatus est._ Ps. xlix. 20.
 
 P. 108, l. 20. _Dixi in corde meo._ Eccl. iii. 18.
 
 P. 110, l. 28. _Ex senatus consultis._ Seneca, _Ep._ xcv., sec. 30.
 
 P. 110, l. 29. _Nihil tam absurde._ Cic. _De Divia._ ii. 58.
 
 P. 110, l. 32. _Ut omnium rerum._ Seneca, _Ep._ cvi. But the real
 reading is _Quemadmodum--omnium rerum_.
 
 P. 110, l. 34. _Id maxime._ Cic. _De Off._ i. 31.
 
 P. 110, l. 35. _Hos natura modos._ Virg. _Georg._ ii. 20.
 
 P. 111, l. 4. _Mihi sic usus est._ Ter. _Hea._ i. 1, 28.
 
 P. 111, l. 6. _falsity of their dilemma in Montaigne._ _Essais_, l.
 ii. ch. xii. "_Si l'âme est mortelle, il est absurde de craindre la
 mort, si elle est immortelle elle ne peut aller qu'en s'ameliorant._"
 
 P. 112, l. 11. _Felix qui potuit._ Virg. _Georg._ ii. l. 489.
 
 P. 112, l. 13. _nihil mirari._ Hor. _Epist._ 1, vi. l. 1. The whole
 passage is,
 
     _Nil admirari prope res est una, Numici,
     Solaque, quæ possit facere et servare beatum_.
 
 P. 113, l. 15. _two sects._ Epicureans and Stoics.
 
 P. 113, l. 17. _Des Barreaux._ Jacques Desbarreaux was an Epicurean
 poet born at Paris in 1602, died in 1673, who in his poems paraded
 his unbelief. Curiously enough, his only extant verses were written
 when he lay ill, and are addressed to God.
 
 P. 113, l. 28. _Epictetus concludes._ _Encheiridion_, iv. 7.
 
 P. 113, l. 30. _three sects._ Pascal no doubt refers the _libido
 sentiendi_ to the Epicureans, the _libido dominandi_ to the Stoics,
 and the _libido sciendi_ to the dogmatic schools of Plato and
 Aristotle, of which Cicero always speaks as though they taught one
 and the same philosophy.
 
 P. 114, l. 3. _two inches under water_, are equally drowned with
 those who are at the bottom.
 
 P. 115. The fragments collected in this chapter are here placed by
 Molinier according to the plan which Pascal had traced out for his
 work, in which after he had laid the various philosophical systems
 before his supposed unbeliever, he brought forward for examination
 the other religions.
 
 P. 115, l. 20. _forbade men to read it._ It is not known whence
 Pascal obtained this statement, which is a complete mistake.
 
 P. 116, l. 15. _Jesus Christ wills that his testimony to himself
 should be of no avail._ John v. 31. "If I bear witness of myself, my
 witness is not true."
 
 P. 116, l. 30. _The Koran says that Saint Matthew._ The Koran does
 not name Saint Matthew, but says in general terms that Mahomet
 regarded the apostles of Jesus as holy.
 
 P. 117, l. 27. _whose witnesses let themselves be slaughtered._
 After this Pascal had written, but erased the words "which of the
 two is most to be blamed, Moses or China?" and these aid us in the
 explanation of this enigmatic passage. The Jesuits had established
 themselves in China at the end of the sixteenth century, and when
 Pascal wrote their missions were in a flourishing state. They
 had studied the language, history, and literature of China. But
 the difficulty presented itself of reconciling the cosmogony and
 chronology of the Bible with those of the Chinese sages. It is
 probable that this passage was inspired by a private conversation
 with some one who had read letters from a missionary, for no book on
 the subject appears to have existed in Pascal's day.
 
 P. 118, l. 4. _The five suns_, etc. Montaigne, from whom this is
 taken, _Essais_, l. iii. ch. iv., probably borrowed it from some
 Spanish book now forgotten.
 
 P. 119. _Of the Jewish People._ This position in his intended
 treatise, before the sections on the Sacred Books and on Prophecy, is
 that which Pascal himself designed for his remarks on the Jews.
 
 P. 123, l. 5. _The Masorah._ The unwritten tradition of the Jews.
 
 P. 126, l. 9. _Quis mihi det._ Num. xi. 29. The true reading is,
 _Quis tribuat ut omnis populus prophetet_.
 
 P. 126, l. 17. _If the story in Esdras is credible._ In the 14th
 Chapter of the Second Book of Esdras God appears to Esdras in a bush,
 and orders him to assemble the people and deliver the message. Esdras
 replies, "I will go as thou hast commanded me, and reprove the people
 which are present, but they that shall be born afterward who shall
 admonish them?... _For thy law is burnt_, therefore no man knoweth
 the things that are done of thee, or the works that shall begin.
 But if I have found grace before thee, send the Holy Ghost into me,
 and I shall write all that hath been done in the world since the
 beginning." ... Then God ordered him to take five scribes, to whom
 for forty days he dictated the ancient law.
 
 The authenticity of this story, coming into conflict as it does with
 many passages of the prophets, and specially with Jeremiah, appeared
 open to such grave doubts, that at the Council of Trent the last book
 of Esdras, called in the Catholic Church, Esdras IV., by Protestants
 Esdras II., was then rejected from the Canon.
 
 P. 126, l. 27. _Jeremiah gave them the law._ See 2 Maccabees, ch. xi.
 
 P. 128, l. 31. _Qui justus est justificetur adhuc._ Apocal. xvii. 4.
 
 P. 129, l. 18. _a thousand and twenty-two._ This was the number of
 stars comprised in the Catalogue of Ptolemy, according to the system
 of Hipparchus.
 
 P. 132, l. 9. _Non habemus regem nisi Cæsarem._ Job. xx. 15.
 
 P. 134, l. 12. _Eris palpans in meridie._ Incorrectly quoted from
 Deut. xxviii. 29.
 
 P. 134, l. 13. _Dabitur liber._ Incorrectly quoted from Is. xxix. 12.
 
 P. 135, l. 6. _Effundam spiritum meum._ Is. xliv. 2.
 
 P. 135, l. 21. _populum non credentem._ Is. lxv. 2.
 
 P. 136, l. 2. _ex omnibus iniquitatibus._ Probably a remembrance of
 Is. xliv. 22. _Delevi ut nubem iniquitates tuas._
 
 P. 136, l. 13. _The little stone._ Dan. ii. 34.
 
 P. 136, l. 33. _Omnis Judæa regio._ Incorrectly quoted from Matt.
 iii. 5.
 
 P. 137, l. 3. _These stones can become._ Matt. iii. 9.
 
 P. 140, l. 15. _Grotius._ The allusion is no doubt to his work, _De
 Veritate Religionis Christianæ_, which appeared in 1662.
 
 P. 143, l. 6. _the king of the Medes and Persians_ is Darius
 Codomanus; the King of the Greeks, Alexander. The four kings are,
 Seleucus, King of Syria; Ptolemy, King of Egypt; Lysimachus, King of
 Thrace, and Cassander, King of Macedonia, after the battle of Ipsus,
 301 B.C.
 
 P. 143, l. 12. This paragraph refers to Antiochus Epiphanes, King of
 Syria, who died 164 B.C. See the account of his death, 1 Macc. c. 6.
 
 P. 145, l. 1. _And in the end of years._ The marriage of Antiochus
 Theos with Berenice took place about 247 B.C. Berenice was
 assassinated by Seleucus Ceraunos soon afterwards, and the war
 between Ptolemy Euergetes and the King of Syria lasted during almost
 all the reign of the latter. Syria regained the ascendancy only after
 the death of Ptolemy Euergetes in 222 B.C.
 
 P. 145, l. 26. _Raphia._ The Battle of Raphia was gained by Ptolemy
 Philopator over Antiochus the Great, 217 B.C.
 
 P. 145, l. 36. _Euergetes_, a mistake for Epiphanes.
 
 P. 147, l. 2. _The leader taken from the thigh._ A literal
 translation of Gen. xlix. 10. _Non auferetur sceptrum de Juda, et dux
 de femore ejus._
 
 P. 152, l. 26. _Pugio Fidei._ The work so called, which Pascal first
 specifies in this place, is one of which he made great use in all his
 speculations on the fulfilment of Prophecy, and on the meaning of
 the Hebrew letters, etc. The book, of which the full title is _Pugio
 Fidei adversus Mauros et Judæos_, was written in 1278 by Raymond
 Martin, a Catalonian monk. It remained almost unknown for four
 hundred years, and was first printed in 1651. It was, therefore, as
 it were, a new book when Pascal became acquainted with it. Under the
 name Mauri the author assails not the Koran nor Mahomet, but Arabic
 philosophy.
 
 P. 161, l. 2. _Ut sciatis quod filius hominis._ Marc. ii. 10-11. The
 words of Jesus to the paralytic.
 
 P. 164, l. 16. _Signa legem in electis meis._ Is. viii. 16, where the
 Vulgate has _discipulis_.
 
 P. 165, l. 15. _Fascination._ _i.e._, _Fascinatio nugacitatis_,
 see p. 101, l. 16. The blindness produced by the love of temporal
 possessions, or as the A. V. translates it, "the bewitching of
 naughtiness."
 
 P. 165, l. 15. _Somnum suum._ Ps. lxxvi. 5. _Turbati sunt omnes

 P. 165, l. 16. _Comedes panem tuum._ Deut viii. 9. _Panem nostrum._
 Luc. xi. 3.
 
 P. 165, l. 17. _Inimici Dei terram lingent._ Ps. lxxii 8. The Psalm
 is of Solomon, _Inimici ejus terram lingent_.
 
 P. 165, l. 22. _cum amaritudinibus._ Ex. xii. 8, where the Vulgate
 has _cum lactucis agrestibus_.
 
 P. 165, l. 24. _Singularis sum ego._ Ps. cxli. 10, where the true
 reading is "_singulariter_."
 
 P. 165, l. 34. _We have no right._ The following is the explanation
 of this and the next two paragraphs: In Is. ix. 6, a prophecy which
 the Rabbis apply to Messiah, and Christian interpreters to Jesus, are
 the words: _Parvulus enim natus est nobis ... multiplicabatur ejus
 imperium._ In the Hebrew words representing this latter clause, the
 _closed mem_, a letter ordinarily employed only at the end of a word,
 occurs where an _open mem_ should be used. From this orthographic
 mistake the Rabbis have concluded that Messiah would be born of a
 virgin, _ex virgine clausa_. Moreover, as the _closed mem_ in Hebrew
 writing means six hundred, the Rabbis supposed that Messiah was to
 come six hundred years after Isaiah. The _final tsadé_ has the same
 value as the _closed mem_.
 
 P. 166, l. 8. _the way of the philosopher's stone_, no doubt the way
 of _finding_ the philosopher's stone. The dreams of the alchemists
 on this subject were early mingled with those of the Rabbis on the
 Messiah. Nor had the Cabbala lost all credit in Pascal's days. In
 1629 Robert Fludd, in Latin De Fluctibus, an Englishman, educated
 at Oxford, and a Fellow of the College of Physicians, published at
 Frankfort his _Medicina Catholica_. In this, sect 1. pt. ii. b. 1.
 ch. i. he speaks of sicknesses and healing as both sent from God by
 angelic intermediaries, and that all angelic natures are summed up
 in the great angel Mittatron, whom the Scriptures call Wisdom. In a
 further passage he says that in him whom the Cabalists call Mittatron
 others recognise Messiah, and quotes the passage of Isaiah in which
 occurs the _closed mem_.
 
 In Reuchlin's book _De Arte Cabalistica_ the _open mem_ is said to
 represent the sphere of Jupiter, and the _closed mem_ the sphere of
 Mars.
 
 P. 166, l. 12. _Apocalyptics._ Interpreters of the Apocalypse.
 
 P. 166, l. 13. _Preadamites._ Those who hold that Adam was the
 progenitor of the Jews only, and not of the whole human race.
 
 P. 166, l. 13. _Millenarians._ The believers in the reign of Christ
 on earth for a thousand years.
 
 P. 166, l. 19. The allusion is probably to 2 Paralip. i. 14. _Et
 fecit eos esse in urbibus quadrigarum, et cum rege in Jerusalem._
 
 P. 166, l. 31. _Exortum est lumen._ Ps. cxii. 4. But the word _corde_
 does not appear in the Vulgate.

 P. 170, l. 23. _the breasts of the Spouse._ Song of Songs, iv. 5.
 
 P. 171, l. 32. _Nisi fecissem._ A partial citation of Joh. xv. 24.
 
 P. 174, l. 32. _Adam forma futuri_, ad Rom. v. 14.
 
 P. 175, l. 7. _the six mornings._ This passage is taken from S.
 Aug. _De Genesi contra Manichæos_, i. 23. Pascal probably intending
 to write _les six orients_, dawns or mornings, his amanuensis has
 written _les six arians_, a source of much misunderstanding. The six
 mornings are, the creation; the deliverance from the Ark; the call of
 Abraham; the carrying away into Babylon; the preaching of Jesus.
 
 P. 175, l. 29. _Fac secundum exemplar._ Exod. xxv. 40, but the

 evacuetur crux Christi._
 
 P. 187, l. 12. _says that he came neither with wisdom nor with
 signs._ See however 2 Cor. xii. 12. "Truly the signs of an apostle
 were wrought among you in all patience, _in signs_ and wonders and
 mighty deeds."

 comparatus est._ Ps. xlix. 20. _Dixi in corde._ Eccles. iii. 18.

 P. 194, l. 19. The citations from the Rabbis are taken from the
 _Pugio Fidei_.

 P. 215, l. 5. _Quare fremuerunt gentes._ Ps. ii. 1, 2.
 
 P. 215, l. 30. _Ingrediens mundum._ Probably a recollection of the
 meaning, but not the words, of Heb. i. 6.
 
 P. 215, l. 31. _Stone upon stone._ Mark, xiii. 2.
 
 P. 216, l. 23. _in sanctificationem et in scandalum_, a partial
 quotation of Isaiah, viii. 14.
 
 P. 217, l. 3. _Ænigmatis._ The word nowhere appears, but the allusion
 is no doubt to 1 ad Cor. xiii. 12. _Videmus nunc per speculum in
 ænigmate, tunc autem facie ad faciem._
 
 P. 219, l. 3. _gladium tuum._ Ps. xlv. 3. _Accingere gladio tuo super

 claimed to be the Messiah, A.D. 135.
 
 P. 222, l. 3. _Curse of the Greeks_, no doubt against those Heretics
 who tried to discover the exact date of the end of the world.
 
 P. 225, l. 19. _Quia non cognovit._ The quotation is modified from
 1 ad Cor. i. 21, and with the important omission of the final word
 "_credentes_."
 
 P. 226, l. 24. _Quod ergo ignorantes quæritis._ Adapted from Act. Ap.
 xvii. 23. _Quod ergo ignorantes colitis ego annuncio vobis._
 
 P. 226, l. 28. _via, veritas._ Joh. xiv. 6.
 
 P. 227, l. 12. _Jaddus to Alexander._ Jaddus was the Jewish High
 Priest, who on Alexander's invasion of Syria refused to aid him.
 Thereupon Alexander marched on Jerusalem. Jaddus came out to meet him
 in processional pomp, when the conqueror prostrated himself at his
 feet, saying he had seen such a man in a dream, who had promised him
 the Empire of Asia.
 
 P. 228, l. 14. _Archimedes, though of princely birth._ Plutarch says
 that Archimedes was of a family allied to that of Hiero, King of
 Syracuse.

 P. 230, l. 21. _Lord, when saw we thee an hungered?_ Matt. xxv. 34.
 
 P. 231. _The Mystery of Jesus._ This fragment has only been included
 by more recent editors. But it exists in the autograph MS., and
 unquestionably forms a part of the intended work.
 
 P. 231, l. 3. _turbare semetipsum._ Joh. xi. 33. In the text
 _turbavit seipsum_.
 
 P. 232, l. 9. _Eamus. Processit._ A recollection of Joh. xviii. 4,
 but the word _eamus_ does not occur in the verse, being borrowed from
 the account in Matt. xxvi. 46.
 
 P. 233, l. 25. _ut immundus pro luto._ Possibly a reminiscence and
 misquotation of 2 Pet. ii. 22. _Sus lota in volutabro luti._
 
 P. 234, l. 33. _Noli me tangere._ Joh. xx. 17.
 
 P. 235, l. 21. _Et tu conversus._ Luc. xxii. 32. _Conversus Jesus._
 _ib._ 61. _before_ should be "after."

 Domino unus spiritus est._
 
 P. 238, l. 28. _because it has perhaps merited ours._ See Bossuet's

 principalement la participation qu'ont tous les fidèles au fruit des
 bonnes œuvres les uns des autres._
 
 P. 240, l. 28. _Book of Wisdom._ Ch. ii. 6. But the sense only, and
 not the words, is given.

 P. 241, l. 19. _The goodness of God._ Rom. ii. 4.
 
 P. 241, l. 20. _Let us do penance._ Jonah, iii. 9. But the sense

 P. 243, l. 4. _libido sentiendi._ From Jansenius, _De statu naturæ
 lapsæ_, ii. 8.
 
 P. 243, l. 5. _Woe to the accursed land._ This and the following

 P. 244, l. 29. _Multi crediderunt._ Joh. viii. 30-33.
 
 P. 245, l. 17. _Comminutum cor._ No doubt a misquotation of Ps. li.
 _cor contritum et humiliatum, Deus, non despicies_.
 
 P. 245, l. 18. _Albe vous a nommé._ Corneille, _Horace_, act ii. sc.
 3.
 
 P. 248, l. 1. _Omnis creatura subjecta est vanitati._ Eccles. iii.
 19, but the true reading is "_cuncta subjacent vanitati_."
 
 P. 249, l. 33. _Inclina cor meum._ Ps. cxix. 36.
 
 P. 251, l. 13. _Ne evacuetur crux Christi._ 1 ad Cor. i. 17.
 
 P. 253. _The Arrangement._ Scattered here and there in Pascal's MS.
 were a number of notes concerning the plan, form, and matter of his
 intended treatise, many of them marked with the word "_Ordre_." These
 are gathered together by recent editors, and some others which seem
 to cohere with them added, but Molinier's arrangement, as well as
 that of Faugère, is necessarily somewhat arbitrary.
 
 P. 254, l. 6. _Justus ex fide vivit._ Habac. ii. 4. Ad Rom. i. 17.
 
 P. 254, l. 8. _fides ex auditu._ Ad Rom. x. 17.
 
 P. 254, l. 14. _divide my moral qualities into four._ The classical
 division of ancient philosophy was into four: prudence, temperance,
 justice, magnanimity.
 
 P. 254, l. 16. _Abstine et sustine._ The Stoic formula.
 
 P. 257. _The Miracle of the Holy Thorn._ Marguerite Perier, Pascal's
 niece, aged ten, was cured of lachrymal fistula on March 24, 1656,
 after touching the diseased part with a reliquary containing a thorn
 from the Saviour's crown. This was at the time that Port Royal was
 suffering deeply from persecution, and was considered by many a
 signal mark of the favour of heaven. The Jesuits did not deny the
 miracle, but the conclusions drawn from it.
 
 P. 257, l. 20. _those who heal by invocation of the devil._ Pascal,
 when a child, was supposed both to have been made ill and restored to
 health by a witch. He desires to show that this was no miracle.
 
 P. 258, l. 9. _Believe the Church._ Matt. xviii. 17.
 
 P. 258, l. 13. _Montaigne._ Cf. _Essais_, i. 26.

 P. 258, l. 25. _Sed plenum signis._ This and the following one are
 not to be found. Pascal is probably citing Saint Paul from memory.
 
 P. 258, l. 29. _Sed vos non creditis._ Joh. x. 26.
 
 P. 261, l. 5. _Saint Augustine._ Pascal does not appear to refer to
 any single passage, but to the general teaching of Saint Augustine.
 But see especially _De Civit. Dei_, xxii. 9.

 vineæ meæ et non feci ei._
 
 P. 264, l. 16. _Barjesus was blinded._ Acts xiii. 6-11.
 
 P. 264, l. 22. _Si angelus._ A reference to ad Gal. i. 8.
 
 P. 264, l. 28. _my good father._ Probably Father Annat. See p. 289,
 l. 28.
 
 P. 265, l. 21. _1 P. ix. 113, a. 10, ad. 2._ These signs refer to
 the Summa of Saint Thomas Aquinas here quoted, and mean _Parte 1,
 quæstione 113, articulo 10, ad objectionem 2_.
 
 P. 265, l. 22. _Si tu es Christus._ Luc. xxii. 66.
 
 P. 265, l. 23. _Opera quæ ego facio._ Joh. v. 36.

 P. 266, l. 14. _Ecce prædixi vobis._ Matt. xxiv. 25.
 
 P. 267, l. 26. _Father Lingende._ Claude de Lingendes, 1591-1660, was
 a Jesuit preacher. His sermons were published in 1666.
 
 P. 268, l. 11. _Ubi est Deus tuus._ Ps. xlii. 3.
 
 P. 268, l. 22. _do not believe that the five propositions are in
 Jansenius._ To explain this fully would need a far longer note than
 can here be given. It may be said shortly that the allusion is to
 the "Augustinus" of Cornelius Jansen, Bishop of Ypres. Two questions
 arose: first, whether the propositions condemned were heretical, and
 second, whether if heretical they were in Jansen's book. The second
 assertion was that which the nuns of Port Royal refused to make. They
 had not read the book, and could not affirm that of which they were
 ignorant. The five propositions were on the Doctrines of Grace and
 Free Will.
 
 P. 268, l. 27. _Tu quid dicis._ These are partial quotations from
 Joh. iv. 19, etc.
 
 P. 269, l. 9. _Nemo facit virtutem._ Marc. ix. 38, but incorrectly.
 The true reading is _Nemo est enim qui faciat_.
 
 P. 269, l. 25. _Omne regnum divisum._ Matt. xii. 25.
 
 P. 269, l. 28. _Si in digito Dei._ Luc. xi. 20.
 
 P. 269, l. 35. _Vatable_, who died in 1517, was professor of Hebrew
 at the Collége Royal established by Francis I. In 1539 Robert Etienne
 published an edition of the Latin Bible of Leo of Modena--Rabbi
 Jehuda--to which he added under Vatable's name, notes which were
 not really Vatable's, but borrowed from various writers of the
 Reformation. These notes were condemned by the Sorbonne. The Bible
 known as that of Vatable contains the Hebrew, the Vulgate Version,
 and that of Rabbi Jehuda.
 
 P. 271, l. 23. _miracles of Vespasian._ Tacitus, _Hist._ iv. 81.
 
 P. 273. _Jesuits and Jansenists._ A collection of fragments on these
 subjects, which perhaps might be considered rather as an appendix to,
 or notes for the _Provincial Letters_, than a part of the _Thoughts_,
 properly so called. But they form part of the autograph MS.
 
 P. 273, l. 9. _There is a time to laugh._ Eccles. iii. 4. _Responde,
 ne respondeas._ Prov. xxvi. 4.
 
 P. 275, l. 9. _Elias was a man like ourselves._ Quoted by memory as
 from Saint Peter, but really from Saint James, v. 17.
 
 P. 275, l. 14. _accused of many crimes._ Athanasius was accused of
 rape, of murder, and of sacrilege. He was condemned by the Councils
 of Tyre, A.D. 335, of Arles, A.D. 353, and of Milan A.D. 355. Pope
 Liberius, after having long refused to ratify the condemnation, was
 said to have finally done so A.D. 357. But this is disputed by recent
 authorities. For Athanasius we are of course here to read Jansenius
 and Arnauld; for Saint Theresa, la mère Angélique or la mère Agnès;
 for Liberius, Clement IX.
 
 P. 275, l. 33. _Antonio Escobar y Mendoza._ The Spanish Jesuit whose
 system of morals was so severely handled by Pascal in the _Provincial
 Letters_. He is among those whose names have given rise to a word:
 "_escobarderie_" is a synonym for equivocation.
 
 P. 276, l. 6. _Molina_, Louis, a Spanish Jesuit, born 1535, died
 1601. The Jansenists accused his Commentary on the Summa of Saint
 Thomas Aquinas of favouring a lax morality.
 
 P. 277, l. 4. _Mohatra._ "The contract Mohatra, by which a man buys
 cloth at a dear rate and on credit, to re-sell it at once to the same
 person cheaply for ready money." Eighth _Provincial_.
 
 P. 278, l. 21. _Est and non est._
 
 P. 278, l. 26. _Væ qui conditis leges iniquas._ Is. x. 1. But the
 Vulgate reads _Væ qui condunt_.
 
 P. 279, l. 22. _M. de Condran._ No doubt Charles de Condren,
 1588-1641, doctor of the Sorbonne, and second General of the French
 Oratory, a society of priests founded by Cardinal de Bérulle at Paris
 in 1611.
 
 P. 280, l. 7. _Sanctificavi prælium._ Mic. iii. 5.
 
 P. 280, l. 12. _Ne convertantur._ Is. vi. 10.
 
 P. 282, l. 21. _Coacervabunt tibi magistras._ 2 ad Tim. iv. 3, where
 the Vulgate has "_sibi_."
 
 P. 282, l. 28. _not to make appointments to bishoprics._ But a few
 years after this Fathers La Chaise and Le Tellier, as Confessors to
 the King, had this power in their hands.
 
 P. 282, l. 31. _Father Brisacier_, born 1603, a Jesuit, and a warm
 opponent of Jansenism. He wrote _Le Jansénisme confondu_, and several
 minor works. He is constantly quoted in the _Provincial Letters_.
 
 P. 283, l. 1. _Venice._ The Jesuits had just returned to Venice in
 1657, having been expelled thence in 1606.
 
 P. 283, l. 22. _Amice, ad quid venisti._ Matt. xxvi. 50.
 
 P. 283, l. 24. _probability_, or, technically, probabilism.
 Probabilism teaches that it is permissible to act on an opinion which
 is less probable than the opinion opposed to it so long as there is
 a solid ground for regarding it as probable _in itself_. Thus, if
 out of three moral theologians of recognised authority, two give it
 as their opinion that a certain course of conduct is unlawful, while
 the third asserts it to be lawful, probabilism permits the adoption
 in practice of the third opinion in opposition to the other two. A
 confessor would therefore have no right to forbid it under pain of
 sin.
 
 P. 284, l. 12. _Dii estis._ Ps. lxxxii. 6.
 
 P. 284, l. 13. _If my Letters are condemned at Rome._ The _Provincial
 Letters_ were condemned at Rome, Sept. 6, 1657.
 
 P. 285, l. 22. _imago._ An allusion to the famous panegyric on the
 Jesuits called, "_Imago primi sæculi_." See Fifth _Provincial_.
 
 P. 285, l. 36. _Si non fecissem quæ alius non fecit._ Jon. xv. 24.
 
 P. 286, l. 31. _These nuns._ The nuns of Port Royal were called upon
 to sign the Formula which declared that the Five Propositions were
 _in Jansenius_.
 
 P. 287, l. 4. _Vide si via iniquitatis in me est._ Ps. cxxxix. 24.
 
 P. 287, l. 15. _they are so no longer_, i.e. since the miracle.
 
 P. 288, l. 18. _Vos autem non sic._ Luc. xxii. 26.
 
 P. 289, l. 28. _Annat_, 1590-1670, a Jesuit priest, Provincial of
 the Order, and Confessor to Louis XIV., 1654-1670. He wrote the
 well-known book, _Le Rabat-joie des Jansénistes_, 1666, and to him
 were addressed Pascal's Seventeenth and Eighteenth _Provincials_.
 
 P. 290, l. 9. _Montalte._ Louis de Montalte was the pseudonym adopted
 by Pascal as the writer of the _Provincial Letters_.
 
 P. 290, l. 26. _A fructibus eorum._ Matt. vii. 16.
 
 P. 291, l. 6. _Lessius_, Leonard, a Jesuit born at Brecht, near
 Antwerp, 1554, died 1623, a pupil of Suarez. He was censured by the
 Faculty of Louvain in 1584. He wrote, among others, a treatise, _De
 licito usu æquivocationum et mentalium restrictionum_.
 
 P. 291, l. 9. _Bauny._ Pascal in his Eighth _Provincial_ quotes an
 opinion of Father Bauny on the question of restitution to be made by
 one who has caused the burning of his neighbour's barn.
 
 P. 291, l. 10. _quam primum._ A reference to the rule that if a
 priest personally disqualified from saying Mass on account of any
 mortal sin is yet obliged to do so for the sake of his parishioners,
 it is sufficient that he make an act of contrition, and as soon as
 possible "_quam primum_" seek the Sacrament of Penance.
 
 P. 292, l. 18. _State super vias._ A partial quotation from Jer. vi.
 16.
 
 P. 293, l. 20. _Vince in bono malum._ Ad Rom. xii. 21.
 
 P. 297, l. 5. _Bibite ex hoc omnes._ Matt xvii. 27.
 
 P. 297, l. 7. _In quo omnes peccaverunt._ Ad Rom. v. 12.
 
 P. 298, l. 10. _Ne timeas, pusillus grex._ Luc. xii. 32.
 
 P. 298, l. 13. _Qui me recipit._ Matt. x. 40.
 
 P. 298, l. 14. _Nemo scit neque Filius._ Luc. x. 22.
 
 P. 298, l. 15. _Nemo lucida obumbravit._ Matt. xvii. v.
 
 P. 303, l. 6. _plus poetice quam humane locutus es._ Petronius, c.
 90, where the words have not the turn that Pascal here gives them.
 
 P. 304, l. 2. _The part that I take in your sorrow._ The Chevalier
 de Méré, in his _Discours de la Conversation_, says, that he had
 been witness to a bet, that on opening a letter of condolence the
 set phrase condemned above would occur, and that the lady to whom
 the letter was addressed could not help laughing in spite of her
 distress. Pascal's note is against writing mere formal phrases which
 can thus be easily guessed. The Cardinal is Mazarin.
 
 P. 304, l. 9. _M. le M._ Le Maistre, Antoine, 1608-1658. The allusion
 is to _Les Plaidoyers et Harangues_ de M. le Maistre, Paris, 1657. On
 the first page of Plaidoyer VI., _Pour un fils mis en religion par
 force_, we find "_Dieu qui répand des aveuglements et des ténèbres
 sur les passions illégitimes_," and Pascal probably refers to this
 passage as one in which the word _répandre_ could not be replaced by
 _verser_.
 
 P. 305, l. 23. _I judge by my watch._ Mlle. Perier says, that Pascal
 always wore a watch attached to his left wrist-band.
 
 P. 309, l. 27. _An example may be taken from the circulation of the
 blood._ Apparently taken from Descartes, _Discours de la Méthode_,
 pt. v., in which Descartes speaks of Harvey's discovery.
 
 P. 309, l. 33. _M. de Roannez._ Gouffier, Duc de Roannez, was a
 friend of Pascal, some seven or eight years younger than he. He was a
 devoted adherent of Port Royal, and died unmarried.
 
 P. 312, l. 23. _Salomon de Tultie._ An anagram for Louis de Montalte,
 see p. 290, l. 9.
 
 P. 313, l. 11. _The story of the pike and frog._ This story has
 hitherto escaped research.
 
 P. 313, l. 17. _conatus recedendi._ Centrifugal force.
 
 P. 316, l. 3. _When a strong man armed._ Luke xi. 21.
