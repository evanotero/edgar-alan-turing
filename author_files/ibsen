 ACT I
 
 
 (SCENE.--_A room furnished comfortably and tastefully, but not
 extravagantly. At the back, a door to the right leads to the
 entrance-hall, another to the left leads to Helmer's study. Between the
 doors stands a piano. In the middle of the left-hand wall is a door, and
 beyond it a window. Near the window are a round table, armchairs and a
 small sofa. In the right-hand wall, at the farther end, another door;
 and on the same side, nearer the footlights, a stove, two easy chairs
 and a rocking-chair; between the stove and the door, a small table.
 Engravings on the wall; a cabinet with china and other small objects; a
 small book-case with well-bound books. The floors are carpeted, and a
 fire burns in the stove. It is winter._
 
 _A bell rings in the hall; shortly afterwards the door is heard to open.
 Enter_ NORA, _humming a tune and in high spirits. She is in out-door
 dress and carries a number of parcels; these she lays on the table to
 the right. She leaves the outer door open after her, and through it is
 seen a_ PORTER _who is carrying a Christmas Tree and a basket, which he
 gives to the_ MAID _who has opened the door_.)
 
 _Nora_. Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children
 do not see it till this evening, when it is dressed. (_To the_ PORTER,
 _taking out her purse_.) How much?
 
 _Porter_. Sixpence.
 
 _Nora_. There is a shilling. No, keep the change. (_The_ PORTER _thanks
 her, and goes out_. NORA _shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as
 she takes off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her
 pocket and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband's door
 and listens_.) Yes, he is in. (_Still humming, she goes to the table on
 the right_.)
 
 _Helmer_ (_calls out from his room_). Is that my little lark twittering
 out there?
 
 _Nora_ (_busy opening some of the parcels_). Yes, it is!
 
 _Helmer_. Is it my little squirrel bustling about?
 
 _Nora_. Yes!
 
 _Helmer_. When did my squirrel come home?
 
 _Nora_. Just now. (_Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes
 her mouth_.) Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.
 
 _Helmer_. Don't disturb me. (_A little later, he opens the door and
 looks into the room, pen in hand_.) Bought, did you say? All these
 things? Has my little spendthrift been wasting money again?
 
 _Nora_. Yes, but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a
 little. This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to
 economize.
 
 _Helmer_. Still, you know, we can't spend money recklessly.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn't we?
 Just a tiny wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots
 and lots of money.
 
 _Helmer_. Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter
 before the salary is due.
 
 _Nora_. Pooh! we can borrow till then.
 
 _Helmer_. Nora! (_Goes up to her and takes her playfully by the ear_.)
 The same little featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds
 today, and you spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New
 Year's Eve a slate fell on my head and killed me, and--
 
 _Nora_ (_putting her hands over his mouth_). Oh! don't say such horrid
 things.
 
 _Helmer_. Still, suppose that happened,--what then?
 
 _Nora_. If that were to happen, I don't suppose I should care whether I
 owed money or not.
 
 _Helmer_. Yes, but what about the people who had lent it?
 
 _Nora_. They? Who would bother about them? I should not know who they
 were.
 
 _Helmer_. That is like a woman! But seriously, Nora, you know what I
 think about that. No debt, no borrowing. There can be no freedom or
 beauty about a home life that depends on borrowing and debt. We two have
 kept bravely on the straight road so far, and we will go on the same way
 for the short time longer that there need be any struggle.
 
 _Nora_ (_moving towards the stove_). As you please, Torvald.
 
 _Helmer_ (_following her_). Come, come, my little skylark must not droop
 her wings. What is this! Is my little squirrel out of temper? (_Taking
 out his purse_.) Nora, what do you think I have got here?
 
 _Nora_ (_turning round quickly_). Money!
 
 _Helmer_. There you are. (_Gives her some money_.) Do you think I don't
 know what a lot is wanted for housekeeping at Christmas-time?
 
 _Nora_ (_counting_). Ten shillings--a pound--two pounds! Thank you,
 thank you, Torvald; that will keep me going for a long time.
 
 _Helmer_. Indeed it must.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, yes, it will. But come here and let me show you what I have
 bought. And ah so cheap! Look, here is a new suit for Ivar, and a sword;
 and a horse and a trumpet for Bob; and a doll and dolly's bedstead for
 Emmy.--they are very plain, but anyway she will soon break them in
 pieces. And here are dress-lengths and handkerchiefs for the maids; old
 Anne ought really to have something better.
 
 _Helmer_. And what is in this parcel?
 
 _Nora_ (_crying out_). No, no! you mustn't see that till this evening.
 
 _Helmer_. Very well. But now tell me, you extravagant little person,
 what would you like for yourself?
 
 _Nora_. For myself? Oh, I am sure I don't want anything.
 
 _Helmer_. Yes, but you must. Tell me something reasonable that you would
 particularly like to have.
 
 _Nora_. No, I really can't think of anything--unless, Torvald--
 
 _Helmer_. Well?
 
 _Nora_ (_playing with his coat buttons, and without raising her eyes to
 his_). If you really want to give me something, you might--you might--
 
 _Helmer_. Well, out with it!
 
 _Nora_ (_speaking quickly_). You might give me money, Torvald. Only just
 as much as you can afford; and then one of these days I will buy
 something with it.
 
 _Helmer_. But, Nora--
 
 _Nora_. Oh, do! dear Torvald; please, please do! Then I will wrap it up
 in beautiful gilt paper and hang it on the Christmas Tree. Wouldn't that
 be fun?
 
 _Helmer_. What are little people called that are always wasting money?
 
 _Nora_. Spendthrifts--I know. Let us do as you suggest, Torvald, and
 then I shall have time to think what I am most in want of. That is a
 very sensible plan, isn't it?
 
 _Helmer_ (_smiling_). Indeed it is--that is to say, if you were really
 to save out of the money I give you, and then really buy something for
 yourself. But if you spend it all on the housekeeping and any number of
 unnecessary things, then I merely have to pay up again.
 
 _Nora_. Oh but, Torvald--
 
 _Helmer_. You can't deny it, my dear, little Nora. (_Puts his arm round
 her waist_.) It's a sweet little spendthrift, but she uses up a deal of
 money. One would hardly believe how expensive such little persons are!
 
 _Nora_. It's a shame to say that. I do really save all I can.
 
 _Helmer_ (_laughing_). That's very true,--all you can. But you can't
 save anything!
 
 _Nora_ (_smiling quietly and happily_). You haven't any idea how many
 expenses we skylarks and squirrels have, Torvald.
 
 _Helmer_. You are an odd little soul. Very like your father. You always
 find some new way of wheedling money out of me, and, as soon as you have
 got it, it seems to melt in your hands. You never know where it has
 gone. Still, one must take you as you are. It is in the blood; for
 indeed it is true that you can inherit these things, Nora.
 
 _Nora_. Ah, I wish I had inherited many of papa's qualities.
 
 _Helmer_. And I would not wish you to be anything but just what you are,
 my sweet little skylark. But, do you know, it strikes me that you are
 looking rather--what shall I say--rather uneasy today?
 
 _Nora_. Do I?
 
 _Helmer_. You do, really. Look straight at me.
 
 _Nora_ (_looks at him_). Well?
 
 _Helmer_ (_wagging his finger at her_). Hasn't Miss Sweet-Tooth been
 breaking rules in town today?
 
 _Nora_. No; what makes you think that?
 
 _Helmer_. Hasn't she paid a visit to the confectioner's?
 
 _Nora_. No, I assure you, Torvald--
 
 _Helmer_. Not been nibbling sweets?
 
 _Nora_. No, certainly not.
 
 _Helmer_. Not even taken a bite at a macaroon or two?
 
 _Nora_. No, Torvald, I assure you really--
 
 _Helmer_. There, there, of course I was only joking.
 
 _Nora_ (_going to the table on the right_). I should not think of going
 against your wishes.
 
 _Helmer_. No, I am sure of that; besides, you gave me your word--(_Going
 up to her_.) Keep your little Christmas secrets to yourself, my darling.
 They will all be revealed tonight when the Christmas Tree is lit, no
 doubt.
 
 _Nora_. Did you remember to invite Doctor Rank?
 
 _Helmer_. No. But there is no need; as a matter of course he will come
 to dinner with us. However, I will ask him when he comes in this
 morning. I have ordered some good wine. Nora, you can't think how I am
 looking forward to this evening.
 
 _Nora_. So am I! And how the children will enjoy themselves, Torvald!
 
 _Helmer_. It is splendid to feel that one has a perfectly safe
 appointment, and a big enough income. It's delightful to think of, isn't
 it?
 
 _Nora_. It's wonderful!
 
 _Helmer_. Do you remember last Christmas? For a full three weeks
 beforehand you shut yourself up every evening till long after midnight,
 making ornaments for the Christmas Tree and all the other fine things
 that were to be a surprise to us. It was the dullest three weeks I ever
 spent!
 
 _Nora_. I didn't find it dull.
 
 _Helmer_ (_smiling_). But there was precious little result, Nora.
 
 _Nora_. Oh, you shouldn't tease me about that again. How could I help
 the cat's going in and tearing everything to pieces?
 
 _Helmer_. Of course you couldn't, poor little girl. You had the best of
 intentions to please us all, and that's the main thing. But it is a good
 thing that our hard times are over.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, it is really wonderful.
 
 _Helmer_. This time I needn't sit here and be dull all alone, and you
 needn't ruin your dear eyes and your pretty little hands--
 
 _Nora_ (_clapping her hands_). No, Torvald, I needn't any longer, need
 I! It's wonderfully lovely to hear you say so! (_Taking his arm_.) Now I
 will tell you how I have been thinking we ought to arrange things,
 Torvald. As soon as Christmas is over--(_A bell rings in the hall_.)
 There's the bell. (_She tidies the room a little_.) There's someone at
 the door. What a nuisance!
 
 _Helmer_. If it is a caller, remember I am not at home.
 
 _Maid_ (_in the doorway_). A lady to see you, ma'am,--a stranger.
 
 _Nora_. Ask her to come in.
 
 _Maid_ (_to_ HELMER). The doctor came at the same time, sir.
 
 _Helmer_. Did he go straight into my room?
 
 _Maid_. Yes, sir.
 
 (HELMER _goes into his room. The_ MAID _ushers in_ MRS. LINDE, _who is
 in traveling dress, and shuts the door_.)
 
 _Mrs Linde_ (_in a dejected and timid voice_). How do you do, Nora?
 
 _Nora_ (_doubtfully_). How do you do--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. You don't recognize me, I suppose.
 
 _Nora_ No, I don't know--yes, to be sure, I seem to--(_Suddenly_.) Yes!
 Christine! Is it really you?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, it is I.
 
 _Nora_. Christine! To think of my not recognising you! And yet how could
 I--(_In a gentle voice_.) How you have altered, Christine!
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, I have indeed. In nine, ten long years--
 
 _Nora_. Is it so long since we met? I suppose it is. The last eight
 years have been a happy time for me, I can tell you. And so now you have
 come into the town, and have taken this long journey in winter--that was
 plucky of you.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. I arrived by steamer this morning.
 
 _Nora_. To have some fun at Christmas-time, of course. How delightful!
 We will have such fun together! But take off your things. You are not
 cold, I hope. (_Helps her_.) Now we will sit down by the stove, and be
 cosy. No, take this arm-chair; I will sit here in the rocking-chair.
 (_Takes her hands_.) Now you look like your old self again; it was only
 the first moment--You are a little paler, Christine, and perhaps a
 little thinner.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. And much, much older, Nora.
 
 _Nora_. Perhaps a little older; very, very little; certainly not much.
 (_Stops suddenly and speaks seriously_.) What a thoughtless creature I
 am, chattering away like this. My poor, dear Christine, do forgive me.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. What do you mean, Nora?
 
 _Nora_ (_gently_). Poor Christine, you are a widow.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes; it is three years ago now.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, I knew; I saw it in the papers. I assure you, Christine, I
 meant ever so often to write to you at the time, but I always put it off
 and something always prevented me.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. I quite understand, dear.
 
 _Nora_. It was very bad of me, Christine. Poor thing, how you must have
 suffered. And he left you nothing?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. No.
 
 _Nora_. And no children?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. No.
 
 _Nora_. Nothing at all, then?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Not even any sorrow or grief to live upon.
 
 _Nora_ (_looking incredulously at her_). But, Christine, is that
 possible?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_smiles sadly and strokes her hair_). It sometimes
 happens, Nora.
 
 _Nora_. So you are quite alone. How dreadfully sad that must be. I have
 three lovely children. You can't see them just now, for they are out
 with their nurse. But now you must tell me all about it.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. No, no; I want to hear about you.
 
 _Nora_. No, you must begin. I mustn't be selfish today; today I must
 only think of your affairs. But there is one thing I must tell you. Do
 you know we have just had a great piece of good luck?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. No, what is it?
 
 _Nora_. Just fancy, my husband has been made manager of the Bank!
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Your husband? What good luck!
 
 _Nora_. Yes tremendous! A barrister's profession is such an uncertain
 thing, especially if he won't undertake unsavoury cases; and naturally
 Torvald has never been willing to do that, and I quite agree with him.
 You may imagine how pleased we are! He is to take up his work in the
 Bank at the New Year, and then he will have a big salary and lots of
 commissions. For the future we can live quite differently--we can do
 just as we like. I feel so relieved and so happy, Christine! It will be
 splendid to have heaps of money and not need to have any anxiety, won't
 it?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, anyhow I think it would be delightful to have what
 one needs.
 
 _Nora_. No, not only what one needs, but heaps and heaps of money.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_smiling_). Nora, Nora, haven't you learnt sense yet? In
 our schooldays you were a great spendthrift.
 
 _Nora_ (_laughing_). Yes, that is what Torvald says now. (_Wags her
 finger at her_.) But "Nora, Nora" is not so silly as you think. We have
 not been in a position for me to waste money. We have both had to work.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. You too?
 
 _Nora_. Yes; odds and ends, needlework, crochet-work, embroidery, and
 that kind of thing. (_Dropping her voice_.) And other things as well.
 You know Torvald left his office when we were married? There was no
 prospect of promotion there, and he had to try and earn more than
 before. But during the first year he overworked himself dreadfully. You
 see, he had to make money every way he could, and he worked early and
 late; but he couldn't stand it, and fell dreadfully ill, and the doctors
 said it was necessary for him to go south.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. You spent a whole year in Italy, didn't you?
 
 _Nora_. Yes. It was no easy matter to get away, I can tell you. It was
 just after Ivar was born; but naturally we had to go. It was a
 wonderfully beautiful journey, and it saved Torvald's life. But it cost
 a tremendous lot of money, Christine.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. So I should think.
 
 _Nora_. It cost about two hundred and fifty pounds. That's a lot, isn't
 it?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, and in emergencies like that it is lucky to have the
 money.
 
 _Nora_. I ought to tell you that we had it from papa.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Oh, I see. It was just about that time that he died,
 wasn't it?
 
 _Nora_. Yes; and, just think of it, I couldn't go and nurse him. I was
 expecting little Ivar's birth every day and I had my poor sick Torvald
 to look after. My dear, kind father--I never saw him again, Christine.
 That was the saddest time I have known since our marriage.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. I know how fond you were of him. And then you went off to
 Italy?
 
 _Nora_. Yes; you see we had money then, and the doctors insisted on our
 going, so we started a month later.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. And your husband came back quite well?
 
 _Nora_. As sound as a bell!
 
 _Mrs Linde_. But--the doctor?
 
 _Nora_. What doctor?
 
 _Mrs Linde_. I thought your maid said the gentleman who arrived here
 just as I did, was the doctor?
 
 _Nora_. Yes, that was Doctor Rank, but he doesn't come here
 professionally. He is our greatest friend, and comes in at least once
 every day. No, Torvald has not had an hour's illness since then, and our
 children are strong and healthy and so am I. (_Jumps up and claps her
 hands_.) Christine! Christine! it's good to be alive and happy!--But how
 horrid of me; I am talking of nothing but my own affairs. (_Sits on a
 stool near her, and rests her arms on her knees_.) You mustn't be angry
 with me. Tell me, is it really true that you did not love your husband?
 Why did you marry him?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. My mother was alive then, and was bedridden and helpless,
 and I had to provide for my two younger brothers; so I did not think I
 was justified in refusing his offer.
 
 _Nora_. No, perhaps you were quite right. He was rich at that time,
 then?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. I believe he was quite well off. But his business was a
 precarious one; and, when he died, it all went to pieces and there was
 nothing left.
 
 _Nora_. And then?--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Well, I had to turn my hand to anything I could
 find--first a small shop, then a small school, and so on. The last three
 years have seemed like one long working-day, with no rest. Now it is at
 an end, Nora. My poor mother needs me no more, for she is gone; and the
 boys do not need me either; they have got situations and can shift for
 themselves.
 
 _Nora_. What a relief you must feel it--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. No, indeed; I only feel my life unspeakably empty. No one
 to live for any more. (_Gets up restlessly_.) That is why I could not
 stand the life in my little backwater any longer. I hope it may be
 easier here to find something which will busy me and occupy my thoughts.
 If only I could have the good luck to get some regular work--office work
 of some kind--
 
 _Nora_. But, Christine, that is so frightfully tiring, and you look
 tired out now. You had far better go away to some watering-place.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_walking to the window_). I have no father to give me
 money for a journey, Nora.
 
 _Nora_ (_rising_). Oh, don't be angry with me.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_going up to her_). It is you that must not be angry with
 me, dear. The worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so
 bitter. No one to work for, and yet obliged to be always on the look-out
 for chances. One must live, and so one becomes selfish. When you told me
 of the happy turn your fortunes have taken--you will hardly believe
 it--I was delighted not so much on your account as on my own.
 
 _Nora_. How do you mean?--Oh, I understand. You mean that perhaps
 Torvald could get you something to do.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, that was what I was thinking of.
 
 _Nora_. He must, Christine. Just leave it to me; I will broach the
 subject very cleverly--I will think of something that will please him
 very much. It will make me so happy to be of some use to you.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. How kind you are, Nora, to be so anxious to help me! It is
 doubly kind in you, for you know so little of the burdens and troubles
 of life.
 
 _Nora_. I--? I know so little of them?
 
 _Mrs Linde_ (_smiling_). My dear! Small household cares and that sort of
 thing!--You are a child, Nora.
 
 _Nora_ (_tosses her head and crosses the stage_). You ought not to be so
 superior.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. No?
 
 _Nora_. You are just like all the others. They all think that I am
 incapable of anything really serious--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Come, come--
 
 _Nora_.--that I have gone through nothing in this world of cares.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. But, my dear Nora, you have just told me all your
 troubles.
 
 _Nora_. Pooh!--those were trifles. (_Lowering her voice_.) I have not
 told you the important thing.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. The important thing? What do you mean?
 
 _Nora_. You look down upon me altogether, Christine--but you ought not
 to. You are proud, aren't you, of having-worked so hard and so long for
 your mother?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Indeed, I don't look down on any one. But it is true that
 I am both proud and glad to think that I was privileged to make the end
 of my mother's life almost free from care.
 
 _Nora_. And you are proud to think of what you have done for your
 brothers.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. I think I have the right to be.
 
 _Nora_. I think so, too. But now, listen to this; I too have something
 to be proud and glad of.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. I have no doubt you have. But what do you refer to?
 
 _Nora_. Speak low. Suppose Torvald were to hear! He mustn't on any
 account--no one in the world must know, Christine, except you.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. But what is it?
 
 _Nora_. Come here. (_Pulls her down on the sofa beside her_.) Now I will
 show you that I too have something to be proud and glad of. It was I who
 saved Torvald's life.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. "Saved"? How?
 
 _Nora_. I told you about our trip to Italy. Torvald would never have
 recovered if he had not gone there--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, but your father gave you the necessary funds.
 
 _Nora_ (_smiling_). Yes, that is what Torvald and all the others think,
 but--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. But.--
 
 _Nora_. Papa didn't give us a shilling. It was I who procured the money.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. You? All that large sum?
 
 _Nora_. Two hundred and fifty pounds. What do you think of that?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. But, Nora, how could you possibly do it? Did you win a
 prize in the Lottery?
 
 _Nora_ (_contemptuously_). In the Lottery? There would have been no
 credit in that.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. But where did you get it from, then?
 
 _Nora_ (_humming and smiling with an air of mystery_). Hm, hu! Aha!
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Because you couldn't have borrowed it.
 
 _Nora_. Couldn't I? Why not?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. No, a wife cannot borrow without her husband's consent.
 
 _Nora_ (_tossing her head_). Oh, if it is a wife who has any head for
 business--a wife who has the wit to be a little bit clever--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. I don't understand it at all, Nora.
 
 _Nora_. There is no need you should. I never said I had borrowed the
 money. I may have got it some other way. (_Lies back on the sofa._)
 Perhaps I got it from some other admirer. When anyone is as attractive
 as I am--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. You are a mad creature.
 
 _Nora_. Now, you know you're full of curiosity, Christine.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Listen to me, Nora dear. Haven't you been a little bit
 imprudent?
 
 _Nora_ (_sits up straight_). Is it imprudent to save your husband's
 life?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. It seems to me imprudent, without his knowledge, to--
 
 _Nora_. But it was absolutely necessary that he should not know! My
 goodness, can't you understand that? It was necessary he should have no
 idea what a dangerous condition he was in. It was to me that the doctors
 came and said that his life was in danger, and that the only thing to
 save him was to live in the south. Do you suppose I didn't try, first of
 all, to get what I wanted as if it were for myself? I told him how much
 I should love to travel abroad like other young wives; I tried tears and
 entreaties with him; I told him that he ought to remember the condition
 I was in, and that he ought to be kind and indulgent to me; I even
 hinted that he might raise a loan. That nearly made him angry,
 Christine. He said I was thoughtless, and that it was his duty as my
 husband not to indulge me in my whims and caprices--as I believe he
 called them. Very well, I thought, you must be saved--and that was how I
 came to devise a way out of the difficulty--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. And did your husband never get to know from your father
 that the money had not come from him?
 
 _Nora_. No, never. Papa died just at that time. I had meant to let him
 into the secret and beg him never to reveal it. But he was so ill
 then--alas, there never was any need to tell him.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. And since then have you never told your secret to your
 husband?
 
 _Nora_. Good Heavens, no! How could you think so? A man who has such
 strong opinions about these things! And besides, how painful and
 humiliating it would be for Torvald, with his manly independence, to
 know that he owed me anything! It would upset our mutual relations
 altogether; our beautiful happy home would no longer be what it is now.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Do you mean never to tell him about it?
 
 _Nora_ (_meditatively, and with a half smile._) Yes--some day, perhaps,
 after many years, when I am no longer as nice-looking as I am now.
 Don't laugh at me! I mean, of course, when Torvald is no longer as
 devoted to me as he is now; when my dancing and dressing-up and reciting
 have palled on him; then it may be a good thing to have something in
 reserve--(_Breaking off,_) What nonsense! That time will never come.
 Now, what do you think of my great secret, Christine? Do you still think
 I am of no use? I can tell you, too, that this affair has caused me a
 lot of worry. It has been by no means easy for me to meet my engagements
 punctually. I may tell you that there is something that is called, in
 business, quarterly interest, and another thing called payment in
 instalments, and it is always so dreadfully difficult to manage them. I
 have had to save a little here and there, where I could, you understand.
 I have not been able to put aside much from my housekeeping money, for
 Torvald must have a good table. I couldn't let my children be shabbily
 dressed; I have felt obliged to use up all he gave me for them, the
 sweet little darlings!
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. So it has all had to come out of your own necessaries of
 life, poor Nora?
 
 _Nora_. Of course. Besides, I was the one responsible for it. Whenever
 Torvald has given me money for new dresses and such things, I have never
 spent more than half of it; I have always bought the simplest and
 cheapest things. Thank Heaven, any clothes look well on me, and so
 Torvald has never noticed it. But it was often very hard on me,
 Christine--because it is delightful to be really well dressed, isn't it?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Quite so.
 
 _Nora_. Well, then I have found other ways of earning money. Last winter
 I was lucky enough to get a lot of copying to do; so I locked myself up
 and sat writing every evening until quite late at night. Many a time I
 was desperately tired; but all the same it was a tremendous pleasure to
 sit there working and earning money. It was like being a man.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. How much have you been able to pay off in that way?
 
 _Nora_. I can't tell you exactly. You see, it is very difficult to keep
 an account of a business matter of that kind. I only know that I have
 paid every penny that I could scrape together. Many a time I was at my
 wits' end. (_Smiles._) Then I used to sit here and imagine that a rich
 old gentleman had fallen in love with me--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. What! Who was it?
 
 _Nora_. Be quiet!--that he had died; and that when his will was opened
 it contained, written in big letters, the instruction: "The lovely Mrs.
 Nora Helmer is to have all I possess paid over to her at once in cash."
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. But, my dear Nora--who could the man be?
 
 _Nora_. Good gracious, can't you understand? There was no old gentleman
 at all; it was only something that I used to sit here and imagine, when
 I couldn't think of any way of procuring money. But it's all the same
 now; the tiresome old person can stay where he is, as far as I am
 concerned; I don't care about him or his will either, for I am free from
 care now. (_Jumps up_.) My goodness, it's delightful to think of,
 Christine! Free from care! To be able to be free from care, quite free
 from care; to be able to play and romp with the children; to be able to
 keep the house beautifully and have everything just as Torvald likes it!
 And, think of it, soon the spring will come and the big blue sky!
 Perhaps we shall be able to take a little trip--perhaps I shall see the
 sea again! Oh, it's a wonderful thing to be alive and be happy. (_A bell
 is heard in the hall_.)
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_rising_). There is the bell; perhaps I had better go.
 
 _Nora_. No, don't go; no one will come in here; it is sure to be for
 Torvald.
 
 _Servant_ (_at the hall door_). Excuse me, ma'am--there is a gentleman
 to see the master, and as the doctor is with him--
 
 _Nora_. Who is it?
 
 _Krogstad_ (_at the door_). It is I, Mrs. Helmer. (_Mrs._ LINDE _starts,
 trembles, and turns to the window_.)
 
 _Nora_ (_takes a step towards him, and speaks in a strained low voice_).
 You? What is it? What do you want to see my husband about?
 
 _Krogstad_. Bank business--in a way. I have a small post in the Bank,
 and I hear your husband is to be our chief now--
 
 _Nora_. Then it is--
 
 _Krogstad_. Nothing but dry business matters, Mrs. Helmers; absolutely
 nothing else.
 
 _Nora_. Be so good as to go into the study then. (_She bows
 indifferently to him and shuts the door into the hall; then comes back
 and makes up the fire in the stove_.)
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Nora--who was that man?
 
 _Nora_. A lawyer, of the name of Krogstad.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Then it really was he.
 
 _Nora_. Do you know the man?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. I used to--many years ago. At one time he was a
 solicitor's clerk in our town.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, he was.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. He is greatly altered.
 
 _Nora_. He made a very unhappy marriage.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. He is a widower now, isn't he?
 
 _Nora_. With several children. There now, it is burning up. (_Shuts the
 door of the stove and moves the rocking-chair aside_.)
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. They say he carries on various kinds of business.
 
 _Nora_. Really! Perhaps he does; I don't know anything about it. But
 don't let us think of business; it is so tiresome.
 
 _Doctor Rank_ (_comes out of_ HELMER'S _study. Before he shuts the door
 he calls to him_). No, my dear fellow, I won't disturb you; I would
 rather go in to your wife for a little while. (_Shuts the door and sees_
 Mrs. LINDE.) I beg your pardon; I am afraid I am disturbing you too.
 
 _Nora_. No, not at all. (_Introducing him_.) Doctor Rank, Mrs. Linde.
 
 _Rank_. I have often heard Mrs. Linde's name mentioned here. I think I
 passed you on the stairs when I arrived, Mrs. Linde?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, I go up very slowly; I can't manage stairs well.
 
 _Rank_. Ah! some slight internal weakness?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. No, the fact is I have been overworking myself.
 
 _Rank_. Nothing more than that? Then I suppose you have come to town to
 amuse yourself with our entertainments?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. I have come to look for work.
 
 _Rank_. Is that a good cure for overwork?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. One must live, Doctor Rank.
 
 _Rank_. Yes, the general opinion seems to be that it is necessary.
 
 _Nora_. Look here, Doctor Rank--you know you want to live.
 
 _Rank_. Certainly. However wretched I may feel, I want to prolong the
 agony as long as possible. All my patients are like that. And so are
 those who are morally diseased; one of them, and a bad case, too, is at
 this very moment with Helmer--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_sadly_). Ah!
 
 _Nora_. Whom do you mean?
 
 _Rank_. A lawyer of the name of Krogstad, a fellow you don't know at
 all. He suffers from a diseased moral character, Mrs. Helmer; but even
 he began talking of its being highly important that he should live.
 
 _Nora_. Did he? What did he want to speak to Torvald about?
 
 _Rank_. I have no idea; I only heard that it was something about the
 Bank.
 
 _Nora_. I didn't know this--what's his name--Krogstad had anything to do
 with the Bank.
 
 _Rank_. Yes, he has some sort of appointment there. (_To_ Mrs. LINDE.) I
 don't know whether you find also in your part of the world that there
 are certain people who go zealously snuffing about to smell out moral
 corruption, and, as soon as they have found some, put the person
 concerned into some lucrative position where they can keep their eye on
 him. Healthy natures are left out in the cold.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Still I think the sick are those who most need taking care
 of.
 
 _Rank_ (_shrugging his shoulders_). Yes, there you are. That is the
 sentiment that is turning Society into a sick-house.
 
 (NORA, _who has been absorbed in her thoughts, breaks out into smothered
 laughter and claps her hands_.)
 
 _Rank_. Why do you laugh at that? Have you any notion what Society
 really is?
 
 _Nora_. What do I care about tiresome Society? I am laughing at
 something quite different, something extremely amusing. Tell me, Doctor
 Rank, are all the people who are employed in the Bank dependent on
 Torvald now?
 
 _Rank_. Is that what you find so extremely amusing?
 
 _Nora_ (_smiling and humming_). That's my affair! (_Walking about the
 room_.) It's perfectly glorious to think that we have--that Torvald has
 so much power over so many people. (_Takes the packet from her pocket_.)
 Doctor Rank, what do you say to a macaroon?
 
 _Rank_. What, macaroons? I thought they were forbidden here.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, but these are some Christine gave me.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. What! I?--
 
 _Nora_. Oh, well, don't be alarmed! You couldn't know that Torvald had
 forbidden them. I must tell you that he is afraid they will spoil my
 teeth. But, bah!--once in a way--That's so, isn't it, Doctor Rank? By
 your leave! (_Puts a macaroon into his mouth.)_ You must have one too,
 Christine. And I shall have one, just a little one--or at most two.
 (_Walking about_.) I am tremendously happy. There is just one thing in
 the world now that I should dearly love to do.
 
 _Rank_. Well, what is that?
 
 _Nora_. It's something I should dearly love to say, if Torvald could
 hear me.
 
 _Rank_. Well, why can't you say it?
 
 _Nora_, No, I daren't; it's so shocking.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Shocking?
 
 _Rank_. Well, I should not advise you to say it. Still, with us you
 might. What is it you would so much like to say if Torvald could hear
 you?
 
 _Nora_. I should just love to say--Well, I'm damned!
 
 _Rank_. Are you mad?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Nora, dear--!
 
 _Rank_. Say it, here he is!
 
 _Nora_ (_hiding the packet_). Hush! Hush! Hush! (HELMER _comes out of
 his room, with his coat over his arm and his hat in his hand_.)
 
 _Nora_. Well, Torvald dear, have you got rid of him?
 
 _Helmer_. Yes, he has just gone.
 
 _Nora_. Let me introduce you--this is Christine, who has come to town.
 
 _Helmer_. Christine--? Excuse me, but I don't know--
 
 _Nora_. Mrs. Linde, dear; Christine Linde.
 
 _Helmer_. Of course. A school friend of my wife's, I presume?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, we have known each other since then.
 
 _Nora_. And just think, she has taken a long journey in order to see
 you.
 
 _Helmer_. What do you mean?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. No, really, I--
 
 _Nora_. Christine is tremendously clever at book-keeping, and she is
 frightfully anxious to work under some clever man, so as to perfect
 herself--
 
 _Helmer_. Very sensible, Mrs. Linde.
 
 _Nora_. And when she heard you had been appointed manager of the
 Bank--the news was telegraphed, you know--she traveled here as quick as
 she could, Torvald, I am sure you will be able to do something for
 Christine, for my sake, won't you?
 
 _Helmer_. Well, it is not altogether impossible. I presume you are a
 widow, Mrs. Linde?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes.
 
 _Helmer_. And have had some experience of bookkeeping?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, a fair amount.
 
 _Helmer_. Ah! well it's very likely I may be able to find something for
 you--
 
 _Nora_ (_clapping her hands_). What did I tell you? What did I tell you?
 
 _Helmer_. You have just come at a fortunate moment, Mrs. Linde.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. How am I to thank you?
 
 _Helmer_. There is no need. (_Puts on his coat_.) But today you must
 excuse me--
 
 _Rank_. Wait a minute; I will come with you. (_Brings his fur coat from
 the hall and warms it at the fire_.)
 
 _Nora_. Don't be long away, Torvald dear.
 
 _Helmer_. About an hour, not more.
 
 _Nora_. Are you going too, Christine?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_putting on her cloak_). Yes, I must go and look for a
 room.
 
 _Helmer_. Oh, well then, we can walk down the street together.
 
 _Nora_ (_helping her_). What a pity it is we are so short of space here;
 I am afraid it is impossible for us--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Please don't think of it! Good-bye, Nora dear, and many
 thanks.
 
 _Nora_. Good-bye for the present. Of course you will come back this
 evening. And you too, Dr. Rank. What do you say? If you are well enough?
 Oh, you must be! Wrap yourself up well. (_They go to the door all
 talking together. Children's voices are heard on the staircase._)
 
 _Nora_. There they are. There they are! (_She runs to open the door.
 The_ NURSE _comes in with the children._) Come in! Come in! (_Stoops and
 kisses them._) Oh, you sweet blessings! Look at them, Christine! Aren't
 they darlings?
 
 _Rank_. Don't let us stand here in the draught.
 
 _Helmer_. Come along, Mrs. Linde; the place will only be bearable for a
 mother now!
 
 (RANK, HELMER, _and_ MRS. LINDE _go downstairs. The_ NURSE _comes
 forward with the children;_ NORA _shuts the hall door._)
 
 _Nora_. How fresh and well you look! Such red cheeks!--like apples and
 roses. (_The children all talk at once while she speaks to them._) Have
 you had great fun? That's splendid! What, you pulled both Emmy and Bob
 along on the sledge?--both at once?--that _was_ good. You are a clever
 boy, Ivar. Let me take her for a little, Anne. My sweet little baby
 doll! (_Takes the baby from the_ MAID _and dances it up and down._) Yes,
 yes, mother will dance with Bob too. What! Have you been snow-balling? I
 wish I had been there too! No, no, I will take their things off, Anne;
 please let me do it, it is such fun. Go in now, you look half frozen.
 There is some hot coffee for you on the stove.
 
 (_The_ NURSE _goes into the room on the left. Nora takes off the
 children's things and throws them about, while they all talk to her at
 once_.)
 
 _Nora._ Really! Did a big dog run after you? But it didn't bite you? No,
 dogs don't bite nice little dolly children. You mustn't look at the
 parcels, Ivar. What are they? Ah, I daresay you would like to know. No,
 no--it's something nasty! Come, let us have a game. What shall we play
 at? Hide and Seek? Yes, we'll play Hide and Seek. Bob shall hide first.
 Must I hide? Very well, I'll hide first. (_She and the children laugh
 and shout, and romp in and out of the room; at last Nora hides under the
 table the children rush in and look for her, but do not see her; they
 hear her smothered laughter run to the table, lift up the cloth and find
 her. Shouts of laughter. She crawls forward and pretends to frighten
 them. Fresh laughter. Meanwhile there has been a knock at the hall door,
 but none of them has noticed it. The door is half opened, and KROGSTAD
 appears. He waits a little; the game goes on._)
 
 _Krogstad_. Excuse me, Mrs. Helmer.
 
 _Nora_ (_with a stifled cry, turns round and gets up on to her knees_).
 Ah! what do you want?
 
 _Krogstad_. Excuse me, the outer door was ajar; I suppose someone forgot
 to shut it.
 
 _Nora_ (_rising_). My husband is out, Mr. Krogstad.
 
 _Krogstad_. I know that.
 
 _Nora_. What do you want here, then?
 
 _Krogstad_. A word with you.
 
 _Nora_. With me?--(_To the children, gently_.) Go in to nurse. What? No,
 the strange man won't do mother any harm. When he has gone we will have
 another game. (_She takes the children into the room on the left, and
 shuts the door after them._) You want to speak to me?
 
 _Krogstad_. Yes, I do.
 
 _Nora_. Today? It is not the first of the month yet.
 
 _Krogstad_. No, it is Christmas Eve, and it will depend on yourself what
 sort of a Christmas you will spend.
 
 _Nora_. What do you want? Today it is absolutely impossible for me--
 
 _Krogstad_. We won't talk about that till later on. This is something
 different. I presume you can give me a moment?
 
 _Nora_. Yes--yes, I can--although--
 
 _Krogstad_. Good. I was in Olsen's Restaurant and saw your husband going
 down the street--
 
 _Nora_. Yes?
 
 _Krogstad_. With a lady.
 
 _Nora_. What then?
 
 _Krogstad_. May I make so bold as to ask if it was a Mrs. Linde?
 
 _Nora_. It was.
 
 _Krogstad_. Just arrived in town?
 
 _Nora_. Yes, today.
 
 _Krogstad_. She is a great friend of yours, isn't she?
 
 _Nora_: She is. But I don't see--
 
 _Krogstad_. I knew her too, once upon a time.
 
 _Nora_. I am aware of that.
 
 _Krogstad_. Are you? So you know all about it; I thought as much. Then I
 can ask you, without beating about the bush--is Mrs. Linde to have an
 appointment in the Bank?
 
 _Nora_. What right have you to question me, Mr. Krogstad?--You, one of
 my husband's subordinates! But since you ask, you shall know. Yes, Mrs.
 Linde _is_ to have an appointment. And it was I who pleaded her cause,
 Mr. Krogstad, let me tell you that.
 
 _Krogstad_. I was right in what I thought, then.
 
 _Nora_ (_walking up and down the stage_). Sometimes one has a tiny
 little bit of influence, I should hope. Because one is a woman, it does
 not necessarily follow that--. When anyone is in a subordinate position,
 Mr. Krogstad, they should really be careful to avoid offending anyone
 who--who--
 
 _Krogstad_. Who has influence?
 
 _Nora_. Exactly.
 
 _Krogstad_ (_changing his tone_). Mrs. Helmer, you will be so good as to
 use your influence on my behalf.
 
 _Nora_. What? What do you mean?
 
 _Krogstad_. You will be so kind as to see that I am allowed to keep my
 subordinate position in the Bank.
 
 _Nora_. What do you mean by that? Who proposes to take your post away
 from you?
 
 _Krogstad_. Oh, there is no necessity to keep up the pretence of
 ignorance. I can quite understand that your friend is not very anxious
 to expose herself to the chance of rubbing shoulders with me; and I
 quite understand, too, whom I have to thank for being turned off.
 
 _Nora_. But I assure you--
 
 _Krogstad_. Very likely; but, to come to the point, the time has come
 when I should advise you to use your influence to prevent that.
 
 _Nora_. But, Mr. Krogstad, I _have_ no influence.
 
 _Krogstad_. Haven't you? I thought you said yourself just now--
 
 _Nora_. Naturally I did not mean you to put that construction on it. I!
 What should make you think I have any influence of that kind with my
 husband?
 
 _Krogstad_. Oh, I have known your husband from our student days. I don't
 suppose he is any more unassailable than other husbands.
 
 _Nora_. If you speak slightly of my husband, I shall turn you out of the
 house.
 
 _Krogstad_. You are bold, Mrs. Helmer.
 
 _Nora_. I am not afraid of you any longer, As soon as the New Year
 comes, I shall in a very short time be free of the whole thing.
 
 _Krogstad_ (_controlling himself_). Listen to me, Mrs. Helmer. If
 necessary, I am prepared to fight for my small post in the Bank as if I
 were fighting for my life.
 
 _Nora_. So it seems.
 
 _Krogstad_. It is not only for the sake of the money; indeed, that
 weighs least with me in the matter. There is another reason--well, I may
 as well tell you. My position is this. I daresay you know, like
 everybody else, that once, many years ago, I was guilty of an
 indiscretion.
 
 _Nora_. I think I have heard something of the kind.
 
 _Krogstad_. The matter never came into court; but every way seemed to be
 closed to me after that. So I took to the business that you know of. I
 had to do something; and, honestly, don't think I've been one of the
 worst. But now I must cut myself free from all that. My sons are growing
 up; for their sake I must try and win back as much respect as I can in
 the town. This post in the Bank was like the first step up for me--and
 now your husband is going to kick me downstairs again into the mud.
 
 _Nora_. But you must believe me, Mr. Krogstad; it is not in my power to
 help you at all.
 
 _Krogstad_. Then it is because you haven't the will; but I have means to
 compel you.
 
 _Nora_. You don't mean that you will tell my husband that I owe you
 money?
 
 _Krogstad_. Hm!--suppose I were to tell him?
 
 _Nora_. It would be perfectly infamous of you. (_Sobbing_.) To think of
 his learning my secret, which has been my joy and pride, in such an
 ugly, clumsy way--that he should learn it from you! And it would put me
 in a horribly disagreeable position--
 
 _Krogstad_. Only disagreeable?
 
 _Nora_ (_impetuously_). Well, do it, then!--and it will be the worse for
 you. My husband will see for himself what a blackguard you are, and you
 certainly won't keep your post then.
 
 _Krogstad_. I asked you if it was only a disagreeable scene at home that
 you were afraid of?
 
 _Nora_. If my husband does get to know of it, of course he will at once
 pay you what is still owing, and we shall have nothing more to do with
 you.
 
 _Krogstad_ (_coming a step nearer_). Listen to me, Mrs. Helmer. Either
 you have a very bad memory or you know very little of business. I shall
 be obliged to remind you of a few details.
 
 _Nora_. What do you mean?
 
 _Krogstad_. When your husband was ill, you came to me to borrow two
 hundred and fifty pounds.
 
 _Nora_. I didn't know any one else to go to.
 
 _Krogstad_. I promised to get you that amount--
 
 _Nora_. Yes, and you did so.
 
 _Krogstad_. I promised to get you that amount, on certain conditions.
 Your mind was so taken up with your husband's illness, and you were so
 anxious to get the money for your journey, that you seem to have paid no
 attention to the conditions of our bargain. Therefore it will not be
 amiss if I remind you of them. Now, I promised to get the money on the
 security of a bond which I drew up.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, and which I signed.
 
 _Krogstad_. Good. But below your signature there were a few lines
 constituting your father a surety for the money; those lines your father
 should have signed.
 
 _Nora_. Should? He did sign them.
 
 _Krogstad_. I had left the date blank; that is to say your father should
 himself have inserted the date on which he signed the paper. Do you
 remember that?
 
 _Nora_. Yes, I think I remember--
 
 _Krogstad_. Then I gave you the bond to send by post to your father. Is
 that not so?
 
 _Nora_. Yes.
 
 _Krogstad_. And you naturally did so at once, because five or six days
 afterwards you brought me the bond with your father's signature. And
 then I gave you the money.
 
 _Nora_. Well, haven't I been paying it off regularly?
 
 _Krogstad_. Fairly so, yes. But--to come back to the matter in
 hand--that must have been a very trying time for you, Mrs. Helmer?
 
 _Nora_. It was, indeed.
 
 _Krogstad_. Your father was very ill, wasn't he?
 
 _Nora_. He was very near his end.
 
 _Krogstad_. And died soon afterwards?
 
 _Nora_. Yes.
 
 _Krogstad_. Tell me, Mrs. Helmer, can you by any chance remember what
 day your father died?--on what day of the month, I mean.
 
 _Nora_. Papa died on the 29th of September.
 
 _Krogstad_. That is correct; I have ascertained it for myself. And, as
 that is so, there is a discrepancy (_taking a paper from his pocket_)
 which I cannot account for.
 
 _Nora_. What discrepancy? I don't know--
 
 _Krogstad_. The discrepancy consists, Mrs. Helmer, in the fact that your
 father signed this bond three days after his death.
 
 _Nora_. What do you mean? I don't understand--
 
 _Krogstad_. Your father died on the 29th of September. But, look here;
 your father dated his signature the 2nd of October. It is a discrepancy,
 isn't it? (NORA _is silent_.) Can you explain it to me? (NORA _is still
 silent_.) It is a remarkable thing, too, that the words "2nd of
 October," as well as the year, are not written in your father's
 handwriting but in one that I think I know. Well, of course it can be
 explained; your father may have forgotten to date his signature, and
 someone else may have dated it haphazard before they knew of his death.
 There is no harm in that. It all depends on the signature of the name;
 and _that_ is genuine, I suppose, Mrs. Helmer? It was your father
 himself who signed his name here?
 
 _Nora_ (_after a short pause, throws her head up and looks defiantly at
 him_). No, it was not. It was I that wrote papa's name.
 
 _Krogstad_. Are you aware that is a dangerous confession?
 
 _Nora_. In what way? You shall have your money soon.
 
 _Krogstad_. Let me ask you a question; why did you not send the paper to
 your father?
 
 _Nora_. It was impossible; papa was so ill. If I had asked him for his
 signature, I should have had to tell him what the money was to be used
 for; and when he was so ill himself I couldn't tell him that my
 husband's life was in danger--it was impossible.
 
 _Krogstad_. It would have been better for you if you had given up your
 trip abroad.
 
 _Nora_. No, that was impossible. That trip was to save my husband's
 life; I couldn't give that up.
 
 _Krogstad_. But did it never occur to you that you were committing a
 fraud on me?
 
 _Nora_. I couldn't take that into account; I didn't trouble myself about
 you at all. I couldn't bear you, because you put so many heartless
 difficulties in my way, although you knew what a dangerous condition my
 husband was in.
 
 _Krogstad_. Mrs. Helmer, you evidently do not realise clearly what it is
 that you have been guilty of. But I can assure you that my one false
 step, which lost me all my reputation, was nothing more or nothing worse
 than what you have done.
 
 _Nora_. You? Do you ask me to believe that you were brave enough to run
 a risk to save your wife's life.
 
 _Krogstad_. The law cares nothing about motives.
 
 _Nora_. Then it must be a very foolish law.
 
 _Krogstad_. Foolish or not, it is the law by which you will be judged,
 if I produce this paper in court.
 
 _Nora_. I don't believe it. Is a daughter not to be allowed to spare her
 dying father anxiety and care? Is a wife not to be allowed to save her
 husband's life? I don't know much about law; but I am certain that there
 must be laws permitting such things as that. Have you no knowledge of
 such laws--you who are a lawyer? You must be a very poor lawyer, Mr.
 Krogstad.
 
 _Krogstad_. Maybe. But matters of business--such business as you and I
 have had together--do you think I don't understand that? Very well. Do
 as you please. But let me tell you this--if I lose my position a second
 time, you shall lose yours with me. (_He bows, and goes out through the
 hall_.)
 
 _Nora_ (_appears buried in thought for a short time, then tosses her
 head)_. Nonsense! Trying to frighten me like that!--I am not so silly as
 he thinks. (_Begins to busy herself putting the children's things in
 order_.) And yet--? No, it's impossible! I did it for love's sake.
 
 _The Children_ (_in the doorway on the left.)_ Mother, the stranger man
 has gone out through the gate.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, dears, I know. But, don't tell anyone about the stranger
 man. Do you hear? Not even papa.
 
 _Children_. No, mother; but will you come and play again?
 
 _Nora_. No no,--not now.
 
 _ Children_. But, mother, you promised us.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, but I can't now. Run away in; I have such a lot to do. Run
 away in, sweet little darlings. (_She gets them into the room by degrees
 and shuts the door on them; then sits down on the sofa, takes up a piece
 of needlework and sews a few stitches, but soon stops_.) No! (_Throws
 down the work, gets up, goes to the hall door and calls out_.) Helen,
 bring the Tree in. (_Goes to the table on the left, opens a drawer, and
 stops again_.) No, no! it is quite impossible!
 
 _Maid_ (_coming in with the Tree_). Where shall I put it, ma'am?
 
 _Nora_. Here, in the middle of the floor.
 
 _Maid_. Shall I get you anything else?
 
 _Nora_. No, thank you. I have all I want.
 
 [_Exit_ MAID
 
 _Nora_ (_begins dressing the tree_). A candle here--and flowers here--.
 The horrible man! It's all nonsense--there's nothing wrong. The Tree
 shall be splendid! I will do everything I can think of to please you,
 Torvald!--I will sing for you, dance for you--(HELMER _comes in with
 some papers under his arm_.) Oh! are you back already?
 
 _Helmer_. Yes. Has anyone been here?
 
 _Nora_. Here? No.
 
 _Helmer_. That is strange. I saw Krogstad going out of the gate.
 
 _Nora_. Did you? Oh yes, I forgot Krogstad was here for a moment.
 
 _Helmer_. Nora, I can see from your manner that he has been here begging
 you to say a good word for him.
 
 _Nora_. Yes.
 
 _Helmer_. And you were to appear to do it of your own accord; you were
 to conceal from me the fact of his having been here; didn't he beg that
 of you too?
 
 _Nora_. Yes, Torvald, but--
 
 _Helmer_. Nora, Nora, and you would be a party to that sort of thing? To
 have any talk with a man like that, and give him any sort of promise?
 And to tell me a lie into the bargain?
 
 _Nora_. A lie--?
 
 _Helmer_. Didn't you tell me no one had been here? (_Shakes his finger
 at her_.) My little song-bird must never do that again. A song-bird must
 have a clean beak to chirp with--no false notes! (_Puts his arm round
 her waist._) That is so, isn't it? Yes, I am sure it is. (_Lets her
 go_.) We will say no more about it. (_Sits down by the stove_.) How warm
 and snug it is here! (_Turns over his papers_.)
 
 _Nora_ (_after a short pause, during which she busies herself with the
 Christmas Tree_). Torvald!
 
 _Helmer_. Yes.
 
 _Nora_: I am looking forward tremendously to the fancy dress ball at the
 Stensborgs' the day after tomorrow.
 
 _Helmer_. And I am tremendously curious to see what you are going to
 surprise me with.
 
 _Nora_. It was very silly of me to want to do that.
 
 _Helmer_. What do you mean?
 
 _Nora_. I can't hit upon anything that will do; everything I think of
 seems so silly and insignificant.
 
 _Helmer_. Does my little Nora acknowledge that at last?
 
 _Nora_ (_standing behind his chair with her arms on the back of it_).
 Are you very busy, Torvald?
 
 _Helmer_. Well--
 
 _Nora_. What are all those papers?
 
 _Helmer_. Bank business.
 
 _Nora_. Already?
 
 _Helmer_. I have got authority from the retiring manager to undertake
 the necessary changes in the staff and in the rearrangement of the work;
 and I must make use of the Christmas week for that, so as to have
 everything in order for the new year.
 
 _Nora_. Then that was why this poor Krogstad--
 
 _Helmer_. Hm!
 
 _Nora_ (_leans against the back of his chair and strokes his hair_). If
 you hadn't been so busy I should have asked you a tremendously big
 favour, Torvald.
 
 _Helmer_. What is that? Tell me.
 
 _Nora_. There is no one has such good taste as you. And I do so want to
 look nice at the fancy-dress ball. Torvald, couldn't you take me in hand
 and decide what I shall go as, and what sort of a dress I shall wear?
 
 _Helmer_. Aha! so my obstinate little woman is obliged to get someone to
 come to her rescue?
 
 _Nora_. Yes, Torvald, I can't get along a bit without your help.
 
 _Helmer_ Very well, I will think it over, we shall manage to hit upon
 something.
 
 _Nora_. That _is_ nice of you. (_Goes to the Christmas Tree. A short
 pause.)_ How pretty the red flowers look--. But, tell me, was it really
 something very bad that this Krogstad was guilty of?
 
 _Helmer_. He forged someone's name. Have you any idea what that means?
 
 _Nora_. Isn't it possible that he was driven to do it by necessity?
 
 _Helmer_. Yes; or, as in so many cases, by imprudence. I am not so
 heartless as to condemn a man altogether because of a single false step
 of that kind.
 
 _Nora_. No you wouldn't, would you, Torvald?
 
 _Helmer_. Many a man has been able to retrieve his character, if he has
 openly confessed his fault and taken his punishment.
 
 _Nora_. Punishment--?
 
 _Helmer_. But Krogstad did nothing of that sort; he got himself out of
 it by a cunning trick, and that is why he has gone under altogether.
 
 _Nora_. But do you think it would--?
 
 _Helmer_. Just think how a guilty man like that has to lie and play the
 hypocrite with everyone, how he has to wear a mask in the presence of
 those near and dear to him, even before his own wife and children. And
 about the children--that is the most terrible part of it all, Nora.
 
 _Nora_. How?
 
 _Helmer_. Because such an atmosphere of lies infects and poisons the
 whole life of a home. Each breath the children take in such a house is
 full of the germs of evil.
 
 _Nora_ (_coming nearer him_). Are you sure of that?
 
 _Helmer_. My dear, I have often seen it in the course of my life as a
 lawyer. Almost everyone who has gone to the bad early in life has had a
 deceitful mother.
 
 _Nora_. Why do you only say--mother?
 
 _Helmer_. It seems most commonly to be the mother's influence, though
 naturally a bad father's would have the same result. Every lawyer is
 familiar with the fact. This Krogstad, now, has been persistently
 poisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation; that is why I
 say he has lost all moral character. (_Holds out his hands to her.)_
 That is why my sweet little Nora must promise me not to plead his cause.
 Give me your hand on it. Come, come, what is this? Give me your hand.
 There now, that's settled. I assure you it would be quite impossible for
 me to work with him; I literally feel physically ill when I am in the
 company of such people.
 
 _Nora_ (_takes her hand out of his and goes to the opposite side of the
 Christmas Tree_). How hot it is in here; and I have such a lot to do.
 
 _Helmer_ (_getting up and putting his papers in order_). Yes, and I must
 try and read through some of these before dinner; and I must think about
 your costume, too. And it is just possible I may have something ready in
 gold paper to hang up on the Tree. (_Puts his hand on her head.)_ My
 precious little singing-bird! (_He goes into his room and shuts the door
 after him.)_
 
 _Nora_ (_after a pause, whispers_). No, no--it isn't true. It's
 impossible; it must be impossible.
 
 (_The_ NURSE _opens the door on the left._)
 
 _Nurse_. The little ones are begging so hard to be allowed to come in to
 mamma.
 
 _Nora_. No, no, no! Don't let them come in to me! You stay with them,
 Anne.
 
 _Nurse_. Very well, ma'am. (_Shuts the door._)
 
 _Nora_ (_pale with terror_). Deprave my little children? Poison my home?
 (_A short pause. Then she tosses her head._) It's not true. It can't
 possibly be true.
 
 
 
 
 ACT II
 
 
 (THE SAME SCENE--_The Christmas Tree is in the corner by the piano,
 stripped of its ornaments and with burnt-down candle-ends on its
 dishevelled branches._ NORA'S _cloak and hat are lying on the sofa. She
 is alone in the room, walking about uneasily. She stops by the sofa and
 takes up her cloak._)
 
 _Nora_ (_drops the cloak_). Someone is coming now! (_Goes to the door
 and listens._) No--it is no one. Of course, no one will come today,
 Christmas Day--nor tomorrow either. But, perhaps--(_opens the door and
 looks out_.) No, nothing in the letter-box; it is quite empty. (_Comes
 forward._) What rubbish! of course he can't be in earnest about it. Such
 a thing couldn't happen; it is impossible--I have three little children.
 
 (_Enter the_ NURSE _from the room on the left, carrying a big cardboard
 box._)
 
 _Nurse_. At last I have found the box with the fancy dress.
 
 _Nora_. Thanks; put it on the table.
 
 _Nurse_ (_doing so_). But it is very much in want of mending.
 
 _Nora_. I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.
 
 _Nurse_. What an idea! It can easily be put in order--just a little
 patience.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, I will go and get Mrs. Linde to come and help me with it.
 
 _Nurse_. What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold,
 ma'am, and make yourself ill.
 
 _Nora_. Well, worse than that might happen. How are the children?
 
 _Nurse_. The poor little souls are playing with their Christmas
 presents, but--
 
 _Nora_. Do they ask much for me?
 
 _Nurse_. You see, they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, but, nurse, I shall not be able to be so much with them now
 as I was before.
 
 _Nurse_. Oh well, young children easily get accustomed to anything.
 
 _Nora_. Do you think so? Do you think they would forget their mother if
 she went away altogether?
 
 _Nurse_. Good heavens!--went away altogether?
 
 _Nora_. Nurse, I want you to tell me something I have often wondered
 about--how could you have the heart to put your own child out among
 strangers?
 
 _Nurse_. I was obliged to, if I wanted to be little Nora's nurse.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, but how could you be willing to do it?
 
 _Nurse_. What, when I was going to get such a good place by it? A poor
 girl who has got into trouble should be glad to. Besides, that wicked
 man didn't do a single thing for me.
 
 _Nora_. But I suppose your daughter has quite forgotten you.
 
 _Nurse_. No, indeed she hasn't. She wrote to me when she was confirmed,
 and when she was married.
 
 _Nora_ (_putting her arms round her neck_). Dear old Anne, you were a
 good mother to me when I was little.
 
 _Nurse_. Little Nora, poor dear, had no other mother but me.
 
 _Nora_. And if my little ones had no other mother, I am sure you
 would--What nonsense I am talking! (_Opens the box._) Go in to them. Now
 I must--. You will see tomorrow how charming I shall look.
 
 _Nurse_. I am sure there will be no one at the ball so charming as you,
 ma'am. (_Goes into the room on the left._)
 
 _Nora_ (_begins to unpack the box, but soon pushes it away from her_).
 If only I dared go out. If only no one would come. If only I could be
 sure nothing would happen here in the meantime. Stuff and nonsense! No
 one will come. Only I mustn't think about it. I will brush my muff. What
 lovely, lovely gloves! Out of my thoughts, out of my thoughts! One, two,
 three, four, five, six--(_Screams._) Ah! there is someone coming--.
 (_Makes a movement towards the door, but stands irresolute_.)
 
 (_Enter_ MRS. LINDE _from the hall, where she has taken off her cloak
 and hat_.)
 
 _Nora_. Oh, it's you, Christine. There is no one else out there, is
 there? How good of you to come!
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. I heard you were up asking for me.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, I was passing by. As a matter of fact, it is something you
 could help me with. Let us sit down here on the sofa. Look here.
 Tomorrow evening there is to be a fancy-dress ball at the Stenborgs',
 who live above us; and Torvald wants me to go as a Neapolitan
 fisher-girl, and dance the Tarantella that I learnt at Capri.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. I see; you are going to keep up the character.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, Torvald wants me to. Look, here is the dress; Torvald had
 it made for me there, but now it is all so torn, and I haven't any
 idea--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. We will easily put that right. It is only some of the
 trimming come unsewn here and there. Needle and thread? Now then, that's
 all we want.
 
 _Nora_. It _is_ nice of you.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_sewing_). So you are going to be dressed up tomorrow,
 Nora. I will tell you what--I shall come in for a moment and see you in
 your fine feathers. But I have completely forgotten to thank you for a
 delightful evening yesterday.
 
 _Nora_ (_gets up, and crosses the stage_). Well I don't think yesterday
 was as pleasant as usual. You ought to have come to town a little
 earlier, Christine. Certainly Torvald does understand how to make a
 house dainty and attractive.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. And so do you, it seems to me; you are not your father's
 daughter for nothing. But tell me, is Doctor Rank always as depressed as
 he was yesterday?
 
 _Nora_. No; yesterday it was very noticeable. I must tell you that he
 suffers from a _very_ dangerous disease. He has consumption of the
 spine, poor creature. His father was a horrible man who committed all
 sorts of excesses; and that is why his son was sickly from childhood, do
 you understand?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_dropping her sewing_). But, my dearest Nora, how do you
 know anything about such things?
 
 _Nora_ (_walking about_). Pooh! When you have three children, you get
 visits now and then from--from married women, who know something of
 medical matters, and they talk about one thing and another.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_goes on sewing. A short silence_). Does Doctor Rank come
 here every day?
 
 _Nora_. Every day regularly. He is Torvald's most intimate friend, and a
 great friend of mine too. He is just like one of the family.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. But tell me this--is he perfectly sincere? I mean, isn't
 he the kind of a man that is very anxious to make himself agreeable?
 
 _Nora_. Not in the least. What makes you think that?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. When you introduced him to me yesterday, he declared he
 had often heard my name mentioned in this house; but afterwards I
 noticed that your husband hadn't the slightest idea who I was. So how
 could Doctor Rank--?
 
 _Nora_. That is quite right, Christine. Torvald is so absurdly fond of
 me that he wants me absolutely to himself, as he says. At first he used
 to seem almost jealous if I mentioned any of the dear folk at home, so
 naturally I gave up doing so. But I often talk about such things with
 Doctor Rank, because he likes hearing about them.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Listen to me, Nora. You are still very like a child in
 many ways, and I am older than you in many ways and have a little more
 experience. Let me tell you this--you ought to make an end of it with
 Doctor Rank.
 
 _Nora_. What ought I to make an end of?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Of two things, I think. Yesterday you talked some nonsense
 about a rich admirer who was to leave you money--
 
 _Nora_. An admirer who doesn't exist, unfortunately! But what then?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Is Doctor Rank a man of means?
 
 _Nora_. Yes, he is.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. And has no one to provide for?
 
 _Nora_. No, no one; but--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. And comes here every day?
 
 _Nora_. Yes, I told you so.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. But how can this well-bred man be so tactless?
 
 _Nora_. I don't understand you at all.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Don't prevaricate, Nora. Do you suppose I don't guess who
 lent you the two hundred and fifty pounds.
 
 _Nora_. Are you out of your senses? How can you think of such a thing! A
 friend of ours, who comes here every day! Do you realise what a horribly
 painful position that would be?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Then it really isn't he?
 
 _Nora_. No, certainly not. It would never have entered into my head for
 a moment. Besides, he had no money to lend then; he came into his money
 afterwards.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Well, I think that was lucky for you, my dear Nora.
 
 _Nora_. No, it would never have come into my head to ask Doctor Rank.
 Although I am quite sure that if I had asked him--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. But of course you won't.
 
 _Nora_. Of course not. I have no reason to think it could possibly be
 necessary. But I am quite sure that if I told Doctor Rank--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Behind your husband's back?
 
 _Nora_. I must make an end of it with the other one, and that will be
 behind his back too. I _must_ make an end of it with him.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, that is what I told you yesterday, but--
 
 _Nora_ (_walking up and down_). A man can put a thing like that straight
 much easier than a woman--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. One's husband, yes.
 
 _Nora_. Nonsense! (_Standing still_.) When you pay off a debt you get
 your bond back, don't you?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, as a matter of course.
 
 _Nora_. And can tear it into a hundred thousand pieces, and burn it
 up--the nasty, dirty paper!
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_looks hard at her, lays down her sewing and gets up
 slowly_). Nora, you are concealing something from me.
 
 _Nora_. Do I look as if I were?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Something has happened to you since yesterday morning.
 Nora, what is it?
 
 _Nora_ (_going nearer to her_). Christine! (_Listens_.) Hush! there's
 Torvald come home. Do you mind going in to the children for the present?
 Torvald can't bear to see dressmaking going on. Let Anne help you.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_gathering some of the things together_). Certainly--but I
 am not going away from here till we have had it out with one another.
 (_She goes into the room, on the left, as Helmer comes in from, the
 hall_.)
 
 _Nora_ (_going up to_ HELMAR). I have wanted you so much, Torvald dear.
 
 _Helmer_. Was that the dressmaker?
 
 _Nora_. No, it was Christine; she is helping me to put my dress in
 order. You will see I shall look quite smart.
 
 _Helmer_. Wasn't that a happy thought of mine, now?
 
 _Nora_. Splendid! But don't you think it is nice of me, too, to do as
 you wish?
 
 _Helmer_. Nice?--because you do as your husband wishes? Well, well, you
 little rogue, I am sure you did not mean it in that way. But I am not
 going to disturb you; you will want to be trying on your dress, I
 expect.
 
 _Nora_. I suppose you are going to work.
 
 _Helmer_. Yes. (_Shows her a bundle of papers_.) Look at that. I have
 just been into the bank. (_Turns to go into his room_.)
 
 _Nora_. Torvald.
 
 _Helmer_. Yes.
 
 _Nora_. If your little squirrel were to ask you for something very, very
 prettily--?
 
 _Helmer_. What then?
 
 _Nora_. Would you do it?
 
 _Helmer_. I should like to hear what it is, first.
 
 _Nora_. Your squirrel would run about and do all her tricks if you would
 be nice, and do what she wants.
 
 _Helmer_. Speak plainly.
 
 _Nora_. Your skylark would chirp about in every room, with her song
 rising and falling--
 
 _Helmer_. Well, my skylark does that anyhow.
 
 _Nora_. I would play the fairy and dance for you in the moonlight,
 Torvald.
 
 _Helmer_. Nora--you surely don't mean that request you made of me this
 morning?
 
 _Nora_ (_going near him_). Yes, Torvald, I beg you so earnestly--
 
 _Helmer_. Have you really the courage to open up that question again?
 
 _Nora_. Yes, dear, you _must_ do as I ask; you _must_ let Krogstad keep
 his post in the bank.
 
 _Helmer_. My dear Nora, it is his post that I have arranged Mrs. Linde
 shall have.
 
 _Nora._ Yes, you have been awfully kind about that; but you could just
 as well dismiss some other clerk instead of Krogstad.
 
 _Helmer._ This is simply incredible obstinacy! Because you chose to give
 him a thoughtless promise that you would speak for him, I am expected
 to--
 
 _Nora._ That isn't the reason, Torvald. It is for your own sake. This
 fellow writes in the most scurrilous newspapers; you have told me so
 yourself. He can do you an unspeakable amount of harm. I am frightened
 to death of him--
 
 _Helmer._ Ah, I understand; it is recollections of the past that scare
 you.
 
 _Nora._ What do you mean?
 
 _Helmer._ Naturally you are thinking of your father.
 
 _Nora._ Yes--yes, of course. Just recall to your mind what these
 malicious creatures wrote in the papers about papa, and how horribly
 they slandered him. I believe they would have procured his dismissal if
 the Department had not sent you over to inquire into it, and if you had
 not been so kindly disposed and helpful to him.
 
 _Helmer._ My little Nora, there is an important difference between your
 father and me. Your father's reputation as a public official was not
 above suspicion. Mine is, and I hope it will continue to be so, as long
 as I hold my office.
 
 _Nora._ You never can tell what mischief these men may contrive. We
 ought to be so well off, so snug and happy here in our peaceful home,
 and have no cares--you and I and the children, Torvald! That is why I
 beg you so earnestly--
 
 _Helmer_. And it is just by interceding for him that you make it
 impossible for me to keep him. It is already known at the Bank that I
 mean to dismiss Krogstad. Is it to get about now that the new manager
 has changed his mind at his wife's bidding--
 
 _Nora_. And what if it did?
 
 _Helmer_. Of course!--if only this obstinate little person can get her
 way! Do you suppose I am going to make myself ridiculous before my whole
 staff, to let people think that I am a man to be swayed by all sorts of
 outside influence? I should very soon feel the consequences of it, I can
 tell you. And besides, there is one thing that makes it quite impossible
 for me to have Krogstad in the bank as long as I am manager.
 
 _Nora_. Whatever is that?
 
 _Helmer_. His moral failings I might perhaps have overlooked, if
 necessary--
 
 _Nora_. Yes, you could--couldn't you?
 
 _Helmer_. And, I hear he is a good worker, too. But I knew him when we
 were boys. It was one of those rash friendships that so often prove an
 incubus in after life. I may as well tell you plainly, we were once on
 very intimate terms with one another. But this tactless fellow lays no
 restraint upon himself when other people are present. On the contrary,
 he thinks it gives him the right to adopt a familiar tone with me, and
 every minute it is "I say, Helmer, old fellow!" and that sort of thing.
 I assure you it is extremely painful to me. He would make my position in
 the bank intolerable.
 
 _Nora_. Torvald, I don't believe you mean that.
 
 _Helmer_. Don't you? Why not?
 
 _Nora_. Because it is such a narrow-minded way of looking at things.
 
 _Helmer_. What are you saying? Narrow-minded? Do you think I am
 narrow-minded?
 
 _Nora_. No, just the opposite, dear--and it is exactly for that reason.
 
 _Helmer_. It's the same thing. You say my point of view is
 narrow-minded, so I must be so, too. Narrow-minded! Very well--I must
 put an end to this. (_Goes to the hall door and calls.)_ Helen!
 
 _Nora_. What are you going to do?
 
 _Helmer_ (_looking among his papers)_. Settle it. (_Enter_ MAID.) Look
 here; take this letter and go downstairs with it at once. Find a
 messenger and tell him to deliver it, and be quick. The address is on
 it, and here is the money.
 
 _Maid_. Very well, sir. (_Exit with the letter_.)
 
 _Helmer_ (_putting his papers together_). Now, then, little Miss
 Obstinate.
 
 _Nora_ (_breathlessly_). Torvald--what was that letter?
 
 _Helmer_. Krogstad's dismissal.
 
 _Nora_. Call her back, Torvald! There is still time. Oh Torvald, call
 her back! Do it for my sake--for your own sake, for the children's sake!
 Do you hear me, Torvald? Call her back! You don't know what that letter
 can bring upon us.
 
 _Helmer_. It's too late.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, it's too late.
 
 _Helmer_. My dear Nora, I can forgive the anxiety you are in, although
 really it is an insult to me. It is, indeed. Isn't it an insult to think
 that I should be afraid of a starving quill-driver's vengeance? But I
 forgive you, nevertheless, because it is such eloquent witness to your
 great love for me. (_Takes her in his arms.)_ And that is as it should
 be, my own darling Nora. Come what will, you may be sure I shall have
 both courage and strength if they be needed. You will see I am man
 enough to take everything upon myself.
 
 _Nora_ (_in a horror-stricken voice_). What do you mean by that?
 
 _Helmer_. Everything I say--
 
 _Nora_ (_recovering herself_). You will never have to do that.
 
 _Helmer_. That's right. Well, we will share it, Nora, as man and wife
 should. That is how it shall be. (_Caressing her_.) Are you content now?
 There! There!--not these frightened dove's eyes! The whole thing is only
 the wildest fancy!--Now, you must go and play through the Tarantella and
 practice with your tambourine. I shall go into the inner office and shut
 the door, and I shall hear nothing; you can make as much noise as you
 please. (_Turns back at the door.)_ And when Rank comes, tell him where
 he will find me. (_Nods to her, takes his papers and goes into his room,
 and shuts the door after him_.)
 
 _Nora_ (_bewildered with anxiety, stands as if rooted to the spot, and
 whispers_). He was capable of doing it. He will do it. He will do it in
 spite of everything.--No, not that! Never, never! Anything rather than
 that! Oh, for some help, some way out of it. (_The door-bell rings_.)
 Doctor Rank! Anything rather than that--anything, whatever it is! (_She
 puts her hands over her face, pulls herself together, goes to the door
 and opens it. _RANK_ is standing without, hanging up his coat. During
 the following dialogue it begins to grow dark_.)
 
 _Nora_. Good-day, Doctor Rank. I knew your ring. But you mustn't go into
 Torvald now; I think he is busy with something.
 
 _Rank_. And you?
 
 _Nora_ (_brings him in and shuts the door after him_). Oh, you know very
 well I always have time for you.
 
 _Rank_. Thank you. I shall make use of as much of it as I can.
 
 _Nora_. What do you mean by that? As much of it as you can.
 
 _Rank_. Well, does that alarm you?
 
 _Nora_. It was such a strange way of putting it. Is anything likely to
 happen?
 
 _Rank_. Nothing but what I have long been prepared for. But I certainly
 didn't expect it to happen so soon.
 
 _Nora_ (_gripping him by the arm_). What have you found out? Doctor
 Rank, you must tell me.
 
 _Rank_ (_sitting down by the stove_). It is all up with me. And it can't
 be helped.
 
 _Nora_ (_with a sigh of relief_). Is it about yourself?
 
 _Rank_. Who else? It is no use lying to one's self. I am the most
 wretched of all my patients, Mrs. Helmer. Lately I have been taking
 stock of my internal economy. Bankrupt! Probably within a month I shall
 lie rotting in the church-yard.
 
 _Nora_. What an ugly thing to say!
 
 _Rank_. The thing itself is cursedly ugly, and the worst of it is that I
 shall have to face so much more that is ugly before that. I shall only
 make one more examination of myself; when I have done that, I shall know
 pretty certainly when it will be that the horrors of dissolution will
 begin. There is something I want to tell you. Helmer's refined nature
 gives him an unconquerable disgust of everything that is ugly; I won't
 have him in my sick-room.
 
 _Nora_. Oh, but, Doctor Rank--
 
 _Rank_. I won't have him there. Not on any account. I bar my door to
 him. As soon as I am quite certain that the worst has come, I shall send
 you my card with a black cross on it, and then you will know that the
 loathsome end has begun.
 
 _Nora_. You are quite absurd to-day. And I wanted you so much to be in a
 really good humour.
 
 _Rank_. With death stalking beside me?--To have to pay this penalty for
 another man's sin! Is there any justice in that? And in every single
 family, in one way or another, some such inexorable retribution is being
 exacted--
 
 _Nora_ (_putting her hands over her ears_). Rubbish! Do talk of
 something cheerful.
 
 _Rank_. Oh, it's a mere laughing matter, the whole thing. My poor
 innocent spine has to suffer for my father's youthful amusements.
 
 _Nora_ (_sitting at the table on the left_). I suppose you mean that he
 was too partial to asparagus and pate de foie gras, don't you?
 
 _Rank_. Yes, and to truffles.
 
 _Nora_. Truffles, yes. And oysters too, I suppose?
 
 _Rank_. Oysters, of course, that goes without saying.
 
 _Nora_. And heaps of port and champagne. It is sad that all these nice
 things should take their revenge on our bones.
 
 _Rank_. Especially that they should revenge themselves on the unlucky
 bones of those who have not had the satisfaction of enjoying them.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, that's the saddest part of it all.
 
 _Rank_ (_with a searching look at her_). Hm!--
 
 _Nora_ (_after a short pause_). Why did you smile?
 
 _Rand_. No, it was you that laughed.
 
 _Nora_. No, it was you that smiled, Doctor Rank!
 
 _Rank_ (_rising_). You are a greater rascal than I thought.
 
 _Nora_. I am in a silly mood today.
 
 _Rank_. So it seems.
 
 _Nora_ (_putting her hands on his shoulders_). Dear, dear Doctor Rank,
 death mustn't take you away from Torvald and me.
 
 _Rank_. It is a loss you would easily recover from. Those who are gone
 are soon forgotten.
 
 _Nora_ (_looking at him anxiously_). Do you believe that?
 
 _Rank_. People form new ties, and then--
 
 _Nora_. Who will form new ties?
 
 _Rank_. Both you and Helmer, when I am gone. You yourself are already on
 the high road to it, I think. What did that Mrs. Linde want here last
 night?
 
 _Nora_. Oho!--you don't mean to say you are jealous of poor Christine?
 
 _Rank_. Yes, I am. She will be my successor in this house. When I am
 done for, this woman will--
 
 _Nora_. Hush! don't speak so loud. She is in that room.
 
 _Rank_. To-day again. There, you see.
 
 _Nora_. She has only come to sew my dress for me. Bless my soul, how
 unreasonable you are! (_Sits down on the sofa_.) Be nice now, Doctor
 Rank, and to-morrow you will see how beautifully I shall dance, and you
 can imagine I am doing it all for you--and for Torvald too, of course.
 (_Takes various things out of the box._) Doctor Rank, come and sit down
 here, and I will show you something.
 
 _Rank_ (_sitting down_). What is it?
 
 _Nora_. Just look at those.
 
 _Rank_. Silk stockings.
 
 _Nora_. Flesh-coloured. Aren't they lovely? It is so dark here now, but
 to-morrow--. No, no, no! you must only look at the feet. Oh, well, you
 may have leave to look at the legs too.
 
 _Rank_. Hm!--
 
 _Nora_. Why are you looking so critical? Don't you think they will fit
 me?
 
 _Rank_. I have no means of forming an opinion about that.
 
 _Nora_ (_looks at him for a moment_). For shame! (_Hits him lightly on
 the ear with the stockings_.) That's to punish you. (_Folds them up
 again_.)
 
 _Rank_. And what other nice things am I to be allowed to see?
 
 _Nora_. Not a single thing more, for being so naughty. (_She looks among
 the things, humming to herself_.)
 
 _Rank_ (_after a short silence_). When I am sitting here, talking to you
 as intimately as this, I cannot imagine for a moment what would have
 become of me if I had never come into this house.
 
 _Nora_ (_smiling_). I believe you do feel thoroughly at home with us.
 
 _Rank_ (_in a lower voice, looking straight in front of him_). And to be
 obliged to leave it all--
 
 _Nora_. Nonsense, you are not going to leave it.
 
 _Rank_ (_as before_). And not be able to leave behind one the slightest
 token of one's gratitude, scarcely even a fleeting regret--nothing but
 an empty place which the first comer can fill as well as any other.
 
 _Nora_. And if I asked you now for a--? No!
 
 _Rank_. For what?
 
 _Nora_. For a big proof of your friendship--
 
 _Rank_. Yes, yes.
 
 _Nora_. I mean a tremendously big favour--
 
 _Rank_. Would you really make me so happy for once?
 
 _Nora_. Ah, but you don't know what it is yet.
 
 _Rank_. No--but tell me.
 
 _Nora_. I really can't, Doctor Rank. It is something out of all reason;
 it means advice, and help, and a favour--
 
 _Rank_. The bigger a thing it is the better. I can't conceive what it is
 you mean. Do tell me. Haven't I your confidence?
 
 _Nora_. More than anyone else. I know you are my truest and best friend,
 and so I will tell you what it is. Well, Doctor Rank, it is something
 you must help me to prevent. You know how devotedly, how inexpressibly
 deeply Torvald loves me; he would never for a moment hesitate to give
 his life for me.
 
 _Rank_ (_leaning toward her_). Nora--do you think he is the only one--?
 
 _Nora_ (_with a slight start_). The only one--?
 
 _Rank_. The only one who would gladly give his life for your sake.
 
 _Nora_ (_sadly_). Is that it?
 
 _Rank_. I was determined you should know it before I went away, and
 there will never be a better opportunity than this. Now you know it,
 Nora. And now you know, too, that you can trust me as you would trust no
 one else.
 
 _Nora_ (_rises deliberately and quietly_). Let me pass.
 
 _Rank_ (_makes room for her to pass him, but sits still_). Nora!
 
 _Nora_ (_at the hall door_). Helen, bring in the lamp. (_Goes over to
 the stove_.) Dear Doctor Rank, that was really horrid of you.
 
 _Rank_. To have loved you as much as anyone else does? Was that horrid?
 
 _Nora_. No, but to go and tell me so. There was really no need--
 
 _Rank_. What do you mean? Did you know--? (MAID _enters with lamp, puts
 it down on the table, and goes out_.) Nora--Mrs. Helmer--tell me, had
 you any idea of this?
 
 _Nora_. Oh, how do I know whether I had or whether I hadn't. I really
 can't tell you--To think you could be so clumsy, Doctor Rank! We were
 getting on so nicely.
 
 _Bank_. Well, at all events you know now that you can command me, body
 and soul. So won't you speak out?
 
 _Nora_ (_looking at him_). After what happened?
 
 _Rank_. I beg you to let me know what it is.
 
 _Nora_. I can't tell you anything now.
 
 _Rank_. Yes, yes. You mustn't punish me in that way. Let me have
 permission to do for you whatever a man may do.
 
 _Nora_. You can do nothing for me now. Besides, I really don't need any
 help at all. You will find that the whole thing is merely fancy on my
 part. It really is so--of course it is! (_Sits down in the
 rocking-chair, and looks at him with a smile_.) You are a nice sort of
 man, Doctor Rank!--don't you feel ashamed of yourself, now the lamp has
 come?
 
 _Rank_. Not a bit. But perhaps I had better go--forever?
 
 _Nora_. No, indeed, you shall not. Of course you must come here just as
 before. You know very well Torvald can't do without you.
 
 _Rank_. Yes, but you?
 
 _Nora_. Oh, I am always tremendously pleased when you come.
 
 _Rank_. It is just that, that put me on the wrong track. You are a
 riddle to me. I have often thought that you would almost as soon be in
 my company as in Helmer's.
 
 _Nora_. Yes--you see there are some people one loves best, and others
 whom one would almost always rather have as companions.
 
 _Rank_. Yes, there is something in that.
 
 _Nora_. When I was at home, of course I loved papa best. But I always
 thought it tremendous fun if I could steal down into the maids' room,
 because they never moralized at all, and talked to each other about such
 entertaining things.
 
 _Rank_. I see--it is their place I have taken.
 
 _Nora_ (_jumping-up and going to him_). Oh, dear, nice Doctor Rank, I
 never meant that at all. But surely you can understand that being with
 Torvald is a little like being with papa--(_Enter_ MAID _from the hall_.)
 
 _Maid_. If you please, ma'am. (_Whispers and hands her a card_.)
 
 _Nora_ (_glancing at the card_). Oh! (_Puts it in her pocket_.)
 
 _Rank_. Is there anything wrong?
 
 _Nora_. No, no, not in the least. It is only something--It is my new
 dress--
 
 _Rank_. What? Your dress is lying there.
 
 _Nora_. Oh, yes, that one; but this is another. I ordered it. Torvald
 mustn't know about it--
 
 _Rank_. Oho! Then that was the great secret.
 
 _Nora_. Of course. Just go in to him; he is sitting in the inner room.
 Keep him as long as--
 
 _Rank_. Make your mind easy; I won't let him escape. (_Goes into_
 HELMER'S _room_.)
 
 _Nora_ (_to the_ MAID). And he is standing waiting in the kitchen?
 
 _Maid_. Yes; he came up the back stairs.
 
 _Nora_. But didn't you tell him no one was in?
 
 _Maid_. Yes, but it was no good.
 
 _Nora_. He won't go away?
 
 _Maid_. No; he says he won't until he has seen you, ma'am.
 
 _Nora_. Well, let him come in--but quietly. Helen, you mustn't say
 anything about it to any one. It is a surprise for my husband.
 
 _Maid_. Yes, ma'am, I quite understand. (_Exit_.)
 
 _Nora_. This dreadful thing is going to happen. It will happen in spite
 of me! No, no, no, it can't happen--it shan't happen! (_She bolts the
 door of_ HELMER'S _room. The_ MAID _opens the hall door for_ KROGSTAD
 _and shuts it after him. He is wearing a fur coat, high boots and a fur
 cap_.)
 
 _Nora_ (_advancing towards him_). Speak low--my husband is at home.
 
 _Krogstad_. No matter about that.
 
 _Nora_. What do you want of me?
 
 _Krogstad_. An explanation of something.
 
 _Nora_. Make haste then. What is it?
 
 _Krogstad_. You know, I suppose, that I have got my dismissal.
 
 _Nora_. I couldn't prevent it, Mr. Krogstad. I fought as hard as I could
 on your side, but it was no good.
 
 _Krogstad_. Does your husband love you so little, then? He knows what I
 can expose you to, and yet he ventures--
 
 _Nora_. How can you suppose that he has any knowledge of the sort?
 
 _Krogstad_. I didn't suppose so at all. It would not be the least like
 our dear Torvald Helmer to show so much courage--
 
 _Nora_. Mr. Krogstad, a little respect for my husband, please.
 
 _Krogstad_. Certainly--all the respect he deserves. But since you have
 kept the matter so carefully to yourself, I make bold to suppose that
 you have a little clearer idea than you had yesterday, of what it
 actually is that you have done?
 
 _Nora_. More than you could ever teach me.
 
 _Krogstad_. Yes, such a bad lawyer as I am.
 
 _Nora_. What is it you want of me?
 
 _Krogstad_. Only to see how you were, Mrs. Helmer. I have been thinking
 about you all day long. A mere cashier--a quill-driver, a--well, a man
 like me--even he has a little of what is called feeling, you know.
 
 _Nora_. Show it, then; think of my little children.
 
 _Krogstad_. Have you and your husband thought of mine? But never mind
 about that. I only wanted to tell you that you need not take this matter
 too seriously. In the first place there will be no accusation made on my
 part.
 
 _Nora_. No, of course not; I was sure of that.
 
 _Krogstad_. The whole thing can be arranged amicably; there is no reason
 why anyone should know anything about it. It will remain a secret
 between us three.
 
 _Nora_. My husband must never get to know anything about it.
 
 _Krogstad_. How will you be able to prevent it? Am I to understand that
 you can pay the balance that is owing?
 
 _Nora_. No, not just at present.
 
 _Krogstad_. Or perhaps that you have some expedient for raising the
 money soon?
 
 _Nora_. No expedient that I mean to make use of.
 
 _Krogstad_. Well, in any case, it would have been of no use to you now.
 If you stood there with ever so much money in your hand, I would never
 part with your bond.
 
 _Nora_. Tell me what purpose you mean to put it to.
 
 _Krogstad_. I shall only preserve it--keep it in my possession. No one
 who is not concerned in the matter shall have the slightest hint of it.
 So that if the thought of it has driven you to any desperate
 resolution--
 
 _Nora_. It has.
 
 _Krogstad_. If you had it in your mind to run away from your home--
 
 _Nora_. I had.
 
 _Krogstad_. Or even something worse--
 
 _Nora_. How could you know that?
 
 _Krogstad_. Give up the idea.
 
 _Nora_. How did you know I had thought of _that?_
 
 _Krogstad_. Most of us think of that at first. I did, too--but I hadn't
 the courage.
 
 _Nora_ (_faintly_). No more had I.
 
 _Krogstad_ (_in a tone of relief)_. No, that's it, isn't it--you hadn't
 the courage either?
 
 _Nora_. No, I haven't--I haven't.
 
 _Krogstad_. Besides, it would have been a great piece of folly. Once the
 first storm at home is over--. I have a letter for your husband in my
 pocket.
 
 _Nora_. Telling him everything?
 
 _Krogstad_. In as lenient a manner as I possibly could.
 
 _Nora_ (_quickly)_. He mustn't get the letter. Tear it up. I will find
 some means of getting money.
 
 _Krogstad_. Excuse me, Mrs. Helmer, but I think I told you just how--
 
 _Nora_. I am not speaking of what I owe you. Tell me what sum you are
 asking my husband for, and I will get the money.
 
 _Krogstad_. I am not asking your husband for a penny.
 
 _Nora_. What do you want, then?
 
 _Krogstad_. I will tell you. I want to rehabilitate myself, Mrs. Helmer;
 I want to get on; and in that your husband must help me. For the last
 year and a half I have not had a hand in anything dishonourable, and all
 that time I have been struggling in most restricted circumstances. I was
 content to work my way up step by step. Now I am turned out, and I am
 not going to be satisfied with merely being taken into favour again. I
 want to get on, I tell you. I want to get into the Bank again, in a
 higher position. Your husband must make a place for me--
 
 _Nora_. That he will never do!
 
 _Krogstad_. He will; I know him; he dare not protest. And as soon as I
 am in there again with him, then you will see! Within a year I shall be
 the manager's right hand. It will be Nils Krogstad and not Torvald
 Helmer who manages the Bank.
 
 _Nora_. That's a thing you will never see!
 
 _Krogstad_. Do you mean that you will--?
 
 _Nora_. I have courage enough for it now.
 
 _Krogstad_. Oh, you can't frighten me. A fine, spoilt lady like you--
 
 _Nora_. You will see, you will see.
 
 _Krogstad_. Under the ice, perhaps? Down into the cold, coal-black
 water? And then, in the spring, to float up to the surface, all horrible
 and unrecognizable, with your hair fallen out--
 
 _Nora_. You can't frighten me.
 
 _Krogstad_. Nor you me. People don't do such things, Mrs. Helmer.
 Besides, what use would it be? I should have him completely in my power
 all the same.
 
 _Nora_. Afterwards? When I am no longer--
 
 _Krogstad_. Have you forgot that it is I who have the keeping of your
 reputation? (_Nora stands speechlessly looking at him.)_ Well, now, I
 have warned you. Do not do anything foolish. When Helmer has had my
 letter, I shall expect a message from him. And be sure you remember that
 it is your husband himself who has forced me into such ways as this
 again. I will never forgive him for that. Good-bye, Mrs. Helmer. (_Exit
 through the hall.)_
 
 _Nora_ (_goes to the hall door, opens it slightly and listens_). He is
 going. He is not putting the letter in the box. Oh, no, no, that's
 impossible! (_Opens the door by degrees._) What is that? He is standing
 outside. He is not going downstairs. Is he hesitating? Can he--? (_A
 letter drops into the box; then_ KROGSTAD'S _footsteps are heard, till
 they die away as he goes downstairs._ NORA _utters a stifled cry, and
 runs across the room to the table by the sofa. A short pause_.)
 
 _Nora_. In the letter-box. (_Steals across to the hall-door_.) There it
 lies--Torvald, Torvald, there is no hope for us now!
 
 (MRS. LINDE _comes in from the room on the left, carrying the dress_.)
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. There, I can't see anything more to mend now. Would you
 like to try it on--?
 
 _Nora_ (_in a hoarse whisper_). Christine, come here.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_throwing the dress down on the sofa_). What is the matter
 with you? You look so agitated!
 
 _Nora_. Come here. Do you see that letter? There, look--you can see it
 through the glass in the letter-box.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, I see it.
 
 _Nora_. That letter is from Krogstad.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Nora--it was Krogstad who lent you the money!
 
 _Nora_. Yes, and now Torvald will know all about it.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Believe me, Nora, that's the best thing for both of you.
 
 _Nora_. You don't know all. I forged a name.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Good heavens--!
 
 _Nora_. I only want to say this to you, Christine--you must be my witness.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Your witness! What do you mean? What am I to--?
 
 _Nora_. If I should go out of my mind--and it might easily happen--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Nora!
 
 _Nora_. Or if anything else should happen to me--anything, for instance,
 that might prevent my being here--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Nora! Nora! you are quite out of your mind.
 
 _Nora_. And if it should happen that there were someone who wanted to
 take all the responsibility, all the blame, you understand--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, yes--but how can you suppose--?
 
 _Nora_. Then you must be my witness, that it is not true, Christine. I
 am not out of my mind at all; I am in my right senses now, and I tell
 you no one else has known anything about it; I and I alone, did the
 whole thing. Remember that.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. I will, indeed. But I don't understand all this.
 
 _Nora_. How should you understand it? A wonderful thing is going to
 happen.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. A wonderful thing?
 
 _Nora_. Yes, a wonderful thing!--But it is so terrible, Christine; it
 _mustn't_ happen, not for all the world.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. I will go at once and see Krogstad.
 
 _Nora_. Don't go to him; he will do you some harm.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. There was a time when he would gladly do anything for my
 sake.
 
 _Nora_. He?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Where does he live?
 
 _Nora_. How should I know--? Yes (_feeling in her pocket_) here is his
 card. But the letter, the letter--!
 
 _Helmer_ (_calls from his room, knocking at the door_). Nora.
 
 _Nora_ (_cries out anxiously_). Oh, what's that? What do you want?
 
 _Helmer_. Don't be so frightened. We are not coming in; you have locked
 the door. Are you trying on your dress?
 
 _Nora_. Yes, that's it. I look so nice, Torvald.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_who has read the card_) I see he lives at the corner
 here.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, but it's no use. It is hopeless. The letter is lying there
 in the box.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. And your husband keeps the key?
 
 _Nora_. Yes, always.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Krogstad must ask for his letter back unread, he must find
 some pretence--
 
 _Nora_. But it is just at this time that Torvald generally--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. You must delay him. Go in to him in the meantime. I will
 come back as soon as I can. (_She goes out hurriedly through the hall
 door_.)
 
 _Nora_ (_goes to_ HELMER'S _door, opens it and peeps in_). Torvald!
 
 _Helmer_ (_from the inner room_). Well? May I venture at last to come
 into my own room again? Come along, Rank, now you will see--(_ Halting
 in the doorway_.) But what is this?
 
 _Nora_. What is what, dear?
 
 _Helmer_. Rank led me to expect a splendid transformation.
 
 _Rank_ (_in the doorway_). I understood so, but evidently I was
 mistaken.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, nobody is to have the chance of admiring me in my dress
 until to-morrow.
 
 _Helmer_. But, my dear Nora, you look so worn out. Have you been
 practising too much?
 
 _Nora_. No, I have not practised at all.
 
 _Helmer_. But you will need to--
 
 _Nora_. Yes, indeed I shall, Torvald. But I can't get on a bit without
 you to help me; I have absolutely forgotten the whole thing.
 
 _Helmer_. Oh, we will soon work it up again.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, help me, Torvald. Promise that you will! I am so nervous
 about it--all the people--. You must give yourself up to me entirely
 this evening. Not the tiniest bit of business--you mustn't even take a
 pen in your hand. Will you promise, Torvald dear?
 
 _Helmer_. I promise. This evening I will be wholly and absolutely at
 your service, you helpless little mortal. Ah, by the way, first of all I
 will just--(_Goes toward the hall-door_.)
 
 _Nora_. What are you going to do there?
 
 _Helmer_. Only see if any letters have come.
 
 _Nora_. No, no! don't do that, Torvald!
 
 _Helmer_. Why not?
 
 _Nora_. Torvald, please don't. There is nothing there.
 
 _Helmer_. Well, let me look. (_Turns to go to the letter-box._ NORA, _at
 the piano, plays the first bars of the Tarantella_. HELMER _stops in the
 doorway_.) Aha!
 
 _Nora_. I can't dance to-morrow if I don't practise with you.
 
 _Helmer_ (_going up to her_). Are you really so afraid of it, dear?
 
 _Nora_. Yes, so dreadfully afraid of it. Let me practise at once; there
 is time now, before we go to dinner. Sit down and play for me, Torvald
 dear; criticise me, and correct me as you play.
 
 _Helmer_. With great pleasure, if you wish me to. (_Sits down at the
 piano_.)
 
 _Nora_ (_takes out of the box a tambourine and a long variegated shawl.
 She hastily drapes the shawl round her. Then she springs to the front of
 the stage and calls out_). Now play for me! I am going to dance!
 
 (HELMER _plays and_ NORA _dances_. RANK _stands by the piano behind_
 HELMER, _and looks on_.)
 
 _Helmer_ (_as he plays_). Slower, slower!
 
 _Nora_. I can't do it any other way.
 
 _Helmer_. Not so violently, Nora!
 
 _Nora_. This is the way.
 
 _Helmer_ (_stops playing_). No, no--that is not a bit right.
 
 _Nora_ (_laughing and swinging the tambourine_). Didn't I tell you so?
 
 _Rank_. Let me play for her.
 
 _Helmer_ (_getting up_). Yes, do. I can correct her better then.
 
 (RANK _sits down at the piano and plays. Nora dances more and more
 wildly_. HELMER _has taken up a position beside the stove, and during
 her dance gives her frequent instructions. She does not seem to hear
 him; her hair comes down and falls over her shoulders; she pays no
 attention to it, but goes on dancing. Enter_ MRS. LINDE.)
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_standing as if spell-bound in the doorway_). Oh!--
 
 _Nora_ (_as she dances_). Such fun, Christine!
 
 _Helmer_. My dear darling Nora, you are dancing as if your life depended
 on it.
 
 _Nora_. So it does.
 
 _Helmer_. Stop, Rank; this is sheer madness. Stop, I tell you. (RANK
 _stops playing, and,_ NORA _suddenly stands still_. HELMER _goes up to
 her._) I could never have believed it. You have forgotten everything I
 taught you.
 
 _Nora_ (_throwing away the tambourine_). There, you see.
 
 _Helmer_. You will want a lot of coaching.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, you see how much I need it. You must coach me up to the
 last minute. Promise me that, Torvald!
 
 _Helmer_. You can depend on me.
 
 _Nora_. You must not think of anything but me, either to-day or
 to-morrow; you mustn't open a single letter--not even open the
 letter-box--
 
 _Helmer_. Ah, you are still afraid of that fellow----
 
 _Nora_. Yes, indeed I am.
 
 _Helmer_. Nora, I can tell from your looks that there is a letter from
 him lying there.
 
 _Nora_. I don't know; I think there is; but you must not read anything
 of that kind now. Nothing horrid must come between us till this is all
 over.
 
 _Rank_ (_whispers to_ HELMER). You mustn't contradict her.
 
 _Helmer_ (_taking her in his arms_). The child shall have her way. But
 to-morrow night, after you have danced--
 
 _Nora_. Then you will be free. (_The_ MAID _appears in the doorway to
 the right_.)
 
 _Maid_. Dinner is served, ma'am.
 
 _Nora_. We will have champagne, Helen.
 
 _Maid_. Very good, ma'am.
 
 _Helmer_. Hullo!--are we going to have a banquet? (_Exit._)
 
 _Nora_. Yes, a champagne banquet till the small hours. (_Calls out_.)
 And a few macaroons, Helen--lots, just for once!
 
 _Helmer_. Come, come, don't be so wild and nervous. Be my own little
 skylark, as you used.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, dear, I will. But go in now and you too, Doctor Rank.
 Christine, you must, help me to do up my hair.
 
 _Rank_ (_whispers to_ HELMER _as they go out_). I suppose there is
 nothing--she is not expecting anything?
 
 _Helmer_. Far from it, my dear fellow; it is simply nothing more than
 this childish nervousness I was telling you of. (_They go into the
 right-hand room_.)
 
 _Nora_. Well!
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Gone out of town.
 
 _Nora_. I could tell from your face.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. He is coming home tomorrow evening. I wrote a note for
 him.
 
 _Nora_. You should have let it alone; you must prevent nothing. After
 all, it is splendid to be waiting for a wonderful thing to happen.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. What is it that you are waiting for?
 
 _Nora_, Oh, you wouldn't understand. Go in to them. I will come in a
 moment. (MRS. LINDE _goes into the dining-room._ NORA _stands still for
 a little while, as if to compose herself. Then she looks at her watch_.)
 Five o'clock. Seven hours till midnight; and then four-and-twenty hours
 till the next midnight. Then the Tarantella will be over. Twenty-four
 and seven? Thirty-one hours to live.
 
 _Helmer_ (_from the doorway on the right_). Where's my little skylark?
 
 _Nora_ (_going to him with her arms out-stretched_). Here she is!
 
 
 
 
 ACT III
 
 
 (THE SAME SCENE--_The table has been placed in the middle of the stage,
 with chairs around it. A lamp is burning on the table. The door into the
 hall stands open. Dance music is heard in the room above_. MRS. LINDE
 _is sitting at the table idly turning over the leaves of a book; she
 tries to read, but does not seem able to collect her thoughts. Every now
 and then she listens intently for a sound at the outer door_.)
 
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_looking at her watch_). Not yet--and the time is nearly
 up. If only he does not--. (_Listens again_.) Ah, there he is. (_Goes
 into the hall and opens the outer door carefully. Light footsteps are
 heard on the stairs. She whispers_.) Come in. There is no one here.
 
 _Krogstad_ (_in the doorway_). I found a note from you at home. What
 does this mean?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with
 you.
 
 _Krogstad_. Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be
 here?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. It is impossible where I live; there is no private
 entrance to my rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep,
 and the Helmers are at the dance upstairs.
 
 _Krogstad_ (_coming into the room_). Are the Helmers really at a dance
 tonight?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, why not?
 
 _Krogstad_. Certainly--why not?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Now, Nils, let us have a talk.
 
 _Krogstad_. Can we two have anything to talk about?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. We have a great deal to talk about.
 
 _Krogstad_. I shouldn't have thought so.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. No, you have never properly understood me.
 
 _Krogstad_. Was there anything else to understand except what was
 obvious to all the world--a heartless woman jilts a man when a more
 lucrative chance turns up.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Do you believe I am as absolutely heartless as all that?
 And do you believe that I did it with a light heart?
 
 _Krogstad_. Didn't you?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Nils, did you really think that?
 
 _Krogstad_. If it were as you say, why did you write to me as you did at
 the time?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. I could do nothing else. As I had to break with you, it
 was my duty also to put an end to all that you felt for me.
 
 _Krogstad_ (_wringing his hands_). So that was it. And all this--only
 for the sake of money.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. You must not forget that I had a helpless mother and two
 little brothers. We couldn't wait for you, Nils; your prospects seemed
 hopeless then.
 
 _Krogstad_. That may be so, but you had no right to throw me over for
 any one else's sake.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Indeed I don't know. Many a time did I ask myself if I had
 a right to do it.
 
 _Krogstad_ (_more gently_). When I lost you, it was as if all the solid
 ground went from under my feet. Look at me now--I am a shipwrecked man
 clinging to a bit of wreckage.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. But help may be near.
 
 _Krogstad_. It _was_ near; but then you came and stood in my way.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Unintentionally, Nils. It was only today that I learnt it
 was your place I was going to take in the bank.
 
 _Krogstad_. I believe you, if you say so. But now that you know it, are
 you not going to give it up to me?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. No, because that would not benefit you in the least.
 
 _Krogstad_. Oh, benefit, benefit--I would have done it whether or no.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. I have learnt to act prudently. Life, and hard, bitter
 necessity have taught me that.
 
 _Krogstad_. And life has taught me not to believe in fine speeches.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Then life has taught you something very reasonable. But
 deeds you must believe in?
 
 _Krogstad_. What do you mean by that?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. You said you were like a shipwrecked man clinging to some
 wreckage.
 
 _Krogstad_. I had good reason to say so.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Well, I am like a shipwrecked woman clinging to some
 wreckage--no one to mourn for, no one to care for.
 
 _Krogstad_. It was your own choice.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. There was no other choice, then.
 
 _Krogstad_. Well, what now?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Nils, how would it be if we two shipwrecked people could
 join forces?
 
 _Krogstad_. What are you saying?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Two on the same piece of wreckage would stand a better
 chance than each on their own.
 
 _Krogstad_. Christine!
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. What do you suppose brought me to town?
 
 _Krogstad_. Do you mean that you gave me a thought?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. I could not endure life without work. All my life, as long
 as I can remember, I have worked, and it has been my greatest and only
 pleasure. But now I am quite alone in the world--my life is so dreadfully
 empty and I feel so forsaken. There is not the least pleasure in working
 for one's self. Nils, give me someone and something to work for.
 
 _Krogstad_. I don't trust that. It is nothing but a woman's overstrained
 sense of generosity that prompts you to make such an offer of your self.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Have you ever noticed anything of the sort in me?
 
 _Krogstad_. Could you really do it? Tell me--do you know all about my
 past life?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes.
 
 _Krogstad_. And do you know what they think of me here?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. You seemed to me to imply that with me you might have been
 quite another man.
 
 _Krogstad_. I am certain of it.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Is it too late now?
 
 _Krogstad_. Christine, are you saying this deliberately? Yes, I am sure
 you are. I see it in your face. Have you really the courage, then--?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. I want to be a mother to someone, and your children need a
 mother. We two need each other. Nils, I have faith in your real
 character--I can dare anything together with you.
 
 _Krogstad_ (_grasps her hands_). Thanks, thanks, Christine! Now I shall
 find a way to clear myself in the eyes of the world. Ah, but I forgot--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_listening_). Hush! The Tarantella! Go, go!
 
 _Krogstad_. Why? What is it?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Do you hear them up there? When that is over, we may
 expect them back.
 
 _Krogstad_. Yes, yes--I will go. But it is all no use. Of course you are
 not aware what steps I have taken in the matter of the Helmers.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, I know all about that.
 
 _Krogstad_. And in spite of that have you the courage to--?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. I understand very well to what lengths a man like you
 might be driven by despair.
 
 _Krogstad_. If I could only undo what I have done!
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. You cannot. Your letter is lying in the letter-box now.
 
 _Krogstad_. Are you sure of that?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Quite sure, but--
 
 _Krogstad_ (_with a searching look at her_). Is that what it all
 means?--that you want to save your friend at any cost? Tell me frankly.
 Is that it?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Nils, a woman who has once sold herself for another's
 sake, doesn't do it a second time.
 
 _Krogstad_. I will ask for my letter back.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. No, no.
 
 _Krogstad_. Yes, of course I will. I will wait here till Helmer comes; I
 will tell him he must give me my letter back--that it only concerns my
 dismissal--that he is not to read it--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. No, Nils, you must not recall your letter.
 
 _Krogstad._ But, tell me, wasn't it for that very purpose that you asked
 me to meet you here?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. In my first moment of fright, it was. But twenty-four
 hours have elapsed since then, and in that time I have witnessed
 incredible things in this house. Helmer must know all about it. This
 unhappy secret must be enclosed; they must have a complete understanding
 between them, which is impossible with all this concealment and
 falsehood going on.
 
 _Krogstad_. Very well, if you will take the responsibility. But there is
 one thing I can do in any case, and I shall do it at once.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_listening_). You must be quick and go! The dance is over;
 we are not safe a moment longer.
 
 _Krogstad_. I will wait for you below.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, do. You must see me back to my door.
 
 _Krogstad_. I have never had such an amazing piece of good fortune in my
 life! (_Goes out through the outer door. The door between the room and
 the hall remains open_.)
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_tidying up the room and laying her hat and cloak ready_).
 What a difference! What a difference! Someone to work for and live
 for--a home to bring comfort into. That I will do, indeed. I wish they
 would be quick and come. (_Listens._) Ah, there they are now. I must put
 on my things. (_Takes up her hat and cloak_. HELMER'S _and_ NORA'S
 _voices are heard outside; a key is turned, and_ HELMER _brings_ NORA
 _almost by force into the hall. She is in an Italian costume with a
 large black shawl round her; he is in evening dress, and a black domino
 which is flying open_.)
 
 _Nora_ (_hanging back in the doorway, and struggling with him_). No, no,
 no!--don't take me in. I want to go upstairs again; I don't want to
 leave so early.
 
 _Helmer_. But, my dearest Nora--
 
 _Nora_. Please, Torvald dear--please, _please_--only an hour more.
 
 _Helmer_. Not a single minute, my sweet Nora. You know that was our
 agreement. Come along into the room; you are catching cold standing
 there. (_He brings her gently into the room, in spite of her
 resistance_.)
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Good evening.
 
 _Nora_. Christine!
 
 _Helmer_. You here, so late, Mrs. Linde?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, you must excuse me; I was so anxious to see Nora in
 her dress.
 
 _Nora_. Have you been sitting here waiting for me?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, unfortunately I came too late, you had already gone
 upstairs; and I thought I couldn't go away again without having seen
 you.
 
 _Helmer_ (_taking off_ NORA'S _shawl_). Yes, take a good look at her. I
 think she is worth looking at. Isn't she charming, Mrs. Linde?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, indeed she is.
 
 _Helmer_. Doesn't she look remarkably pretty? Everyone thought so at the
 dance. But she is terribly self-willed, this sweet little person. What
 are we to do with her? You will hardly believe that I had almost to
 bring her away by force.
 
 _Nora_. Torvald, you will repent not having let me stay, even if it were
 only for half an hour.
 
 _Helmer_. Listen to her, Mrs. Linde! She had danced her Tarantella, and
 it had been a tremendous success, as it deserved--although possibly the
 performance was a trifle too realistic--little more so, I mean, than
 was strictly compatible with the limitations of art. But never mind
 about that! The chief thing is, she had made a success--she had made a
 tremendous success. Do you think I was going to let her remain there
 after that, and spoil the effect? No, indeed! I took my charming little
 Capri maiden--my capricious little Capri maiden, I should say--on my
 arm; took one quick turn round the room; a curtsey on either side, and,
 as they say in novels, the beautiful apparition disappeared. An exit
 ought always to be effective, Mrs. Linde; but that is what I cannot make
 Nora understand. Pooh! this room is hot. (_Throws his domino on a chair,
 and opens the door of his room_.) Hullo! it's all dark in here. Oh, of
 course--excuse me--. (_He goes in, and lights some candles_.)
 
 _Nora_ (_in a hurried and breathless whisper_). Well?
 
 _Mrs. Linde._ (_in a low voice_). I have had a talk with him.
 
 _Nora._ Yes, and--
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Nora, you must tell your husband all about it.
 
 _Nora_ (_in an expressionless voice_). I knew it.
 
 _Mrs. Linde._ You have nothing to be afraid of as far as Krogstad is
 concerned; but you must tell him.
 
 _Nora_. I won't tell him.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Then the letter will.
 
 _Nora_. Thank you, Christine. Now I know what I must do. Hush--!
 
 _Helmer_ (_coming in again_). Well, Mrs. Linde, have you admired her?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, and now I will say good-night.
 
 _Helmer_. What, already? Is this yours, this knitting?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_ (_taking it_). Yes, thank you, I had very nearly forgotten
 it.
 
 _Helmer_. So you knit?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Of course.
 
 _Helmer_. Do you know, you ought to embroider?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Really? Why?
 
 _Helmer_. Yes, it's far more becoming. Let me show you. You hold the
 embroidery thus in your left hand, and use the needle with the
 right--like this--with a long, easy sweep. Do you see?
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Yes, perhaps--
 
 _Helmer_. But in the case of knitting--that can never be anything but
 ungraceful; look here--the arms close together, the knitting-needles
 going up and down--it has a sort of Chinese effect--. That was really
 excellent champagne they gave us.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Well,--good-night, Nora, and don't be self-willed any
 more.
 
 _Helmer_. That's right, Mrs. Linde.
 
 _Mrs. Linde_. Good-night, Mr. Helmer.
 
 _Helmer_ (_accompanying her to the door_). Good-night, good-night. I
 hope you will get home all right. I should be very happy to--but you
 haven't any great distance to go. Good-night, good-night. (_She goes
 out; he shuts the door after her and comes in again_.) Ah!--at last we
 have got rid of her. She is a frightful bore, that woman.
 
 _Nora_. Aren't you very tired, Torvald?
 
 _Helmer_. No, not in the least.
 
 _Nora_. Nor sleepy?
 
 _Helmer_. Not a bit. On the contrary, I feel extraordinarily lively. And
 you?--you really look both tired and sleepy.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, I am very tired. I want to go to sleep at once.
 
 _Helmer_. There, you see it was quite right of me not to let you stay
 there any longer.
 
 _Nora_. Everything you do is quite right, Torvald.
 
 _Helmer_ (_kissing her on the forehead_). Now my little skylark is
 speaking reasonably. Did you notice what good spirits Rank was in this
 evening?
 
 _Nora_. Really? Was he? I didn't speak to him at all.
 
 _Helmer_. And I very little, but I have not for a long time seen him in
 such good form. (_Looks for a while at her and then goes nearer to
 her_.) It is delightful to be at home by ourselves again, to be all
 alone with you--you fascinating, charming little darling!
 
 _Nora_. Don't look at me like that, Torvald.
 
 _Helmer_. Why shouldn't I look at my dearest treasure?--at all the
 beauty that is mine, all my very own?
 
 _Nora_ (_going to the other side of the table_). You mustn't say things
 like that to me tonight.
 
 _Helmer_ (_following her_). You have still got the Tarantella in your
 blood, I see. And it makes you more captivating than ever. Listen--the
 guests are beginning to go now. (_In a lower voice_.) Nora--soon the
 whole house will be quiet.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, I hope so.
 
 _Helmer_. Yes, my own darling Nora. Do you know, when I am out at a
 party with you like this, why I speak so little to you, keep away from
 you, and only send a stolen glance in your direction now and then?--do
 you know why I do that? It is because I make believe to myself that we
 are secretly in love, and you are my secretly promised bride, and that
 no one suspects there is anything between us.
 
 _Nora_. Yes, yes--I know very well your thoughts are with me all the
 time.
 
 _Helmer_. And when we are leaving, and I am putting the shawl over your
 beautiful young shoulders--on your lovely neck--then I imagine that you
 are my young bride and that we have just come from the wedding, and I am
 bringing you for the first time into our home--to be alone with you for
 the first time--quite alone with my shy little darling! All this evening
 I have longed for nothing but you. When I watched the seductive figures
 of the Tarantella, my blood was on fire; I could endure it no longer,
 and that was why I brought you down so early--
 
 _Nora_. Go away, Torvald! You must let me go. I won't--
 
 _Helmer_. What's that? You're joking, my little Nora! You won't--you
 won't? Am I not your husband--? (_A knock is heard at the outer door_.)
 
 _Nora_ (_starting_). Did you hear--?
 
 _Helmer_ (_going into the hall_). Who is it?
 
 _Rank_ (_outside_). It is I. May I come in for a moment?
 
 _Helmer_ (_in a fretful whisper_). Oh, what does he want now? (_Aloud_.)
 Wait a minute? (_Unlocks the door_.) Come, that's kind of you not to
 pass by our door.
 
 _Rank_. I thought I heard your voice, and felt as if I should like to
 look in. (_With a swift glance round_.) Ah, yes!--these dear familiar
 rooms. You are very happy and cosy in here, you two.
 
 _Helmer_. It seems to me that you looked after yourself pretty well
 upstairs too.
 
 _Rank_. Excellently. Why shouldn't I? Why shouldn't one enjoy everything
 in this world?--at any rate as much as one can, and as long as one can.
 The wine was capital--
 
 _Helmer_. Especially the champagne.
 
 _Rank_. So you noticed that too? It is almost incredible how much I
 managed to put away!
 
 _Nora_. Torvald drank a great deal of champagne tonight, too.
 
 _Rank_. Did he?
 
 _Nora_. Yes, and he is always in such good spirits afterwards.
 
 _Rank_. Well, why should one not enjoy a merry evening after a
 well-spent day?
 
 _Helmer_. Well spent? I am afraid I can't take credit for that.
 
 _Rank_ (_clapping him on the back_). But I can, you know!
 
 _Nora_. Doctor Rank, you must have been occupied with some scientific
 investigation today.
 
 _Rank_. Exactly.
 
 _Helmer_. Just listen!--little Nora talking about scientific
 investigations!
 
 _Nora_. And may I congratulate you on the result?
 
 _Rank_. Indeed you may.
 
 _Nora_. Was it favourable, then.
 
 _Rank_. The best possible, for both doctor and patient--certainty.
 
 _Nora_ (_quickly and searchingly_). Certainty?
 
 _Rank_. Absolute certainty. So wasn't I entitled to make a merry evening
 of it after that?
 
 _Nora_. Yes, you certainly were, Doctor Rank.
 
 _Helmer_. I think so too, so long as you don't have to pay for it in the
 morning.
 
 _Rank_. Oh well, one can't have anything in this life without paying for
 it.
 
 _Nora_. Doctor Rank--are you fond of fancy-dress balls?
 
 _Rank_. Yes, if there is a fine lot of pretty costumes.
 
 _Nora_. Tell me--what shall we two wear at the next?
 
 _Helmer_. Little featherbrain!--are you thinking of the next already?
 
 _Rank_. We two? Yes, I can tell you. You shall go as a good fairy--
 
 _Helmer_. Yes, but what do you suggest as an appropriate costume for
 that?
 
 _Rank_. Let your wife go dressed just as she is in every-day life.
 
 _Helmer_. That was really very prettily turned. But can't you tell us
 what you will be?
 
 _Rank_. Yes, my dear friend, I have quite made up my mind about that.
 
 _Helmer_. Well?
 
 _Rank_. At the next fancy-dress ball I shall be invisible.
 
 _Helmer_ That's a good joke!
 
 _Rank_. There is a big black hat--have you never heard of hats that make
 you invisible? If you put one on, no one can see you.
 
 _Helmer_ (_suppressing a smile_). Yes, you are quite right.
 
 _Rank_. But I am clean forgetting what I came for. Helmer, give me a
 cigar--one of the dark Havanas.
 
 _Helmer_. With the greatest pleasure. (_Offers him his case_.)
 
 _Rank_ (_takes a cigar and cuts off the end_). Thanks.
 
 _Nora_ (_striking a match_). Let me give you a light.
 
 _Rank_. Thank you. (_She holds the match for him to light his cigar_.)
 And now good-bye!
 
 _Helmer_. Good-bye, good-bye, dear old man!
 
 _Nora_. Sleep well, Doctor Rank.
 
 _Rank_. Thank you for that wish.
 
 _Nora_. Wish me the same.
 
 _Rank_. You? Well, if you want me to sleep well! And thanks for the
 light. (_He nods to them both and goes out_.)
 
 _Helmer_ (_in a subdued voice_). He has drunk more than he ought.
 
 _Nora_ (_absently_). Maybe. (HELMER _takes a bunch of keys out of his
 pocket and goes into the hall_.) Torvald! what are you going to do
 there?
 
 _Helmer_. Empty the letter-box; it is quite full; there will be no room
 to put the newspaper in to-morrow morning.
 
 _Nora._ Are you going to work to-night?
 
 _Helmer_. You know quite well I'm not. What is this? Some one has been
 at the lock.
 
 _Nora_. At the lock?
 
 _Helmer_. Yes, someone has. What can it mean? I should never have
 thought the maid--. Here is a broken hairpin. Nora, it is one of yours.
 
 _Nora_ (_quickly_). Then it must have been the children--
 
 _Helmer_. Then you must get them out of those ways. There, at last I
 have got it open. (_Takes out the contents of the letter-box, and calls
 to the kitchen_.) Helen!--Helen, put out the light over the front door.
 (_Goes back into the room and shuts the door into the hall. He holds out
 his hand full of letters_.) Look at that--look what a heap of them there
 are. (_Turning them over_.) What on earth is that?
 
 _Nora_ (_at the window_). The letter--No! Torvald, no!
 
 _Helmer._ Two cards--of Rank's.
 
 _Nora._ Of Doctor Rank's?
 
 _Helmer_ (_looking at them_). Doctor Rank. They were on the top. He must
 have put them in when he went out.
 
 _Nora._ Is there anything written on them?
 
 _Helmer._ There is a black cross over the name. Look there--what an
 uncomfortable idea! It looks as If he were announcing his own death.
 
 _Nora._ It is just what he is doing.
 
 _Helmer._ What? Do you know anything about it? Has he said anything to
 you?
 
 _Nora._ Yes. He told me that when the cards came it would be his
 leave-taking from us. He means to shut himself up and die.
 
 _Helmer._ My poor old friend. Certainly I knew we should not have him
 very long with us. But so soon! And so he hides himself away like a
 wounded animal.
 
 _Nora._ If it has to happen, it is best it should be without a
 word--don't you think so, Torvald?
 
 _Helmer_ (_walking up and down_). He has so grown into our lives. I
 can't think of him as having gone out of them. He, with his sufferings
 and his loneliness, was like a cloudy background to our sunlit
 happiness. Well, perhaps it is best so. For him, anyway. (_Standing
 still._) And perhaps for us too, Nora. We two are thrown quite upon each
 other now. (_Puts his arms around her._) My darling wife, I don't feel
 as if I could hold you tight enough. Do you know, Nora, I have often
 wished that you might be threatened by some great danger, so that I
 might risk my life's blood, and everything, for your sake.
 
 _Nora_ (_disengages herself, and says firmly and decidedly_). Now you
 must read your letters, Torvald.
 
 _Helmer._ No, no; not tonight. I want to be with you, my darling wife.
 
 _Nora._ With the thought of your friend's death--
 
 _Helmer._ You are right, it has affected us both. Something ugly has
 come between us--the thought of the horrors of death. We must try and
 rid our minds of that. Until then--we will each go to our own room.
 
 _Nora_ (_hanging on his neck_). Good-night, Torvald--Good-night!
 
 _Helmer_ (_kissing her on the forehead_). Good-night, my little
 singing-bird. Sleep sound, Nora. Now I will read my letters through.
 (_He takes his letters and goes into his room, shutting the door after
 him._)
 
 _Nora_ (_gropes distractedly about, seizes_ HELMER'S _domino, throws it
 round her, while she says in quick, hoarse, spasmodic whispers_). Never
 to see him again. Never! Never! (_Puts her shawl over her head._) Never
 to see my children again either--never again. Never! Never!--Ah! the
 icy, black water--the unfathomable depths--If only it were over! He has
 got it now--now he is reading it. Good-bye, Torvald and my children!
 (_She is about to rush out through the hall, when_ HELMER _opens his
 door hurriedly and stands with an open letter in his hand._)
 
 _Helmer._ Nora!
 
 _Nora._ Ah!--
 
 _Helmer._ What is this? Do you know what is in this letter?
 
 _Nora._ Yes, I know. Let me go! Let me get out!
 
 _Helmer_ (_holding her back_). Where are you going?
 
 _Nora_ (_trying to get free_). You shan't save me, Torvald!
 
 _Helmer_ (_reeling_). True? Is this true, that I read here? Horrible!
 No, no--it is impossible that it can be true.
 
 _Nora._ It is true. I have loved you above everything else in the world.
 
 _Helmer._ Oh, don't let us have any silly excuses.
 
 _Nora_ (_taking a step towards him_). Torvald--!
 
 _Helmer._ Miserable creature--what have you done?
 
 _Nora._ Let me go. You shall not suffer for my sake. You shall not take
 it upon yourself.
 
 _Helmer._ No tragedy airs, please. (_Locks the hall door._) Here you
 shall stay and give me an explanation. Do you understand what you have
 done? Answer me? Do you understand what you have done?
 
 _Nora_ (_looks steadily at him and says with a growing look of coldness
 in her face_). Yes, now I am beginning to understand thoroughly.
 
 _Helmer_ (_walking about the room_). What a horrible awakening! All
 these eight years--she who was my joy and pride--a hypocrite, a
 liar--worse, worse--a criminal! The unutterable ugliness of it all!--For
 shame! For shame! (NORA _is silent and looks steadily at him. He stops
 in front of her._) I ought to have suspected that something of the sort
 would happen. I ought to have foreseen it. All your father's want of
 principle--be silent!--all your father's want of principle has come out
 in you. No religion, no morality, no sense of duty--How I am punished
 for having winked at what he did! I did it for your sake, and this is
 how you repay me.
 
 _Nora._ Yes, that's just it.
 
 _Helmer._ Now you have destroyed all my happiness. You have ruined
 all my future. It is horrible to think of! I am in the power of an
 unscrupulous man; he can do what he likes with me, ask anything he likes
 of me, give me any orders he pleases--I dare not refuse. And I must sink
 to such miserable depths because of a thoughtless woman!
 
 _Nora._ When I am out of the way, you will be free.
 
 _Helmer._ No fine speeches, please. Your father had always plenty of
 those ready, too. What good would it be to me if you were out of the
 way, as you say? Not the slightest. He can make the affair known
 everywhere; and if he does, I may be falsely suspected of having been
 a party to your criminal action. Very likely people will think I was
 behind it all--that it was I who prompted you! And I have to thank you
 for all this--you whom I have cherished during the whole of our married
 life. Do you understand now what it is you have done for me?
 
 _Nora_ (_coldly and quietly_). Yes.
 
 _Helmer._ It is so incredible that I can't take it in. But we must come
 to some understanding. Take off that shawl. Take it off, I tell you. I
 must try and appease him some way or another. The matter must be hushed
 up at any cost. And as for you and me, it must appear as if everything
 between us were as before--but naturally only in the eyes of the world.
 You will still remain in my house, that is a matter of course. But I
 shall not allow you to bring up the children; I dare not trust them to
 you. To think that I should be obliged to say so to one whom I have
 loved so dearly, and whom I still--. No, that is all over. From this
 moment happiness is not the question; all that concerns us is to save
 the remains, the fragments, the appearance--
 
 (_A ring is heard at the front-door bell._)
 
 _Helmer_ (_with a start_). What is that? So late! Can the worst--? Can
 he--? Hide yourself, Nora. Say you are ill.
 
 (NORA _stands motionless._ HELMER _goes and unlocks the hall door._)
 
 _Maid_ (_half-dressed, comes to the door_). A letter for the mistress.
 
 _Helmer._ Give it to me. (_Takes the letter, and shuts the door._) Yes,
 it is from him. You shall not have it; I will read it myself.
 
 _Nora._ Yes, read it.
 
 _Helmer_ (_standing by the lamp_). I scarcely have the courage to do it.
 It may mean ruin for both of us. No, I must know. (_Tears open the
 letter, runs his eye over a few lines, looks at a paper enclosed, and
 gives a shout of joy._) Nora! (_She looks at him, questioningly._) Nora!
 No, I must read it once again--. Yes, it is true! I am saved! Nora, I am
 saved!
 
 _Nora._ And I?
 
 _Helmer._ You too, of course; we are both saved, both saved, both you
 and I. Look, he sends you your bond back. He says he regrets and
 repents--that a happy change in his life--never mind what he says! We
 are saved, Nora! No one can do anything to you. Oh, Nora, Nora!--no,
 first I must destroy these hateful things. Let me see--. (_Takes a look
 at the bond._) No, no, I won't look at it. The whole thing shall be
 nothing but a bad dream to me. (_Tears up the bond and both letters,
 throws them all into the stove, and watches them burn._) There--now it
 doesn't exist any longer. He says that since Christmas Eve you--. These
 must have been three dreadful days for you, Nora.
 
 _Nora._ I have fought a hard fight these three days.
 
 _Helmer._ And suffered agonies, and seen no way out but--. No, we won't
 call any of the horrors to mind. We will only shout with joy, and keep
 saying, "It's all over! It's all over!" Listen to me, Nora. You don't
 seem to realise that it is all over. What is this?--such a cold, set
 face! My poor little Nora, I quite understand; you don't feel as if you
 could believe that I have forgiven you. But it is true, Nora, I swear
 it; I have forgiven you everything. I know that what you did, you did
 out of love for me.
 
 _Nora._ That is true.
 
 _Helmer._ You have loved me as a wife ought to love her husband. Only
 you had not sufficient knowledge to judge of the means you used. But do
 you suppose you are any the less dear to me, because you don't
 understand how to act on your own responsibility? No, no; only lean on
 me; I will advise you and direct you. I should not be a man if this
 womanly helplessness did not just give you a double attractiveness in my
 eyes. You must not think any more about the hard things I said in my
 first moment of consternation, when I thought everything was going to
 overwhelm me. I have forgiven you, Nora; I swear to you I have forgiven
 you.
 
 _Nora._ Thank you for your forgiveness. (_She goes out through the door
 to the right._)
 
 _Helmer._ No, don't go--. (_Looks in._) What are you doing in there?
 
 _Nora_ (_from within_). Taking off my fancy dress.
 
 _Helmer_ (_standing at the open door_). Yes, do. Try and calm yourself,
 and make your mind easy again, my frightened little singing-bird. Be at
 rest, and feel secure; I have broad wings to shelter you under. (_Walks
 up and down by the door._) How warm and cosy our home is, Nora. Here is
 shelter for you; here I will protect you like a hunted dove that I have
 saved from a hawk's claws; I will bring peace to your poor beating
 heart. It will come, little by little, Nora, believe me. To-morrow
 morning you will look upon it all quite differently; soon everything
 will be just as it was before. Very soon you won't need me to assure you
 that I have forgiven you; you will yourself feel the certainty that I
 have done so. Can you suppose I should ever think of such a thing as
 repudiating you, or even reproaching you? You have no idea what a true
 man's heart is like, Nora. There is something so indescribably sweet and
 satisfying, to a man, in the knowledge that he has forgiven his
 wife--forgiven her freely, and with all his heart. It seems as if that
 had made her, as it were, doubly his own; he has given her a new life,
 so to speak; and she is in a way become both wife and child to him. So
 you shall be for me after this, my little scared, helpless darling. Have
 no anxiety about anything, Nora; only be frank and open with me, and I
 will serve as will and conscience both to you--. What is this? Not gone
 to bed? Have you changed your things?
 
 _Nora_ (_in everyday dress_). Yes, Torvald, I have changed my things
 now.
 
 _Helmer._ But what for?--so late as this.
 
 _Nora._ I shall not sleep tonight.
 
 _Helmer._ But, my dear Nora--
 
 _Nora_ (_looking at her watch_). It is not so very late. Sit down here,
 Torvald. You and I have much to say to one another. (_She sits down at
 one side of the table_.)
 
 _Helmer._ Nora--what is this?--this cold, set face?
 
 _Nora._ Sit down. It will take some time; I have a lot to talk over with
 you.
 
 _Helmer_ (_sits down at the opposite side of the table_). You alarm me,
 Nora!--and I don't understand you.
 
 _Nora._ No, that is just it. You don't understand me, and I have never
 understood you either--before tonight. No, you mustn't interrupt me. You
 must simply listen to what I say. Torvald, this is a settling of
 accounts.
 
 _Helmer._ What do you mean by that?
 
 _Nora_ (_after a short silence_). Isn't there one thing that strikes you
 as strange in our sitting here like this?
 
 _Helmer._ What is that?
 
 _Nora._ We have been married now eight years. Does it not occur to you
 that this is the first time we two, you and I, husband and wife, have
 had a serious conversation?
 
 _Helmer._ What do you mean by serious?
 
 _Nora._ In all these eight years--longer than that--from the very
 beginning of our acquaintance, we have never exchanged a word on any
 serious subject.
 
 _Helmer._ Was it likely that I would be continually and forever telling
 you about worries that you could not help me to bear?
 
 _Nora._ I am not speaking about business matters. I say that we have
 never sat down in earnest together to try and get at the bottom of
 anything.
 
 _Helmer._ But, dearest Nora, would it have been any good to you?
 
 _Nora._ That is just it; you have never understood me. I have been
 greatly wronged, Torvald--first by papa and then by you.
 
 _Helmer._ What! By us two--by us two, who have loved you better than
 anyone else in in the world?
 
 _Nora_ (_shaking her head_). You have never loved me. You have only
 thought it pleasant to be in love with me.
 
 _Helmer._ Nora, what do I hear you saying?
 
 _Nora._ It is perfectly true, Torvald. When I was at home with papa, he
 told me his opinion about everything, and so I had the same opinions;
 and if I differed from him I concealed the fact, because he would not
 have liked it. He called me his doll-child, and he played with me just
 as I used to play with my dolls. And when I came to live with you--
 
 _Helmer._ What sort of an expression is that to use about our marriage?
 
 _Nora_ (_undisturbed_). I mean that I was simply transferred from papa's
 hands into yours. You arranged everything according to your own taste,
 and so I got the same tastes as you--or else I pretended to, I am really
 not quite sure which--I think sometimes the one and sometimes the other.
 When I look back on it, it seems to me as if I had been living here like
 a poor woman--just from hand to mouth. I have existed merely to perform
 tricks for you, Torvald. But you would have it so. You and papa have
 committed a great sin against me. It is your fault that I have made
 nothing of my life.
 
 _Helmer_. How unreasonable and how ungrateful you are, Nora! Have you
 not been happy here?
 
 _Nora_. No, I have never been happy. I thought I was, but it has never
 really been so.
 
 _Helmer_. Not--not happy!
 
 _Nora_. No, only merry. And you have always been so kind to me. But our
 home has been nothing but a playroom. I have been your doll-wife, just
 as at home I was papa's doll-child; and here the children have been my
 dolls. I thought it great fun when you played with me, just as they
 thought it great fun when I played with them. That is what our marriage
 has been, Torvald.
 
 _Helmer_. There is some truth in what you say--exaggerated and strained
 as your view of it is. But for the future it shall be different.
 Playtime shall be over, and lesson-time shall begin.
 
 _Nora_. Whose lessons? Mine, or the children's?
 
 _Helmer_. Both yours and the children's, my darling Nora.
 
 _Nora_. Alas, Torvald, you are not the man to educate me into being a
 proper wife for you.
 
 _Helmer_. And you can say that!
 
 _Nora_. And I--how am I fitted to bring up the children?
 
 _Helmer_. Nora!
 
 _Nora_. Didn't you say so yourself a little while ago--that you dare not
 trust me to bring them up?
 
 _Helmer_. In a moment of anger! Why do you pay any heed to that?
 
 _Nora_. Indeed, you were perfectly right. I am not fit for the task.
 There is another task I must undertake first. I must try and educate
 myself--you are not the man to help me in that. I must do that for
 myself. And that is why I am going to leave you now.
 
 _Helmer_ (_springing up_). What do you say?
 
 _Nora_. I must stand quite alone, if I am to understand myself and
 everything about me. It is for that reason that I cannot remain with you
 any longer.
 
 _Helmer_. Nora, Nora!
 
 _Nora_. I am going away from here now, at once. I am sure Christine will
 take me in for the night--
 
 _Helmer_. You are out of your mind! I won't allow it! I forbid you!
 
 _Nora_. It is no use forbidding me anything any longer. I will take with
 me what belongs to myself. I will take nothing from you, either now or
 later.
 
 _Helmer_. What sort of madness is this!
 
 _Nora_. Tomorrow I shall go home--I mean to my old home. It will be
 easiest for me to find something to do there.
 
 _Helmer_. You blind, foolish woman!
 
 _Nora_. I must try and get some sense, Torvald.
 
 _Helmer_. To desert your home, your husband and your children! And you
 don't consider what people will say!
 
 _Nora_. I cannot consider that at all. I only know that it is necessary
 for me.
 
 _Helmer_. It's shocking. This is how you would neglect your most sacred
 duties.
 
 _Nora_. What do you consider my most sacred duties?
 
 _Helmer_. Do I need to tell you that? Are they not your duties to your
 husband and your children?
 
 _Nora_. I have other duties just as sacred.
 
 _Helmer_. That you have not. What duties could those be?
 
 _Nora_. Duties to myself.
 
 _Helmer_. Before all else, you are a wife and mother.
 
 _Nora_. I don't believe that any longer. I believe that before all else
 I am a reasonable human being, just as you are--or, at all events, that
 I must try and become one. I know quite well, Torvald, that most people
 would think you right, and that views of that kind are to be found in
 books; but I can no longer content myself with what most people say, or
 with what is found in books. I must think over things for myself and get
 to understand them.
 
 _Helmer_. Can you not understand your place in your own home? Have you
 not a reliable guide in such matters as that?--have you no religion?
 
 _Nora_. I am afraid, Torvald, I do not exactly know what religion is.
 
 _Helmer_. What are you saying?
 
 _Nora_. I know nothing but what the clergyman said, when I went to be
 confirmed. He told us that religion was this, and that, and the other.
 When I am away from all this, and am alone, I will look into that matter
 too. I will see if what the clergyman said is true, or at all events if
 it is true for me.
 
 _Helmer_. This is unheard of in a girl of your age! But if religion
 cannot lead you aright, let me try and awaken your conscience. I suppose
 you have some moral sense? Or--answer me--am I to think you have none?
 
 _Nora_. I assure you, Torvald, that is not an easy question to answer.
 I really don't know. The thing perplexes me altogether. I only know that
 you and I look at it in quite a different light. I am learning, too,
 that the law is quite another thing from what I supposed; but I find it
 impossible to convince myself that the law is right. According to it a
 woman has no right to spare her old dying father, or to save her
 husband's life. I can't believe that.
 
 _Helmer_. You talk like a child. You don't understand the conditions of
 the world in which you live.
 
 _Nora_. No, I don't. But now I am going to try. I am going to see if I
 can make out who is right, the world or I.
 
 _Helmer_. You are ill, Nora; you are delirious; I almost think you are
 out of your mind.
 
 _Nora_. I have never felt my mind so clear and certain as to-night.
 
 _Helmer_. And is it with a clear and certain mind that you forsake your
 husband and your children?
 
 _Nora_. Yes, it is.
 
 _Helmer_. Then there is only one possible explanation.
 
 _Nora_. What is that?
 
 _Helmer_. You do not love me any more.
 
 _Nora_. No, that is just it.
 
 _Helmer_. Nora!--and you can say that?
 
 _Nora_. It gives me great pain, Torvald, for you have always been so
 kind to me, but I cannot help it. I do not love you any more.
 
 _Helmer_ (_regaining his composure_). Is that a clear and certain
 conviction too?
 
 _Nora_. Yes, absolutely clear and certain. That is the reason why I will
 not stay here any longer.
 
 _Helmer_. And can you tell me what I have done to forfeit your love?
 
 _Nora_. Yes, indeed I can. It was to-night, when the wonderful thing did
 not happen; then I saw you were not the man I had thought you.
 
 _Helmer_. Explain yourself better--I don't understand you.
 
 _Nora_. I have waited so patiently for eight years; for, goodness knows,
 I knew very well that wonderful things don't happen every day. Then this
 horrible misfortune came upon me; and then I felt quite certain that the
 wonderful thing was going to happen at last. When Krogstad's letter was
 lying out there, never for a moment did I imagine that you would consent
 to accept this man's conditions. I was so absolutely certain that you
 would say to him: Publish the thing to the whole world. And when that
 was done--
 
 _Helmer_. Yes, what then?--when I had exposed my wife to shame and
 disgrace?
 
 _Nora_. When that was done, I was so absolutely certain, you would come
 forward and take everything upon yourself, and say: I am the guilty one.
 
 _Helmer_. Nora--!
 
 _Nora_. You mean that I would never have accepted such a sacrifice on
 your part? No, of course not. But what would my assurances have been
 worth against yours? That was the wonderful thing which I hoped for and
 feared; and it was to prevent that, that I wanted to kill myself.
 
 _Helmer_. I would gladly work night and day for you, Nora--bear sorrow
 and want for your sake. But no man would sacrifice his honour for the
 one he loves.
 
 _Nora_. It is a thing hundreds of thousands of women have done.
 
 _Helmer_. Oh, you think and talk like a heedless child.
 
 _Nora_. Maybe. But you neither think nor talk like the man I could bind
 myself to. As soon as your fear was over--and it was not fear for what
 threatened me, but for what might happen to you--when the whole thing
 was past, as far as you were concerned it was exactly as if nothing at
 all had happened. Exactly as before, I was your little skylark, your
 doll, which you would in future treat with doubly gentle care, because
 it was so brittle and fragile. (_Getting up_.) Torvald--it was then it
 dawned upon me that for eight years I had been living here with a
 strange man, and had borne him three children--. Oh! I can't bear to
 think of it! I could tear myself into little bits!
 
 _Helmer_ (_sadly_). I see, I see. An abyss has opened between us--there
 is no denying it. But, Nora, would it not be possible to fill it up?
 
 _Nora_. As I am now, I am no wife for you.
 
 _Helmer_. I have it in me to become a different man.
 
 _Nora_. Perhaps--if your doll is taken away from you.
 
 _Helmer_. But to part!--to part from you! No, no, Nora, I can't
 understand that idea.
 
 _Nora_ (_going out to the right_). That makes it all the more certain
 that it must be done. (_She comes back with her cloak and hat and a
 small bag which she puts on a chair by the table_.)
 
 _Helmer_. Nora, Nora, not now! Wait till tomorrow.
 
 _Nora_ (_putting on her cloak_). I cannot spend the night in a strange
 man's room.
 
 _Helmer_. But can't we live here like brother and sister--?
 
 _Nora_ (_putting on her hat_). You know very well that would not last
 long. (_Puts the shawl round her_.) Good-bye, Torvald. I won't see the
 little ones. I know they are in better hands than mine. As I am now, I
 can be of no use to them.
 
 _Helmer_. But some day, Nora--some day?
 
 _Nora_. How can I tell? I have no idea what is going to become of me.
 
 _Helmer_. But you are my wife, whatever becomes of you.
 
 _Nora_. Listen, Torvald. I have heard that when a wife deserts her
 husband's house, as I am doing now, he is legally freed from all
 obligations towards her. In any case I set you free from all your
 obligations. You are not to feel yourself bound in the slightest way,
 any more than I shall. There must be perfect freedom on both sides.
 See, here is your ring back. Give me mine.
 
 _Helmer_. That too?
 
 _Nora_. That too.
 
 _Helmer_. Here it is.
 
 _Nora_. That's right. Now it is all over. I have put the keys here.
 The maids know all about everything in the house--better than I do.
 Tomorrow, after I have left her, Christine will come here and pack up
 my own things that I brought with me from home. I will have them sent
 after me.
 
 _Helmer_. All over! All over!--Nora, shall you never think of me again?
 
 _Nora_. I know I shall often think of you and the children and this
 house.
 
 _Helmer_. May I write to you, Nora?
 
 _Nora_. No--never. You must not do that.
 
 _Helmer_. But at least let me send you--
 
 _Nora_. Nothing--nothing--
 
 _Helmer_. Let me help you if you are in want.
 
 _Nora_. No. I can receive nothing from a stranger.
 
 _Helmer_. Nora--can I never be anything more than a stranger to you?
 
 _Nora_ (_taking her bag_). Ah, Torvald, the most wonderful thing of all
 would have to happen.
 
 _Helmer_. Tell me what that would be!
 
 _Nora_. Both you and I would have to be so changed that--. Oh, Torvald,
 I don't believe any longer in wonderful things happening.
 
 _Helmer_. But I will believe in it. Tell me? So changed that--?
 
 _Nora_. That our life together would be a real wedlock. Good-bye. (_She
 goes out through the hall_.)
 
 _Helmer_ (_sinks down on a chair at the door and buries his face in his
 hands_). Nora! Nora! (_Looks round, and rises_.) Empty. She is gone. (_A
 hope flashes across his mind_.) The most wonderful thing of all--?
 
 (_The sound of a door shutting is heard from below_.)

 ACT 1
 
 
 (SCENE--The sitting-room at Rosmersholm; a spacious room, comfortably
 furnished in old-fashioned style. In the foreground, against the
 right-hand wall, is a stove decorated with sprigs of fresh birch and
 wild flowers. Farther back, a door. In the back wall folding doors
 leading into the entrance hall. In the left-hand wall a window, in
 front of which is a stand filled with flowers and plants. Near the
 stove stand a table, a couch and an easy-chair. The walls are hung
 round with portraits, dating from various periods, of clergymen,
 military officers and other officials in uniform. The window is open,
 and so are the doors into the lobby and the outer door. Through the
 latter is seen an avenue of old trees leading to a courtyard. It is a
 summer evening, after sunset. REBECCA WEST is sitting by the window
 crocheting a large white woollen shawl, which is nearly completed. From
 time to time she peeps out of window through the flowers. MRS. HELSETH
 comes in from the right.)
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Hadn't I better begin and lay the table for supper, miss?
 
 Rebecca. Yes, do. Mr. Rosmer ought to be in directly.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Isn't there a draught where you are sitting, miss?
 
 Rebecca. There is a little. Will you shut up, please? (MRS. HELSETH
 goes to the hall door and shuts it. Then she goes to the window, to
 shut it, and looks out.)
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Isn't that Mr. Rosmer coming there?
 
 Rebecca. Where? (Gets up.) Yes, it is he. (Stands behind the
 window-curtain.) Stand on one side. Don't let him catch sight of us.
 
 Mrs. Helseth (stepping back). Look, miss--he is beginning to use the
 mill path again.
 
 Rebecca. He came by the mill path the day before yesterday too. (Peeps
 out between the curtain and the window-frame). Now we shall see
 whether--
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Is he going over the wooden bridge?
 
 Rebecca. That is just what I want to see. (After a moment.) No. He has
 turned aside. He is coming the other way round to-day too. (Comes away
 from the window.) It is a long way round.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Yes, of course. One can well understand his shrinking
 from going over that bridge. The spot where such a thing has happened
 is--
 
 Rebecca (folding up her work). They cling to their dead a long time at
 Rosmersholm.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. If you ask me, miss, I should say it is the dead that
 cling to Rosmersholm a long time.
 
 Rebecca (looking at her). The dead?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Yes, one might almost say that they don't seem to be able
 to tear themselves away from those they have left behind.
 
 Rebecca. What puts that idea into your head?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Well, otherwise I know the White Horses would not be seen
 here.
 
 Rebecca. Tell me, Mrs. Helseth--what is this superstition about the
 White Horses?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Oh, it is not worth talking about. I am sure you don't
 believe in such things, either.
 
 Rebecca. Do you believe in them?
 
 Mrs. Helseth (goes to the window and shuts it). Oh, I am not going to
 give you a chance of laughing at me, miss. (Looks out.) See--is that
 not Mr. Rosmer out on the mill path again?
 
 Rebecca (looking out). That man out there? (Goes to the window.) Why,
 that is Mr. Kroll, of course!
 
 Mrs. Helseth. So it is, to be sure.
 
 Rebecca. That is delightful, because he is certain to be coming here.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. He actually comes straight over the wooden bridge, he
 does for all that she was his own sister. Well, I will go in and get
 the supper laid, miss. (Goes out to the right. REBECCA stands still for
 a moment, then waves her hand out of the window, nodding and smiling.
 Darkness is beginning to fall.)
 
 Rebecca (going to the door on the right and calling through it). Mrs.
 Helseth, I am sure you won't mind preparing something extra nice for
 supper? You know what dishes Mr. Kroll is especially fond of.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Certainly, miss. I will.
 
 Rebecca (opening the door into the lobby). At last, Mr. Kroll! I am so
 glad to see you!
 
 Kroll (coming into the lobby and putting down his stick). Thank you.
 Are you sure I am not disturbing you?
 
 Rebecca. You? How can you say such a thing?
 
 Kroll (coming into the room). You are always so kind. (Looks round the
 room.) Is John up in his room?
 
 Rebecca. No, he has gone out for a walk. He is later than usual of
 coming in, but he is sure to be back directly. (Points to the sofa.) Do
 sit down and wait for him.
 
 Kroll (putting down his hat). Thank you. (Sits down and looks about
 him.) How charmingly pretty you have made the old room look! Flowers
 everywhere!
 
 Rebecca. Mr. Rosmer is so fond of having fresh flowers about him.
 
 Kroll. And so are you, I should say.
 
 Rebecca. Yes, I am. I think their scent has such a delicious effect on
 one--and till lately we had to deny ourselves that pleasure, you know.
 
 Kroll (nodding slowly). Poor Beata could not stand the scent of them.
 
 Rebecca. Nor their colours either. They made her feel dazed.
 
 Kroll. Yes, I remember. (Continues in a more cheerful tone of voice).
 Well, and how are things going here?
 
 Rebecca. Oh, everything goes on in the same quiet, placid way. One day
 is exactly like another. And how are things with you? Is your wife--?
 
 Kroll. Oh, my dear Miss West, don't let us talk about my affairs. In a
 family there is always something or other going awry--especially in
 such times as we live in now.
 
 Rebecca (after a short pause, sitting down in an easy-chair near the
 sofa). Why have you never once been near us during the whole of your
 holidays?
 
 Kroll. Oh, it doesn't do to be importunate, you know.
 
 Rebecca. If you only knew how we have missed you.
 
 Kroll. And, besides, I have been away, you know.
 
 Rebecca. Yes, for a fortnight or so. I suppose you have been going the
 round of the public meetings?
 
 Kroll (nods). Yes, what do you say to that? Would you ever have thought
 I would become a political agitator in my old age--eh?
 
 Rebecca (smilingly). You have always been a little bit of an agitator,
 Mr. Kroll.
 
 Kroll. Oh, yes; just for my own amusement. But for the future it is
 going to be in real earnest. Do you ever read the Radical newspapers?
 
 Rebecca. Yes, I won't deny that!
 
 Kroll. My dear Miss West, there is no objection to that--not as far as
 you are concerned.
 
 Rebecca. No, that is just what I think. I must follow the course of
 events--keep up with what is happening.
 
 Kroll. Well, under any circumstances, I should never expect you, as a
 woman, to side actively with either party in the civic dispute--indeed
 one might more properly call it the civil war--that is raging here. I
 dare say you have read, then, the abuse these "nature's gentlemen" are
 pleased to shower upon me, and the scandalous coarseness they consider
 they are entitled to make use of?
 
 Rebecca. Yes, but I think you have held your own pretty forcibly.
 
 Kroll. That I have--though I say it. I have tasted blood now, and I
 will make them realise that I am not the sort of man to take it lying
 down--. (Checks himself.) No, no, do not let us get upon that sad and
 distressing topic this evening.
 
 Rebecca. No, my dear Mr. Kroll, certainly not.
 
 Kroll. Tell me, instead, how you find you get on at Rosmersholm, now
 that you are alone here--I mean, since our poor Beata--
 
 Rebecca. Oh, thanks--I get on very well here. Her death has made a
 great gap in the house in many ways, of course--and one misses her and
 grieves for her, naturally. But in other respects--
 
 Kroll. Do you think you will remain here?--permanently, I mean?
 
 Rebecca. Dear Mr. Kroll, I really never think about it at all. The fact
 is that I have become so thoroughly domesticated here that I almost
 feel as if I belonged to the place too.
 
 Kroll. You? I should think you did!
 
 Rebecca. And as long as Mr. Rosmer finds I can be any comfort or any
 use to him, I will gladly remain here, undoubtedly.
 
 Kroll (looking at her, with some emotion). You know, there is something
 splendid about a woman's sacrificing the whole of her youth for others.
 
 Rebecca. What else have I had to live for?
 
 Kroll. At first when you came here there was your perpetual worry with
 that unreasonable cripple of a foster-father of yours--
 
 Rebecca. You mustn't think that Dr. West was as unreasonable as that
 when we lived in Finmark. It was the trying journeys by sea that broke
 him up. But it is quite true that after we had moved here there were
 one or two hard years before his sufferings were over.
 
 Kroll. Were not the years that followed even harder for you?
 
 Rebecca. No; how can you say such a thing! I, who was so genuinely fond
 of Beata--! And she, poor soul was so sadly in need of care and
 sympathetic companionship.
 
 Kroll. You deserve to be thanked and rewarded for the forbearance with
 which you speak of her.
 
 Rebecca (moving a little nearer to him). Dear Mr. Kroll, you say that
 so kindly and so sincerely that I feel sure you really bear me no
 ill-will.
 
 Kroll. Ill-will? What do you mean?
 
 Rebecca. Well, it would not be so very surprising if it were rather
 painful for you to see me, a stranger, doing just as I like here at
 Rosmersholm.
 
 Kroll. How in the world could you think--!
 
 Rebecca. Then it is not so? (Holds out her hand to, him.) Thank you,
 Mr. Kroll; thank you for that.
 
 Kroll. But what on earth could make you take such an idea into your
 head?
 
 Rebecca. I began to be afraid it might be so, as you have so seldom
 been out here to see us lately.
 
 Kroll. I can assure you, you have been on the wrong scent entirely,
 Miss West. And, in any case, the situation of affairs is unchanged in
 any essential point; because during the last sad years of poor Beata's
 life it was you and you alone, even then, that looked after everything
 here.
 
 Rebecca. But it was more like a kind of regency in the wife's name.
 
 Kroll. Whatever it was, I--. I will tell you what, Miss West; as far as
 I am concerned I should have nothing whatever to say against it if you.
 But it doesn't do to say such things.
 
 Rebecca. What things?
 
 Kroll. Well, if it so happened that you were to step into the empty
 place--
 
 Rebecca. I have the place I want, already, Mr. Kroll.
 
 Kroll. Yes, as far as material benefits go; but not--
 
 Rebecca (interrupting him, in a serious voice). For shame, Mr. Kroll!
 How can you sit there and jest about such things!
 
 Kroll. Oh, well, I dare say our good John Rosmer thinks he has had more
 than enough of married life. But, all the same--
 
 Rebecca. Really, you almost make me feel inclined to laugh at you.
 
 Kroll. All the same--Tell me, Miss West, if I may be allowed the
 question, how old are you?
 
 Rebecca. I am ashamed to say I was twenty-nine on my last birthday, Mr.
 Kroll. I am nearly thirty.
 
 Kroll. Quite so. And Rosmer--how old is he? Let me see. He is five
 years younger than me, so he must be just about forty-three. It seems
 to me it would be very suitable.
 
 Rebecca. No doubt, no doubt. It would be remarkably suitable--Will you
 stop and have supper with us?
 
 Kroll. Thank you. I had meant to pay you a good long visit, because
 there is a matter I want to talk over with our excellent friend--Well,
 then, Miss West, to prevent your taking foolish ideas into your head
 again, I will come out here again from time to time, as in the old days.
 
 Rebecca. Yes, please do. (Holds out her hand to, him.) Thank you, thank
 you! You are really uncommonly good-natured.
 
 Kroll (with a little grumble). Am I? I can tell you that is more than
 they say at home. (ROSMER comes in by the door on the right.)
 
 Rebecca. Mr. Rosmer, do you see who is sitting here?
 
 Rosmer. Mrs. Helseth told me. (KROLL gets up.) I am so glad to see you
 here again, my dear fellow. (Puts his hands on KROLL'S shoulders and
 looks him in the face.) Dear old friend! I knew that one day we should
 be on our old footing again.
 
 Kroll. My dear fellow, have you that insane idea in your head too, that
 any thing could come between us?
 
 Rebecca (to ROSMER). Isn't it delightful to think it was all our
 imagination!
 
 Rosmer. Is that really true, Kroll? But why have you kept so
 obstinately away from us?
 
 Kroll (seriously, and in, a subdued voice). Because I did not want to
 come here like a living reminder of the unhappy time that is past--and
 of her who met her death in the mill-race.
 
 Rosmer. It was a very kind thought on your part. You are always so
 considerate. But it was altogether unnecessary to keep away from us on
 that account. Come along, let us sit down on the sofa. (They sit down.)
 I can assure you it is not in the least painful for me to think about
 Beata. We talk about her every day. She seems to us to have a part in
 the house still.
 
 Kroll. Does she really?
 
 Rebecca (lighting the lamp). Yes, it is really quite true.
 
 Rosmer. She really does. We both think so affectionately of her. And
 both Rebecca--both Miss West and I know in our hearts that we did all
 that lay in our power for the poor afflicted creature. We have nothing
 to reproach ourselves with. That is why I feel there is something sweet
 and peaceful in the way we can think of Beata now.
 
 Kroll. You dear good people! In future I am coming out to see you every
 day.
 
 Rebecca (sitting down in an arm-chair). Yes, let us see that you keep
 your word.
 
 Rosmer (with a slight hesitation). I assure you, my dear fellow, my
 dearest wish would be that our intimacy should never suffer in any way.
 You know, you have seemed to be my natural adviser as long as we have
 known one another, even from my student days.
 
 Kroll. I know, and I am very proud of the privilege. Is there by any
 chance anything in particular just now--?
 
 Rosmer. There are a great many things that I want very much to talk
 over with you frankly--things that lie very near my heart.
 
 Rebecca. I feel that is so, too, Mr. Rosmer. It seems to me it would be
 such a good thing if you two old friends--
 
 Kroll. Well, I can assure you I have even more to talk over with
 you--because I have become an active politician, as I dare say you know.
 
 Rosmer. Yes, I know you have. How did that come about?
 
 Kroll. I had to, you see, whether I liked it or not. It became
 impossible for me to remain an idle spectator any longer. Now that the
 Radicals have become so distressingly powerful, it was high time. And
 that is also why I have induced our little circle of friends in the
 town to bind themselves more definitely together. It was high time, I
 can tell you!
 
 Rebecca (with a slight smile). As a matter of fact, isn't it really
 rather late now?
 
 Kroll. There is no denying it would have been more fortunate if we had
 succeeded in checking the stream at an earlier point. But who could
 really foresee what was coming? I am sure I could not. (Gets up and
 walks up and down.) Anyway, my eyes are completely opened now; for the
 spirit of revolt has spread even into my school.
 
 Rosmer. Into the school? Surely not into your school?
 
 Kroll. Indeed it has. Into my own school. What do you think of this? I
 have got wind of the fact that the boys in the top class--or rather, a
 part of the boys in it--have formed themselves into a secret society
 and have been taking in Mortensgaard's paper!
 
 Rebecca. Ah, the "Searchlight".
 
 Kroll. Yes, don't you think that is a nice sort of intellectual pabulum
 for future public servants? But the saddest part of it is that it is
 all the most promising boys in the class that have conspired together
 and hatched this plot against me. It is only the duffers and dunces
 that have held aloof from it.
 
 Rebecca. Do you take it so much to heart, Mr. Kroll?
 
 Kroll. Do I take it to heart, to find myself so hampered and thwarted
 in my life's work? (Speaking more gently.) I might find it in my heart
 to say that I could even take that for what it is worth; but I have not
 told you the worst of it yet. (Looks round the room.) I suppose nobody
 is likely to be listening at the doors?
 
 Rebecca. Oh, certainly not.
 
 Kroll. Then let me tell you that the revolt and dissension has spread
 into my own home--into my own peaceful home--and has disturbed the
 peace of my family life.
 
 Rosmer (getting up). Do you mean it? In your own home?
 
 Rebecca (going up to Kroll). Dear Mr. Kroll, what has happened?
 
 Kroll. Would you believe it that my own children--. To make a long
 story short, my boy Laurits is the moving spirit of the conspiracy at
 the school. And Hilda has embroidered a red portfolio to keep the
 numbers of the "Searchlight" in.
 
 Rosmer. I should never have dreamed of such a thing; in your family--in
 your own house!
 
 Kroll. No, who would ever have dreamed of such a thing? In my house,
 where obedience and order have always ruled--where hitherto there has
 never been anything but one unanimous will--
 
 Rebecca. How does your wife take it?
 
 Kroll. Ah, that is the most incredible part of the whole thing. She,
 who all her days--in great things and small--has concurred in my
 opinions and approved of all my views, has actually not refrained from
 throwing her weight on the children's side on many points. And now she
 considers I am to blame for what has happened. She says I try to coerce
 the young people too much. Just as if it were not necessary to--. Well,
 those are the sort of dissensions I have going on at home. But
 naturally I talk as little about it as possible; it is better to be
 silent about such things. (Walks across the floor.) Oh, yes.--Oh, yes.
 (Stands by the window, with his hands behind his back, and looks out.)
 
 Rebecca (goes up to ROSMER, and speaks in low, hurried tones, unheard
 by KROLL). Do it!
 
 Rosmer (in the same tone). Not to-night.
 
 Rebecca (as before). Yes, this night of all others. (Goes away from him
 and adjusts the lamp.)
 
 Kroll (coming back). Yes, my dear John, so now you know the sort of
 spirit of the age that has cast its shadow both over my home life and
 my official work. Ought I not to oppose this appalling, destructive,
 disorganising tendency with all the weapons I can lay my hands upon? Of
 course it is certainly my duty--and that both with my pen and my tongue.
 
 Rosmer. But have you any hope that you can produce any effect in that
 way?
 
 Kroll. At all events I mean to take my share in the fight as a citizen.
 And I consider that it is the duty of every patriotic man, every man
 who is concerned about what is right, to do the same. And, I may as
 well tell you, that is really the reason why I have come here to see
 you to-night.
 
 Rosmer. My dear fellow, what do you mean? What can I--?
 
 Kroll. You are going to help your old friends, and do as we are
 doing--take your share in it to the best of your ability.
 
 Rebecca. But, Mr. Kroll, you know how little taste Mr. Rosmer has for
 that sort of thing.
 
 Kroll. Then he has got to overcome that distaste now. You do not keep
 abreast of the times, John. You sit here and bury yourself in your
 historical researches. Goodness knows, I have the greatest respect for
 family pedigrees and all that they imply. But this is not the time for
 such occupations, unhappily. You have no conception of the state of
 affairs that is going on all over the country. Every single idea is
 turned upside down, or very nearly so. It will be a hard fight to get
 all the errors straightened out again.
 
 Rosmer. I can quite believe it. But that sort of a fight is not in my
 line at all.
 
 Rebecca. Besides, I rather fancy that Mr. Rosmer has come to look at
 the affairs of life with wider opened eyes than before.
 
 Kroll (with a start). Wider opened eyes?
 
 Rebecca. Yes, or with an opener mind--with less prejudice.
 
 Kroll. What do you mean by that? John--surely you could never be so
 weak as to allow yourself to be deluded by the accidental circumstance
 that the demagogues have scored a temporary success!
 
 Rosmer. My dear fellow, you know very well that I am no judge of
 politics; but it certainly seems to me that of late years individual
 thought has become somewhat more independent.
 
 Kroll. Quite so--but do you consider that as a matter of course to be a
 good thing? In any case you are vastly mistaken, my friend. Just
 inquire a little into the opinions that are current amongst the
 Radicals, both out here in the country and in town. You will find them
 to be nothing else than the words of wisdom that appear in the
 "Searchlight".
 
 Rebecca. Yes, Mortensgaard has a great deal of influence over the
 people about here.
 
 Kroll. Yes, just think of it--a man with as dirty a record as his! A
 fellow that was turned out of his place as a schoolmaster because of
 his immoral conduct! This is the sort of man that poses as a leader of
 the people! And successfully, too!--actually successfully! I hear that
 he means to enlarge his paper now. I know, on reliable authority, that
 he is looking for a competent assistant.
 
 Rebecca. It seems to me surprising that you and your friends do not
 start an opposition paper.
 
 Kroll. That is exactly what we intend to do. This very day we have
 bought the "County News." There was no difficulty about the financial
 side of the matter; but-- (Turns towards ROSMER) Now we have come to
 the real purport of my visit. It is the Management of it--the editorial
 management--that is the difficulty, you see. Look here, Rosmer--don't
 you feel called upon to undertake it, for the sake of the good cause?
 
 Rosmer (in a tone of consternation). I!
 
 Rebecca. How can you think of such a thing!
 
 Kroll. I can quite understand your having a horror of public meetings
 and being unwilling to expose yourself to the mercies of the rabble
 that frequents them. But an editor's work, which is carried on in much
 greater privacy, or rather--
 
 Rosmer. No, no, my dear fellow, you must not ask that of me.
 
 Kroll. It would give me the greatest pleasure to have a try at work of
 that sort myself--only it would be quite out of the question for me; I
 am already saddled with such an endless number of duties. You, on the
 other hand, who are no longer hampered by any official duties, might--.
 Of course the rest of us would give you all the help in our power.
 
 Rosmer. I cannot do it, Kroll. I am not fitted for it.
 
 Kroll. Not fitted for it? That was just what you said when your father
 got you your living.
 
 Rosmer. I was quite right; and that was why I resigned it, too.
 
 Kroll. Well, if you only make as good an editor as you did a parson, we
 shall be quite satisfied.
 
 Rosmer. My dear Kroll--once for all--I cannot do it.
 
 Kroll. Well, then, I suppose you will give us the use of your name, at
 all events?
 
 Rosmer. My name?
 
 Kroll. Yes, the mere fact of John Rosmer's name being connected with it
 will be a great advantage to the paper. We others are looked upon as
 pronounced partisans. I myself even have the reputation of being a
 wicked fanatic, I am told. Therefore we cannot count upon our own names
 to give us any particular help in making the paper known to the
 misguided masses. But you, on the contrary, have always held aloof from
 this kind of fighting. Your gentle and upright disposition, your
 polished mind, your unimpeachable honour, are known to and appreciated
 by every one about here. And then there is the deference and respect
 that your former position as a clergyman ensures for you--and, besides
 that, there is the veneration in which your family, name is held!
 
 Rosmer. Oh, my family name.
 
 Kroll (pointing to the portraits). Rosmers of Rosmersholm--clergymen,
 soldiers, men who have filled high places in the state--men of
 scrupulous honour, every one of them--a family that has been rooted
 here, the most influential in the place, for nearly two centuries.
 (Lays his hand on ROSMER'S shoulder.) John, you owe it to yourself and
 to the traditions of your race to join us in defence of all that has
 hitherto been held sacred in our community. (Turning to REBECCA.) What
 do you say, Miss West?
 
 Rebecca (with a quiet little laugh). my dear Mr. Kroll--it all sounds
 so absurdly ludicrous to me.
 
 Kroll. What! Ludicrous?
 
 Rebecca. Yes, because it is time you were told plainly--
 
 Rosmer (hurriedly). No, no--don't! Not now!
 
 Kroll (looking from one to the other). But, my dear friends, what on
 earth--? (Breaks off, as MRS. HELSETH comes in, by the door on the
 right.) Ahem!
 
 Mrs. Helseth. There is a man at the kitchen door, sir. He says he wants
 to see you.
 
 Rosmer (in a relieved voice). Is there? Well, ask him to come in.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Shall I show him in here, sir?
 
 Rosmer. Certainly.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. But he doesn't look the sort of man one ought to allow in
 here.
 
 Rebecca. What does he look like, Mrs. Helseth?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Oh, he is not much to look at, Miss.
 
 Rosmer. Did he not give you his name?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Yes, I think he said it was Hekman, or something like
 that.
 
 Rosmer. I do not know any one of that name.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. And he said his Christian name was Ulrik.
 
 Rosmer (with a start of surprise). Ulrik Hetman! Was that it?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Yes, sir, it was Hetman.
 
 Kroll. I am certain I have heard that name before.
 
 Rebecca. Surely it was the name that strange creature used to write
 under--
 
 Rosmer (to Kroll). It is Ulrik Brendel's pseudonym, you know.
 
 Kroll. That scamp Ulrik Brendel. You are quite right.
 
 Rebecca. So he is alive still.
 
 Rosmer. I thought he was travelling with a theatrical company.
 
 Kroll. The last I heard of him was that he was in the workhouse.
 
 Rosmer. Ask him to come in, Mrs. Helseth.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Yes, sir. (Goes out.)
 
 Kroll. Do you really mean to allow this fellow into your house?
 
 Rosmer. Oh, well, you know he was my tutor once.
 
 Kroll. I know that what he did was to stuff your head with
 revolutionary ideas, and that in consequence your father turned him out
 of the house with a horsewhip.
 
 Rosmer (a little bitterly). Yes, my father was always the commanding
 officer--even at home.
 
 Kroll. Be grateful to his memory for that, my dear John. Ah!
 
 (MRS. HELSETH shows ULRIK BRENDEL in at the door, then goes out and
 shuts the door after her. BRENDEL is a good-looking man with grey hair
 and beard; somewhat emaciated, but active and alert; he is dressed like
 a common tramp, in a threadbare frock coat, shoes with holes in them,
 and no visible linen at his neck or wrists. He wears a pair of old
 black gloves, carries a dirty soft hat under his arm, and has a
 walking-stick in his hand. He looks puzzled at first, then goes quickly
 up to KROLL and holds out his hand to him.)
 
 Brendel. Good-evening, John!
 
 Kroll. Excuse me
 
 Brendel. Did you ever expect to see me again? And inside these hated
 walls, too?
 
 Kroll. Excuse me. (Points to ROSMER.) Over there.
 
 Brendel (turning round). Quite right. There he is. John--my boy--my
 favourite pupil!
 
 Rosmer (shaking hands with him). My old tutor!
 
 Brendel. In spite of certain recollections, I could not pass by
 Rosmersholm without paying you a flying visit.
 
 Rosmer. You are very welcome here now. Be sure of that.
 
 Brendel. And this charming lady--? (Bows to Rebecca.) Your wife, of
 course.
 
 Rosmer. Miss West.
 
 Brendel. A near relation, I presume. And our stranger friend here? A
 colleague, I can see.
 
 Rosmer. Mr. Kroll, master of the grammar school here.
 
 Brendel. Kroll? Kroll? Wait a moment. Did you take the Philology course
 in your student days?
 
 Kroll. Certainly I did.
 
 Brendel. By Jove, I used to know you, then
 
 Kroll. Excuse me--
 
 Brendel. Were you not--
 
 Kroll. Excuse me--
 
 Brendel. --one of those champions of all the virtues that got me turned
 out of the Debating Society?
 
 Kroll. Very possibly. But I disclaim any other acquaintance with you.
 
 Brendel. All right, all right! Nach Belieben, Mr. Kroll. I dare say I
 shall get over it. Ulrik Brendel will still be himself in spite of it.
 
 Rebecca. Are you on your way to the town, Mr. Brendel?
 
 Brendel. You have hit the nail on the head, ma'am. At certain intervals
 I am obliged to do something for my living. I do not do it
 willingly--but, enfin--when needs must--
 
 Rosmer. My dear Mr. Brendel, will you not let me be of assistance to
 you? In some way or another, I mean--
 
 Brendel. Ah, what a proposal to come from you! Could you wish to soil
 the tie that binds us together? Never, John--never!
 
 Rosmer. But what do you propose to do in the town, then? I assure you,
 you won't find it so easy--
 
 Brendel. Leave that to me, my boy. The die is cast. The unworthy
 individual who stands before you is started on an extensive
 campaign--more extensive than all his former excursions put together.
 (To KROLL.) May I venture to ask you, Professor--unter uns--are there
 in your esteemed town any fairly decent, respectable and spacious
 assembly-rooms?
 
 Kroll. The most spacious is the hall belonging to the Working Men's
 Association.
 
 Brendel. May I ask, sir, if you have any special influence with that no
 doubt most useful Association?
 
 Kroll. I have nothing whatever to do with it.
 
 Rebecca (to BRENDEL). You ought to apply to Peter Mortensgaard.
 
 Brendel. Pardon, madame--what sort of an idiot is he?
 
 Rosmer. Why do you make up your mind he is an idiot?
 
 Brendel. Do you suppose I can't tell, from the sound of the name, that
 it belongs to a plebeian?
 
 Kroll. I did not expect that answer.
 
 Brendel. But I will conquer my prejudices. There is nothing else for
 it. When a man stands at a turning-point in his life--as I do--. That
 is settled. I shall, put myself into communication with this
 person--commence direct negotiations.
 
 Rosmer. Are you in earnest when you say you are standing at a
 turning-point in your life?
 
 Brendel. Does my own boy not know that wherever Ulrik Brendel stands he
 is always in earnest about it? Look here, I mean to become a new man
 now--to emerge from the cloak of reserve in which I have hitherto
 shrouded myself.
 
 Rosmer. In what way?
 
 Brendel. I mean to take an active part in life--to step forward--to
 look higher. The atmosphere we breathe is heavy with storms. I want now
 to offer my mite upon the altar of emancipation.
 
 Kroll. You too?
 
 Brendel (to them all). Has your public here any intimate acquaintance
 with my scattered writings?
 
 Kroll. No, I must candidly confess that--
 
 Rebecca. I have read several of them. My foster-father had them.
 
 Brendel. My dear lady, then you have wasted your time. They are simply
 trash, allow me to tell you.
 
 Rebecca. Really?
 
 Brendel. Those you have read, yes. My really important works no man or
 woman knows anything about. No one--except myself.
 
 Rebecca. How is that?
 
 Brendel. Because they are not yet written.
 
 Rosmer. But, my dear Mr. Brendel--
 
 Brendel. You know, my dear John, that I am a bit of a sybarite--a
 gourmet. I have always been so. I have a taste for solitary enjoyment,
 because in that way my enjoyment is twice--ten times--as keen. It is,
 like this. When I have been wrapped in a haze of golden dreams that
 have descended on me--when new, intoxicating, momentous thoughts have
 had their birth in my mind, and I have been fanned by the beat of their
 wings as they bore me aloft--at such moments I have transformed them
 into poetry, into visions, into pictures. In general outlines, that is
 to say.
 
 Rosmer. Quite so.
 
 Brendel. You cannot imagine the luxury of enjoyment I have experienced!
 The mysterious rapture of creation!--in, general outlines, as I said.
 Applause, gratitude, eulogies, crowns of laurel!--all these I have
 culled with full hands trembling with joy. In my secret ecstasies I
 have steeped myself in a happiness so, intoxicating--
 
 Kroll. Ahem!
 
 Rosmer. But you have never written anything of it down?
 
 Brendel. Not a word. The thought of the dull clerk's work that it would
 mean has always moved me to a nauseating sense of disgust. Besides, why
 should I profane my own ideals when I could enjoy them, in all their
 purity, by myself? But now they shall be sacrificed. Honestly, I feel
 as a mother must do when she entrusts her young daughter to the arms of
 a husband. But I am going to, sacrifice them nevertheless--sacrifice
 them on the altar of emancipation. A series of carefully thought-out
 lectures, to be delivered all over the country!
 
 Rebecca (impetuously). That is splendid of you, Mr. Brendel! You are
 giving up the most precious thing you possess.
 
 Rosmer. The only thing.
 
 Rebecca (looking meaningly at ROSMER). I wonder how many there are who
 would do as much--who dare do it?
 
 Rosmer (returning her look). Who knows?
 
 Brendel. My audience is moved. That refreshes my heart and strengthens
 my will--and now I shall proceed upon my task forthwith. There is one
 other point, though. (To KROLL.) Can you inform me, sir, whether there
 is an Abstainers' Society in the town? A Total Abstainers' Society? I
 feel sure there must be.
 
 Kroll. There is one, at your service. I am the president.
 
 Brendel. I could tell that as soon as I saw you! Well, it is not at all
 impossible that I may come to you and become a member for a week.
 
 Kroll. Excuse me--we do not accept weekly members.
 
 Brendel. A la bonne heure, my good sir. Ulrik Brendel has never been in
 the habit of forcing himself upon societies of that kind. (Turns to go)
 But I must not prolong my stay in this house, rich as it is in
 memories. I must go into the town and find some suitable lodging. I
 shall find a decent hotel of some kind there, I hope?
 
 Rebecca. Will you not have something hot to drink before you go?
 
 Brendel. Of what nature, dear lady?
 
 Rebecca. A cup of tea, or--
 
 Brendel. A thousand thanks to the most generous of hostesses!--but I do
 not like trespassing on private hospitality. (Waves his hand.) Good-bye
 to you all! (Goes to the door, but turns back.) Oh, by the
 way--John--Mr. Rosmer--will you do your former tutor a service for old
 friendship's sake?
 
 Rosmer. With the greatest of pleasure.
 
 Brendel. Good. Well, then, lend me--just for a day or two--a starched
 shirt.
 
 Rosmer. Nothing more than that!
 
 Brendel. Because, you see, I am travelling on foot--on this occasion.
 My trunk is being sent after me.
 
 Rosmer. Quite so. But, in that case, isn't there anything else?
 
 Brendel. Well, I will tell you what--perhaps you have an old, worn-out
 summer coat that you could spare?
 
 Rosmer. Certainly I have.
 
 Brendel. And if there happened to be a pair of presentable shoes that
 would go with the coat.
 
 Rosmer. I am sure we can manage that, too. As soon as you let us know
 your address, we will send the things to you.
 
 Brendel. Please don't think of it! No one must be put to any
 inconvenience on my account! I will take the trifles with me.
 
 Rosmer. Very well. Will you come upstairs with me, then?
 
 Rebecca. Let me go. Mrs. Helseth and I will see about it.
 
 Brendel. I could never think of allowing this charming lady--
 
 Rebecca. Nonsense! Come along, Mr. Brendel. (She goes out by the door
 on the right.)
 
 Rosmer (holding BRENDEL back). Tell me--is there no other way I can be
 of service to you?
 
 Brendel. I am sure I do not know of any. Yes, perdition seize it!--now
 that I come to think of it--John, do you happen to have seven or eight
 shillings on you?
 
 Rosmer. I will see. (Opens his purse.) I have two half-sovereigns here.
 
 Brendel. Oh, well, never mind. I may as well take them. I can always
 get change in town. Thanks, in the meantime. Remember that it was two
 half-sovereigns I had. Good-night, my own dear boy! Good-night to you,
 sir! (Goes out by the door on the right, where ROSMER takes leave of
 him and shuts the door after him.)
 
 Kroll. Good heavens--and that is the Ulrik Brendel of whom people once
 thought that he would do great things!
 
 Rosmer. At all events he has had the courage to live his life in his
 own way. I do not think that is such a small thing, after all.
 
 Kroll. What? A life like his? I almost believe he would have the power,
 even now, to disturb all your ideas.
 
 Rosmer. No, indeed. I have come to a clear understanding with myself
 now, upon all points.
 
 Kroll. I wish I could believe it, my dear Rosmer. You are so dreadfully
 susceptible to impressions from without.
 
 Rosmer. Let us sit down. I want to have a talk with you.
 
 Kroll. By all means. (They sit down on the couch.)
 
 Rosmer (after a short pause). Don't you think everything here looks
 very pleasant and comfortable?
 
 Kroll. Yes, it looks very pleasant and comfortable now--and peaceful.
 You have made yourself a real home, Rosmer. And I have lost mine.
 
 Rosmer. My dear fellow, do not say that. There may seem to be a rift
 just now, but it will heal again.
 
 Kroll. Never, never. The sting will always remain. Things can never be
 as they were before.
 
 Rosmer. I want to ask you something, Kroll. You and I have been the
 closest of friends now for so many years--does it seem to you
 conceivable that anything could destroy our friendship?
 
 Kroll. I cannot imagine anything that could cause a breach between us.
 What has put that into your head?
 
 Rosmer. Well--your attaching such tremendous importance to similarity
 of opinions and views.
 
 Kroll. Certainly I do; but then we two hold pretty similar opinions at
 all events on the most essential points.
 
 Rosmer (gently). No. Not any longer.
 
 Kroll (trying to jump up from his seat). What is this?
 
 Rosmer (restraining him). No, you must sit still. Please, Kroll.
 
 Kroll. What does it all mean? I do not understand you. Tell me,
 straight out!
 
 Rosmer. A new summer has blossomed in my heart--my eyes have regained
 the clearness of youth. And, accordingly, I am now standing where--
 
 Kroll. Where? Where are you standing?
 
 Rosmer. Where your children are standing.
 
 Kroll. You? You! The thing is impossible! Where do you say you are
 standing?
 
 Rosmer. On the same side as Laurits and Hilda.
 
 Kroll (letting his head drop). An apostate. John Rosmer an apostate.
 
 Rosmer. What you are calling apostasy ought to have made me feel
 sincerely happy and fortunate; but for all that I have suffered keenly,
 because I knew quite well it would cause you bitter sorrow.
 
 Kroll. Rosmer, Rosmer, I shall never get over this. (Looks at him
 sadly.) To think that you, too, could bring yourself to sympathise with
 and join in the work of disorder and ruin that is playing havoc with
 our unhappy country.
 
 Rosmer. It is the work of emancipation that I sympathise with.
 
 Kroll. Oh yes, I know all about that. That is what it is called, by
 both those who are leading the people astray and by their misguided
 victims. But, be sure of this--you need expect no emancipation to be
 the result of the spirit that relies on the poisoning of the whole of
 our social life.
 
 Rosmer. I do not give my allegiance to the spirit that is directing
 this, nor to any of those who are leading the fight. I want to try to
 bring men of all shades of opinion together--as many as I can
 reach--and bind them as closely together as I can. I want to live for
 and devote all the strength that is in me to one end only--to create a
 real public opinion in the country.
 
 Kroll. So you do not consider that we have sufficient public opinion!
 I, for my part, consider that the whole lot of us are on the high road
 to be dragged down into the mire where otherwise only the common people
 would be wallowing.
 
 Rosmer. It is just for that reason that I have made up my mind as to
 what should be the real task of public opinion.
 
 Kroll. What task?
 
 Rosmer. The task of making all our fellow-countrymen into men of
 nobility.
 
 Kroll. All our fellow-countrymen--!
 
 Rosmer. As many as possible, at all events.
 
 Kroll. By what means?
 
 Rosmer. By emancipating their ideas and purifying their aspirations, it
 seems to me.
 
 Kroll. You are a dreamer, Rosmer. Are you going to emancipate them? Are
 you going to purify them?
 
 Rosmer. No, my dear fellow--I can only try to awake the desire for it
 in them. The doing of it rests with themselves.
 
 Kroll. And do you think they are capable of it?
 
 Rosmer. Yes.
 
 Kroll. Of their own power?
 
 Rosmer. Yes, of their own power. There is no other that can do it.
 
 Kroll (getting up). Is that speaking as befits a clergyman?
 
 Rosmer. I am a clergyman no longer.
 
 Kroll. Yes, but--what of the faith you were brought up in?
 
 Rosmer. I have it no longer.
 
 Kroll. You have it no longer?
 
 Rosmer (getting up). I have given it up. I had to give it up, Kroll.
 
 Kroll (controlling his emotion). I see. Yes, yes. The one thing implies
 the other. Was that the reason, then, why you left the service of the
 Church?
 
 Rosmer. Yes. When my mind was clearly made up--when I felt the
 certainty that it Was not merely a transitory temptation, but that it
 was something that I would neither have the power nor the desire to
 dismiss from my mind--then I took that step.
 
 Kroll. So it has been fermenting in your mind as long as that. And
 we--your friends--have never been allowed to know anything of it.
 Rosmer, Rosmer--how could you hide the sorrowful truth from us!
 
 Rosmer. Because I considered it was a matter that only concerned
 myself; and therefore I did not wish to cause you and my other friends
 any unnecessary pain. I thought I should be able to live my life here
 as I have done hitherto--peacefully and happily. I wanted to read, and
 absorb myself in all the works that so far had been sealed books to
 me--to familiarise myself thoroughly with the great world of truth and
 freedom that has been disclosed to me now.
 
 Kroll. An apostate. Every word you say bears witness to that. But, for
 all that, why have you made this confession of your secret apostasy? Or
 why just at the present moment?
 
 Rosmer. You yourself have compelled me to it, Kroll.
 
 Kroll. I? I have compelled you?
 
 Rosmer. When I heard of your violent behaviour at public meetings--when
 I read the reports of all the vehement speeches you made there of all
 your bitter attacks upon those that were on the other side--your
 scornful censure of your opponents--oh, Kroll, to think that
 you--you--could be the man to do that!--then my eyes were opened to my
 imperative duty. Mankind is suffering from the strife that is going on
 now, and we ought to bring peace and happiness and a spirit of
 reconciliation into their souls. That is why I step forward now and
 confess myself openly for what I am--and, besides, I want to put my
 powers to the test, as well as others. Could not you--from your
 side--go with me in that, Kroll?
 
 Kroll. Never, as long as I live, will I make any alliance with the
 forces of disorder in the community.
 
 Rosmer. Well, let us at least fight with honourable weapons, since it
 seems we must fight.
 
 Kroll. I can have nothing more to do with any one who does not think
 with me on matters of vital importance, and I owe such a man no
 consideration.
 
 Rosmer. Does that apply even to me?
 
 Kroll. You yourself have broken with me, Rosmer.
 
 Rosmer. But does this really mean a breach between us?
 
 Kroll. Between us! It is a breach with all those who have hitherto
 stood shoulder to shoulder with you. And now you must take the
 consequences.
 
 (REBECCA comes in from the room on the right and opens the door wide.)
 
 Rebecca. Well, that is done! We have started him off on the road to his
 great sacrifice, and now we can go in to supper. Will you come in, Mr.
 Kroll?
 
 Kroll (taking his hat). Good-night, Miss West. This is no longer any
 place for me.
 
 Rebecca (excitedly). What do you mean? (Shuts the door and comes nearer
 to the two men.) Have you told him--?
 
 Rosmer. He knows now.
 
 Kroll. We shall not let you slip out of our hands, Rosmer. We shall
 compel you to come back to us again.
 
 Rosmer. I shall never find myself there any more.
 
 Kroll. We shall see. You are not the man to endure standing alone.
 
 Rosmer. I am not so entirely alone, even now. There are two of us to
 bear the solitude together here.
 
 Kroll. Ah! (A suspicion appears to cross his mind.) That too! Beata's
 words!
 
 Rosmer. Beata's?
 
 Kroll (dismissing the thought from his mind). No, no--that was odious
 of me. Forgive me.
 
 Rosmer. What? What do you mean?
 
 Kroll. Think no more about it. I am ashamed of it. Forgive me--and
 good-bye. (Goes out by the door to the hall.)
 
 Rosmer (following him). Kroll! We cannot end everything between us like
 this. I will come and see you to-morrow.
 
 Kroll (turning round in the hall). You shall not set your foot in my
 house. (Takes his stick and goes.)
 
 (ROSMER stands for a while at the open door; then shuts it and comes
 back into the room.)
 
 Rosmer. That does not matter, Rebecca. We shall be able to go through
 with it, for all that--we two trusty friends--you and I.
 
 Rebecca. What do you suppose he meant just now when he said he was
 ashamed of himself?
 
 Rosmer. My dear girl, don't bother your head about that. He didn't even
 believe what he meant, himself. But I will go and see him tomorrow.
 Goodnight!
 
 Rebecca. Are you going up so early to-night--after this?
 
 Rosmer. As early to-night as I usually do. I feel such a sense of
 relief now that it is over. You see, my dear Rebecca, I am perfectly
 calm--so you take it calmly, too. Good-night.
 
 Rebecca. Good-night, dear friend--and sleep well! (ROSMER goes out by
 the door to the lobby; then his footsteps are heard as he goes
 upstairs. REBECCA goes to the wall and rings a bell, which is answered
 by MRS. HELSETH.) You can clear the table again, Mrs. Helseth. Mr.
 Rosmer does not want anything, and Mr. Kroll has gone home.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Gone home? What was wrong with him, miss?
 
 Rebecca (taking up her crochet-work). He prophesied that there was a
 heavy storm brewing--
 
 Mrs. Helseth. That is very strange, miss, because there isn't a scrap
 of cloud in the sky.
 
 Rebecca. Let us hope he doesn't meet the White Horse. Because I am
 afraid it will not be long before we hear something of the family ghost.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. God forgive you, miss--don't talk of such a dreadful
 thing!
 
 Rebecca. Oh, come, come!
 
 Mrs. Helseth (lowering her voice). Do you really think, miss, that some
 one here is to go soon?
 
 Rebecca. Not a bit of it. But there are so many sorts of white horses
 in this world, Mrs. Helseth--Well, good-night. I shall go to my room
 now.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Good-night, miss. (Rebecca takes her work and goes out to
 the right. MRS. HELSETH shakes her head, as she turns down the lamp,
 and mutters to herself): Lord--Lord!--how queer Miss West does talk
 sometimes!
 
 
 
 
 ACT II
 
 
 (SCENE. ROSMER'S study. The door into it is in the left-hand wall. At
 the back of the room is a doorway with a curtain drawn back from it,
 leading to his bedroom. On the right, a window, in front of which is a
 writing-table strewn with books and papers. Bookshelves and cupboards
 on the walls. Homely furniture. On the left, an old-fashioned sofa with
 a table in front of it. ROSMER, wearing a smoking-jacket, is sitting at
 the writing-table on a high-backed chair. He is cutting and turning
 over the leaves of a magazine, and dipping into it here and there. A
 knock is heard at the door on the left.)
 
 Rosmer (without turning round). Come in.
 
 (REBECCA comes in, wearing a morning wrapper.)
 
 Rebecca. Good morning.
 
 Rosmer (still turning over the leaves of his book). Good morning, dear.
 Do you want anything?
 
 Rebecca. Only to ask if you have slept well?
 
 Rosmer. I went to sleep feeling so secure and happy. I did not even
 dream. (Turns round.) And you?
 
 Rebecca. Thanks, I got to sleep in the early morning.
 
 Rosmer. I do not think I have felt so light-hearted for a long time as
 I do to-day. I am so glad that I had the opportunity to say what I did.
 
 Rebecca. Yes, you should not have been silent so long, John.
 
 Rosmer. I cannot understand how I came to be such a coward.
 
 Rebecca. I am sure it was not really from cowardice.
 
 Rosmer. Yes, indeed. I can see that at bottom there was some cowardice
 about it.
 
 Rebecca. So much the braver of you to face it as you did. (Sits down
 beside him on a chair by the writing-table.) But now I want to confess
 something that I have done--something that you must not be vexed with
 me about.
 
 Rosmer. Vexed? My dear girl, how can you think--?
 
 Rebecca. Yes, because I dare say it was a little presumptuous of me,
 but--
 
 Rosmer. Well, let me hear what it was.
 
 Rebecca. Last night, when that Ulrick Brendel was going, I wrote him a
 line or two to take to Mortensgaard.
 
 Rosmer (a little doubtfully). But, my dear Rebecca--What did you write,
 then?
 
 Rebecca. I wrote that he would be doing you a service if he would
 interest himself a little in that unfortunate man, and help him in any
 way he could.
 
 Rosmer. My dear, you should not have done that. You have only done
 Brendel harm by doing so. And besides, Mortensgaard is a man I
 particularly wish to have nothing to do with. You know I have been at
 loggerheads once with him already.
 
 Rebecca. But do you not think that now it might be a very good thing if
 you got on to good terms with him again?
 
 Rosmer. I? With Mortensgaard? For what reason, do you mean?
 
 Rebecca. Well, because you cannot feel altogether secure now--since
 this has come between you and your friends.
 
 Rosmer (looking at her and shaking his head). Is it possible that you
 think either Kroll or any of the others would take a revenge on
 me--that they could be capable of--
 
 Rebecca. In their first heat of indignation dear. No one can be certain
 of that. I think, after the way Mr. Kroll took it--
 
 Rosmer. Oh, you ought to know him better than that. Kroll is an
 honourable man, through and through. I will go into town this
 afternoon, and have a talk with him. I will have a talk with them all.
 Oh, you will see how smoothly everything will go. (MRS. HELSETH comes
 in by the door on the left.)
 
 Rebecca (getting up). What is it, Mrs. Helseth?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Mr. Kroll is downstairs in the hall, miss.
 
 Rosmer (getting up quickly). Kroll!
 
 Rebecca. Mr. Kroll! What a surprise!
 
 Mrs. Helseth. He asks if he may come up and speak to Mr. Rosmer.
 
 Rosmer (to REBECCA). What did I say! (To MRS. HELSETH). Of course he
 may. (Goes to the door and calls down the stairs.) Come up, my dear
 fellow! I am delighted to see you! (He stands holding the door open.
 MRS. HELSETH goes out. REBECCA draws the curtain over the doorway at
 the back, and then begins to tidy the room. KROLL comes in with his hat
 in his hand.)
 
 Rosmer (quietly, and with some emotion). I knew quite well it would not
 be the last time--
 
 Kroll. To-day I see the matter in quite a different light from
 yesterday.
 
 Rosmer. Of course you do, Kroll! Of course you do! You have been
 thinking things over--
 
 Kroll. You misunderstand me altogether. (Puts his hat down on the
 table.) It is important that I should speak to you alone.
 
 Rosmer. Why may not Miss West--?
 
 Rebecca. No, no, Mr. Rosmer. I will go.
 
 Kroll (looking meaningly at her). And I see I ought to apologise to
 you, Miss West, for coming here so early in the morning. I see I have
 taken you by surprise, before you have had time to--
 
 Rebecca (with a start). Why so? Do you find anything out of place in
 the fact of my wearing a morning wrapper at home here?
 
 Kroll. By no means! Besides, I have no knowledge of what customs may
 have grown up at Rosmersholm.
 
 Rosmer. Kroll, you are not the least like yourself to-day.
 
 Rebecca. I will wish you good morning, Mr. Kroll. (Goes out to the
 left.)
 
 Kroll. If. you will allow me-- (Sits down on the couch.)
 
 Rosmer. Yes, my dear fellow, let us make ourselves comfortable and have
 a confidential talk. (Sits down on a chair facing KROLL.)
 
 Kroll. I have not been able to close an eye since yesterday. I lay all
 night, thinking and thinking.
 
 Rosmer. And what have you got to say to-day?
 
 Kroll. It will take me some time, Rosmer. Let me begin with a sort of
 introduction. I can give you some news of Ulrick Brendel.
 
 Rosmer. Has he been to see you?
 
 Kroll. No. He took up his quarters in a low-class tavern--in the lowest
 kind of company, of course; drank, and stood drinks to others, as long
 as he had any money left; and then began to abuse the whole lot of them
 as a contemptible rabble--and, indeed, as far as that goes he was quite
 right. But the result was, that he got a thrashing and was thrown out
 into the gutter.
 
 Rosmer. I see he is altogether incorrigible.
 
 Kroll. He had pawned the coat you gave him, too, but that is going to
 be redeemed for him. Can you guess by whom?
 
 Rosmer. By yourself, perhaps?
 
 Kroll. No. By our noble friend Mr. Mortensgaard.
 
 Rosmer. Is that so?
 
 Kroll. I am informed that Mr. Brendel's first visit was paid to the
 "idiot" and  "plebeian".
 
 Rosmer. Well, it was very lucky for him--
 
 Kroll. Indeed it was. (Leans over the table, towards ROSMER.) Now I am
 coming to a matter of which, for the sake of our old--our
 former--friendship, it is my duty to warn you.
 
 Rosmer. My dear fellow, what is that?
 
 Kroll. It is this; that certain games are going on behind your back in
 this house.
 
 Rosmer. How can you think that? Is it Rebec--is it Miss West you are
 alluding to?
 
 Kroll. Precisely. And I can quite understand it on her part; she has
 been accustomed, for such a long time now, to do as she likes here. But
 nevertheless--
 
 Rosmer. My dear Kroll, you are absolutely mistaken. She and I have no
 secrets from one another about anything whatever.
 
 Kroll. Then has she confessed to you that she has been corresponding
 with the editor of the "Searchlight"?
 
 Rosmer. Oh, you mean the couple of lines she wrote to him on Ulrik
 Brendel's behalf?
 
 Kroll. You have found that out, then? And do you approve of her being
 on terms of this sort with that scurrilous hack, who almost every week
 tries to pillory me for my attitude in my school and out of it?
 
 Rosmer. My dear fellow, I don't suppose that side of the question has
 ever occurred to her. And in any case, of course she has entire freedom
 of action, just as I have myself.
 
 Kroll. Indeed? Well, I suppose that is quite in accordance with the new
 turn your views have taken--because I suppose Miss West looks at things
 from the same standpoint as you?
 
 Rosmer. She does. We two have worked our way forward in complete
 companionship.
 
 Kroll (looking at him and shaking his head slowly). Oh, you blind,
 deluded man!
 
 Rosmer. I? What makes you say that?
 
 Kroll. Because I dare not--I WILL not--think the worst. No, no, let me
 finish what I want to say. Am I to believe that you really prize my
 friendship, Rosmer? And my respect, too? Do you?
 
 Rosmer. Surely I need not answer that question.
 
 Kroll. Well, but there are other things that require answering--that
 require full explanation on your part. Will you submit to it if I hold
 a sort of inquiry--?
 
 Rosmer. An inquiry?
 
 Kroll. Yes, if I ask you questions about one or two things that it may
 be painful for you to recall to mind. For instance, the matter of your
 apostasy--well, your emancipation, if you choose to call it so--is
 bound up with so much else for which, for your own sake, you ought to
 account to me.
 
 Rosmer. My dear fellow, ask me about anything you please. I have
 nothing to conceal.
 
 Kroll. Well, then, tell me this--what do you yourself believe was the
 real reason of Beata's making away with herself?
 
 Rosmer. Can you have any doubt? Or perhaps I should rather say, need
 one look for reasons for what an unhappy sick woman, who is
 unaccountable for her actions, may do?
 
 Kroll. Are you certain that Beata was so entirely unaccountable for her
 actions? The doctors, at all events, did not consider that so
 absolutely certain.
 
 Rosmer. If the doctors had ever seen her in the state in which I have
 so often seen her, both night and day, they would have had no doubt
 about it.
 
 Kroll. I did not doubt it either, at the time.
 
 Rosmer. Of course not. It was impossible to doubt it, unfortunately.
 You remember what I told you of her ungovernable, wild fits of
 passion--which she expected me to reciprocate. She terrified me! And
 think how she tortured herself with baseless self-reproaches in the
 last years of her life!
 
 Kroll. Yes, when she knew that she would always be childless.
 
 Rosmer. Well, think what it meant--to be perpetually in the clutches of
 such--agony of mind over a thing that she was not in the slightest
 degree responsible for--! Are you going to suggest that she was
 accountable for her actions?
 
 Kroll. Hm!--Do you remember whether at that time you had, in the house
 any books dealing with the purport of marriage--according to the
 advanced views of to-day?
 
 Rosmer. I remember Miss West's lending me a work of the kind. She
 inherited Dr. West's library, you know. But, my dear Kroll, you surely
 do not suppose that we were so imprudent as to let the poor sick
 creature get wind of any such ideas? I can solemnly swear that we were
 in no way to blame. It was the overwrought nerves of her own brain that
 were responsible for these frantic aberrations.
 
 Kroll. There is one thing, at any rate, that I can tell you now, and
 that is that your poor tortured and overwrought Beata put an end to her
 own life in order that yours might be happy--and that you might be free
 to live as you pleased.
 
 Rosmer (starting half up from his chair). What do you mean by that?
 
 Kroll. You must listen to me quietly, Rosmer--because now I can speak
 of it. During the last year of her life she came twice to see me, to
 tell me what she suffered from her fears and her despair.
 
 Rosmer. On that point?
 
 Kroll. No. The first time she came she declared that you were on the
 high road to apostasy--that you were going to desert the faith that
 your father had taught you.
 
 Rosmer (eagerly). What you say is impossible, Kroll!--absolutely
 impossible! You must be wrong about that.
 
 Kroll. Why?
 
 Rosmer. Because as long as Beata lived I was still doubting and
 fighting with myself. And I fought out that fight alone and in the
 completest secrecy. I do not imagine that even Rebecca--
 
 Kroll. Rebecca?
 
 Rosmer. Oh, well--Miss West. I call her Rebecca for the sake of
 convenience.
 
 Kroll. So I have observed.
 
 Rosmer. That is why it is so incomprehensible to me that Beata should
 have had any suspicion of it. Why did she never speak to me about
 it?--for she never did, by a single word.
 
 Kroll. Poor soul--she begged and implored me to speak to you.
 
 Rosmer. Then why did you never do so?
 
 Kroll. Do you think I had a moment's doubt, at that time, that her mind
 was unhinged? Such an accusation as that, against a man like you! Well,
 she came to see me again, about a month later. She seemed calmer then;
 but, as she was going away, she said: "They may expect to see the White
 Horse soon at Rosmersholm."
 
 Rosmer. Yes, I know--the White Horse. She often used to talk about that.
 
 Kroll. And then, when I tried to distract her from such unhappy
 thoughts, she only answered: "I have not much time left; for John must
 marry Rebecca immediately now."
 
 Rosmer (almost speechless). What are you saying! I marry--!
 
 Kroll. That was on a Thursday afternoon. On the Saturday evening she
 threw herself from the footbridge into the millrace.
 
 Rosmer. And you never warned us!
 
 Kroll. Well, you know yourself how constantly she used to say that she
 was sure she would die before long.
 
 Rosmer. Yes, I know. But, all the same, you ought to have warned us!
 
 Kroll. I did think of doing so. But then it was too late.
 
 Rosmer. But since then, why have you not--? Why have you kept all this
 to yourself?
 
 Kroll. What good would it have done for me to come here and add to your
 pain and distress? Of course I thought the whole thing was merely wild,
 empty fancy--until yesterday evening.
 
 Rosmer. Then you do not think so any longer?
 
 Kroll. Did not Beata see clearly enough, when she saw that you were
 going to fall away from your childhood's faith?
 
 Rosmer (staring in front of him). Yes, I cannot understand that. It is
 the most incomprehensible thing in the world to me.
 
 Kroll. Incomprehensible or not, the thing is true. And now I ask you,
 Rosmer, how much truth is there in her other accusation?--the last one,
 I mean.
 
 Rosmer. Accusation? Was that an accusation, then?
 
 Kroll. Perhaps you did not notice how it was worded. She said she meant
 to stand out of the way. Why? Well?
 
 Rosmer. In order that I might marry Rebecca, apparently.
 
 Kroll. That was not quite how it was worded. Beata expressed herself
 differently. She said "I have not much time left; for John must marry
 Rebecca IMMEDIATELY now."
 
 Rosmer (looks at him for a moment; then gets up). Now I understand you,
 Kroll.
 
 Kroll. And if you do? What answer have you to make?
 
 Rosmer (in an even voice, controlling himself). To such an
 unheard-of--? The only fitting answer would be to point to the door.
 
 Kroll (getting up). Very good.
 
 Rosmer (standing face to face with him). Listen to me. For considerably
 more than a year to be precise, since Beata's death--Rebecca West and I
 have lived here alone at Rosmersholm. All that time you have known of
 the charge Beata made against us; but I have never for one moment seen
 you appear the least scandalised at our living together here.
 
 Kroll. I never knew, till yesterday evening, that it was a case of an
 apostate man and an "emancipated" woman living together.
 
 Rosmer. Ah! So then you do not believe in any purity of life among
 apostates or emancipated folk? You do not believe that they may have
 the instinct of morality ingrained in their natures?
 
 Kroll. I have no particular confidence in the kind of morality that is
 not rooted in the Church's faith.
 
 Rosmer. And you mean that to apply to Rebecca and myself?--to my
 relations with Rebecca?
 
 Kroll. I cannot make any departure, in favour of you two, from my
 opinion that there is certainly no very wide gulf between free thinking
 and--ahem!
 
 Rosmer. And what?
 
 Kroll. And free love, since you force me to say it.
 
 Rosmer (gently). And you are not ashamed to say that to me!--you, who
 have known me ever since I was a boy.
 
 Kroll. It is just for that reason. I know how easily you allow yourself
 to be influenced by those you associate with. And as for your
 Rebecca--well, your Miss West, then--to tell the truth, we know very
 little about her. To cut the matter short, Rosmer--I am not going to
 give you up. And you, on your part, ought to try and save yourself in
 time.
 
 Rosmer. Save myself? How--? (MRS. HELSETH looks in through the door on
 the left.) What do you want?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. I wanted to ask Miss West to come down, sir.
 
 Rosmer. Miss West is not up here.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Indeed, sir? (Looks round the room.) That is very
 strange. (Goes out.)
 
 Rosmer. You were saying--?
 
 Kroll. Listen to me. As to what may have gone on here in secret while
 Beata was alive, and as to what may be still going on here, I have no
 wish to inquire more closely. You were, of course, extremely unhappy in
 your marriage--and to some extent that may be urged in your excuse--
 
 Rosmer. Oh, how little you really know me!
 
 Kroll. Do not interrupt me. What I want to say is this. If you
 definitely must continue living with Miss West, it is absolutely
 necessary that you should conceal the revolution of opinion--I mean the
 distressing apostasy--that she has beguiled you into. Let me speak! Let
 me speak! I say that, if you are determined to go on with this folly,
 for heaven's sake hold any variety of ideas or opinions or beliefs you
 like--but keep your opinions to yourself. It is a purely personal
 matter, and there is not the slightest necessity to go proclaiming it
 all over the countryside.
 
 Rosmer. It is a necessity for me to abandon a false and equivocal
 position.
 
 Kroll. But you have a duty towards the traditions of your family,
 Rosmer! Remember that! From time immemorial Rosmersholm has been a
 stronghold of discipline and order, of respect and esteem for all that
 the best people in our community have upheld and sanctioned. The whole
 neighbourhood has taken its tone from Rosmersholm. If the report gets
 about that you yourself have broken with what I may call the Rosmer
 family tradition, it will evoke an irreparable state of unrest.
 
 Rosmer. My dear Kroll, I cannot see the matter in that light. It seems
 to me that it is my imperative duty to bring a little light and
 happiness into the place where the race of Rosmers has spread darkness
 and oppression for all these long years.
 
 Kroll (looking severely at him). Yes, that would be a worthy action for
 the man with whom the race will disappear. Let such things alone, my
 friend. It is no suitable task for you. You were meant to lead the
 peaceful life of a student.
 
 Rosmer. Yes, that may be so. But nevertheless I want to try and play my
 humble part in the struggles of life.
 
 Kroll. The struggles of life! Do you know what that will mean for you?
 It will mean war to the death with all your friends.
 
 Rosmer (quietly). I do not imagine they are all such fanatics as you.
 
 Kroll. You are a simple-minded creature, Rosmer--an inexperienced
 creature. You have no suspicion of the violence of the storm that will
 burst upon you. (MRS. HELSETH slightly opens the door on the left.)
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Miss West wishes me to ask you, sir
 
 Rosmer. What is it?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. There is some one downstairs that wishes to speak to you
 for a minute, sir.
 
 Rosmer. Is it the gentleman that was here yesterday afternoon, by any
 chance?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. No, it is that Mr. Mortensgaard.
 
 Rosmer. Mortensgaard?
 
 Kroll. Aha! So matters have got as far as that already, have they!
 
 Rosmer. What does he want with me? Why did you not send him away?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Miss West told me to ask you if he might come up.
 
 Rosmer. Tell him I am engaged, and--
 
 Kroll (to MRS. HELSETH). No; show him up, please. (MRS. HELSETH goes
 out. KROLL takes up his hat.) I quit the field--temporarily. But we
 have not fought the decisive action yet.
 
 Rosmer. As truly as I stand here, Kroll, I have absolutely nothing to
 do with Mortensgaard.
 
 Kroll. I do not believe you any longer on any point. Under no
 circumstances shall I have any faith in you after this. It is war to
 the knife now. We shall try if we cannot make you powerless to do any
 harm.
 
 Rosmer. Oh, Kroll--how you have sunk! How low you have sunk!
 
 Kroll. I? And a man like you has the face to say so? Remember Beata!
 
 Rosmer. Are you harking back to that again!
 
 Kroll. No. You must solve the riddle of the millrace as your conscience
 will allow you--if you have any conscience still left. (PETER
 MORTENSGAARD comes in softly and quietly, by the door on the left. He
 is a short, slightly built man with sparse reddish hair and beard.
 KROLL gives him a look of hatred.) The "Searchlight" too, I see.
 Lighted at Rosmersholm! (Buttons up his coat.) That leaves me no doubt
 as to the course I should steer.
 
 Mortensgaard (quietly). The "Searchlight" will always be ready burning
 to light Mr. Kroll home.
 
 Kroll. Yes, you have shown me your goodwill for a long time. To be sure
 there is a Commandment that forbids us to bear false witness against
 our neighbour--
 
 Mortensgaard. Mr. Kroll has no need to instruct me in the Commandments.
 
 Kroll. Not even in the sixth?
 
 Rosmer. Kroll--!
 
 Mortensgaard. If I needed such instruction, Mr. Rosmer is the most
 suitable person to give it me.
 
 Kroll (with scarcely concealed scorn). Mr. Rosmer? Oh yes, the Reverend
 Mr. Rosmer is undoubtedly the most suitable man for that! I hope you
 will enjoy yourselves, gentlemen. (Goes out and slams the door after
 him.)
 
 Rosmer (stands looking at the door, and says to himself). Yes, yes--it
 had to be so. (Turns round.) Will you tell me, Mr. Mortensgaard, what
 has brought you out here to see me?
 
 Mortensgaard. It was really Miss West I wanted to see. I thought I
 ought to thank her for the kind letter I received from her yesterday.
 
 Rosmer. I know she has written to you. Have you had a talk with her?
 
 Mortensgaard. Yes, a little. (Smiles slightly.) I hear that there has
 been a change of views in certain respects at Rosmersholm.
 
 Rosmer. My views have changed to a very considerable extent; I might
 almost say entirely.
 
 Mortensgaard. That is what Miss West said. And that was why she thought
 I ought to come up and have a little chat with you about this.
 
 Rosmer. About what, Mr. Mortensgaard?
 
 Mortensgaard. May I have your permission to announce in the
 "Searchlight" that you have altered your opinions, and are going to
 devote yourself to the cause of free thought and progress?
 
 Rosmer. By all means. I will go so far as to ask you to make the
 announcement.
 
 Mortensgaard. Then it shall appear to-morrow. It will be a great and
 weighty piece of news that the Reverend Mr. Rosmer of Rosmersholm has
 made up his mind to join the forces of light in that direction too.
 
 Rosmer. I do not quite understand you.
 
 Mortensgaard. What I mean is that it implies the gain of strong moral
 support for our party every time we win over an earnest,
 Christian-minded adherent.
 
 Rosmer (with some astonishment). Then you don't know--? Did Miss West
 not tell you that as well?
 
 Mortensgaard. What, Mr. Rosmer? Miss West was in a considerable hurry.
 She told me to come up, and that I would hear the rest of it from
 yourself.
 
 Rosmer. Very well, then; let me tell you that I have cut myself free
 entirely--on every side. I have now, no connection of any kind with the
 tenets of the Church. For the future such matters have not the smallest
 signification for me.
 
 Mortensgaard (looking at him in perplexity). Well, if the moon had
 fallen down from the sky, I could not be more--! To think that I should
 ever hear you yourself renounce--!
 
 Rosmer. Yes, I stand now where you have stood for a long time. You can
 announce that in the "Searchlight" to-morrow too.
 
 Mortensgaard. That, too? No, my dear Mr. Rosmer--you must excuse
 me--but it is not worth touching on that side of the matter.
 
 Rosmer. Not touch on it?
 
 Mortensgaard. Not at first, I think.
 
 Rosmer. But I do not understand--
 
 Mortensgaard. Well, it is like this, Mr. Rosmer. You are not as
 familiar with all the circumstances of the case as I am, I expect. But
 if you, too, have joined the forces of freedom--and if you, as Miss
 West says you do, mean to take part in the movement--I conclude you do
 so with the desire to be as useful to the movement as you possibly can,
 in practice as well as, in theory.
 
 Rosmer. Yes, that is my most sincere wish.
 
 Mortensgaard. Very well. But I must impress on you, Mr. Rosmer, that if
 you come forward openly with this news about your defection from the
 Church, you will tie your own hands immediately.
 
 Rosmer. Do you think so?
 
 Mortensgaard. Yes, you may be certain that there is not much that you
 would be able to do hereabouts. And besides, Mr. Rosmer, we have quite
 enough freethinkers already--indeed, I was going to say we have too
 many of those gentry. What the party needs is a Christian
 element--something that every one must respect. That is what we want
 badly. And for that reason it is most advisable that you should hold
 your tongue about any matters that do not concern the public. That is
 my opinion.
 
 Rosmer. I see. Then you would not risk having anything to do with me if
 I were to confess my apostasy openly?
 
 Mortensgaard (shaking his head). I should not like to, Mr. Rosmer.
 Lately I have made it a rule never to support anybody or anything that
 is opposed to the interests of the Church.
 
 Rosmer. Have you, then, entered the fold of the Church again lately?
 
 Mortensgaard. That is another matter altogether.
 
 Rosmer. Oh, that is how it is. Yes, I understand you now.
 
 Mortensgaard. Mr. Rosmer--you ought to remember that I, of all people,
 have not absolute freedom of action.
 
 Rosmer. What hampers you?
 
 Mortensgaard. What hampers me is that I am a marked man.
 
 Rosmer. Ah--of course.
 
 Mortensgaard. A marked man, Mr. Rosmer. And you, of all people, ought
 to remember that--because you were responsible, more than any one else,
 for my being branded.
 
 Rosmer. If I had stood then where I stand now, I should have handled
 the affair more judiciously.
 
 Mortensgaard. I think so too. But it is too late now; you have branded
 me, once for all--branded me for life. I do not suppose you can fully
 realise what such a thing means. But it is possible that you may soon
 feel the smart of it yourself now, Mr. Rosmer.
 
 Rosmer. I?
 
 Mortensgaard. Yes. You surely do not suppose that Mr. Kroll and his
 gang will be inclined to forgive a rupture such as yours? And the
 "County News" is going to be pretty bloodthirsty, I hear. It may very
 well come to pass that you will be a marked man, too.
 
 Rosmer. On personal grounds, Mr. Mortensgaard, I feel myself to be
 invulnerable. My conduct does not offer any point of attack.
 
 Mortensgaard (with a quiet smile). That is saying a good deal, Mr.
 Rosmer.
 
 Rosmer. Perhaps it is. But I have the right to say as much.
 
 Mortensgaard. Even if you were inclined to overhaul your conduct as
 thoroughly as you once overhauled mine?
 
 Rosmer. You say that very strangely. What are you driving at?--is it
 anything definite?
 
 Mortensgaard. Yes, there is one definite thing--no more than a single
 one. But it might be quite awkward enough if malicious opponents got a
 hint of it.
 
 Rosmer. Will you have the kindness to tell me what on earth it is?
 
 Mortensgaard. Can you not guess, Mr. Rosmer?
 
 Rosmer. No, not for a moment.
 
 Mortensgaard. All right. I must come out with it, then. I have in my
 possession a remarkable letter, that was written here at Rosmersholm.
 
 Rosmer. Miss West's letter, you mean? Is it so remarkable?
 
 Mortensgaard. No, that letter is not remarkable. But I received a
 letter from this house on another occasion.
 
 Rosmer. From Miss West?
 
 Mortensgaard. No, Mr. Rosmer.
 
 Rosmer. Well, from whom, then? From whom?
 
 Mortensgaard. From your late wife.
 
 Rosmer. From my wife? You had a letter from my wife?
 
 Mortensgaard. Yes, I did.
 
 Rosmer. When?
 
 Mortensgaard. It was during the poor lady's last days. It must be about
 a year and a half ago now. And that is the letter that is so remarkable.
 
 Rosmer. Surely you know that my wife's mind was affected at that time?
 
 Mortensgaard. I know there were a great many people who thought so.
 But, in my opinion, no one would have imagined anything of the kind
 from the letter. When I say the letter is a remarkable one, I mean
 remarkable in quite another way.
 
 Rosmer. And what in the world did my poor wife find to write to you
 about?
 
 Mortensgaard. I have the letter at home. It begins more or less to the
 effect that she is living in perpetual terror and dread, because of the
 fact that there are so many evilly disposed people about her whose only
 desire is to do you harm and mischief.
 
 Rosmer. Me?
 
 Mortensgaard. Yes, so she says. And then follows the most remarkable
 part of it all. Shall I tell you, Mr. Rosmer?
 
 Rosmer. Of course! Tell me everything, without any reserve.
 
 Mortensgaard. The poor lady begs and entreats me to be magnanimous. She
 says that she knows it was you, who got me dismissed from my post as
 schoolmaster, and implores me most earnestly not to revenge myself upon
 you.
 
 Rosmer. What way did she think you could revenge yourself, then?
 
 Mortensgaard. The letter goes on to say that if I should hear that
 anything sinful was going on at Rosmersholm, I was not to believe a
 word of it; that it would be only the work of wicked folk who were
 spreading the rumours on purpose to do you harm.
 
 Rosmer. Does the letter say that?
 
 Mortensgaard. You may read it at your convenience, Mr. Rosmer.
 
 Rosmer. But I cannot understand--? What did she imagine there could be
 any wicked rumours about?
 
 Mortensgaard. In the first place, that you had broken away from the
 faith of your childhood. Mrs. Rosmer denied that absolutely--at that
 time. And, in the next place--ahem!
 
 Rosmer. In the next place?
 
 Mortensgaard. Well, in the next place she writes--though rather
 confusedly--that she has no knowledge of any sinful relations existing
 at Rosmersholm; that she has never been wronged in any way; and that if
 any rumours of that sort should get about, she entreats me not to
 allude to them in the "Searchlight".
 
 Rosmer. Does she mention any names?
 
 Mortensgaard. No.
 
 Rosmer. Who brought you the letter?
 
 Mortensgaard. I promised not to tell that. It was brought to me one
 evening after dark.
 
 Rosmer. If you had made inquiries at the time, you would have learnt
 that my poor unhappy wife was not fully accountable for her actions.
 
 Mortensgaard. I did make inquiries, Mr. Rosmer; but I must say I did
 not get exactly that impression.
 
 Rosmer. Not?--But why have you chosen this moment to enlighten me as to
 the existence of this old crazy letter?
 
 Mortensgaard. With the object of advising you to be extremely cautious,
 Mr. Rosmer.
 
 Rosmer. As to my way of life, do you mean?
 
 Mortensgaard. Yes. You must remember that for the future you will not
 be unassailable.
 
 Rosmer. So you persist in thinking that I have something to conceal
 here?
 
 Mortensgaard. I do not see any reason why a man of emancipated ideas
 should refrain from living his life as fully as possible. Only, as I
 have already said, you should be cautious in future. If rumours should
 get about of anything that offends people's prejudices, you may be
 quite certain that the whole cause of freedom of thought will suffer
 for it. Good-bye, Mr. Rosmer.
 
 Rosmer. Good-bye.
 
 Mortensgaard. I shall go straight to the printing-office now and have
 the great piece of news inserted in the "Searchlight".
 
 Rosmer. Put it all in.
 
 Mortensgaard. I will put in as much as there is any need for the public
 to know. (Bows, and goes out. ROSMER stands at the door, while
 MORTENSGAARD goes downstairs. The front door is heard shutting.)
 
 Rosmer (still standing in the doorway, calls softly). Rebecca!
 Reb--ahem! (Calls loudly.) Mrs. Helseth--is Miss West downstairs?
 
 Mrs. Helseth (from below). No, sir, she is not here.
 
 (The curtain at the end of the room is drawn back, disclosing REBECCA
 standing in the doorway.)
 
 Rebecca. John!
 
 Rosmer (turning round). What! Were you in there, in my bedroom! My
 dear, what were you doing there?
 
 Rebecca (going up to him). I have been listening.
 
 Rosmer. Rebecca! Could you do a thing like that?
 
 Rebecca. Indeed I could. It was so horrid the way he said that--about
 my morning wrapper.
 
 Rosmer. Ah, so you were in there too when Kroll--?
 
 Rebecca. Yes. I wanted to know what was at the bottom of his mind.
 
 Rosmer. You know I would have told you.
 
 Rebecca. I scarcely think you would have told me everything--certainly
 not in his own words.
 
 Rosmer. Did you hear everything, then?
 
 Rebecca. Most of it, I think. I had to go down for a moment when
 Mortensgaard came.
 
 Rosmer. And then came up again?
 
 Rebecca. Do not take it ill of me, dear friend.
 
 Rosmer. Do anything that you think right and proper. You have full
 freedom of action.--But what do you say to it all, Rebecca? Ah, I do
 not think I have ever stood so much in need of you as I do to-day.
 
 Rebecca. Surely both you and I have been prepared for what would happen
 some day.
 
 Rosmer. No, no--not for this.
 
 Rebecca. Not for this?
 
 Rosmer. It is true that I used to think that sooner or later our
 beautiful pure friendship would come to be attacked by calumny and
 suspicion--not on Kroll's part, for I never would have believed such a
 thing of him--but on the part of the coarse-minded and ignoble-eyed
 crowd. Yes, indeed; I had good reason enough for so jealously drawing a
 veil of concealment over our compact. It was a dangerous secret.
 
 Rebecca. Why should we pay any heed to what all these other people
 think? You and I know that we have nothing to reproach ourselves with.
 
 Rosmer. I? Nothing to reproach myself with? It is true enough that I
 thought so until to-day. But now, now, Rebecca--
 
 Rebecca. Yes? Now?
 
 Rosmer. How am I to account to myself for Beata's horrible accusation?
 
 Rebecca (impetuously). Oh, don't talk about Beata! Don't think about
 Beata any more! She is dead, and you seemed at last to have been able
 to get away from the thought of her.
 
 Rosmer. Since I have learnt of this, it seems just as if she had come
 to life again in some uncanny fashion.
 
 Rebecca. Oh no--you must not say that, John! You must not!
 
 Rosmer. I tell you it is so. We must try and get to the bottom of it.
 How can she have strayed into such a woeful misunderstanding of me?
 
 Rebecca. Surely you too are not beginning to doubt that she was very
 nearly insane?
 
 Rosmer. Well, I cannot deny it is just of that fact that I feel I
 cannot be so altogether certain any longer. And besides if it were so--
 
 Rebecca. If it were so? What then?
 
 Rosmer. What I mean is--where are we to look for the actual cause of
 her sick woman's fancies turning into insanity?
 
 Rebecca. What good can it possibly do for you to indulge in such
 speculations!
 
 Rosmer. I cannot do otherwise, Rebecca. I cannot let this doubt go on
 gnawing at my heart, however unwilling I may be to face it.
 
 Rebecca. But it may become a real danger to you to be perpetually
 dwelling on this one lugubrious topic.
 
 Rosmer (walking about restlessly and absorbed in the idea). I must have
 betrayed myself in some way or other. She must have noticed how happy I
 began to feel from the day you came to us.
 
 Rebecca. Yes; but dear, even if that were so--
 
 Rosmer. You may be sure she did not fail to notice that we read the
 same books; that we sought one another's company, and discussed every
 new topic together. But I cannot understand it--because I was always so
 careful to spare her. When I look back, it seems to me that I did
 everything I could to keep her apart from our lives. Or did I not,
 Rebecca?
 
 Rebecca. Yes, yes--undoubtedly you did.
 
 Rosmer. And so did you, too. And notwithstanding that--! Oh, it is
 horrible to think of! To think that here she was--with her affection
 all distorted by illness--never saying a word--watching us--noticing
 everything and--and--misconstruing everything.
 
 Rebecca (wringing her hands). Oh, I never ought to have come to
 Rosmersholm.
 
 Rosmer. Just think what she must have suffered in silence! Think of all
 the horrible things her poor diseased brain must have led her to
 believe about us and store up in her mind about us! Did she never speak
 to you of anything that could give you any kind of clue?
 
 Rebecca (as if startled). To me! Do you suppose I should have remained
 here a day longer, if she had?
 
 Rosmer. No, no--that is obvious. What a fight she must have fought--and
 fought alone, Rebecca! In despair, and all alone. And then, in the end,
 the poignant misery of her victory--which was also her accusation of
 us--in the mill-race! (Throws himself into a chair, rests his elbows on
 the table, and hides his face in his hands.)
 
 Rebecca (coming quietly up behind him). Listen to me, John. If it were
 in your power to call Beata back--to you--to Rosmersholm--would you do
 it?
 
 Rosmer. How can I tell what I would do or what I would not do! I have
 no thoughts for anything but the one thing which is irrevocable.
 
 Rebecca. You ought to be beginning to live now, John. You were
 beginning. You had freed yourself completely on all sides. You were
 feeling so happy and so light-hearted
 
 Rosmer. I know--that is true enough. And then comes this overwhelming
 blow.
 
 Rebecca (standing behind him, with her arms on the back of his chair).
 How beautiful it was when we used to sit there downstairs in the
 dusk--and helped each other to plan our lives out afresh. You wanted to
 catch hold of actual life--the actual life of the day, as you used to
 say. You wanted to pass from house to house like a guest who brought
 emancipation with him--to win over men's thoughts and wills to your
 own--to fashion noble men all around you, in a wider and wider
 circle--noble men!
 
 Rosmer. Noble men and happy men.
 
 Rebecca. Yes, happy men.
 
 Rosmer. Because it is happiness that gives the soul nobility, Rebecca.
 
 Rebecca. Do you not think suffering too? The deepest suffering?
 
 Rosmer. Yes, if one can win through it--conquer it--conquer it
 completely.
 
 Rebecca. That is what you must do.
 
 Rosmer (shaking his head sadly). I shall never conquer this completely.
 There will always be a doubt confronting me--a question. I shall never
 again be able to lose myself in the enjoyment of what makes life so
 wonderfully beautiful.
 
 Rebecca (speaking over the back of his chair, softly). What do you
 mean, John?
 
 Rosmer (looking up at her). Calm and happy innocence.
 
 Rebecca (taking a step backwards). Of course. Innocence. (A short
 silence.)
 
 Rosmer (resting his head on his hands with his elbows on the table, and
 looking straight in front of him). How ingeniously--how
 systematically--she must have put one thing together with another!
 First of all she begins to have a suspicion as to my orthodoxy. How on
 earth did she get that idea in her mind? Any way, she did; and the idea
 grew into a certainty. And then--then, of course, it was easy for her
 to think everything else possible. (Sits up in his chair and, runs his
 hands through his hair.) The wild fancies I am haunted with! I shall
 never get quit of them. I am certain of that--certain. They will always
 be starting up before me to remind me of the dead.
 
 Rebecca. Like the White Horse of Rosmersholm.
 
 Rosmer. Yes, like that. Rushing at me out of the dark--out of the
 silence.
 
 Rebecca. And, because of this morbid fancy of yours, you are going to
 give up the hold you had just gained upon real life?
 
 Rosmer. You are right, it seems hard--hard, Rebecca. But I have no
 power of choice in the matter. How do you think I could ever get the
 mastery over it?
 
 Rebecca (standing behind his chair). By making new ties for yourself.
 
 Rosmer (starts, and looks up). New ties?
 
 Rebecca. Yes, new ties with the outside world. Live, work, do
 something! Do not sit here musing and brooding over insoluble
 conundrums.
 
 Rosmer (getting up). New ties! (Walks across the room, turns at the
 door and comes back again.) A question occurs to my mind. Has it not
 occurred to you too, Rebecca?
 
 Rebecca (catching her breath). Let me hear what it is.
 
 Rosmer. What do you suppose will become of the tie between us, after
 to-day?
 
 Rebecca. I think surely our friendship can endure, come what may.
 
 Rosmer. Yes, but that is not exactly what I meant. I was thinking of
 what brought us together from the first, what links us so closely to
 one another--our common belief in the possibility of a man and a woman
 living together in chastity.
 
 Rebecca. Yes, yes--what of it?
 
 Rosmer. What I mean is--does not such a tie as that--such a tie as
 ours--seem to belong properly to a life lived in quiet, happy
 peacefulness?
 
 Rebecca. Well?
 
 Rosmer. But now I see stretching before me a life of strife and unrest
 and violent emotions. For I mean to live my life, Rebecca! I am not
 going to let myself be beaten to the ground by the dread of what may
 happen. I am not going to have my course of life prescribed for me,
 either by any living soul or by another.
 
 Rebecca. No, no--do not! Be a free man in everything, John!
 
 Rosmer. Do you understand what is in my Mind, then? Do you not know? Do
 you not see how I could best win my freedom from all these harrowing
 memories from the whole sad past?
 
 Rebecca. Tell me!
 
 Rosmer. By setting up, in opposition to them, a new and living reality.
 
 Rebecca (feeling for the back of the chair). A living--? What do you
 mean?
 
 Rosmer (coming closer to her). Rebecca--suppose I asked you now--will
 you be my second wife?
 
 Rebecca (is speechless for a moment, then gives a cry of joy). Your
 wife! Yours--! I!
 
 Rosmer. Yes--let us try what that will do. We two shall be one. There
 must no longer be any empty place left by the dead in this house.
 
 Rebecca. I--in Beata's place--?
 
 Rosmer. And then that chapter of my life will be closed--completely
 closed, never to be reopened.
 
 Rebecca (in a low, trembling voice). Do you think so, John?
 
 Rosmer. It must be so! It must! I cannot--I will not--go through life
 with a dead body on my back. Help me to throw it off, Rebecca; and then
 let us stifle all memories in our sense of freedom, in joy, in passion.
 You shall be to me the only wife I have ever had.
 
 Rebecca (controlling herself). Never speak of this, again. I will never
 be your wife.
 
 Rosmer. What! Never? Do you think, then, that you could not learn to
 love me? Is not our friendship already tinged with love?
 
 Rebecca (stopping her ears, as if in fear). Don't speak like that,
 John! Don't say such things!
 
 Rosmer (catching her by the arm). It is true! There is a growing
 possibility in the tie that is between us. I can see that you feel
 that, as well as I--do you not, Rebecca?
 
 Rebecca (controlling herself completely). Listen. Let me tell you
 this--if you persist in this, I shall leave Rosmersholm.
 
 Rosmer. Leave Rosmersholm! You! You cannot do that. It is impossible.
 
 Rebecca. It is still more impossible for me to become your wife. Never,
 as long as I live, can I be that.
 
 Rosmer (looks at her in surprise). You say "can"--and you say it so
 strangely. Why can you not?
 
 Rebecca (taking both his hands in hers). Dear friend--for your own
 sake, as well as for mine, do not ask me why. (Lets go of his hands.)
 So, John. (Goes towards the door on the left.)
 
 Rosmer. For the future the world will hold only one question for
 me--why?
 
 Rebecca (turns and looks at him). In that case everything is at an end.
 
 Rosmer. Between you and me?
 
 Rebecca. Yes.
 
 Rosmer. Things can never be at an end between us two. You shall never
 leave Rosmersholm.
 
 Rebecca (with her hand on the door-handle). No, I dare say I shall not.
 But, all the same, if you question me again, it will mean the end of
 everything.
 
 Rosmer. The end of everything, all the same? How--?
 
 Rebecca. Because then I shall go the way Beata went. Now you know, John.
 
 Rosmer. Rebecca--!
 
 Rebecca (stops at the door and nods: slowly). Now you know. (Goes out.)
 
 Rosmer (stares in bewilderment at the shut door, and says to himself):
 What can it mean?
 
 
 
 
 ACT III
 
 
 (SCENE. The sitting-room at Rosmersholm. The window and the hall-door
 are open. The morning sun is seen shining outside. REBECCA, dressed as
 in ACT I., is standing by the window, watering and arranging the
 flowers. Her work is lying on the armchair. MRS. HELSETH is going round
 the room with a feather brush, dusting the furniture.)
 
 Rebecca (after a short pause). I wonder why Mr. Rosmer is so late in
 coming down to-day?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Oh, he is often as late as this, miss. He is sure to be
 down directly.
 
 Rebecca. Have you seen anything of him?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. No, miss, except that as I took his coffee into his study
 he went into his bedroom to finish dressing.
 
 Rebecca. The reason I ask is that he was not very well yesterday.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. No, he did not look well. It made me wonder whether
 something had gone amiss between him and his brother-in-law.
 
 Rebecca. What do you suppose could go amiss between them?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. I can't say, miss. Perhaps it was that fellow
 Mortensgaard set them at loggerheads.
 
 Rebecca. It is quite possible. Do you know anything of this Peter
 Mortensgaard?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Not I! How could you think so, miss--a man like that!
 
 Rebecca. Because of that horrid paper he edits, you mean?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Not only because of that, miss. I suppose you have heard
 that a certain married woman, whose husband had deserted her, had a
 child by him?
 
 Rebecca. I have heard it; but of course that was long before I came
 here.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Bless me, yes--he was quite a young man then. But she
 might have had more sense than he had. He wanted to marry her, too, but
 that could not be done; and so he had to pay heavily for it. But since
 then--my word!--Mortensgaard has risen in the world. There are lots of
 people who run after him now.
 
 Rebecca. I believe most of the poor people turn to him first when they
 are in any trouble.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Oh, not only the poor people, miss--
 
 Rebecca (glancing at her unobserved). Indeed?
 
 Mrs. Helseth (standing at the sofa, dusting vigorously). People you
 would least expect, sometimes, miss.
 
 Rebecca (arranging the flowers). Yes, but that is only an idea of
 yours, Mrs. Helseth. You cannot know that for certain.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. You think I don't know anything about that for certain,
 do you, miss? Indeed I do. Because--if I must let out the secret at
 last--I carried a letter to Mortensgaard myself once.
 
 Rebecca (turns round). No--did you!
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Yes, that I did. And that letter, let me tell you, was
 written here--at Rosmersholm.
 
 Rebecca. Really, Mrs. Helseth?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. I give you my word it was, miss. And it was written on
 good note-paper--and sealed with beautiful red sealing-wax.
 
 Rebecca. And you were entrusted with the delivery of it? Dear Mrs.
 Helseth, it is not very difficult to guess whom it was from.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Who, then?
 
 Rebecca. Naturally, it was something that poor Mrs. Rosmer in her
 invalid state--
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Well, you have mentioned her name, miss--not I.
 
 Rebecca. But what was in the letter?--No, of course, you cannot know
 that.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Hm!--it is just possible I may know, all the same.
 
 Rebecca. Did she tell you what she was writing about, then?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. No, she did not do that. But when Mortensgaard had read
 it, he set to work and cross-questioned me, so that I got a very good
 idea of what was in it.
 
 Rebecca. What do you think was in it, then? Oh, dear, good Mrs.
 Helseth, do tell me!
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Certainly not, miss. Not for worlds.
 
 Rebecca. Oh, you can tell me. You and I are such friends, you know.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Heaven forbid I should tell you anything about that,
 miss. I shall not tell you anything, except that it was some dreadful
 idea that they had gone and put into my poor sick mistress's head.
 
 Rebecca. Who had put it into her head?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Wicked people, miss. Wicked people.
 
 Rebecca. Wicked--?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Yes, I say it again--very wicked people, they must have
 been.
 
 Rebecca. And what do you think it could be?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Oh, I know what I think--but, please Heaven, I'll keep my
 mouth shut. At the same time, there is a certain lady in the town--hm!
 
 Rebecca. I can see you mean Mrs. Kroll.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Yes, she is a queer one, she is. She has always been very
 much on the high horse with me. And she has never looked with any
 friendly eye on you, either, miss.
 
 Rebecca. Do you think Mrs. Rosmer was quite in her right mind when she
 wrote that letter to Mortensgaard?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. It is so difficult to tell, miss. I certainly don't think
 she was quite out of her mind.
 
 Rebecca. But you know she seemed to go quite distracted when she learnt
 that she would never be able to have a child. That was when her madness
 first showed itself.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Yes, that had a terrible effect on her, poor lady.
 
 Rebecca (taking up her work, and sitting down on a chair by the
 window). But, in other respects, do you not think that was really a
 good thing for Mr. Rosmer, Mrs. Helseth?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. What, miss?
 
 Rebecca. That there were no children?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Hm!--I really do not know what to say to that.
 
 Rebecca. Believe me, it was best for him. Mr. Rosmer was never meant to
 be surrounded by crying children.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Little children do not cry at Rosmersholm, Miss West.
 
 Rebecca (looking at her). Not cry?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. No. In this house, little children have never been known
 to cry, as long as any one can remember.
 
 Rebecca. That is very strange.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Yes, isn't it, miss? But it runs in the family. And there
 is another thing that is just as strange; when they grow up they never
 laugh--never laugh, all their lives.
 
 Rebecca. But that would be extraordinary
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Have you ever once heard or seen Mr. Rosmer laugh, miss?
 
 Rebecca. No--now that I think of it, I almost believe you are right.
 But I fancy most of the folk hereabouts laugh very little.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. That is quite true. People say it began at Rosmersholm,
 and I expect it spread like a sort of infection.
 
 Rebecca. You are a sagacious woman, Mrs. Helseth!
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Oh, you mustn't sit there and make game of me, miss.
 (Listens.) Hush, hush--Mr. Rosmer is coming down. He doesn't like to
 see brooms about. (Goes out by the door on the right. ROSMER, with his
 stick and hat in his hand, comes in from the lobby.)
 
 Rosmer. Good-morning, Rebecca.
 
 Rebecca. Good-morning, dear. (She goes on working for a little while in
 silence.) Are you going out?
 
 Rosmer. Yes.
 
 Rebecca. It is such a lovely day.
 
 Rosmer. You did not come up to see me this morning.
 
 Rebecca. No--I didn't. Not to-day.
 
 Rosmer. Don't you mean to do so in future, either? Rebecca. I cannot
 say yet, dear.
 
 Rosmer. Has anything come for me?
 
 Rebecca. The "County News" has come.
 
 Rosmer. The "County News"!
 
 Rebecca. There it is, on the table.
 
 Rosmer (putting down his hat and stick). Is there anything--?
 
 Rebecca. Yes.
 
 Rosmer. And you did not send it up to me
 
 Rebecca. You will read it quite soon enough.
 
 Rosmer. Well, let us see. (Takes up the paper and stands by the table
 reading it.) What!--"cannot pronounce too emphatic a warning against
 unprincipled deserters." (Looks at her.) They call me a deserter,
 Rebecca.
 
 Rebecca. They mention no names at all.
 
 Rosmer. It comes to the same thing. (Goes on reading.) "Secret traitors
 to the good cause."--"Judas-like creatures, who shamelessly confess
 their apostasy as soon as they think the most opportune and most
 profitable moment has arrived."--"A reckless outrage on the fair fame
 of honoured ancestors"--"in the expectation that those who are enjoying
 a brief spell of authority will not disappoint them of a suitable
 reward." (Lays the paper down on the table.) And they write that of
 me--these men who have known me so long and so intimately--write a
 thing that they do not even believe themselves! They know there is not
 a single word of truth in it--and yet they write it.
 
 Rebecca. There is more of it yet.
 
 Rosmer (taking up the paper again). "Make some allowance for
 inexperience and want of judgment"--"a pernicious influence which, very
 possibly, has extended even to matters which for the present we will
 refrain from publicly discussing or condemning." (Looks at her.) What
 does that mean?
 
 Rebecca. That is a hit at me, obviously.
 
 Rosmer (laying down the paper). Rebecca, this is the conduct of
 dishonourable men.
 
 Rebecca. Yes, it seems to me they have no right to talk about
 Mortensgaard.
 
 Rosmer (walking up and down the room). They must be saved from this
 sort of thing. All the good that is in men is destroyed, if it is
 allowed to go on. But it shall not be so! How happy--how happy I should
 feel if I could succeed in bringing a little light into all this murky
 ugliness.
 
 Rebecca (getting up). I am sure of it. There is something great,
 something splendid, for you to live for!
 
 Rosmer. Just think of it--if I could wake them to a real knowledge of
 themselves--bring them to be angry with and ashamed of
 themselves--induce them to be at one with each other in toleration, in
 love, Rebecca!
 
 Rebecca. Yes! Give yourself up entirely to that task, and you will see
 that you will succeed.
 
 Rosmer. I think it might be done. What happiness it would be to live
 one's life, then! No more hateful strife--only emulation; every eye
 fixed on the same goal; every man's will, every man's thoughts moving
 forward-upward--each in its own inevitable path Happiness for all--and
 through the efforts of all! (Looks out of the window as he speaks, then
 gives a start and says gloomily:) Ah! not through me.
 
 Rebecca. Not--not through you?
 
 Rosmer. Nor for me, either.
 
 Rebecca. Oh, John, have no such doubts.
 
 Rosmer. Happiness, dear Rebecca, means first and foremost the calm,
 joyous sense of innocence.
 
 Rebecca (staring in front of her). Ah, innocence--
 
 Rosmer. You need fear nothing on that score. But I--
 
 Rebecca. You least of all men!
 
 Rosmer (pointing out of the window). The mill-race.
 
 Rebecca. Oh, John!--(MRS. HELSETH looks in in through the door on the
 left.)
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Miss West!
 
 Rebecca. Presently, presently. Not now.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Just a word, miss! (REBECCA goes to the door. MRS.
 HELSETH tells her something, and they whisper together for a moment;
 then MRS. HELSETH nods and goes away.)
 
 Rosmer (uneasily). Was it anything for me?
 
 Rebecca. No, only something about the housekeeping. You ought to go out
 into the open air now, John dear. You should go for a good long walk.
 
 Rosmer (taking up his hat). Yes, come along; we will go together.
 
 Rebecca. No, dear, I can't just now. You must go by yourself. But shake
 off all these gloomy thoughts--promise me that!
 
 Rosmer. I shall never be able to shake them quite off, I am afraid.
 
 Rebecca. Oh, but how can you let such groundless fancies take such a
 hold on you!
 
 Rosmer. Unfortunately they are not so groundless as you think, dear. I
 have lain, thinking them over, all night. Perhaps Beata saw things
 truly after all.
 
 Rebecca. In what way do you mean?
 
 Rosmer. Saw things truly when she believed I loved you, Rebecca.
 
 Rebecca. Truly in THAT respect?
 
 Rosmer (laying his hat down on the table). This is the question I have
 been wrestling with--whether we two have deluded ourselves the whole
 time, when we have been calling the tie between us merely friendship.
 
 Rebecca. Do you mean, then, that the right name for it would have
 been--?
 
 Rosmer. Love. Yes, dear, that is what I mean. Even while Beata was
 alive, it was you that I gave all my thoughts to. It was you alone I
 yearned for. It was with you that I experienced peaceful, joyful,
 passionless happiness. When we consider it rightly, Rebecca, our life
 together began like the sweet, mysterious love of two children for one
 another--free from desire or any thought of anything more. Did you not
 feel it in that way too? Tell me.
 
 Rebecca (struggling with herself). Oh, I do not know what to answer.
 
 Rosmer. And it was this life of intimacy, with one another and for one
 another, that we took to be friendship. No, dear--the tie between us
 has been a spiritual marriage--perhaps from the very first day. That is
 why I am guilty. I had no right to it--no right to it for Beata's sake.
 
 Rebecca. No right to a happy life? Do you believe that, John?
 
 Rosmer. She looked at the relations between us through the eyes of HER
 love--judged them after the nature of HER love. And it was only
 natural. She could not have judged them otherwise than she did.
 
 Rebecca. But how can you so accuse yourself for Beata's delusions?
 
 Rosmer. It was for love of me--in her own way that--she threw herself
 into the mill-race. That fact is certain, Rebecca. I can never get
 beyond that.
 
 Rebecca. Oh, do not think of anything else but the great, splendid task
 that you are going to devote your life to!
 
 Rosmer (shaking his head). It can never be carried through. Not by me.
 Not after what I know now.
 
 Rebecca. Why not by you?
 
 Rosmer. Because no cause can ever triumph which has its beginnings in
 guilt.
 
 Rebecca (impetuously). Oh, these are nothing but prejudices you have
 inherited--these doubts, these fears, these scruples! You have a legend
 here that your dead return to haunt you in the form of white horses.
 This seems to me to be something of that sort.
 
 Rosmer. Be that as it may, what difference does it make if I cannot
 shake it off? Believe me, Rebecca, it is as I say--any cause which is
 to win a lasting victory must be championed by a man who is joyous and
 innocent.
 
 Rebecca. But is joy so absolutely indispensable to you, John?
 
 Rosmer. Joy? Yes, indeed it is.
 
 Rebecca. To you, who never laugh?
 
 Rosmer. Yes, in spite of that. Believe me, I have a great capacity for
 joy.
 
 Rebecca. Now you really must go out, dear--for a long walk--a really
 long one, do you hear? There is your hat, and there is your stick.
 
 Rosmer (taking them from her). Thank you. And you won't come too?
 
 Rebecca. No, no, I can't come now.
 
 Rosmer. Very well. You are none the less always with me now. (Goes out
 by the entrance hall. After a moment REBECCA peeps out from behind the
 door which he has left open. Then she goes to the door on the right,
 which she opens.)
 
 Rebecca (in a whisper). Now, Mrs. Helseth. You can let him come in now.
 (Crosses to the window. A moment later, KROLL comes in from the right.
 He bows to her silently and formally and keeps his hat in his hand.)
 
 Kroll. Has he gone, then?
 
 Rebecca. Yes.
 
 Kroll. Does he generally stay out long?
 
 Rebecca. Yes. But to-day he is in a very uncertain mood--so, if you do
 not want to meet him--
 
 Kroll. Certainly not. It is you I wish to speak to--and quite alone.
 
 Rebecca. Then we had better make the best of our time. Please sit down.
 (She sits down in an easy-chair by the window. KROLL takes a chair
 beside her.)
 
 Kroll. Miss West, you can scarcely have any idea how deeply pained and
 unhappy I am over this revolution that has taken place in John Rosmer's
 ideas.
 
 Rebecca. We were prepared for that being so--at first.
 
 Kroll. Only at first?
 
 Rosmer. Mr. Rosmer hoped confidently that sooner or later you would
 take your place beside him.
 
 Kroll. I?
 
 Rebecca. You and all his other friends.
 
 Kroll. That should convince you how feeble his judgment is on any
 matter concerning his fellow-creatures and the affairs of real life.
 
 Rebecca. In any case, now that he feels the absolute necessity of
 cutting himself free on all sides--
 
 Kroll. Yes; but, let me tell you, that is exactly what I do not believe.
 
 Rebecca. What do you believe, then?
 
 Kroll. I believe it is you that are at the bottom of the whole thing.
 
 Rebecca. Your wife put that into your head, Mr. Kroll.
 
 Kroll. It does not matter who put it into my head. The point is this,
 that I feel grave doubts--exceedingly grave doubts--when I recall and
 think over the whole of your behaviour since you came here.
 
 Rebecca (looking at him). I have a notion that there was a time when
 you had an exceedingly strong BELIEF in me, dear Mr. Kroll--I might
 almost say, a warm belief.
 
 Kroll (in a subdued voice). I believe you could bewitch any one--if you
 set yourself to do it.
 
 Rebecca. And you say I set myself to do it!
 
 Kroll. Yes, you did. I am no longer such a simpleton as to suppose that
 sentiment entered into your little game at all. You simply wanted to
 secure yourself admission to Rosmersholm--to establish yourself here.
 That was what I was to help you to. I see it now.
 
 Rebecca. Then you have completely forgotten that it was Beata that
 begged and entreated me to come and live here.
 
 Kroll. Yes, because you had bewitched her too. Are you going to pretend
 that friendship is the name for what she came to feel towards you? It
 was idolatry--adoration. It degenerated into a--what shall I call,
 it?--a sort of desperate passion. Yes, that is just the word for it.
 
 Rebecca. Have the goodness to remember the condition your sister was
 in. As far as I am concerned I do not think I can be said to be
 particularly emotional in any way.
 
 Kroll. No, you certainly are not. But that makes you all the more
 dangerous to those whom you wish to get into your power. It comes easy
 to you to act with deliberation and careful calculation, just because
 you have a cold heart.
 
 Rebecca. Cold? Are you so sure of that?
 
 Kroll. I am certain of it now. Otherwise you could not have pursued
 your object here so unswervingly, year after year. Yes, yes--you have
 gained what you wanted. You have got him and everything else here into
 your power. But, to carry out your schemes, you have not scrupled to
 make him unhappy.
 
 Rebecca. That is not true. It is not I; it is you yourself that have
 made him unhappy.
 
 Kroll. I!
 
 Rebecca. Yes, by leading him to imagine that he was responsible for the
 terrible end that overtook Beata.
 
 Kroll. Did that affect him so deeply, then?
 
 Rebecca. Of course. A man of such gentle disposition as he--
 
 Kroll. I imagined that one of your so-called "emancipated" men would
 know how to overcome any scruples. But there it is! Oh, yes--as a
 matter of fact it turned out just as I expected. The descendant of the
 men who are looking at us from these walls need not think he can break
 loose from what has been handed down as an inviolable inheritance from
 generation to generation.
 
 Rebecca (looking thoughtfully in front of her). John Rosmer's nature is
 deeply rooted in his ancestors. That is certainly very true.
 
 Kroll. Yes, and you ought to have taken that into consideration, if you
 had had any sympathy for him. But I dare say you were incapable of that
 sort of consideration. Your starting-point is so very widely-removed
 from his, you see.
 
 Rebecca. What do you mean by my starting-point?
 
 Kroll. I mean the starting-point of origin--of parentage, Miss West.
 
 Rebecca. I see. Yes, it is quite true that my origin is very humble.
 But nevertheless--
 
 Kroll. I am not alluding to rank or position. I am thinking of the
 moral aspect of your origin.
 
 Rebecca. Of my origin? In what respect?
 
 Kroll. In respect of your birth generally.
 
 Rebecca. What are you saying!
 
 Kroll. I am only saying it because it explains the whole of your
 conduct.
 
 Rebecca. I do not understand. Be so good as to tell me exactly what you
 mean.
 
 Kroll. I really thought you did not need telling. Otherwise it would
 seem a very strange thing that you let yourself be adopted by Dr. West.
 
 Rebecca (getting up). Oh, that is it! Now I understand.
 
 Kroll. And took his name. Your mother's name was Gamvik.
 
 Rebecca (crossing the room). My father's name was Gamvik, Mr. Kroll.
 
 Kroll. Your mother's occupation must, of course, have brought her
 continually into contact with the district physician.
 
 Rebecca. You are quite right.
 
 Kroll. And then he takes you to live with him, immediately upon your
 mother's death. He treats you harshly, and yet you stay with him. You
 know that he will not leave you a single penny--as a matter of fact you
 only got a box of books--and yet you endure living with him, put up
 with his behaviour, and nurse him to the end.
 
 Rebecca (comes to the table and looks at him scornfully). And my doing
 all that makes it clear to you that there was something
 immoral--something criminal about my birth!
 
 Kroll. What you did for him, I attributed to an unconscious filial
 instinct. And, as far as the rest of it goes, I consider that the whole
 of your conduct has been the outcome of your origin.
 
 Rebecca (hotly). But there is not a single word of truth in what you
 say! And I can prove it! Dr. West had not come to Finmark when I was
 born.
 
 Kroll. Excuse me, Miss West. He went there a year before you were born.
 I have ascertained that.
 
 Rebecca. You are mistaken, I tell you! You are absolutely mistaken!
 
 Kroll. You said here, the day before yesterday, that you were
 twenty-nine--going on for thirty.
 
 Rebecca. Really? Did I say that?
 
 Kroll. Yes, you did. And from that I can calculate--
 
 Rebecca. Stop! That will not help you to calculate. For, I may as well
 tell you at once, I am a year older than I give myself out to be.
 
 Kroll (smiling incredulously). Really? That is something new. How is
 that?
 
 Rebecca. When I had passed my twenty-fifth birthday, I thought I was
 getting altogether too old for an unmarried girl, so I resolved to tell
 a lie and take a year off my age.
 
 Kroll. You--an emancipated woman--cherishing prejudices as to the
 marriageable age!
 
 Rebecca. I know it was a silly thing to do--and ridiculous, too. But
 every one has some prejudice or another that they cannot get quite rid
 of. We are like that.
 
 Kroll. Maybe. But my calculation may be quite correct, all the same;
 because Dr. West was up in Finmark for a flying visit the year before
 he was appointed.
 
 Rebecca (impetuously). That is not true
 
 Kroll. Isn't it?
 
 Rebecca. No. My mother never mentioned it.
 
 Kroll. Didn't she, really!
 
 Rebecca. No, never. Nor Dr. West, either. Never a word of it.
 
 Kroll. Might that not be because they both had good reason to jump over
 a year?--@just as you have done yourself, Miss West? Perhaps it is a
 family failing.
 
 Rebecca (walking about, wringing her hands). It is impossible. It is
 only something you want to make me believe. Nothing in the world will
 make me believe it. It cannot be true! Nothing in the world--
 
 Kroll (getting up). But, my dear Miss West, why in Heaven's name do you
 take it in this way? You quite alarm me! What am I to believe and think?
 
 Rebecca. Nothing. Neither believe nor think anything.
 
 Kroll. Then you really must give me some explanation of your taking
 this matter--this possibility--so much to heart.
 
 Rebecca (controlling herself). It is quite obvious, I should think, Mr.
 Kroll. I have no desire for people here to think me an illegitimate
 child.
 
 Kroll. Quite so. Well, well, let us be content with your explanation,
 for the present. But you see that is another point on which you have
 cherished a certain prejudice.
 
 Rebecca. Yes, that is quite true.
 
 Kroll. And it seems to me that very much the same applies to most of
 this "emancipation" of yours, as you call it. Your reading has
 introduced you to a hotch-potch of new ideas and opinions; you have
 made a certain acquaintance with researches that are going on in
 various directions--researches that seem to you to upset a good many
 ideas that people have hitherto considered incontrovertible and
 unassailable. But all this has never gone any further than knowledge in
 your case, Miss West--a mere matter of the intellect. It has not got
 into your blood.
 
 Rebecca (thoughtfully). Perhaps you are right.
 
 Kroll. Yes, only test yourself, and you will see! And if it is true in
 your case, it is easy to recognise how true it must be in John
 Rosmer's. Of course it is madness, pure and simple. He will be running
 headlong to his ruin if he persists in coming openly forward and
 proclaiming himself an apostate! Just think of it--he, with his shy
 disposition! Think of HIM disowned--hounded out of the circle to which
 he has always belonged--exposed to the uncompromising attacks of all
 the best people in the place. Nothing would ever make him the man to
 endure that.
 
 Rebecca. He MUST endure it! It is too late now for him to draw back.
 
 Kroll. Not a bit too late--not by any means too late. What has happened
 can be hushed up--or at any rate can be explained away as a purely
 temporary, though regrettable, aberration. But--there is one step that
 it is absolutely essential he should take.
 
 Rebecca. And that is?
 
 Kroll. You must get him to legalise his position, Miss West.
 
 Rebecca. The position in which he stands to me?
 
 Kroll. Yes. You must see that you get him to do that.
 
 Rebecca. Then you can't rid yourself of the conviction that the
 relations between us need "legalising," as you say?
 
 Kroll. I do not wish to go any more precisely into the question. But I
 certainly have observed that the conditions under which it always seems
 easiest for people to abandon all their so-called prejudices are
 when--ahem!
 
 Rebecca. When it is a question of the relations between a man and a
 woman, I suppose you mean?
 
 Kroll. Yes--to speak candidly--that is what I mean.
 
 Rebecca (walks across the room and looks out of the window). I was on
 the point of saying that I wish you had been right, Mr. Kroll.
 
 Kroll. What do you mean by that? You say it so strangely!
 
 Rebecca. Oh, nothing! Do not let us talk any more about it. Ah, there
 he is!
 
 Kroll. Already! I will go, then.
 
 Rebecca (turning to him). No--stay here, and you will hear something.
 
 Kroll. Not now. I do not think I could bear to see him.
 
 Rebecca. I beg you to stay. Please do, or you will regret it later. It
 is the last time I shall ever ask you to do anything.
 
 Kroll (looks at her in surprise, and lays his hat down). Very well,
 Miss West. It shall be as you wish. (A short pause. Then ROSMER comes
 in from the hall.)
 
 Rosmer (stops at the door, as he sees KROLL). What! you here?
 
 Rebecca. He wanted to avoid meeting you, John.
 
 Kroll (involuntarily). "John?"
 
 Rebecca. Yes, Mr. Kroll. John and I call each other by our Christian
 names. That is a natural consequence of the relations between us.
 
 Kroll. Was that what I was to hear if I stayed?
 
 Rebecca. Yes, that and something else.
 
 Rosmer (coming into the room). What is the object of your visit here
 to-day?
 
 Kroll. I wanted to make one more effort to stop you, and win you back.
 
 Rosmer (pointing to the newspaper). After that?
 
 Kroll. I did not write it.
 
 Rosmer. Did you take any steps to prevent its appearing?
 
 Kroll. That would have been acting unjustifiably towards the cause I
 serve. And, besides that, I had no power to prevent it.
 
 Rebecca (tears the newspaper into pieces, which she crumples up and
 throws into the back of the stove). There! Now it is out of sight; let
 it be out of mind too. Because there will be no more of that sort of
 thing, John.
 
 Kroll. Indeed, I wish you could ensure that.
 
 Rebecca. Come, and let us sit down, dear--all three of us. Then I will
 tell you all about it.
 
 Rosmer (sitting down involuntarily). What has come over you, Rebecca?
 You are so unnaturally calm--What is it?
 
 Rebecca. The calmness of determination. (Sits down.) Please sit down
 too, Mr. Kroll. (He takes a seat on the couch.)
 
 Rosmer. Determination, you say. Determination to do what?
 
 Rebecca. I want to give you back what you need in order to live your
 life. You shall have your happy innocence back, dear friend.
 
 Rosmer. But what do you mean?
 
 Rebecca. I will just tell you what happened. That is all that is
 necessary.
 
 Rosmer. Well?
 
 Rebecca. When I came down here from Finmark with Dr. West, it seemed to
 me that a new, great, wide world was opened to me. Dr. West had given
 me an erratic sort of education--had taught me all the odds and ends
 that I knew about life then. (Has an evident struggle with herself, and
 speaks in barely audible tones.) And then--
 
 Kroll. And then?
 
 Rosmer. But, Rebecca--I know all this.
 
 Rebecca (collecting herself). Yes--that is true enough. You know it
 only too well.
 
 Kroll (looking fixedly at her). Perhaps it would be better if I left
 you.
 
 Rebecca. No, stay where you are, dear Mr. Kroll. (To ROSMER.) Well,
 this was how it was. I wanted to play my part in the new day that was
 dawning--to have a share in all the new ideas. Mr. Kroll told me one
 day that Ulrik Brendel had had a great influence over you once, when
 you were a boy. I thought it might be possible for me to resume that
 influence here.
 
 Rosmer. Did you come here with a covert design?
 
 Rebecca. What I wanted was that we two should go forward together on
 the road towards freedom--always forward, and further forward! But
 there was that gloomy, insurmountable barrier between you and a full,
 complete emancipation.
 
 Rosmer. What barrier do you mean?
 
 Rebecca. I mean, John, that you could never have attained freedom
 except in the full glory of the sunshine. And, instead of that, here
 you were--ailing and languishing in the gloom of such a marriage as
 yours.
 
 Rosmer. You have never spoken to me of my marriage in that way, before
 to-day.
 
 Rebecca. No, I did not dare, for fear of frightening you.
 
 Kroll (nodding to ROSMER). You hear that!
 
 Rebecca (resuming). But I saw quite well where your salvation lay--your
 only salvation. And so I acted.
 
 Rosmer. How do you mean--you acted?
 
 Kroll. Do you mean that?
 
 Rebecca. Yes, John. (Gets up.) No, do not get up. Nor you either, Mr.
 Kroll. But we must let in the daylight now. It was not you, John. You
 are innocent. It was I that lured--that ended by luring--Beata into the
 tortuous path--
 
 Rosmer (springing up). Rebecca!
 
 Kroll (getting up). Into the tortuous path!
 
 Rebecca. Into the path that--led to the mill-race. Now you know it,
 both of you.
 
 Rosmer (as if stunned). But I do not understand--What is she standing
 there saying? I do not understand a word--
 
 Kroll. Yes, yes. I begin to understand.
 
 Rosmer. But what did you do? What did you find to tell her? Because
 there was nothing--absolutely nothing!
 
 Rebecca. She got to know that you were determined to emancipate
 yourself from all your old prejudices.
 
 Rosmer. Yes, but at that time I had come to no decision.
 
 Rebecca. I knew that you soon would come to one.
 
 Kroll (nodding to ROSMER). Aha!
 
 Rosmer. Well--and what more? I want to know everything now.
 
 Rebecca. Some time afterwards, I begged and implored her to let me
 leave Rosmersholm.
 
 Rosmer. Why did you want to leave here--then?
 
 Rebecca. I did not want to. I wanted to remain where I was. But I told
 her that it would be best for us all if I went away in time. I let her
 infer that if I remained here any longer I could not tell
 what-what-might happen.
 
 Rosmer. That is what you said and did, then?
 
 Rebecca. Yes, John.
 
 Rosmer. That is what you referred to when you said that you "acted"?
 
 Rebecca (in a broken voice). Yes, that was it.
 
 Rosmer (after a pause). Have you confessed everything now, Rebecca?
 
 Rebecca. Yes.
 
 Kroll. Not everything.
 
 Rebecca (looking at him in terror). What else can there be?
 
 Kroll. Did you not eventually lead Beata to believe that it was
 necessary--not merely that it should be best--but that it was
 necessary, both for your own sake and for John's, that you should go
 away somewhere else as soon as possible?--Well?
 
 Rebecca (speaking low and indistinctly). Perhaps I did say something of
 the sort.
 
 Rosmer (sinking into a chair by the window). And she, poor sick
 creature, believed in this tissue of lies and deceit! Believed in it so
 completely--so absolutely! (Looks up at REBECCA.) And she never came to
 me about it--never said a word! Ah, Rebecca--I see it in your face--YOU
 dissuaded her from doing so.
 
 Rebecca. You know she had taken it into her head that she, a childless
 wife, had no right to be here. And so she persuaded herself that her
 duty to you was to give place to another.
 
 Rosmer. And you--you did nothing to rid her mind of such an idea?
 
 Rebecca. No.
 
 Kroll. Perhaps you encouraged her in the idea? Answer! Did you not do
 so?
 
 Rebecca. That was how she understood me, I believe.
 
 Rosmer. Yes, yes--and she bowed to your will in everything. And so she
 gave place. (Springs up.) How could you--how could you go on with this
 terrible tragedy!
 
 Rebecca. I thought there were two lives here to choose between, John.
 
 Kroll (severely and with authority). You had no right to make any such
 choice.
 
 Rebecca (impetuously). Surely you do not think I acted with cold and
 calculating composure! I am a different woman now, when I am telling
 you this, from what I was then. And I believe two different kinds of
 will can exist at the same time in one person. I wanted Beata away--in
 one way or the other; but I never thought it would happen, all the
 same. At every step I ventured and risked, I seemed to hear a voice in
 me crying: "No further! Not a step further!" And yet, at the same time,
 I COULD not stop. I HAD to venture a little bit further--just one step.
 And then another--and always another--and at last it happened. That is
 how such things go of themselves. (A short silence.)
 
 Rosmer (to REBECCA). And how do you think it will go with YOU in the
 future?--after this?
 
 Rebecca. Things must go with me as they can. It is of very little
 consequence.
 
 Kroll. Not a word suggestive of remorse! Perhaps you feel none?
 
 Rebecca (dismissing his remark coldly). Excuse me, Mr. Kroll, that is a
 matter that is no concern of any one else's. That is an account I must
 settle with myself.
 
 Kroll (to ROSMER). And this is the woman you have been living under the
 same roof with--in relations of the completest confidence. (Looks up at
 the portraits on the walls.) If only those that are gone could look
 down now!
 
 Rosmer. Are you going into the town?
 
 Kroll (taking up his hat). Yes. The sooner the better.
 
 Rosmer (taking his hat also). Then I will go with you.
 
 Kroll. You will! Ah, I thought we had not quite lost you.
 
 Rosmer. Come, then, Kroll. Come! (They both go out into the hall
 without looking at REBECCA. After a minute REBECCA goes cautiously to
 the window and peeps out between the flowers.)
 
 Rebecca (speaking to herself, half aloud). Not over the bridge to-day
 either. He is going round. Never over the millrace--never. (Comes away
 from the window.) As I thought! (She goes over to the bell, and rings
 it. Soon afterwards MRS. HELSETH comes in from the right.)
 
 Mrs. Helseth. What is it, miss?
 
 Rebecca. Mrs. Helseth, will you be so good as to fetch my travelling
 trunk down from the loft?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Your trunk?
 
 Rebecca. Yes, the brown hair-trunk, you know.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Certainly, miss. But, bless my soul, are you going away
 on a journey, miss?
 
 Rebecca. Yes--I am going away on a journey, Mrs. Helseth.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. And immediately!
 
 Rebecca. As soon as I have packed.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. I never heard of such a thing! But you are coming back
 again soon, I suppose, miss?
 
 Rebecca. I am never coming back again.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Never! But, my goodness, what is to become of us at
 Rosmersholm if Miss West is not here any longer? Just as everything was
 making poor Mr. Rosmer so happy and comfortable!
 
 Rebecca. Yes, but to-day I have had a fright, Mrs. Helseth.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. A fright! Good heavens-how?
 
 Rebecca. I fancy I have had a glimpse of the White Horse.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Of the White Horse! In broad daylight!
 
 Rebecca. Ah! they are out both early and late, the White Horses of
 Rosmersholm. (Crosses the room.) Well--we were speaking of my trunk,
 Mrs. Helseth.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Yes, miss. Your trunk.
 
 (They both go out to the right.)
 
 
 
 
 ACT IV
 
 
 (SCENE.--The same room in the late evening. The lamp, with a shade on
 it, is burning on the table. REBECCA is standing by the table, packing
 some small articles in a travelling-bag. Her cloak, hat, and the white
 crochetted shawl are hanging on the back of the couch. MRS. HELSETH
 comes in from the right.)
 
 Mrs. Helseth (speaking in low tones and with a reserved manner). Yes,
 all your things have been taken down, miss. They are in the kitchen
 passage.
 
 Rebecca. Thank you. You have ordered the carriage?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Yes, miss. The coachman wants to know what time he shall
 bring it round.
 
 Rebecca. I think at about eleven o'clock. The boat goes at midnight.
 
 Mrs. Helseth (with a little hesitation). But what about Mr. Rosmer?
 Suppose he is not back by that time?
 
 Rebecca. I shall start, all the same. If I should not see him, you can
 tell him I will write to him--a long letter, say that.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Yes, I dare say it will be all right to write. But, poor
 dear, I really think that you ought to try and have a talk with him
 once more.
 
 Rebecca. Perhaps I ought--Or perhaps not, after all.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Dear, dear! I never thought I should, live to see such a
 thing as this!
 
 Rebecca. What did you think, then, Mrs. Helseth?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. To tell the truth, miss, I thought Mr. Rosmer was an
 honester man than that.
 
 Rebecca. Honester?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Yes, miss, that is the truth.
 
 Rebecca. But, my dear Mrs. Helseth, what do you mean by that?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. I mean what is true and right, miss. He should not get
 out of it in this way--that he shouldn't.
 
 Rebecca (looking at her). Now look here, Mrs. Helseth. Tell me,
 honestly and frankly, why you think I am going away.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Good Lord, miss--because it is necessary, I suppose.
 Well, well!--Still, I certainly do not think Mr. Rosmer has behaved
 well. There was some excuse in Mortensgaard's case, because the woman's
 husband was still alive; so that it was impossible for them to marry,
 however much they wished it. But Mr. Rosmer, he could--ahem!
 
 Rebecca (with a faint smile). Is it possible that you could think such
 things about me and Mr. Rosmer?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Not for a moment--until to-day, I mean.
 
 Rebecca. But why to-day?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Well, after all the horrible things they tell me one may
 see in the papers about Mr. Rosmer--
 
 Rebecca. Ah!
 
 Mrs. Helseth. What I mean is this--if a man can go over to
 Mortensgaard's religion, you may believe him capable of anything. And
 that's the truth.
 
 Rebecca. Yes, very likely. But about me? What have you got to say about
 me?
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Well, I am sure, miss--I do not think you are so greatly
 to be blamed. It is not always so easy for a lone woman to resist, I
 dare say. We are all human after all, Miss West.
 
 Rebecca. That is very true, Mrs. Helseth. We are all human, after
 all.--What are you listening to?
 
 Mrs. Helseth (in a low voice). Good Lord!--I believe that is him coming
 now.
 
 Rebecca (with a start). In spite of everything, then--! (Speaks with
 determination.) Very well. So be it. (ROSMER comes in from the hall. He
 sees the luggage, and turns to REBECCA.)
 
 Rosmer. What does this mean?
 
 Rebecca. I am going away.
 
 Rosmer. At once?
 
 Rebecca. Yes. (To MRS. HELSETH.) Eleven o'clock, then.
 
 Mrs. Helseth. Very well, miss. (Goes out to the right.)
 
 Rosmer (after a short pause). Where are you going, Rebecca?
 
 Rebecca. I am taking the boat for the north.
 
 Rosmer. North? What are you going there for?
 
 Rebecca. It is where I came from.
 
 Rosmer. But you have no more ties there now.
 
 Rebecca. I have none here, either.
 
 Rosmer. What do you propose to do?
 
 Rebecca. I do not know. I only want to make an end of it.
 
 Rosmer. Make an end of what?
 
 Rebecca. Rosmersholm has broken me.
 
 Rosmer (more attentively). What is that?
 
 Rebecca. Broken me utterly. I had a will of my own, and some courage,
 when I came here. Now I am crushed under the law of strangers. I do not
 think I shall have the courage to begin anything else in the world
 after this.
 
 Rosmer. Why not? What do you mean by being crushed under a law--?
 
 Rebecca. Dear friend, do not let us talk about that now--Tell me what
 passed between you and Mr. Kroll.
 
 Rosmer. We have made our peace.
 
 Rebecca. Quite so. So it came to that.
 
 Rosmer. He got together all our old circle of friends at his house.
 They convinced me that the work of ennobling men's souls was not in my
 line at all. Besides, it is such a hopeless task, any way. I shall let
 it alone.
 
 Rebecca. Well, perhaps it is better so.
 
 Rosmer. Do you say THAT now? Is that what your opinion is now?
 
 Rebecca. I have come to that opinion--in the last day or two.
 
 Rosmer. You are lying, Rebecca.
 
 Rebecca. Lying--?
 
 Rosmer. Yes, lying. You have never believed in me. You have never
 believed me to be the man to lead the cause to victory.
 
 Rebecca. I have believed that we two together would be equal to it.
 
 Rosmer. That is not true. You have believed that you could accomplish
 something big in life yourself--that you could use me to further your
 plans--that I might be useful to you in the pursuit of your object.
 That is what you have believed.
 
 Rebecca. Listen to me, John
 
 Rosmer (sitting down wearily on the couch). Oh, let me be! I see the
 whole thing clearly now. I have been like a glove in your hands.
 
 Rebecca. Listen to me, John. Let us talk this thing over. It will be
 for the last time. (Sits down in a chair by the couch.) I had intended
 to write to you about it all--when I had gone back north. But it is
 much better that you should hear it at once.
 
 Rosmer. Have you something more to tell, then?
 
 Rebecca. The most important part of it all.
 
 Rosmer. What do you mean?
 
 Rebecca. Something that you have never suspected. Something that puts
 all the rest in its true light.
 
 Rosmer (shaking his head). I do not understand, at all.
 
 Rebecca. It is quite true that at one time I did play my cards so as to
 secure admission to Rosmersholm. My idea was that I should succeed in
 doing well for myself here--either in one way or in another, you
 understand.
 
 Rosmer. Well, you succeeded in carrying your scheme through, too.
 
 Rebecca. I believe I could have carried anything through--at that time.
 For then I still had the courage of a free will. I had no one else to
 consider, nothing to turn me from my path. But then began what has
 broken down my will and filled the whole of my life with dread and
 wretchedness.
 
 Rosmer. What--began? Speak so that I can understand you.
 
 Rebecca. There came over me--a wild, uncontrollable passion--Oh, John--!
 
 Rosmer. Passion? You--! For what?
 
 Rebecca. For you.
 
 Rosmer (getting up). What does this mean!
 
 Rebecca (preventing him). Sit still, dear. I will tell you more about
 it.
 
 Rosmer. And you mean to say--that you have loved me--in that way!
 
 Rebecca. I thought I might call it loving you--then. I thought it was
 love. But it was not. It was what I have said--a wild, uncontrollable
 passion.
 
 Rosmer (speaking with difficulty). Rebecca--is it really you--you--who
 are sitting here telling me this?
 
 Rebecca. Yes, indeed it is, John.
 
 Rosmer. Then it was as the outcome of this--and under the influence of
 this--that you "acted," as you called it.
 
 Rebecca. It swept over me like a storm over the sea--like one of the
 storms we have in winter in the north. They catch you up and rush you
 along with them, you know, until their fury is expended. There is no
 withstanding them.
 
 Rosmer. So it swept poor unhappy Beata into the mill-race.
 
 Rebecca. Yes--it was like a fight for life between Beata and me at that
 time.
 
 Rosmer. You proved the strongest of us all at Rosmersholm--stronger
 than both Beata and me put together.
 
 Rebecca. I knew you well enough to know that I could not get at you in
 any way until you were set free--both in actual circumstances and in
 your soul.
 
 Rosmer. But I do not understand you, Rebecca. You--you yourself and
 your whole conduct--are an insoluble riddle to me. I am free now--both
 in my soul and my circumstances. You are absolutely in touch with the
 goal you set before yourself from the beginning. And nevertheless--
 
 Rebecca. I have never stood farther from my goal than I do now.
 
 Rosmer. And nevertheless, I say, when yesterday I asked you--urged
 you--to become my wife, you cried out that it never could be.
 
 Rebecca. I cried out in despair, John.
 
 Rosmer. Why?
 
 Rebecca. Because Rosmersholm has unnerved me. All the courage has been
 sapped out of my will here--crushed out! The time has gone for me to
 dare risk anything whatever. I have lost all power of action, John.
 
 Rosmer. Tell me how that has come about.
 
 Rebecca. It has come about through my living with you.
 
 Rosmer. But how? How?
 
 Rebecca. When I was alone with you here--and you had really found
 yourself--
 
 Rosmer. Yes, yes?
 
 Rebecca. For you never really found yourself as long as Beata was
 Alive--
 
 Rosmer. Alas, you are right in that.
 
 Rebecca. When it came about that I was living together with you here,
 in peace and solitude--when you exchanged all your thoughts with me
 unreservedly--your every mood, however tender or intimate--then the
 great change happened in me. Little by little, you understand. Almost
 imperceptibly--but overwhelmingly in the end, till it reached the
 uttermost depths of my soul.
 
 Rosmer. What does this mean, Rebecca?
 
 Rebecca. All the other feeling--all that horrible passion that had
 drowned my better self--left me entirely. All the violent emotions that
 had been roused in me were quelled and silenced. A peace stole over my
 soul--a quiet like that of one of our mountain peaks up under the
 midnight sun.
 
 Rosmer. Tell me more of it--all that you can.
 
 Rebecca. There is not much more to tell. Only that this was how love
 grew up in my heart--a great, self-denying love--content with such a
 union of hearts as there has been between us two.
 
 Rosmer. Oh, if only I had had the slightest suspicion of all this!
 
 Rebecca. It is best as it is. Yesterday, when you asked me if I would
 be your wife, I gave a cry of joy--
 
 Rosmer. Yes, it was that, Rebecca, was it not! I thought that was what
 it meant.
 
 Rebecca. For a moment, yes-I forgot myself for a moment. It was my
 dauntless will of the old days that was struggling to be free again.
 But now it has no more strength--it has lost it for ever.
 
 Rosmer. How do you explain what has taken place in you?
 
 Rebecca. It is the Rosmer attitude towards life-or your attitude
 towards life, at any rate--that has infected my will.
 
 Rosmer. Infected?
 
 Rebecca. Yes, and made it sickly--bound it captive under laws that
 formerly had no meaning for me. You--my life together with you--have
 ennobled my soul--
 
 Rosmer. Ah, if I dared believe that to be true!
 
 Rebecca. You may believe it confidently. The Rosmer attitude towards
 life ennobles. But-(shakes her head)-but-but--
 
 Rosmer. But? Well?
 
 Rebecca. But it kills joy, you know.
 
 Rosmer. Do you say that, Rebecca?
 
 Rebecca. For me, at all events.
 
 Rosmer. Yes, but are you so sure of that? If I asked you again now--?
 Implored you--?
 
 Rebecca. Oh, my dear--never go back to that again! It is impossible.
 Yes, impossible--because I must tell you this, John. I have a--past
 behind me.
 
 Rosmer. Something more than you have told me?
 
 Rebecca. Yes, something more and something different.
 
 Rosmer (with a faint smile). It is very strange, Rebecca, but--do you
 know--the idea of such a thing has occurred to me more than once.
 
 Rebecca. It has? And yet--notwithstanding that, you--?
 
 Rosmer. I never believed in it. I only played with the idea-nothing
 more.
 
 Rebecca. If you wish, I will tell you all about it at once.
 
 Rosmer (stopping her). No, no! I do not want to hear a word about it.
 Whatever it is, it shall be forgotten, as far as I am concerned.
 
 Rebecca. But I cannot forget it.
 
 Rosmer. Oh, Rebecca--!
 
 Rebecca. Yes, dear--that is just the dreadful part of it-that now, when
 all the happiness of life is freely and fully offered to me, all I can
 feel is that I am barred out from it by my past.
 
 Rosmer. Your past is dead, Rebecca. It has no longer any hold on
 you--has nothing to do with you--as you are now.
 
 Rebecca. Ah, my dear, those are mere words, you know. What about
 innocence, then? Where am I to get that from?
 
 Rosmer (gloomily). Ah, yes--innocence.
 
 Rebecca. Yes, innocence--which is at the root of all joy and happiness.
 That was the teaching, you know, that you wanted to see realised by all
 the men you were going to raise up to nobility and happiness.
 
 Rosmer. Ah, do not remind me of that. It was nothing but a half-dreamt
 dream, Rebecca--a rash suggestion that I have no longer any faith in.
 Human nature cannot be ennobled by outside influences, believe me.
 
 Rebecca (gently). Not by a tranquil love, do you think?
 
 Rosmer (thoughtfully). Yes, that would be a splendid thing--almost the
 most glorious thing in life, I think if it were so. (Moves restlessly.)
 But how am I ever to clear up the question?--how am I to get to the
 bottom of it?
 
 Rebecca. Do you not believe in me, John?
 
 Rosmer. Ah, Rebecca, how can I believe you entirely--you whose life
 here has been nothing but continual concealment and secrecy!--And now
 you have this new tale to tell. If it is cloaking some design of yours,
 tell me so--openly. Perhaps there is something or other that you hope
 to gain by that means? I will gladly do anything that I can for you.
 
 Rebecca (wringing her hands). Oh, this killing doubt! John, John--!
 
 Rosmer. Yes, I know, dear--it is horrible--but I cannot help it. I
 shall never be able to free myself from it--never be able to feel
 certain that your love for me is genuine and pure.
 
 Rebecca. But is there nothing in your own heart that bears witness to
 the transformation that has taken place in me--and taken place through
 your influence, and yours alone!
 
 Rosmer. Ah, my dear, I do not believe any longer in my power to
 transform people. I have no belief in myself left at all. I do not
 believe either in myself or in you.
 
 Rebecca (looking darkly at him). How are you going to live out your
 life, then?
 
 Rosmer. That is just what I do not know--and cannot imagine. I do not
 believe I can live it out. And, moreover, I do not know anything in the
 world that would be worth living for.
 
 Rebecca. Life carries a perpetual rebirth with it. Let us hold fast to
 it, dear. We shall be finished with it quite soon enough.
 
 Rosmer (getting up restlessly). Then give me my faith back again!--my
 faith in you, Rebecca--my faith in your love! Give me a proof of it! I
 must have some proof!
 
 Rebecca. Proof? How can I give you a proof--!
 
 Rosmer. You must! (Crosses the room.) I cannot bear this desolate,
 horrible loneliness--this-this--. (A knock is heard at the hall door.)
 
 Rebecca (getting up from her chair). Did you hear that?
 
 (The door opens, and ULRIK BRENDEL comes in. Except that he wears a
 white shirt, a black coat and, a good pair of high boots, he is dressed
 as in the first act. He looks troubled.)
 
 Rosmer. Ah, it is you, Mr. Brendel!
 
 Brendel. John, my boy, I have come to say good-bye to you!
 
 Rosmer. Where are you going, so late as this?
 
 Brendel. Downhill.
 
 Rosmer. How--?
 
 Brendel. I am on my way home, my beloved pupil. I am homesick for the
 great Nothingness.
 
 Rosmer. Something has happened to you, Mr. Brendel! What is it?
 
 Brendel. Ah, you notice the transformation, then? Well, it is evident
 enough. The last time I entered your doors I stood before you a man of
 substance, slapping a well-filled pocket.
 
 Rosmer. Really? I don't quite understand--
 
 Brendel. And now, as you see me to-night, I am a deposed monarch
 standing over the ashes of my burnt-out palace.
 
 Rosmer. If there is any way I can help you
 
 Brendel. You have preserved your childlike heart, John--can you let me
 have a loan?
 
 Rosmer. Yes, most willingly!
 
 Brendel. Can you spare me an ideal or two?
 
 Rosmer. What do you say?
 
 Brendel. One or two cast-off ideals? You will be doing a good deed. I
 am cleaned out, my dear boy, absolutely and entirely.
 
 Rebecca. Did you not succeed in giving your lecture?
 
 Brendel. No, fair lady. What do you think?--just as I was standing
 ready to pour out the contents of my horn in plenty, I made the painful
 discovery that I was bankrupt.
 
 Rebecca. But what of all your unwritten works, then?
 
 Brendel. For five and twenty years I have been like a miser sitting on
 his locked money-chest. And then to-day, when I opened it to take out
 my treasure--there was nothing there! The mills of time had ground it
 into dust. There was not a blessed thing left of the whole lot.
 
 Rosmer. But are you certain of that?
 
 Brendel. There is no room for doubt, my dear boy. The President has
 convinced me of that.
 
 Rosmer. The President?
 
 Brendel. Oh, well--His Excellency, then. Ganz nach Belieben.
 
 Rosmer. But whom do you mean?
 
 Brendel. Peter Mortensgaard, of course.
 
 Rosmer. What!
 
 Brendel (mysteriously). Hush, hush, hush! Peter Mortensgaard is Lord
 and Chieftain of the Future. I have never stood in a more august
 presence. Peter Mortensgaard has the power of omnipotence in him. He
 can do whatever he wants.
 
 Rosmer. Oh, come--don't you believe that!
 
 Brendel. It is true, my boy--because Peter Mortensgaard never wants to
 do more than he can. Peter Mortensgaard is capable of living his life
 without ideals. And that, believe me, is precisely the great secret of
 success in life. It sums up all the wisdom of the world. Basta!
 
 Rosmer (in a low voice). Now I see that you are going away from here
 poorer than you came.
 
 Brendel. Bien! Then take an example from your old tutor. Erase from
 your mind everything that he imprinted there. Do not build your castle
 upon the shifting sand. And look well ahead, and be sure of your
 ground, before you build upon the charming creature who is sweetening
 your life here.
 
 Rebecca. Do you mean me?
 
 Brendel. Yes, most attractive mermaid!
 
 Rebecca. Why am I not fit to build upon?
 
 Brendel (taking a step nearer to her). I understood that my former
 pupil had a cause which it was his life's work to lead to victory.
 
 Rebecca. And if he has--?
 
 Brendel. He is certain of victory--but, be it distinctly understood, on
 one unalterable condition.
 
 Rebecca. What is that?
 
 Brendel (taking her gently by the wrist). That the woman who loves him
 shall gladly go out into the kitchen and chop off her dainty, pink and
 white little finger--here, just at the middle joint. Furthermore, that
 the aforesaid loving woman shall--also gladly--clip off her
 incomparably moulded left ear. (Lets her go, and turns to ROSMER.)
 Good-bye, John the Victorious!
 
 Rosmer. Must you go now--in this dark night?
 
 Brendel. The dark night is best. Peace be with you! (He goes out.
 Silence in the room for a short time.)
 
 Rebecca (breathing heavily). How close and sultry it is in here! (Goes
 to the window, opens it and stands by it.)
 
 Rosmer (sitting down on a chair by the stove). There is nothing else
 for it after all, Rebecca--I can see that. You must go away.
 
 Rebecca. Yes, I do not see that I have any choice.
 
 Rosmer. Let us make use of our last hour together. Come over here and
 sit beside me.
 
 Rebecca (goes and sits down on the couch). What do you want, John?
 
 Rosmer. In the first place I want to tell you that you need have no
 anxiety about your future.
 
 Rebecca (with a smile). Hm! My future!
 
 Rosmer. I have foreseen all contingencies--long ago. Whatever may
 happen, you are provided for.
 
 Rebecca. Have you even done that for me, dear?
 
 Rosmer. You might have known that I should.
 
 Rebecca. It is many a long day since I thought about anything of the
 kind.
 
 Rosmer. Yes, of course. Naturally, you thought things could never be
 otherwise between us than as they were.
 
 Rebecca. Yes, that was what I thought.
 
 Rosmer. So did I. But if anything were to happen to me now--
 
 Rebecca. Oh, John, you will live longer than I shall.
 
 Rosmer. I can dispose of my miserable existence as I please, you know.
 
 Rebecca. What do you mean? You surely are never thinking of--!
 
 Rosmer. Do you think it would be so surprising? After the pitiful,
 lamentable defeat I have suffered? I, who was to have made it my life's
 work to lead my cause to victory--! And here I am, a deserter before
 the fight has even really begun!
 
 Rebecca. Take up the fight again, John! Only try--and you will see that
 you will conquer. You will ennoble hundreds--thousands--of souls. Only
 try!
 
 Rosmer. I, Rebecca, who no longer believe even in my having a mission
 in life?
 
 Rebecca. But your mission has stood the test. You have at all events
 ennobled one of your fellow-creatures for the rest of her life--I mean
 myself.
 
 Rosmer. Yes--if I dared believe you about that.
 
 Rebecca (wringing her hands). But, John, do you know of
 nothing--nothing--that would make you believe that?
 
 Rosmer (starts, as if with fear). Don't venture on that subject! No
 further, Rebecca! Not a single word more!
 
 Rebecca. Indeed, that is just the subject we must venture upon. Do you
 know of anything that would stifle your doubts? For I know of nothing
 in the world.
 
 Rosmer. It is best for you not to know. Best for us both.
 
 Rebecca. No, no, no--I have no patience with that sort of thing! If you
 know of anything that would acquit me in your eyes, I claim it as my
 right that you should name it.
 
 Rosmer (as if impelled against his will). Well, let us see. You say
 that you have great love in your heart; that your soul has been
 ennobled through me. Is that so? Have you counted the cost? Shall we
 try and balance our accounts? Tell me.
 
 Rebecca. I am quite ready.
 
 Rosmer. Then when shall it be?
 
 Rebecca. Whenever you like. The sooner the better.
 
 Rosmer. Then let me see, Rebecca, whether you--for my sake-this very
 night--. (Breaks off.) Oh, no, no!
 
 Rebecca. Yes, John! Yes, yes! Say it, and you shall see.
 
 Rosmer. Have you the courage--are you willing--gladly, as Ulrik Brendel
 said--for my sake, to-night--gladly--to go the same way--that Beata
 went!
 
 Rebecca (gets up slowly from the couch, and says almost inaudibly):
 John--!
 
 Rosmer. Yes, dear--that is the question I shall never be able to rid my
 thoughts of, when you have gone away. Every hour of the day I shall
 come back to it. Ah, I seem to see you bodily before me--standing out
 on the foot-bridge-right out in the middle. Now you lean out over the
 railing! You grow dizzy as you feel drawn down towards the mill-race!
 No--you recoil. You dare not do--what she dared.
 
 Rebecca. But if I had the courage?--and willingly and gladly? What then?
 
 Rosmer. Then I would believe in you. Then I should get back my faith in
 my mission in life--my faith in my power to ennoble my fellow men--my
 faith in mankind's power to be ennobled.
 
 Rebecca (takes up her shawl slowly, throws it over her head, and says,
 controlling herself): You shall have your faith back.
 
 Rosmer. Have you the courage and the strength of will for that, Rebecca?
 
 Rebecca. Of that you must judge in the morning--or later--when they
 take up my body.
 
 Rosmer (burying his head in his hands). There is a horrible temptation
 in this--!
 
 Rebecca. Because I should not like to be left lying there--any longer
 than need be. You must take care that they find me.
 
 Rosmer (springing up). But all this is madness, you know. Go away, or
 stay! I will believe you on your bare word this time too.
 
 Rebecca. Those are mere words, John. No more cowardice or evasion! How
 can you believe me on my bare word after today?
 
 Rosmer. But I do not want to see your defeat, Rebecca.
 
 Rebecca. There will be no defeat.
 
 Rosmer. There will. You will never have the heart to go Beata's way.
 
 Rebecca. Do you believe that?
 
 Rosmer. Never. You are not like Beata. You are not under the influence
 of a distorted view of life.
 
 Rebecca. But I am under the influence of the Rosmersholm view of
 Life--now. Whatever my offences are--it is right that I should expiate
 them.
 
 Rosmer (looking at her fixedly). Have you come to that decision?
 
 Rebecca. Yes.
 
 Rosmer. Very well. Then I too am under the influence of our unfettered
 view of life, Rebecca. There is no one that can judge us. And therefore
 we must be our own judges.
 
 Rebecca (misunderstanding his meaning). That too. That too. My leaving
 you will save the best that is in you.
 
 Rosmer. Ah, there is nothing left to save in me.
 
 Rebecca. There is. But I--after this I should only be like some
 sea-sprite hanging on to the barque you are striving to sail forward
 in, and, hampering its progress. I must go overboard. Do you think I
 could go through the world bearing the burden of a spoiled
 life--brooding for ever over the happiness which I have forfeited by my
 past? I must throw up the game, John.
 
 Rosmer. If you go--then I go with you.
 
 Rebecca (looks at him with an almost imperceptible smile, and says more
 gently): Yes, come with me, dear--and be witness--
 
 Rosmer. I go with you, I said.
 
 Rebecca. As far as the bridge--yes. You never dare go out on to it, you
 know.
 
 Rosmer. Have you noticed that?
 
 Rebecca (in sad and broken tones). Yes. That was what made my love
 hopeless.
 
 Rosmer. Rebecca--now I lay my hand on your head. (Does as he says.) And
 I take you for my true and lawful wife.
 
 Rebecca (taking both his hands in hers, and bowing her head on to his
 breast). Thank you, John. (Lets him go.) And now I am going--gladly.
 
 Rosmer. Man and wife should go together.
 
 Rebecca. Only as far as the bridge, John.
 
 Rosmer. And out on to it, too. As far as you go--so far I go with you.
 I dare do it now.
 
 Rebecca. Are you absolutely certain that way is the best for you?
 
 Rosmer. I know it is the only way.
 
 Rebecca. But suppose you are only deceiving yourself? Suppose it were
 only a delusion--one of these White Horses of Rosmersholm?
 
 Rosmer. It may be so. We can never escape from them--we of my race.
 
 Rebecca. Then stay, John!
 
 Rosmer. The man shall cleave to his wife, as the wife to her husband.
 
 Rebecca. Yes, but first tell me this--is it you that go with me, or I
 that go with you?
 
 Rosmer. We shall never get to the bottom of that.
 
 Rebecca. Yet I should dearly like to know.
 
 Rosmer. We two go with each other, Rebecca. I with you, and you with me.
 
 Rebecca. I almost believe that is true.
 
 Rosmer. For now we two are one.
 
 Rebecca. Yes. We are one now. Come! We can go gladly now. (They go out,
 hand in hand, through the hall, and are seen to turn to the left. The
 door stands open after them. The room is empty for a little while. Then
 MRS. HELSETH opens the door on the right.)
 
 Mrs. Helseth. The carriage, miss, is--. (Looks round the room.) Not
 here? Out together at this time of night? Well, well--I must say--! Hm!
 (Goes out into the hall, looks round and comes in again.) Not sitting
 on the bench--ah, well! (Goes to the window and looks out.) Good
 heavens! What is that white thing--! As I am a living soul, they are
 both out on the foot-bridge! God forgive the sinful creatures--if they
 are not in each other's arms! (Gives a wild scream.) Ah!--they are
 over--both of them! Over into the mill-race! Help! help! (Her knees
 tremble, she holds on shakily to the back of a chair and can scarcely
 get her words out.) No. No help here. The dead woman has taken them.

 ACT I.
 
 
 (SCENE.--A spacious garden-room in the BERNICKS' house. In the
 foreground on the left is a door leading to BERNICK'S business room;
 farther back in the same wall, a similar door. In the middle of the
 opposite wall is a large entrance-door, which leads to the street. The
 wall in the background is almost wholly composed of plate-glass; a door
 in it opens upon a broad flight of steps which lead down to the garden;
 a sun-awning is stretched over the steps. Below the steps a part of the
 garden is visible, bordered by a fence with a small gate in it. On the
 other side of the fence runs a street, the opposite side of which is
 occupied by small wooden houses painted in bright colours. It is
 summer, and the sun is shining warmly. People are seen, every now and
 then, passing along the street and stopping to talk to one another;
 others going in and out of a shop at the corner, etc.
 
 In the room a gathering of ladies is seated round a table. MRS. BERNICK
 is presiding; on her left side are MRS. HOLT and her daughter NETTA,
 and next to them MRS. RUMMEL and HILDA RUMMEL. On MRS. BERNICK'S right
 are MRS. LYNGE, MARTHA BERNICK and DINA DORF. All the ladies are busy
 working. On the table lie great piles of linen garments and other
 articles of clothing, some half finished, and some merely cut out.
 Farther back, at a small table on which two pots of flowers and a glass
 of sugared water are standing, RORLUND is sitting, reading aloud from a
 book with gilt edges, but only loud enough for the spectators to catch
 a word now and then. Out in the garden OLAF BERNICK is running about
 and shooting at a target with a toy crossbow.
 
 After a moment AUNE comes in quietly through the door on the right.
 There is a slight interruption in the reading. MRS. BERNICK nods to him
 and points to the door on the left. AUNE goes quietly across, knocks
 softly at the door of BERNICK'S room, and after a moment's pause,
 knocks again. KRAP comes out of the room, with his hat in his hand and
 some papers under his arm.)
 
 Krap: Oh, it was you knocking?
 
 Aune: Mr. Bernick sent for me.
 
 Krap: He did--but he cannot see you. He has deputed me to tell you--
 
 Aune: Deputed you? All the same, I would much rather--
 
 Krap: --deputed me to tell you what he wanted to say to you. You must
 give up these Saturday lectures of yours to the men.
 
 Aune: Indeed? I supposed I might use my own time--
 
 Krap: You must not use your own time in making the men useless in
 working hours. Last Saturday you were talking to them of the harm that
 would be done to the workmen by our new machines and the new working
 methods at the yard. What makes you do that?
 
 Aune: I do it for the good of the community.
 
 Krap: That's curious, because Mr. Bernick says it is disorganising the
 community.
 
 Aune: My community is not Mr. Bernick's, Mr. Krap! As President of the
 Industrial Association, I must--
 
 Krap: You are, first and foremost, President of Mr. Bernick's
 shipbuilding yard; and, before everything else, you have to do your
 duty to the community known as the firm of Bernick & Co.; that is what
 every one of us lives for. Well, now you know what Mr. Bernick had to
 say to you.
 
 Aune: Mr. Bernick would not have put it that way, Mr. Krap! But I know
 well enough whom I have to thank for this. It is that damned American
 boat. Those fellows expect to get work done here the way they are
 accustomed to it over there, and that--
 
 Krap: Yes, yes, but I can't go into all these details. You know now
 what Mr. Bernick means, and that is sufficient. Be so good as to go
 back to the yard; probably you are needed there. I shall be down myself
 in a little while. --Excuse me, ladies! (Bows to the ladies and goes
 out through the garden and down the street. AUNE goes quietly out to
 the right. RORLUND, who has continued his reading during the foregoing
 conversation, which has been carried on in low tones, has now come to
 the end of the book, and shuts it with a bang.)
 
 Rorlund: There, my dear ladies, that is the end of it.
 
 Mrs. Rummel: What an instructive tale!
 
 Mrs. Holt: And such a good moral!
 
 Mrs. Bernick: A book like that really gives one something to think
 about.
 
 Rorlund: Quite so; it presents a salutary contrast to what,
 unfortunately, meets our eyes every day in the newspapers and
 magazines. Look at the gilded and painted exterior displayed by any
 large community, and think what it really conceals!--emptiness and
 rottenness, if I may say so; no foundation of morality beneath it. In a
 word, these large communities of ours now-a-days are whited sepulchres.
 
 Mrs. Holt: How true! How true!
 
 Mrs. Rummel: And for an example of it, we need look no farther than at
 the crew of the American ship that is lying here just now.
 
 Rorlund: Oh, I would rather not speak of such offscourings of humanity
 as that. But even in higher circles--what is the case there? A spirit
 of doubt and unrest on all sides; minds never at peace, and instability
 characterising all their behaviour. Look how completely family life is
 undermined over there! Look at their shameless love of casting doubt on
 even the most serious truths!
 
 Dina (without looking up from her work): But are there not many big
 things done there too?
 
 Rorlund: Big things done--? I do not understand--.
 
 Mrs. Holt (in amazement): Good gracious, Dina--!
 
 Mrs. Rummel (in the same breath): Dina, how can you--?
 
 Rorlund: I think it would scarcely be a good thing for us if such "big
 things" became the rule here. No, indeed, we ought to be only too
 thankful that things are as they are in this country. It is true enough
 that tares grow up amongst our wheat here too, alas; but we do our best
 conscientiously to weed them out as well as we are able. The important
 thing is to keep society pure, ladies--to ward off all the hazardous
 experiments that a restless age seeks to force upon us.
 
 Mrs. Holt: And there are more than enough of them in the wind,
 unhappily.
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Yes, you know last year we only by a hair's breadth
 escaped the project of having a railway here.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Ah, my husband prevented that.
 
 Rorlund: Providence, Mrs. Bernick. You may be certain that your husband
 was the instrument of a higher Power when he refused to have anything
 to do with the scheme.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: And yet they said such horrible things about him in the
 newspapers! But we have quite forgotten to thank you, Mr. Rorlund. It
 is really more than friendly of you to sacrifice so much of your time
 to us.
 
 Rorlund: Not at all. This is holiday time, and--
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Yes, but it is a sacrifice all the same, Mr. Rorlund.
 
 Rorlund (drawing his chair nearer): Don't speak of it, my dear lady.
 Are you not all of you making some sacrifice in a good cause?--and that
 willingly and gladly? These poor fallen creatures for whose rescue we
 are working may be compared to soldiers wounded on the field of battle;
 you, ladies, are the kind-hearted sisters of mercy who prepare the lint
 for these stricken ones, lay the bandages softly on their wounds, heal
 them and cure them.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: It must be a wonderful gift to be able to see everything
 in such a beautiful light.
 
 Rorlund: A good deal of it is inborn in one--but it can be to a great
 extent acquired, too. All that is needful is to see things in the light
 of a serious mission in life. (To MARTHA:) What do you say, Miss
 Bernick? Have you not felt as if you were standing on firmer ground
 since you gave yourself up to your school work?
 
 Martha: I really do not know what to say. There are times, when I am in
 the schoolroom down there, that I wish I were far away out on the
 stormy seas.
 
 Rorlund: That is merely temptation, dear Miss Bernick. You ought to
 shut the doors of your mind upon such disturbing guests as that. By the
 "stormy seas"--for of course you do not intend me to take your words
 literally--you mean the restless tide of the great outer world, where
 so many are shipwrecked. Do you really set such store on the life you
 hear rushing by outside? Only look out into the street. There they go,
 walking about in the heat of the sun, perspiring and tumbling about
 over their little affairs. No, we undoubtedly have the best of it, who
 are able to sit here in the cool and turn our backs on the quarter from
 which disturbance comes.
 
 Martha: Yes, I have no doubt you are perfectly right.
 
 Rorlund: And in a house like this, in a good and pure home, where
 family life shows in its fairest colours--where peace and harmony
 rule-- (To MRS. BERNICK:) What are you listening to, Mrs. Bernick?
 
 Mrs. Bernick (who has turned towards the door of BERNICK'S room): They
 are talking very loud in there.
 
 Rorlund: Is there anything particular going on?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: I don't know. I can hear that there is somebody with my
 husband.
 
 (HILMAR TONNESEN, smoking a cigar, appears in the doorway on the right,
 but stops short at the sight of the company of ladies.)
 
 Hilmar: Oh, excuse me-- (Turns to go back.)
 
 Mrs. Bernick: No, Hilmar, come along in; you are not disturbing us. Do
 you want something?
 
 Hilmar: No, I only wanted to look in here--Good morning, ladies. (To
 MRS. BERNICK:) Well, what is the result?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Of what?
 
 Hilmar: Karsten has summoned a meeting, you know.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Has he? What about?
 
 Hilmar:  Oh, it is this railway nonsense over again.
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Is it possible?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Poor Karsten, is he to have more annoyance over that?
 
 Rorlund:  But how do you explain that, Mr. Tonnesen? You know that last
 year Mr. Bernick made it perfectly clear that he would not have a
 railway here.
 
 Hilmar: Yes, that is what I thought, too; but I met Krap, his
 confidential clerk, and he told me that the railway project had been
 taken up again, and that Mr. Bernick was in consultation with three of
 our local capitalists.
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Ah, I was right in thinking I heard my husband's voice.
 
 Hilmar:  Of course Mr. Rummel is in it, and so are Sandstad and Michael
 Vigeland, "Saint Michael", as they call him.
 
 Rorlund:  Ahem!
 
 Hilmar: I beg your pardon, Mr. Rorlund?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Just when everything was so nice and peaceful.
 
 Hilmar: Well, as far as I am concerned, I have not the slightest
 objection to their beginning their squabbling again. It will be a
 little diversion, any way.
 
 Rorlund: I think we can dispense with that sort of diversion.
 
 Hilmar: It depends how you are constituted. Certain natures feel the
 lust of battle now and then. But unfortunately life in a country town
 does not offer much in that way, and it isn't given to every one to
 (turns the leaves of the book RORLUND has been reading). "Woman as the
 Handmaid of Society." What sort of drivel is this?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: My dear Hilmar, you must not say that. You certainly have
 not read the book.
 
 Hilmar: No, and I have no intention of reading it, either.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Surely you are not feeling quite well today.
 
 Hilmar: No, I am not.
 
 Mrs. Bernick:  Perhaps you did not sleep well last night?
 
 Hilmar: No, I slept very badly. I went for a walk yesterday evening for
 my health's sake; and I finished up at the club and read a book about a
 Polar expedition. There is something bracing in following the
 adventures of men who are battling with the elements.
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  But it does not appear to have done you much good, Mr.
 Tonnesen.
 
 Hilmar:  No, it certainly did not. I lay all night tossing about, only
 half asleep, and dreamt that I was being chased by a hideous walrus.
 
 Olaf (who meanwhile has come up the steps from the garden): Have you
 been chased by a walrus, uncle?
 
 Hilmar: I dreamt it, you duffer! Do you mean to say you are still
 playing about with that ridiculous bow? Why don't you get hold of a
 real gun?
 
 Olaf: I should like to, but--
 
 Hilmar:  There is some sense in a thing like that; it is always an
 excitement every time you fire it off.
 
 Olaf: And then I could shoot bears, uncle. But daddy won't let me.
 
 Mrs. Bernick:  You really mustn't put such ideas into his head, Hilmar.
 
 Hilmar:  Hm! It's a nice breed we are educating up now-a-days, isn't
 it! We talk a great deal about manly sports, goodness knows--but we
 only play with the question, all the same; there is never any serious
 inclination for the bracing discipline that lies in facing danger
 manfully. Don't stand pointing your crossbow at me, blockhead--it might
 go off!
 
 Olaf:  No, uncle, there is no arrow in it.
 
 Hilmar:  You don't know that there isn't--there may be, all the same.
 Take it away, I tell you!--Why on earth have you never gone over to
 America on one of your father's ships? You might have seen a buffalo
 hunt then, or a fight with Red Indians.
 
 Mrs. Bernick:  Oh, Hilmar--!
 
 Olaf: I should like that awfully, uncle; and then perhaps I might meet
 Uncle Johan and Aunt Lona.
 
 Hilmar: Hm!--Rubbish.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: You can go down into the garden again now, Olaf.
 
 Olaf: Mother, may I go out into the street too?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Yes, but not too far, mind.
 
 (OLAF runs down into the garden and out through the gate in the fence.)
 
 Rorlund: You ought not to put such fancies into the child's head, Mr.
 Tonnesen.
 
 Hilmar:  No, of course he is destined to be a miserable stay-at-home,
 like so many others.
 
 Rorlund:  But why do you not take a trip over there yourself?
 
 Hilmar: I? With my wretched health? Of course I get no consideration on
 that account. But putting that out of the question, you forget that one
 has certain obligations to perform towards the community of which one
 forms a part. There must be some one here to hold aloft the banner of
 the Ideal.--Ugh, there he is shouting again!
 
 The Ladies: Who is shouting?
 
 Hilmar: I am sure I don't know. They are raising their voices so loud
 in there that it gets on my nerves.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: I expect it is my husband, Mr. Tonnesen. But you must
 remember he is so accustomed to addressing large audiences.
 
 Rorlund: I should not call the others low-voiced, either.
 
 Hilmar:  Good Lord, no!--not on any question that touches their
 pockets. Everything here ends in these petty material considerations.
 Ugh!
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Anyway, that is a better state of things than it used to
 be when everything ended in mere frivolity.
 
 Mrs. Lynge: Things really used to be as bad as that here?
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Indeed they were, Mrs. Lynge. You may think yourself lucky
 that you did not live here then.
 
 Mrs. Holt:  Yes, times have changed, and no mistake, when I look back
 to the days when I was a girl.
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Oh, you need not look back more than fourteen or fifteen
 years. God forgive us, what a life we led! There used to be a Dancing
 Society and a Musical Society--
 
 Mrs. Bernick:  And the Dramatic Club. I remember it very well.
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Yes, that was where your play was performed, Mr. Tonnesen.
 
 Hilmar (from the back of the room): What, what?
 
 Rorlund: A play by Mr. Tonnesen?
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Yes, it was long before you came here, Mr. Rorlund. And it
 was only performed once.
 
 Mrs. Lynge: Was that not the play in which you told me you took the
 part of a young man's sweetheart, Mrs. Rummel?
 
 Mrs. Rummel (glancing towards RORLUND): I? I really cannot remember,
 Mrs. Lynge. But I remember well all the riotous gaiety that used to go
 on.
 
 Mrs. Holt: Yes, there were houses I could name in which two large
 dinner-parties were given in one week.
 
 Mrs. Lynge: And surely I have heard that a touring theatrical company
 came here, too?
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Yes, that was the worst thing of the lot.
 
 Mrs. Holt (uneasily):  Ahem!
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Did you say a theatrical company? No, I don't remember
 that at all.
 
 Mrs. Lynge: Oh yes, and I have been told they played all sorts of mad
 pranks. What is really the truth of those stories?
 
 Mrs. Rummel: There is practically no truth in them, Mrs. Lynge.
 
 Mrs. Holt: Dina, my love, will you give me that linen?
 
 Mrs. Bernick (at the same time): Dina, dear, will you go and ask
 Katrine to bring us our coffee?
 
 Martha: I will go with you, Dina. (DINA and MARTHA go out by the
 farther door on, the left.)
 
 Mrs. Bernick (getting up): Will you excuse me for a few minutes? I
 think we will have our coffee outside. (She goes out to the verandah
 and sets to work to lay a table. RORLUND stands in the doorway talking
 to her. HILMAR sits outside, smoking.)
 
 Mrs. Rummel (in a low voice): My goodness, Mrs. Lynge, how you
 frightened me!
 
 Mrs. Lynge: I?
 
 Mrs. Holt: Yes, but you know it was you that began it, Mrs. Rummel.
 
 Mrs. Rummel: I? How can you say such a thing, Mrs. Holt? Not a syllable
 passed my lips!
 
 Mrs. Lynge: But what does it all mean?
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  What made you begin to talk about--? Think--did you not
 see that Dina was in the room?
 
 Mrs. Lynge:  Dina? Good gracious, is there anything wrong with--?
 
 Mrs. Holt: And in this house, too! Did you not know it was Mrs.
 Bernick's brother--?
 
 Mrs. Lynge: What about him? I know nothing about it at all; I am quite
 new to the place, you know.
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Have you not heard that--? Ahem! (To her daughter) Hilda,
 dear, you can go for a little stroll in the garden?
 
 Mrs. Holt: You go too, Netta. And be very kind to poor Dina when she
 comes back. (HILDA and NETTA go out into the garden.)
 
 Mrs. Lynge: Well, what about Mrs. Bernick's brother?
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Don't you know the dreadful scandal about him?
 
 Mrs. Lynge: A dreadful scandal about Mr. Tonnesen?
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Good Heavens, no. Mr. Tonnesen is her cousin, of course,
 Mrs. Lynge. I am speaking of her brother--
 
 Mrs. Holt: The wicked Mr. Tonnesen--
 
 Mrs. Rummel: His name was Johan. He ran away to America.
 
 Mrs. Holt: Had to run away, you must understand.
 
 Mrs. Lynge: Then it is he the scandal is about?
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Yes; there was something--how shall I put it?--there was
 something of some kind between him and Dina's mother. I remember it all
 as if it were yesterday. Johan Tonnesen was in old Mrs. Bernick's
 office then; Karsten Bernick had just come back from Paris--he had not
 yet become engaged--
 
 Mrs. Lynge:  Yes, but what was the scandal?
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Well, you must know that Moller's company were acting in
 the town that winter--
 
 Mrs. Holt: And Dorf, the actor, and his wife were in the company. All
 the young men in the town were infatuated with her.
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Yes, goodness knows how they could think her pretty. Well,
 Dorf came home late one evening--
 
 Mrs. Holt: Quite unexpectedly.
 
 Mrs. Rummel: And found his-- No, really it isn't a thing one can talk
 about.
 
 Mrs. Holt: After all, Mrs. Rummel, he didn't find anything, because the
 door was locked on the inside.
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Yes, that is just what I was going to say--he found the
 door locked. And--just think of it--the man that was in the house had
 to jump out of the window.
 
 Mrs. Holt: Right down from an attic window.
 
 Mrs. Lynge: And that was Mrs. Bernick's brother?
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Yes, it was he.
 
 Mrs. Lynge: And that was why he ran away to America?
 
 Mrs. Holt: Yes, he had to run away, you may be sure.
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Because something was discovered afterwards that was
 nearly as bad; just think--he had been making free with the cash-box...
 
 Mrs. Holt:  But, you know, no one was certain of that, Mrs. Rummel;
 perhaps there was no truth in the rumour.
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Well, I must say--! Wasn't it known all over the town? Did
 not old Mrs. Bernick nearly go bankrupt as the result of it?  However,
 God forbid I should be the one to spread such reports.
 
 Mrs. Holt:  Well, anyway, Mrs. Dorf didn't get the money, because she--
 
 Mrs. Lynge:  Yes, what happened to Dina's parents afterwards?
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  Well, Dorf deserted both his wife and his child. But
 madam was impudent enough to stay here a whole year. Of course she had
 not the face to appear at the theatre any more, but she kept herself by
 taking in washing and sewing--
 
 Mrs. Holt: And then she tried to set up a dancing school.
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Naturally that was no good. What parents would trust their
 children to such a woman? But it did not last very long. The fine madam
 was not accustomed to work; she got something wrong with her lungs and
 died of it.
 
 Mrs. Lynge: What a horrible scandal!
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  Yes, you can imagine how hard it was upon the Bernicks.
 It is the dark spot among the sunshine of their good fortune, as Rummel
 once put it. So never speak about it in this house, Mrs. Lynge.
 
 Mrs. Holt:  And for heaven's sake never mention the stepsister, either!
 
 Mrs. Lynge:  Oh, so Mrs. Bernick has a step-sister, too?
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  Had, luckily-- for the relationship between them is all
 over now. She was an extraordinary person too! Would you believe it,
 she cut her hair short, and used to go about in men's boots in bad
 weather!
 
 Mrs. Holt:  And when her step-brother, the black sheep, had gone away,
 and the whole town naturally was talking about him--what do you think
 she did? She went out to America to him!
 
 Mr. Rummel:  Yes, but remember the scandal she caused before she went,
 Mrs. Holt.
 
 Mrs. Holt:  Hush, don't speak of it.
 
 Mrs. Lynge: My goodness, did she create a scandal too?
 
 Mrs. Rummel: I think you ought to hear it, Mrs. Lynge. Mr. Bernick had
 just got engaged to Betty Tonnesen, and the two of them went arm in arm
 into her aunt's room to tell her the news--
 
 Mrs. Holt: The Tonnesens' parents were dead, you know--
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  When, suddenly, up got Lona Hessel from her chair and
 gave our refined and well-bred Karsten Bernick such a box on the ear
 that his head swam.
 
 Mrs. Lynge:  Well, I am sure I never--
 
 Mrs. Holt: It is absolutely true.
 
 Mrs. Rummel: And then she packed her box and went away to America.
 
 Mrs. Lynge: I suppose she had had her eye on him for herself.
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  Of course she had. She imagined that he and she would
 make a match of it when he came back from Paris.
 
 Mrs. Holt:  The idea of her thinking such a thing!  Karsten Bernick--a
 man of the world and the pink of courtesy, a perfect gentleman, the
 darling of all the ladies...
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  And, with it all, such an excellent young man, Mrs.
 Holt--so moral.
 
 Mrs. Lynge:  But what has this Miss Hessel made of herself in America?
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  Well, you see, over that (as my husband once put it) has
 been drawn a veil which one should hesitate to lift.
 
 Mrs. Lynge:  What do you mean?
 
 Mrs. Rummel: She no longer has any connection with the family, as you
 may suppose; but this much the whole town knows, that she has sung for
 money in drinking saloons over there--
 
 Mrs. Holt:  And has given lectures in public--
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  And has published some mad kind of book.
 
 Mrs. Lynge:  You don't say so!
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  Yes, it is true enough that Lona Hessel is one of the
 spots on the sun of the Bernick family's good fortune. Well, now you
 know the whole story, Mrs. Lynge. I am sure I would never have spoken
 about it except to put you on your guard.
 
 Mrs. Lynge:  Oh, you may be sure I shall be most careful. But that poor
 child Dina Dorf! I am truly sorry for her.
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  Well, really it was a stroke of good luck for her. Think
 what it would have meant if she had been brought up by such parents! Of
 course we did our best for her, every one of us, and gave her all the
 good advice we could. Eventually Miss Bernick got her taken into this
 house.
 
 Mrs. Holt:  But she has always been a difficult child to deal with. It
 is only natural--with all the bad examples she had had before her. A
 girl of that sort is not like one of our own; one must be lenient with
 her.
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  Hush--here she comes. (In a louder voice.) Yes, Dina is
 really a clever girl. Oh, is that you, Dina? We are just putting away
 the things.
 
 Mrs. Holt:  How delicious your coffee smells, my dear Dina. A nice cup
 of coffee like that--
 
 Mrs. Bernick (calling in from the verandah):  Will you come out here?
 (Meanwhile MARTHA and DINA have helped the Maid to bring out the
 coffee. All the ladies seat themselves on the verandah, and talk with a
 great show of kindness to DINA. In a few moments DINA comes back into
 the room and looks for her sewing.)
 
 Mrs. Bernick (from the coffee table): Dina, won't you--?
 
 Dina:  No, thank you. (Sits down to her sewing. MRS. BERNICK and
 RORLUND exchange a few words; a moment afterwards he comes back into
 the room, makes a pretext for going up to the table, and begins
 speaking to DINA in low tones.)
 
 Rorlund: Dina.
 
 Dina:  Yes?
 
 Rorlund:  Why don't you want to sit with the others?
 
 Dina:  When I came in with the coffee, I could see from the strange
 lady's face that they had been talking about me.
 
 Rorlund:  But did you not see as well how agreeable she was to you out
 there?
 
 Dina:  That is just what I will not stand
 
 Rorlund:  You are very self-willed, Dina.
 
 Dina:  Yes.
 
 Rorlund:  But why?
 
 Dina:  Because it is my nature.
 
 Rorlund:  Could you not try to alter your nature?
 
 Dina:  No.
 
 Rorlund:  Why not?
 
 Dina (looking at him): Because I am one of the "poor fallen creatures",
 you know.
 
 Rorlund:  For shame, Dina.
 
 Dina:  So was my mother.
 
 Rorlund:  Who has spoken to you about such things?
 
 Dina:  No one; they never do. Why don't they? They all handle me in
 such a gingerly fashion, as if they thought I should go to pieces if
 they---. Oh, how I hate all this kind-heartedness.
 
 Rorlund:  My dear Dina, I can quite understand that you feel repressed
 here, but--
 
 Dina:  Yes; if only I could get right away from here. I could make my
 own way quite well, if only I did not live amongst people who are
 so--so--
 
 Rorlund:  So what?
 
 Dina:  So proper and so moral.
 
 Rorlund:  Oh but, Dina, you don't mean that.
 
 Dina:  You know quite well in what sense I mean it. Hilda and Netta
 come here every day, to be exhibited to me as good examples. I can
 never be so beautifully behaved as they; I don't want to be. If only I
 were right away from it all, I should grow to be worth something.
 
 Rorlund:  But you are worth a great deal, Dina dear.
 
 Dina:  What good does that do me here?
 
 Rorlund:  Get right away, you say? Do you mean it seriously?
 
 Dina:  I would not stay here a day longer, if it were not for you.
 
 Rorlund: Tell me, Dina--why is it that you are fond of being with me?
 
 Dina:  Because you teach me so much that is beautiful.
 
 Rorlund:  Beautiful? Do you call the little I can teach you, beautiful?
 
 Dina: Yes. Or perhaps, to be accurate, it is not that you teach me
 anything; but when I listen to you talking I see beautiful visions.
 
 Rorlund: What do you mean exactly when you call a thing beautiful?
 
 Dina: I have never thought it out.
 
 Rorlund: Think it out now, then. What do you understand by a beautiful
 thing?
 
 Dina: A beautiful thing is something that is great--and far off.
 
 Rorlund: Hm!--Dina, I am so deeply concerned about you, my dear.
 
 Dina: Only that?
 
 Rorlund: You know perfectly well that you are dearer to me than I can
 say.
 
 Dina: If I were Hilda or Netta, you would not be afraid to let people
 see it.
 
 Rorlund: Ah, Dina, you can have no idea of the number of things I am
 forced to take into consideration. When it is a man's lot to be a moral
 pillar of the community he lives in, he cannot be too circumspect. If
 only I could be certain that people would interpret my motives
 properly. But no matter for that; you must, and shall be, helped to
 raise yourself. Dina, is it a bargain between us that when I come--when
 circumstances allow me to come--to you and say: "Here is my hand," you
 will take it and be my wife? Will you promise me that, Dina?
 
 Dina: Yes.
 
 Rorlund: Thank you, thank you! Because for my part, too--oh, Dina, I
 love you so dearly. Hush! Some one is coming. Dina--for my sake--go out
 to the others.(She goes out to the coffee table. At the same moment
 RUMMEL, SANDSTAD and VIGELAND come out of BERNICK'S room, followed by
 Bernick, who has a bundle of papers in his hand.)
 
 Bernick: Well, then, the matter is settled.
 
 Vigeland: Yes, I hope to goodness it is.
 
 Rummel: It is settled, Bernick. A Norseman's word stands as firm as the
 rocks on Dovrefjeld, you know!
 
 Bernick: And no one must falter, no one give way, no matter what
 opposition we meet with.
 
 Rummel: We will stand or fall together, Bernick.
 
 Hilmar (coming in from the verandah): Fall? If I may ask, isn't it the
 railway scheme that is going to fall?
 
 Bernick: No, on the contrary, it is going to proceed--
 
 Rummel: Full steam, Mr. Tonnesen.
 
 Hilmar (coming nearer): Really?
 
 Rorlund: How is that?
 
 Mrs. Bernick (at the verandah door): Karsten, dear, what is it that--?
 
 Bernick:  My dear Betty, how can it interest you? (To the three men.)
 We must get out lists of subscribers, and the sooner the better.
 Obviously our four names must head the list. The positions we occupy in
 the community makes it our duty to make ourselves as prominent as
 possible in the affair.
 
 Sandstad: Obviously, Mr. Bernick.
 
 Rummel: The thing shall go through, Bernick; I swear it shall!
 
 Bernick: Oh, I have not the least anticipation of failure. We must see
 that we work, each one among the circle of his own acquaintances; and
 if we can point to the fact that the scheme is exciting a lively
 interest in all ranks of society, then it stands to reason that our
 Municipal Corporation will have to contribute its share.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Karsten, you really must come out here and tell us--
 
 Bernick: My dear Betty, it is an affair that does not concern ladies at
 all.
 
 Hilmar: Then you are really going to support this railway scheme after
 all?
 
 Bernick: Yes, naturally.
 
 Rorlund: But last year, Mr. Bernick--
 
 Bernick: Last year it was quite another thing. At that time it was a
 question of a line along the coast--
 
 Vigeland:  Which would have been quite superfluous, Mr. Rorlund;
 because, of course, we have our steamboat service--
 
 Sandstad:  And would have been quite unreasonably costly--
 
 Rummel:  Yes, and would have absolutely ruined certain important
 interests in the town.
 
 Bernick: The main point was that it would not have been to the
 advantage of the community as a whole. That is why I opposed it, with
 the result that the inland line was resolved upon.
 
 Hilmar:  Yes, but surely that will not touch the towns about here.
 
 Bernick: It will eventually touch our town, my dear Hilmar, because we
 are going to build a branch line here.
 
 Hilmar: Aha--a new scheme, then?
 
 Rummel: Yes, isn't it a capital scheme? What?
 
 Rorlund: Hm!--
 
 Vigeland: There is no denying that it looks as though Providence had
 just planned the configuration of the country to suit a branch line.
 
 Rorlund: Do you really mean it, Mr. Vigeland?
 
 Bernick: Yes, I must confess it seems to me as if it had been the hand
 of Providence that caused me to take a journey on business this spring,
 in the course of which I happened to traverse a valley through which I
 had never been before. It came across my mind like a flash of lightning
 that this was where we could carry a branch line down to our town. I
 got an engineer to survey the neighbourhood, and have here the
 provisional calculations and estimate; so there is nothing to hinder us.
 
 Mrs. Bernick (who is still with the other ladies at the verandah door):
 But, my dear Karsten, to think that you should have kept it all a
 secret from us!
 
 Bernick: Ah, my dear Betty, I knew you would not have been able to
 grasp the exact situation. Besides, I have not mentioned it to a living
 soul until today. But now the decisive moment has come, and we must
 work openly and with all our might. Yes, even if I have to risk all I
 have for its sake, I mean to push the matter through.
 
 Rummel: And we will back you up, Bernick; you may rely upon that.
 
 Rorlund: Do you really promise us so much, then, from this undertaking,
 gentlemen?
 
 Bernick: Yes, undoubtedly. Think what a lever it will be to raise the
 status of our whole community. Just think of the immense tracts of
 forest-land that it will make accessible; think of all the rich
 deposits of minerals we shall be able to work; think of the river with
 one waterfall above another! Think of the possibilities that open out
 in the way of manufactories!
 
 Rorlund: And are you not afraid that an easier intercourse with the
 depravity of the outer world--?
 
 Bernick: No, you may make your mind quite easy on that score, Mr.
 Rorlund. Our little hive of industry rests now-a-days, God be thanked,
 on such a sound moral basis; we have all of us helped to drain it, if I
 may use the expression; and that we will continue to do, each in his
 degree. You, Mr. Rorlund, will continue your richly blessed activity in
 our schools and our homes. We, the practical men of business, will be
 the support of the community by extending its welfare within as wide a
 radius as possible; and our women--yes, come nearer ladies--you will
 like to hear it--our women, I say, our wives and daughters--you,
 ladies--will work on undisturbed in the service of charity, and
 moreover will be a help and a comfort to your nearest and dearest, as
 my dear Betty and Martha are to me and Olaf.(Looks around him.) Where
 is Olaf today?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Oh, in the holidays it is impossible to keep him at home.
 
 Bernick: I have no doubt he is down at the shore again. You will see he
 will end by coming to some harm there.
 
 Hilmar: Bah! A little sport with the forces of nature
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  Your family affection is beautiful, Mr. Bernick!
 
 Bernick: Well, the family is the kernel of society. A good home,
 honoured and trusty friends, a little snug family circle where no
 disturbing elements can cast their shadow-- (KRAP comes in from the
 right, bringing letters and papers.)
 
 Krap: The foreign mail, Mr. Bernick--and a telegram from New York.
 
 Bernick (taking the telegram): Ah--from the owners of the "Indian Girl".
 
 Rummel: Is the mail in? Oh, then you must excuse me.
 
 Vigeland:  And me too.
 
 Sandstad: Good day, Mr. Bernick.
 
 Bernick: Good day, good day, gentlemen. And remember, we have a meeting
 this afternoon at five o'clock.
 
 The Three Men: Yes--quite so--of course. (They go out to the right.)
 
 Bernick (who has read the telegram): This is thoroughly American!
 Absolutely shocking!
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Good gracious, Karsten, what is it?
 
 Bernick: Look at this, Krap! Read it!
 
 Krap (reading):  "Do the least repairs possible. Send over 'Indian
 Girl' as soon as she is ready to sail; good time of year; at a pinch
 her cargo will keep her afloat." Well, I must say--
 
 Rorlund: You see the state of things in these vaunted great communities!
 
 Bernick: You are quite right; not a moment's consideration for human
 life, when it is a question of making a profit. (To KRAP:) Can the
 "Indian Girl" go to sea in four--or five--days?
 
 Krap: Yes, if Mr. Vigeland will agree to our stopping work on the "Palm
 Tree" meanwhile.
 
 Bernick: Hm--he won't. Well, be so good as to look through the letters.
 And look here, did you see Olaf down at the quay?
 
 Krap: No, Mr. Bernick. (Goes into BERNICK'S room.)
 
 Bernick (looking at the telegram again): These gentlemen think nothing
 of risking eight men's lives--
 
 Hilmar: Well, it is a sailor's calling to brave the elements; it must
 be a fine tonic to the nerves to be like that, with only a thin plank
 between one and the abyss--
 
 Bernick: I should like to see the ship-owner amongst us who would
 condescend to such a thing! There is not one that would do it--not a
 single one! (Sees OLAF coming up to the house.) Ah, thank Heaven, here
 he is, safe and sound. (OLAF, with a fishing-line in his hand, comes
 running up the garden and in through the verandah.)
 
 Olaf: Uncle Hilmar, I have been down and seen the steamer.
 
 Bernick: Have you been down to the quay again?
 
 Olaf: No, I have only been out in a boat. But just think, Uncle Hilmar,
 a whole circus company has come on shore, with horses and animals; and
 there were such lots of passengers.
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  No, are we really to have a circus?
 
 Rorlund: We? I certainly have no desire to see it.
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  No, of course I don't mean we, but--
 
 Dina: I should like to see a circus very much.
 
 Olaf: So should I.
 
 Hilmar: You are a duffer. Is that anything to see? Mere tricks. No, it
 would be something quite different to see the Gaucho careering over the
 Pampas on his snorting mustang. But, Heaven help us, in these wretched
 little towns of ours.
 
 Olaf (pulling at MARTHA'S dress): Look, Aunt Martha! Look, there they
 come!
 
 Mrs. Holt:  Good Lord, yes--here they come.
 
 Mrs. Lynge: Ugh, what horrid people!
 
 (A number of passengers and a whole crowd of townsfolk, are seen coming
 up the street.)
 
 Mrs. Rummel: They are a set of mountebanks, certainly. Just look at
 that woman in the grey dress, Mrs. Holt--the one with a knapsack over
 her shoulder.
 
 Mrs. Holt:  Yes--look--she has slung it on the handle of her parasol.
 The manager's wife, I expect.
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  And there is the manager himself, no doubt. He looks a
 regular pirate. Don't look at him, Hilda!
 
 Mrs. Holt: Nor you, Netta!
 
 Olaf: Mother, the manager is bowing to us.
 
 Bernick: What?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: What are you saying, child?
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Yes, and--good Heavens--the woman is bowing to us too.
 
 Bernick: That is a little too cool--
 
 Martha (exclaims involuntarily):  Ah--!
 
 Mrs. Bernick:  What is it, Martha?
 
 Martha:  Nothing, nothing. I thought for a moment--
 
 Olaf (shrieking with delight): Look, look, there are the rest of them,
 with the horses and animals! And there are the Americans, too! All the
 sailors from the "Indian Girl"! (The strains of "Yankee Doodle," played
 on a clarinet and a drum, are heard.)
 
 Hilmar (stopping his ears): Ugh, ugh, ugh!
 
 Rorlund: I think we ought to withdraw ourselves from sight a little,
 ladies; we have nothing to do with such goings on. Let us go to our
 work again.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Do you think we had better draw the curtains?
 
 Rorlund: Yes, that was exactly what I meant.
 
 (The ladies resume their places at the work-table; RORLUND shuts the
 verandah door, and draws the curtains over it and over the windows, so
 that the room becomes half dark.)
 
 Olaf (peeping out through the curtains): Mother, the manager's wife is
 standing by the fountain now, washing her face.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: What? In the middle of the marketplace?
 
 Mrs. Rummel: And in broad daylight, too!
 
 Hilmar: Well, I must say if I were travelling across a desert waste and
 found myself beside a well, I am sure I should not stop to think
 whether--. Ugh, that frightful clarinet!
 
 Rorlund: It is really high time the police interfered.
 
 Bernick: Oh no; we must not be too hard on foreigners. Of course these
 folk have none of the deep-seated instincts of decency which restrain
 us within proper bounds. Suppose they do behave outrageously, what does
 it concern us? Fortunately this spirit of disorder, that flies in the
 face of all that is customary and right, is absolutely a stranger to
 our community, if I may say so--. What is this! (LONA HESSEL walks
 briskly in from the door on the right.)
 
 The Ladies (in low, frightened tones): The circus woman! The manager's
 wife!
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Heavens, what does this mean?
 
 Martha (jumping up):  Ah--!
 
 Lona:  How do you do, Betty dear! How do you do, Martha! How do you do,
 brother-in-law!
 
 Mrs. Bernick (with a cry):  Lona--!
 
 Bernick (stumbling backwards):  As sure as I am alive--!
 
 Mrs. Holt:  Mercy on us--!
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  It cannot possibly be--!
 
 Hilmar: Well! Ugh!
 
 Mrs. Bernick:  Lona--! Is it really--?
 
 Lona:  Really me? Yes, indeed it is; you may fall on my neck if you
 like.
 
 Hilmar: Ugh, ugh!
 
 Mrs. Bernick:  And coming back here as--?
 
 Mrs. Bernick:  And actually mean to appear in--?
 
 Lona: Appear? Appear in what?
 
 Bernick: Well, I mean--in the circus--
 
 Lona: Ha, ha, ha! Are you mad, brother-in-law? Do you think I belong to
 the circus troupe? No, certainly I have turned my hand to a good many
 things and made a fool of myself in a good many ways--
 
 Mrs. Rummel:  Hm!
 
 Lona: But I have never tried circus riding.
 
 Bernick: Then you are not--?
 
 Mrs. Bernick:  Thank Heaven!
 
 Lona: No, we travelled like other respectable folk, second-class,
 certainly, but we are accustomed to that.
 
 Mrs. Bernick:  We, did you say?
 
 Bernick (taking a step for-ward): Whom do you mean by "we"?
 
 Lona: I and the child, of course.
 
 The Ladies (with a cry): The child!
 
 Hilmar: What?
 
 Rorlund: I really must say--!
 
 Mrs. Bernick:  But what do you mean, Lona?
 
 Lona: I mean John, of course; I have no other child, as far as I know,
 but John, or Johan as you used to call him.
 
 Mrs. Bernick:  Johan--
 
 Mrs. Rummel (in an undertone to MRS. LYNGE): The scapegrace brother!
 
 Bernick (hesitatingly): Is Johan with you?
 
 Lona:  Of course he is; I certainly would not come without him. Why do
 you look so tragical? And why are you sitting here in the gloom, sewing
 white things? There has not been a death in the family, has there?
 
 Rorlund: Madam, you find yourself in the Society for Fallen Women.
 
 Lona (half to herself): What? Can these nice, quiet-looking ladies
 possibly be--?
 
 Mrs. Rummel: Well, really--!
 
 Lona: Oh, I understand! But, bless my soul, that is surely Mrs. Rummel?
 And Mrs. Holt sitting there too! Well, we three have not grown younger
 since the last time we met. But listen now, good people; let the Fallen
 Women wait for a day--they will be none the worse for that. A joyful
 occasion like this--
 
 Rorlund:  A home-coming is not always a joyful occasion.
 
 Lona: Indeed? How do you read your Bible, Mr. Parson?
 
 Rorlund: I am not a parson.
 
 Lona: Oh, you will grow into one, then. But--faugh!--this moral linen
 of yours smells tainted, just like a winding-sheet. I am accustomed to
 the air of the prairies, let me tell you.
 
 Bernick (wiping his forehead): Yes, it certainly is rather close in
 here.
 
 Lona: Wait a moment; we will resurrect ourselves from this vault.
 (Pulls the curtains to one side) We must have broad daylight in here
 when the boy comes. Ah, you will see a boy then that has washed himself.
 
 Hilmar: Ugh!
 
 Lona (opening the verandah door and window): I should say, when he has
 washed himself, up at the hotel--for on the boat he got piggishly dirty.
 
 Hilmar: Ugh, ugh!
 
 Lona: Ugh? Why, surely isn't that--? (Points at HILDAR and asks the
 others): Is he still loafing about here saying "Ugh"?
 
 Hilmar: I do not loaf; it is the state of my health that keeps me here.
 
 Rorlund: Ahem! Ladies, I do not think--
 
 Lona (who has noticed OLAF): Is he yours, Betty? Give me a paw, my boy!
 Or are you afraid of your ugly old aunt?
 
 Rorlund (putting his book under his arm): Ladies, I do not think any of
 us is in the mood for any more work today. I suppose we are to meet
 again tomorrow?
 
 Lona (while the others are getting up and taking their leave): Yes, let
 us. I shall be on the spot.
 
 Rorlund: You? Pardon me, Miss Hessel, but what do you propose to do in
 our Society?
 
 Lona: I will let some fresh air into it, Mr. Parson.
 
 
 
 
 ACT II
 
 
 (SCENE.--The same room. MRS. BERNICK is sitting alone at the
 work-table, sewing. BERNICK comes in from the right, wearing his hat
 and gloves and carrying a stick.)
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Home already, Karsten?
 
 Bernick: Yes, I have made an appointment with a man.
 
 Mrs. Bernick (with a sigh): Oh yes, I suppose Johan is coming up here
 again.
 
 Bernick: With a man, I said. (Lays down his hat.) What has become of
 all the ladies today?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Mrs. Rummel and Hilda hadn't time to come.
 
 Bernick: Oh!--did they send any excuse?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Yes, they had so much to do at home.
 
 Bernick: Naturally. And of course the others are not coming either?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: No, something has prevented them today, too.
 
 Bernick: I could have told you that, beforehand. Where is Olaf?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: I let him go out a little with Dina.
 
 Bernick: Hm--she is a giddy little baggage. Did you see how she at once
 started making a fuss of Johan yesterday?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: But, my dear Karsten, you know Dina knows nothing
 whatever of--
 
 Bernick: No, but in any case Johan ought to have had sufficient tact
 not to pay her any attention. I saw quite well, from his face, what
 Vigeland thought of it.
 
 Mrs. Bernick (laying her sewing down on her lap): Karsten, can you
 imagine what his objective is in coming here?
 
 Bernick: Well--I know he has a farm over there, and I fancy he is not
 doing particularly well with it; she called attention yesterday to the
 fact that they were obliged to travel second class--
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Yes, I am afraid it must be something of that sort. But
 to think of her coming with him! She! After the deadly insult she
 offered you!
 
 Bernick: Oh, don't think about that ancient history.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: How can I help thinking of it just now? After all, he is
 my brother--still, it is not on his account that I am distressed, but
 because of all the unpleasantness it would mean for you. Karsten, I am
 so dreadfully afraid!
 
 Bernick: Afraid of what?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Isn't it possible that they may send him to prison for
 stealing that money from your mother?
 
 Bernick: What rubbish! Who can prove that the money was stolen?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: The whole town knows it, unfortunately; and you know you
 said yourself.
 
 Bernick: I said nothing. The town knows nothing whatever about the
 affair; the whole thing was no more than idle rumour.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: How magnanimous you are, Karsten!
 
 Bernick: Do not let us have any more of these reminiscences, please!
 You don't know how you torture me by raking all that up. (Walks up and
 down; then flings his stick away from him.) And to think of their
 coming home now--just now, when it is particularly necessary for me
 that I should stand well in every respect with the town and with the
 Press. Our newspaper men will be sending paragraphs to the papers in
 the other towns about here. Whether I receive them well, or whether I
 receive them ill, it will all be discussed and talked over. They will
 rake up all those old stories--as you do. In a community like
 ours--(Throws his gloves down on the table.) And I have not a soul here
 to whom I can talk about it and to whom I can go for support.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: No one at all, Karsten?
 
 Bernick: No--who is there? And to have them on my shoulders just at
 this moment! Without a doubt they will create a scandal in some way or
 another--she, in particular. It is simply a calamity to be connected
 with such folk in any way!
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Well, I can't help their--
 
 Bernick: What can't you help? Their being your relations? No, that is
 quite true.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: And I did not ask them to come home.
 
 Bernick: That's it--go on! "I did not ask them to come home; I did not
 write to them; I did not drag them home by the hair of their heads!"
 Oh, I know the whole rigmarole by heart.
 
 Mrs. Bernick (bursting into tears): You need not be so unkind--
 
 Bernick: Yes, that's right--begin to cry, so that our neighbours may
 have that to gossip about too. Do stop being so foolish, Betty. Go and
 sit outside; some one may come in here. I don't suppose you want people
 to see the lady of the house with red eyes? It would be a nice thing,
 wouldn't it, if the story got out about that--. There, I hear some one
 in the passage. (A knock is heard at the door.) Come in! (MRS. BERNICK
 takes her sewing and goes out down the garden steps. AUNE comes in from
 the right.)
 
 Aune: Good morning, Mr. Bernick.
 
 Bernick: Good morning. Well, I suppose you can guess what I want you
 for?
 
 Aune: Mr. Krap told me yesterday that you were not pleased with--
 
 Bernick: I am displeased with the whole management of the yard, Aune.
 The work does not get on as quickly as it ought. The "Palm Tree" ought
 to have been under sail long ago. Mr. Vigeland comes here every day to
 complain about it; he is a difficult man to have with one as part owner.
 
 Aune: The "Palm Tree" can go to sea the day after tomorrow.
 
 Bernick: At last. But what about the American ship, the "Indian Girl,"
 which has been laid up here for five weeks and--
 
 Aune: The American ship? I understood that, before everything else, we
 were to work our hardest to get your own ship ready.
 
 Bernick: I gave you no reason to think so. You ought to have pushed on
 as fast as possible with the work on the American ship also; but you
 have not.
 
 Aune: Her bottom is completely rotten, Mr. Bernick; the more we patch
 it, the worse it gets.
 
 Bernick: That is not the reason. Krap has told me the whole truth. You
 do not understand how to work the new machines I have provided--or
 rather, you will not try to work them.
 
 Aune: Mr. Bernick, I am well on in the fifties; and ever since I was a
 boy I have been accustomed to the old way of working--
 
 Bernick:  We cannot work that way now-a-days. You must not imagine,
 Aune, that it is for the sake of making profit; I do not need that,
 fortunately; but I owe consideration to the community I live in, and to
 the business I am at the head of. I must take the lead in progress, or
 there would never be any.
 
 Aune: I welcome progress too, Mr. Bernick.
 
 Bernick: Yes, for your own limited circle--for the working class. Oh, I
 know what a busy agitator you are; you make speeches, you stir people
 up; but when some concrete instance of progress presents itself--as
 now, in the case of our machines--you do not want to have anything to
 do with it; you are afraid.
 
 Aune: Yes, I really am afraid, Mr. Bernick. I am afraid for the number
 of men who will have the bread taken out of their mouths by these
 machines. You are very fond, sir, of talking about the consideration we
 owe to the community; it seems to me, however, that the community has
 its duties too. Why should science and capital venture to introduce
 these new discoveries into labour, before the community has had time to
 educate a generation up to using them?
 
 Bernick: You read and think too much, Aune; it does you no good, and
 that is what makes you dissatisfied with your lot.
 
 Aune: It is not, Mr. Bernick; but I cannot bear to see one good workman
 dismissed after another, to starve because of these machines.
 
 Bernick: Hm! When the art of printing was discovered, many a
 quill-driver was reduced to starvation.
 
 Aune: Would you have admired the art so greatly if you had been a
 quill-driver in those days, sir?
 
 Bernick: I did not send for you to argue with you. I sent for you to
 tell you that the "Indian Girl" must be ready to put to sea the day
 after tomorrow.
 
 Aune: But, Mr. Bernick--
 
 Bernick: The day after tomorrow, do you hear?--at the same time as our
 own ship, not an hour later. I have good reasons for hurrying on the
 work. Have you seen today's paper? Well, then you know the pranks these
 American sailors have been up to again. The rascally pack are turning
 the whole town upside down. Not a night passes without some brawling in
 the taverns or the streets--not to speak of other abominations.
 
 Aune: Yes, they certainly are a bad lot.
 
 Bernick: And who is it that has to bear the blame for all this
 disorder? It is I! Yes, it is I who have to suffer for it. These
 newspaper fellows are making all sorts of covert insinuations because
 we are devoting all our energies to the "Palm Tree." I, whose task in
 life it is to influence my fellow-citizens by the force of example,
 have to endure this sort of thing cast in my face. I am not going to
 stand that. I have no fancy for having my good name smirched in that
 way.
 
 Aune: Your name stands high enough to endure that and a great deal
 more, sir.
 
 Bernick: Not just now. At this particular moment I have need of all the
 respect and goodwill my fellow-citizens can give me. I have a big
 undertaking on, the stocks, as you probably have heard; but, if it
 should happen that evil-disposed persons succeeded in shaking the
 absolute confidence I enjoy, it might land me in the greatest
 difficulties. That is why I want, at any price, to avoid these shameful
 innuendoes in the papers, and that is why I name the day after tomorrow
 as the limit of the time I can give you.
 
 Aune: Mr. Bernick, you might just as well name this afternoon as the
 limit.
 
 Bernick: You mean that I am asking an impossibility?
 
 Aune: Yes, with the hands we have now at the yard.
 
 Bernick: Very good; then we must look about elsewhere.
 
 Aune: Do you really mean, sir, to discharge still more of your old
 workmen?
 
 Bernick: No, I am not thinking of that.
 
 Aune: Because I think it would cause bad blood against you both among
 the townsfolk and in the papers, if you did that.
 
 Bernick: Very probably; therefore, we will not do it. But, if the
 "Indian Girl" is not ready to sail the day after tomorrow, I shall
 discharge you.
 
 Aune (with a start): Me! (He laughs.) You are joking, Mr. Bernick.
 
 Bernick: I should not be so sure of that, if I were you.
 
 Aune: Do you mean that you can contemplate discharging me?--Me, whose
 father and grandfather worked in your yard all their lives, as I have
 done myself--?
 
 Bernick: Who is it that is forcing me to do it?
 
 Aune: You are asking what is impossible, Mr. Bernick.
 
 Bernick: Oh, where there's a will there's a way. Yes or no; give me a
 decisive answer, or consider yourself discharged on the spot.
 
 Aune (coming a step nearer to him): Mr. Bernick, have you ever realised
 what discharging an old workman means? You think he can look about for
 another job? Oh, yes, he can do that; but does that dispose of the
 matter? You should just be there once, in the house of a workman who
 has been discharged, the evening he comes home bringing all his tools
 with him.
 
 Bernick: Do you think I am discharging you with a light heart? Have I
 not always been a good master to you?
 
 Aune: So much the worse, Mr. Bernick. Just for that very reason those
 at home will not blame you; they will say nothing to me, because they
 dare not; but they will look at me when I am not noticing, and think
 that I must have deserved it. You see, sir, that is--that is what I
 cannot bear. I am a mere nobody, I know; but I have always been
 accustomed to stand first in my own home. My humble home is a little
 community too, Mr. Bernick--a little community which I have been able
 to support and maintain because my wife has believed in me and because
 my children have believed in me. And now it is all to fall to pieces.
 
 Bernick: Still, if there is nothing else for it, the lesser must go
 down before the greater; the individual must be sacrificed to the
 general welfare. I can give you no other answer; and that, and no
 other, is the way of the world. You are an obstinate man, Aune! You are
 opposing me, not because you cannot do otherwise, but because you will
 not exhibit 'the superiority of machinery over manual labour'.
 
 Aune: And you will not be moved, Mr. Bernick, because you know that if
 you drive me away you will at all events have given the newspapers
 proof of your good will.
 
 Bernick: And suppose that were so? I have told you what it means for
 me--either bringing the Press down on my back, or making them
 well-disposed to me at a moment when I am working for an objective
 which will mean the advancement of the general welfare. Well, then, can
 I do otherwise than as I am doing? The question, let me tell you, turns
 upon this--whether your home is to be supported, as you put it, or
 whether hundreds of new homes are to be prevented from
 existing--hundreds of homes that will never be built, never have a fire
 lighted on their hearth, unless I succeed in carrying through the
 scheme I am working for now. That is the reason why I have given you
 your choice.
 
 Aune: Well, if that is the way things stand, I have nothing more to say.
 
 Bernick: Hm--my dear Aune, I am extremely grieved to think that we are
 to part.
 
 Aune: We are not going to part, Mr. Bernick.
 
 Bernick: How is that?
 
 Aune: Even a common man like myself has something he is bound to
 maintain.
 
 Bernick: Quite so, quite so--then I presume you think you may promise--?
 
 Aune: The "Indian Girl" shall be ready to sail the day after tomorrow.
 (Bows and goes out to the right.)
 
 Bernick: Ah, I have got the better of that obstinate fellow! I take it
 as a good omen. (HILMAR comes in through the garden door, smoking a
 cigar.)
 
 Hilmar (as he comes up the steps to the verandah): Good morning, Betty!
 Good morning, Karsten!
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Good morning.
 
 Hilmar: Ah, I see you have been crying, so I suppose you know all about
 it too?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Know all about what?
 
 Hilmar: That the scandal is in full swing. Ugh!
 
 Bernick: What do you mean?
 
 Hilmar (coming into the room): Why, that our two friends from America
 are displaying themselves about the streets in the company of Dina Dorf.
 
 Mrs. Bernick (coming in after him): Hilmar, is it possible?
 
 Hilmar: Yes, unfortunately, it is quite true. Lona was even so wanting
 in tact as to call after me, but of course I appeared not to have heard
 her.
 
 Bernick: And no doubt all this has not been unnoticed.
 
 Hilmar: You may well say that. People stood still and looked at them.
 It spread like wildfire through the town--just like a prairie fire out
 West. In every house people were at the windows waiting for the
 procession to pass, cheek by jowl behind the curtains--ugh! Oh, you
 must excuse me, Betty, for saying "ugh"--this has got on my nerves. If
 it is going on, I shall be forced to think about getting right away
 from here.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: But you should have spoken to him and represented to him
 that--
 
 Hilmar: In the open street? No, excuse me, I could not do that. To
 think that the fellow should dare to show himself in the town at all!
 Well, we shall see if the Press doesn't put a stopper on him;
 yes--forgive me, Betty, but--
 
 Bernick: The Press, do you say? Have you heard a hint of anything of
 the sort?
 
 Hilmar: There are such things flying about. When I left here yesterday
 evening I looked in at the club, because I did not feel well. I saw at
 once, from the sudden silence that fell when I went in, that our
 American couple had been the subject of conversation. Then that
 impudent newspaper fellow, Hammer, came in and congratulated me at the
 top of his voice on the return of my rich cousin.
 
 Bernick: Rich?
 
 Hilmar: Those were his words. Naturally I looked him up and down in the
 manner he deserved, and gave him to understand that I knew nothing
 about Johan Tonnesen's being rich. "Really," he said, "that is very
 remarkable. People usually get on in America when they have something
 to start with, and I believe your cousin did not go over there quite
 empty-handed."
 
 Bernick: Hm--now will you oblige me by--
 
 Mrs. Bernick (distressed): There, you see, Karsten!
 
 Hilmar: Anyhow, I have spent a sleepless night because of them. And
 here he is, walking about the streets as if nothing were the matter.
 Why couldn't he disappear for good and all? It really is insufferable
 how hard some people are to kill.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: My dear Hilmar, what are you saying P
 
 Hilmar: Oh, nothing. But here this fellow escapes with a whole skin
 from railway accidents and fights with California grizzlies and
 Blackfoot Indians--has not even been scalped--. Ugh, here they come!
 
 Bernick (looking down the street): Olaf is with them too!
 
 Hilmar: Of course! They want to remind everybody that they belong to
 the best family in the town. Look there!--look at the crowd of loafers
 that have come out of the chemist's to stare at them and make remarks.
 My nerves really won't stand it; how a man is to be expected to keep
 the banner of the Ideal flying under such circumstances, I--
 
 Bernick: They are coming here. Listen, Betty; it is my particular wish
 that you should receive them in the friendliest possible way.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Oh, may I, Karsten.
 
 Bernick: Certainly, certainly--and you too, Hilmar. It is to be hoped
 they will not stay here very long; and when we are quite by
 ourselves--no allusions to the past; we must not hurt their feelings in
 any way.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: How magnanimous you are, Karsten!
 
 Bernick: Oh, don't speak of that.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: But you must let me thank you; and you must forgive me
 for being so hasty. I am sure you had every reason to--
 
 Bernick: Don't talk about it, please.
 
 Hilmar: Ugh!
 
 (JOHAN TONNESEN and DINA come up through the garden, followed by LONA
 and OLAF.)
 
 Lona: Good morning, dear people!
 
 Johan: We have been out having a look round the old place, Karsten.
 
 Bernick: So I hear. Greatly altered, is it not?
 
 Lona: Mr. Bernick's great and good works everywhere. We have been up
 into the Recreation Ground you have presented to the town.
 
 Bernick: Have you been there?
 
 Lona: "The gift of Karsten Bernick," as it says over the gateway. You
 seem to be responsible for the whole place here.
 
 Johan: Splendid ships you have got, too. I met my old schoolfellow, the
 captain of the "Palm Tree."
 
 Lona: And you have built a new school-house too; and I hear that the
 town has to thank you for both the gas supply and the water supply.
 
 Bernick: Well, one ought to work for the good of the community one
 lives in.
 
 Lona: That is an excellent sentiment, brother-in-law, but it is a
 pleasure, all the same, to see how people appreciate you. I am not
 vain, I hope; but I could not resist reminding one or two of the people
 we talked to that we were relations of yours.
 
 Hilmar: Ugh!
 
 Lona: Do you say "ugh" to that?
 
 Hilmar: No, I said "ahem."
 
 Lona: Oh, poor chap, you may say that if you like. But are you all by
 yourselves today?
 
 Bernick: Yes, we are by ourselves today.
 
 Lona: Ah, yes, we met a couple of members of your Morality Society up
 at the market; they made out they were very busy. You and I have never
 had an opportunity for a good talk yet. Yesterday you had your three
 pioneers here, as well as the parson.
 
 Hilmar: The schoolmaster.
 
 Lona: I call him the parson. But now tell me what you think of my work
 during these fifteen years? Hasn't he grown a fine fellow? Who would
 recognise the madcap that ran away from home?
 
 Hilmar: Hm!
 
 Johan: Now, Lona, don't brag too much about me.
 
 Lona: Well, I can tell you I am precious proud of him. Goodness knows
 it is about the only thing I have done in my life; but it does give me
 a sort of right to exist. When I think, Johan, how we two began over
 there with nothing but our four bare fists.
 
 Hilmar: Hands.
 
 Lona: I say fists; and they were dirty fists.
 
 Hilmar: Ugh!
 
 Lona: And empty, too.
 
 Hilmar: Empty? Well, I must say--
 
 Lona: What must you say?
 
 Bernick: Ahem!
 
 Hilmar: I must say--ugh! (Goes out through the garden.)
 
 Lona: What is the matter with the man?
 
 Bernick: Oh, do not take any notice of him; his nerves are rather upset
 just now. Would you not like to take a look at the garden? You have not
 been down there yet, and I have got an hour to spare.
 
 Lona: With pleasure. I can tell you my thoughts have been with you in
 this garden many and many a time.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: We have made a great many alterations there too, as you
 will see. (BERNICK, MRS. BERNICK, and LONA go down to the garden, where
 they are visible every now and then during the following scene.)
 
 Olaf (coming to the verandah door): Uncle Hilmar, do you know what
 uncle Johan asked me? He asked me if I would go to America with him.
 
 Hilmar: You, you duffer, who are tied to your mother's apron strings--!
 
 Olaf: Ah, but I won't be that any longer. You will see, when I grow big.
 
 Hilmar: Oh, fiddlesticks! You have no really serious bent towards the
 strength of character necessary to--.
 
 (They go down to the garden. DINA meanwhile has taken off her hat and
 is standing at the door on the right, shaking the dust off her dress.)
 
 Johan (to DINA): The walk has made you pretty warm.
 
 Dina: Yes, it was a splendid walk. I have never had such a splendid
 walk before.
 
 Johan: Do you not often go for a walk in the morning?
 
 Dina: Oh, yes--but only with Olaf.
 
 Johan: I see.--Would you rather go down into the garden than stay here?
 
 Dina: No, I would rather stay here.
 
 Johan: So would I. Then shall we consider it a bargain that we are to
 go for a walk like this together every morning?
 
 Dina: No, Mr. Tonnesen, you mustn't do that.
 
 Johan: What mustn't I do? You promised, you know.
 
 Dina: Yes, but--on second thought--you mustn't go out with me.
 
 Johan: But why not?
 
 Dina: Of course, you are a stranger--you cannot understand; but I must
 tell you--
 
 Johan: Well?
 
 Dina: No, I would rather not talk about it.
 
 Johan: Oh, but you must; you can talk to me about whatever you like.
 
 Dina: Well, I must tell you that I am not like the other young girls
 here. There is something--something or other about me. That is why you
 mustn't.
 
 Johan: But I do not understand anything about it. You have not done
 anything wrong?
 
 Dina: No, not I, but--no, I am not going to talk any more about it now.
 You will hear about it from the others, sure enough.
 
 Johan: Hm!
 
 Dina: But there is something else I want very much to ask you.
 
 Johan: What is that?
 
 Dina: I suppose it is easy to make a position for oneself over in
 America?
 
 Johan: No, it is not always easy; at first you often have to rough it
 and work very hard.
 
 Dina: I should be quite ready to do that.
 
 Johan: You?
 
 Dina: I can work now; I am strong and healthy; and Aunt Martha taught
 me a lot.
 
 Johan: Well, hang it, come back with us!
 
 Dina: Ah, now you are only making fun of me; you said that to Olaf too.
 But what I wanted to know is if people are so very--so very moral over
 there?
 
 Johan: Moral?
 
 Dina: Yes; I mean are they as--as proper and as well-behaved as they
 are here?
 
 Johan: Well, at all events they are not so bad as people here make out.
 You need not be afraid on that score.
 
 Dina: You don't understand me. What I want to hear is just that they
 are not so proper and so moral.
 
 Johan: Not? What would you wish them to be, then?
 
 Dina: I would wish them to be natural.
 
 Johan: Well, I believe that is just what they are.
 
 Dina: Because in that case I should get on if I went there.
 
 Johan: You would, for certain!--and that is why you must come back with
 us.
 
 Dina: No, I don't want to go with you; I must go alone. Oh, I would
 make something of my life; I would get on--
 
 Bernick (speaking to LONA and his wife at the foot of the garden
 steps): Wait a moment--I will fetch it, Betty dear; you might so easily
 catch cold. (Comes into the room and looks for his wife's shawl.)
 
 Mrs. Bernick (from outside): You must come out too, Johan; we are going
 down to the grotto.
 
 Bernick: No, I want Johan to stay here. Look here, Dina; you take my
 wife's shawl and go with them. Johan is going to stay here with me,
 Betty dear. I want to hear how he is getting on over there.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Very well--then you will follow us; you know where you
 will find us. (MRS. BERNICK, LONA and DINA go out through the garden,
 to the left. BERNICK looks after them for a moment, then goes to the
 farther door on the left and locks it, after which he goes up to JOHAN,
 grasps both his hands, and shakes them warmly.)
 
 Bernick: Johan, now that we are alone, you must let me thank you.
 
 Johan: Oh, nonsense!
 
 Bernick: My home and all the happiness that it means to me--my position
 here as a citizen--all these I owe to you.
 
 Johan: Well, I am glad of it, Karsten; some good came of that mad story
 after all, then.
 
 Bernick (grasping his hands again): But still you must let me thank
 you! Not one in ten thousand would have done what you did for me.
 
 Johan: Rubbish! Weren't we, both of us, young and thoughtless? One of
 us had to take the blame, you know.
 
 Bernick: But surely the guilty one was the proper one to do that?
 
 Johan: Stop! At the moment the innocent one happened to be the proper
 one to do it. Remember, I had no ties--I was an orphan; it was a lucky
 chance to get free from the drudgery of the office. You, on the other
 hand, had your old mother still alive; and, besides that, you had just
 become secretly engaged to Betty, who was devoted to you. What would
 have happened between you and her if it had come to her ears?
 
 Bernick: That is true enough, but still--
 
 Johan: And wasn't it just for Betty's sake that you broke off your
 acquaintance with Mrs. Dorf? Why, it was merely in order to put an end
 to the whole thing that you were up there with her that evening.
 
 Bernick: Yes, that unfortunate evening when that drunken creature came
 home! Yes, Johan, it was for Betty's sake; but, all the same, it was
 splendid of you to let all the appearances go against you, and to go
 away.
 
 Johan: Put your scruples to rest, my dear Karsten. We agreed that it
 should be so; you had to be saved, and you were my friend. I can tell
 you, I was uncommonly proud of that friendship. Here was I, drudging
 away like a miserable stick-in-the-mud, when you came back from your
 grand tour abroad, a great swell who had been to London and to Paris;
 and you chose me for your chum, although I was four years younger than
 you--it is true it was because you were courting Betty, I understand
 that now--but I was proud of it! Who would not have been? Who would not
 willingly have sacrificed himself for you?--especially as it only meant
 a month's talk in the town, and enabled me to get away into the wide
 world.
 
 Bernick: Ah, my dear Johan, I must be candid and tell you that the
 story is not so completely forgotten yet.
 
 Johan: Isn't it? Well, what does that matter to me, once I am back over
 there on my farm again?
 
 Bernick: Then you mean to go back?
 
 Johan: Of course.
 
 Bernick: But not immediately, I hope?
 
 Johan: As soon as possible. It was only to humour Lona that I came over
 with her, you know.
 
 Bernick: Really? How so?
 
 Johan: Well, you see, Lona is no longer young, and lately she began to
 be obsessed with home-sickness; but she never would admit it. (Smiles.)
 How could she venture to risk leaving such a flighty fellow as me
 alone, who before I was nineteen had been mixed up in...
 
 Bernick: Well, what then?
 
 Johan: Well, Karsten, now I am coming to a confession that I am ashamed
 to make.
 
 Bernick: You surely haven't confided the truth to her?
 
 Johan: Yes. It was wrong of me, but I could not do otherwise. You can
 have no conception what Lona has been to me. You never could put up
 with her; but she has been like a mother to me. The first year we were
 out there, when things went so badly with us, you have no idea how she
 worked! And when I was ill for a long time, and could earn nothing and
 could not prevent her, she took to singing ballads in taverns, and gave
 lectures that people laughed at; and then she wrote a book that she has
 both laughed and cried over since then--all to keep the life in me.
 Could I look on when in the winter she, who had toiled and drudged for
 me, began to pine away? No, Karsten, I couldn't. And so I said, "You go
 home for a trip, Lona; don't be afraid for me, I am not so flighty as
 you think." And so--the end of it was that she had to know.
 
 Bernick: And how did she take it?
 
 Johan: Well, she thought, as was true, that as I knew I was innocent
 nothing need prevent me from taking a trip over here with her. But make
 your mind easy; Lona will let nothing out, and I shall keep my mouth
 shut as I did before.
 
 Bernick: Yes, yes I rely on that.
 
 Johan: Here is my hand on it. And now we will say no more about that
 old story; luckily it is the only mad prank either of us has been
 guilty of, I am sure. I want thoroughly to enjoy the few days I shall
 stay here. You cannot think what a delightful walk we had this morning.
 Who would have believed that that little imp, who used to run about
 here and play angels' parts on the stage--! But tell me, my dear
 fellow, what became of her parents afterwards?
 
 Bernick: Oh, my boy, I can tell you no more than I wrote to you
 immediately after you went away. I suppose you got my two letters?
 
 Johan: Yes, yes, I have them both. So that drunken fellow deserted her?
 
 Bernick: And drank himself to death afterwards.
 
 Johan: And she died soon afterwards, too?
 
 Bernick: She was proud; she betrayed nothing, and would accept nothing.
 
 Johan: Well, at all events you did the right thing by taking Dina into
 your house.
 
 Bernick: I suppose so. As a matter of fact it was Martha that brought
 that about.
 
 Johan: So it was Martha? By the way, where is she today?
 
 Bernick: She? Oh, when she hasn't her school to look after, she has her
 sick people to see to.
 
 Johan: So it was Martha who interested herself in her.
 
 Bernick: Yes, you know Martha has always had a certain liking for
 teaching; so she took a post in the boarding-school. It was very
 ridiculous of her.
 
 Johan: I thought she looked very worn yesterday; I should be afraid her
 health was not good enough for it.
 
 Bernick: Oh, as far as her health goes, it is all right enough. But it
 is unpleasant for me; it looks as though I, her brother, were not
 willing to support her.
 
 Johan: Support her? I thought she had means enough of her own.
 
 Bernick: Not a penny. Surely you remember how badly off our mother was
 when you went away? She carried things on for a time with my
 assistance, but naturally I could not put up with that state of affairs
 permanently. I made her take me into the firm, but even then things did
 not go well. So I had to take over the whole business myself, and when
 we made up our balance-sheet, it became evident that there was
 practically nothing left as my mother's share. And when mother died
 soon afterwards, of course Martha was left penniless.
 
 Johan: Poor Martha!
 
 Bernick: Poor! Why? You surely do not suppose I let her want for
 anything? No, I venture to say I am a good brother. Of course she has a
 home here with us; her salary as a teacher is more than enough for her
 to dress on; what more could she want?
 
 Johan: Hm--that is not our idea of things in America.
 
 Bernick: No, I dare say not--in such a revolutionary state of society
 as you find there. But in our small circle--in which, thank God,
 depravity has not gained a footing, up to now at all events--women are
 content to occupy a seemly, as well as modest, position. Moreover, it
 is Martha's own fault; I mean, she might have been provided for long
 ago, if she had wished.
 
 Johan: You mean she might have married?
 
 Bernick: Yes, and married very well, too. She has had several good
 offers--curiously enough, when you think that she is a poor girl, no
 longer young, and, besides, quite an insignificant person.
 
 Johan: Insignificant?
 
 Bernick: Oh, I am not blaming her for that. I most certainly would not
 wish her otherwise. I can tell you it is always a good thing to have a
 steady-going person like that in a big house like this--some one you
 can rely on in any contingency.
 
 Johan: Yes, but what does she--?
 
 Bernick: She? How? Oh well, of course she has plenty to interest
 herself in; she has Betty and Olaf and me. People should not think
 first of themselves--women least of all. We have all got some
 community, great or small, to work for. That is my principle, at all
 events. (Points to KRAP, who has come in from the right.) Ah, here is
 an example of it, ready to hand. Do you suppose that it is my own
 affairs that are absorbing me just now? By no means. (Eagerly to KRAP.)
 Well?
 
 Krap (in an undertone, showing him a bundle of papers): Here are all
 the sale contracts, completed.
 
 Bernick: Capital! Splendid!--Well, Johan, you must really excuse me for
 the present. (In a low voice, grasping his hand.) Thanks, Johan,
 thanks! And rest assured that anything I can do for you-- Well, of
 course you understand. Come along, Krap. (They go into BERNICK'S room.)
 
 Johan (looking after them for a moment): Hm!-- (Turns to go down to the
 garden. At the same moment MARTHA comes in from the right, with a
 little basket over her arm.) Martha!
 
 Martha: Ah, Johan--is it you?
 
 Johan: Out so early?
 
 Martha: Yes. Wait a moment; the others are just coming. (Moves towards
 the door on the left.)
 
 Johan: Martha, are you always in such a hurry?
 
 Martha: I?
 
 Johan: Yesterday you seemed to avoid me, so that I never managed to
 have a word with you--we two old playfellows.
 
 Martha: Ah, Johan; that is many, many years ago.
 
 Johan: Good Lord--why, it is only fifteen years ago, no more and no
 less. Do you think I have changed so much?
 
 Martha: You? Oh yes, you have changed too, although--
 
 Johan: What do you mean?
 
 Martha: Oh, nothing.
 
 Johan: You do not seem to be very glad to see me again.
 
 Martha: I have waited so long, Johan--too long.
 
 Johan: Waited? For me to come?
 
 Martha: Yes.
 
 Johan. And why did you think I would come?
 
 Martha: To atone for the wrong you had done.
 
 Johan: I?
 
 Martha: Have you forgotten that it was through you that a woman died in
 need and in shame? Have you forgotten that it was through you that the
 best years of a young girl's life were embittered?
 
 Johan: And you can say such things to me? Martha, has your brother
 never--?
 
 Martha: Never what?
 
 Johan: Has he never--oh, of course, I mean has he never so much as said
 a word in my defence?
 
 Martha: Ah, Johan, you know Karsten's high principles.
 
 Johan: Hm--! Oh, of course; I know my old friend Karsten's high
 principles! But really this is--. Well, well. I was having a talk with
 him just now. He seems to me to have altered considerably.
 
 Martha: How can you say that? I am sure Karsten has always been an
 excellent man.
 
 Johan: Yes, that was not exactly what I meant--but never mind. Hm! Now
 I understand the light you have seen me in; it was the return of the
 prodigal that you were waiting for.
 
 Martha: Johan, I will tell you what light I have seen you in. (Points
 down to the garden.) Do you see that girl playing on the grass down
 there with Olaf? That is Dina. Do you remember that incoherent letter
 you wrote me when you went away? You asked me to believe in you. I have
 believed in you, Johan. All the horrible things that were rumoured
 about you after you had gone must have been done through being led
 astray--from thoughtlessness, without premeditation.
 
 Johan: What do you mean?
 
 Martha: Oh! you understand me well enough--not a word more of that. But
 of course you had to go away and begin afresh--a new life. Your duties
 here which you never remembered to undertake--or never were able to
 undertake--I have undertaken for you. I tell you this, so that you
 shall not have that also to reproach yourself with. I have been a
 mother to that much-wronged child; I have brought her up as well as I
 was able.
 
 Johan: And have wasted your whole life for that reason.
 
 Martha: It has not been wasted. But you have come late, Johan.
 
 Johan: Martha--if only I could tell you--. Well, at all events let me
 thank you for your loyal friendship.
 
 Martha (with a sad smile): Hm.--Well, we have had it out now, Johan.
 Hush, some one is coming. Goodbye, I can't stay now. (Goes out through
 the farther door on the left. LONA comes in from the garden, followed
 by MRS. BERNICK.)
 
 Mrs. Bernick: But good gracious, Lona--what are you thinking of?
 
 Lona: Let me be, I tell you! I must and will speak to him.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: But it would be a scandal of the worst sort! Ah,
 Johan--still here?
 
 Lona: Out with you, my boy; don't stay here in doors; go down into the
 garden and have a chat with Dina.
 
 Johan: I was just thinking of doing so.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: But--
 
 Lona: Look here, Johan--have you had a good look at Dina?
 
 Johan: I should think so!
 
 Lona: Well, look at her to some purpose, my boy. That would be somebody
 for you!
 
 Mrs. Bernick: But, Lona!
 
 Johan: Somebody for me?
 
 Lona: Yes, to look at, I mean. Be off with you!
 
 Johan: Oh, I don't need any pressing. (Goes down into the garden.)
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Lona, you astound me! You cannot possibly be serious
 about it?
 
 Lona: Indeed I am. Isn't she sweet and healthy and honest? She is
 exactly the wife for Johan. She is just what he needs over there; it
 will be a change from an old step-sister.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Dina? Dina Dorf? But think--
 
 Lona: I think first and foremost of the boy's happiness. Because, help
 him I must; he has not much idea of that sort of thing; he has never
 had much of an eye for girls or women.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: He? Johan? Indeed I think we have had only too sad proofs
 that--
 
 Lona: Oh, devil take all those stupid stories! Where is Karsten? I mean
 to speak to him.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Lona, you must not do it, I tell you.
 
 Lona: I am going to. If the boy takes a fancy to her--and she to
 him--then they shall make a match of it. Karsten is such a clever man,
 he must find some way to bring it about.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: And do you think these American indecencies will be
 permitted here?
 
 Lona: Bosh, Betty!
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Do you think a man like Karsten, with his strictly moral
 way of thinking--
 
 Lona: Pooh! he is not so terribly moral.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: What have you the audacity to say?
 
 Lona: I have the audacity to say that Karsten is not any more
 particularly moral than anybody else.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: So you still hate him as deeply as that! But what are you
 doing here, if you have never been able to forget that? I cannot
 understand how you, dare look him in the face after the shameful insult
 you put upon him in the old days.
 
 Lona: Yes, Betty, that time I did forget myself badly.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: And to think how magnanimously he has forgiven you--he,
 who had never done any wrong! It was not his fault that you encouraged
 yourself with hopes. But since then you have always hated me too.
 (Bursts into tears.) You have always begrudged me my good fortune. And
 now you come here to heap all this on my head--to let the whole town
 know what sort of a family I have brought Karsten into. Yes, it is me
 that it all falls upon, and that is what you want. Oh, it is abominable
 of you! (Goes out by the door on the left, in tears.)
 
 Lona (looking after her): Poor Betty! (BERNICK comes in from his room.
 He stops at the door to speak to KRAP.)
 
 Bernick: Yes, that is excellent, Krap--capital! Send twenty pounds to
 the fund for dinners to the poor. (Turns round.) Lona! (Comes forward.)
 Are you alone? Is Betty not coming in?
 
 Lona: No. Would you like me to call her?
 
 Bernick: No, no--not at all. Oh, Lona, you don't know how anxious I
 have been to speak openly to you--after having begged for your
 forgiveness.
 
 Lona: Look here, Karsten--do not let us be sentimental; it doesn't suit
 us.
 
 Bernick: You must listen to me, Lona. I know only too well how much
 appearances are against me, as you have learnt all about that affair
 with Dina's mother. But I swear to you that it was only a temporary
 infatuation; I was really, truly and honestly, in love with you once.
 
 Lona: Why do you think I have come home?
 
 Bernick: Whatever you have in your mind, I entreat, you to do nothing
 until I have exculpated myself. I can do that, Lona; at all events I
 can excuse myself.
 
 Lona: Now you are frightened. You once were in love with me, you say.
 Yes, you told me that often enough in your letters; and perhaps it was
 true, too--in a way--as long as you were living out in the great, free
 world which gave you the courage to think freely and greatly. Perhaps
 you found in me a little more character and strength of will and
 independence than in most of the folk at home here. And then we kept it
 secret between us; nobody could make fun of your bad taste.
 
 Bernick: Lona, how can you think--?
 
 Lona: But when you came back--when you heard the gibes that were made
 at me on all sides--when you noticed how people laughed at what they
 called my absurdities...
 
 Bernick: You were regardless of people's opinion at that time.
 
 Lona: Chiefly to annoy the petticoated and trousered prudes that one
 met at every turn in the town. And then, when you met that seductive
 young actress--
 
 Bernick: It was a boyish escapade--nothing more; I swear to you that
 there was no truth in a tenth part of the rumours and gossip that went
 about.
 
 Lona: Maybe. But then, when Betty came home--a pretty young girl,
 idolised by every one--and it became known that she would inherit all
 her aunt's money and that I would have nothing!
 
 Bernick: That is just the point, Lona; and now you shall have the truth
 without any beating about the bush. I did not love Betty then; I did
 not break off my engagement with you because of any new attachment. It
 was entirely for the sake of the money. I needed it; I had to make sure
 of it.
 
 Lona: And you have the face to tell me that?
 
 Bernick: Yes, I have. Listen, Lona.
 
 Lona: And yet you wrote to me that an unconquerable passion for Betty
 had overcome you--invoked my magnanimity--begged me, for Betty's sake,
 to hold my tongue about all that had been between us.
 
 Bernick: I had to, I tell you.
 
 Lona: Now, by Heaven, I don't regret that I forgot myself as I did that
 time--
 
 Bernick: Let me tell you the plain truth of how things stood with me
 then. My mother, as you remember, was at the head of the business, but
 she was absolutely without any business ability whatever. I was
 hurriedly summoned home from Paris; times were critical, and they
 relied on me to set things straight. What did I find? I found--and you
 must keep this a profound secret--a house on the brink of ruin. Yes--as
 good as on the brink of ruin, this old respected house which had seen
 three generations of us. What else could I--the son, the only son--do
 than look about for some means of saving it?
 
 Lona: And so you saved the house of Bernick at the cost of a woman.
 
 Bernick: You know quite well that Betty was in love with me.
 
 Lona: But what about me?
 
 Bernick: Believe me, Lona, you would never have been happy with me.
 
 Lona: Was it out of consideration for my happiness that you sacrificed
 me?
 
 Bernick: Do you suppose I acted as I did from selfish motives? If I had
 stood alone then, I would have begun all over again with cheerful
 courage. But you do not understand how the life of a man of business,
 with his tremendous responsibilities, is bound up with that of the
 business which falls to his inheritance. Do you realise that the
 prosperity or the ruin of hundreds--of thousands--depends on him? Can
 you not take into consideration the fact that the whole community in
 which both you and I were born would have been affected to the most
 dangerous extent if the house of Bernick had gone to smash?
 
 Lon: Then is it for the sake of the community that you have maintained
 your position these fifteen years upon a lie?
 
 Bernick: Upon a lie?
 
 Lona: What does Betty know of all this...that underlies her union with
 you?
 
 Bernick: Do you suppose that I would hurt her feelings to no purpose by
 disclosing the truth?
 
 Lona: To no purpose, you say? Well, well--You are a man of business;
 you ought to understand what is to the purpose. But listen to me,
 Karsten--I am going to speak the plain truth now. Tell me, are you
 really happy?
 
 Bernick: In my family life, do you mean?
 
 Lona: Yes.
 
 Bernick: I am, Lona. You have not been a self-sacrificing friend to me
 in vain. I can honestly say that I have grown happier every year. Betty
 is good and willing; and if I were to tell you how, in the course of
 years, she has learned to model her character on the lines of my own--
 
 Lona: Hm!
 
 Bernick: At first, of course, she had a whole lot of romantic notions
 about love; she could not reconcile herself to the idea that, little by
 little, it must change into a quiet comradeship.
 
 Lona: But now she is quite reconciled to that?
 
 Bernick: Absolutely. As you can imagine, daily intercourse with me has
 had no small share in developing her character. Every one, in their
 degree, has to learn to lower their own pretensions, if they are to
 live worthily of the community to which they belong. And Betty, in her
 turn, has gradually learned to understand this; and that is why our
 home is now a model to our fellow citizens.
 
 Lona: But your fellow citizens know nothing about the lie?
 
 Bernick: The lie?
 
 Lona: Yes--the lie you have persisted in for these fifteen years.
 
 Bernick: Do you mean to say that you call that--?
 
 Lona: I call it a lie--a threefold lie: first of all, there is the lie
 towards me; then, the lie towards Betty; and then, the lie towards
 Johan.
 
 Bernick: Betty has never asked me to speak.
 
 Lona: Because she has known nothing.
 
 Bernick: And you will not demand it--out of consideration for her.
 
 Lona: Oh, no--I shall manage to put up with their gibes well enough; I
 have broad shoulders.
 
 Bernick: And Johan will not demand it either; he has promised me that.
 
 Lona: But you yourself, Karsten? Do you feel within yourself no impulse
 urging you to shake yourself free of this lie?
 
 Bernick: Do you suppose that of my own free will I would sacrifice my
 family happiness and my position in the world?
 
 Lona: What right have you to the position you hold?
 
 Bernick: Every day during these fifteen years I have earned some little
 right to it--by my conduct, and by what I have achieved by my work.
 
 Lona: True, you have achieved a great deal by your work, for yourself
 as well as for others. You are the richest and most influential man in
 the town; nobody in it dares do otherwise than defer to your will,
 because you are looked upon as a man without spot or blemish; your home
 is regarded as a model home, and your conduct as a model of conduct.
 But all this grandeur, and you with it, is founded on a treacherous
 morass. A moment may come and a word may be spoken, when you and all
 your grandeur will be engulfed in the morass, if you do not save
 yourself in time.
 
 Bernick: Lona--what is your object in coming here?
 
 Lona: I want to help you to get firm ground under your feet, Karsten.
 
 Bernick: Revenge!--you want to revenge yourself! I suspected it. But
 you won't succeed! There is only one person here that can speak with
 authority, and he will be silent.
 
 Lona: You mean Johan?
 
 Bernick: Yes, Johan. If any one else accuses me, I shall deny
 everything. If any one tries to crush me, I shall fight for my life.
 But you will never succeed in that, let me tell you! The one who could
 strike me down will say nothing--and is going away.
 
 (RUMMEL and VIGELAND come in from the right.)
 
 Rummel: Good morning, my dear Bernick, good morning. You must come up
 with us to the Commercial Association. There is a meeting about the
 railway scheme, you know.
 
 Bernick: I cannot. It is impossible just now.
 
 Vigeland: You really must, Mr. Bernick.
 
 Rummel: Bernick, you must. There is an opposition to us on foot.
 Hammer, and the rest of those who believe in a line along the coast,
 are declaring that private interests are at the back of the new
 proposals.
 
 Bernick: Well then, explain to them--
 
 Vigeland: Our explanations have no effect, Mr. Bernick.
 
 Rummel: No, no, you must come yourself. Naturally, no one would dare to
 suspect you of such duplicity.
 
 Lona: I should think not.
 
 Bernick: I cannot, I tell you; I am not well. Or, at all events,
 wait--let me pull myself together. (RORLUND comes in from the right.)
 
 Rorlund: Excuse me, Mr. Bernick, but I am terribly upset.
 
 Bernick: Why, what is the matter with you?
 
 Rorlund. I must put a question to you, Mr. Bernick. Is it with your
 consent that the young girl who has found a shelter under your roof
 shows herself in the open street in the company of a person who--
 
 Lona: What person, Mr. Parson?
 
 Rorlund: With the person from whom, of all others in the world, she
 ought to be kept farthest apart!
 
 Lona: Ha! ha!
 
 Rorlund: Is it with your consent, Mr. Bernick?
 
 Bernick (looking for his hat and gloves). I know nothing about it. You
 must excuse me; I am in a great hurry. I am due at the Commercial
 Association.
 
 (HILMAR comes up from the garden and goes over to the farther door on
 the left.)
 
 Hilmar: Betty--Betty, I want to speak to you.
 
 Mrs. Bernick (coming to the door): What is it?
 
 Hilmar: You ought to go down into the garden and put a stop to the
 flirtation that is going on between a certain person and Dina Dorf! It
 has quite got on my nerves to listen to them.
 
 Lona: Indeed! And what has the certain person been saying?
 
 Hilmar: Oh, only that he wishes she would go off to America with him.
 Ugh!
 
 Rorlund: Is it possible?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: What do you say?
 
 Lona: But that would be perfectly splendid!
 
 Bernick: Impossible! You cannot have heard right.
 
 Hilmar: Ask him yourself, then. Here comes the pair of them. Only,
 leave me out of it, please.
 
 Bernick (to RUMMEL and VIGELAND): I will follow you--in a moment.
 (RUMMEL and VIGELAND go out to the right. JOHAN and DINA come up from
 the garden.)
 
 Johan: Hurrah, Lona, she is going with us!
 
 Mrs. Bernick: But, Johan--are you out of your senses?
 
 Rorlund: Can I believe my ears! Such an atrocious scandal! By what arts
 of seduction have you--?
 
 Johan: Come, come, sir--what are you saying?
 
 Rorlund: Answer me, Dina; do you mean to do this--entirely of your own
 free will?
 
 Dina: I must get away from here.
 
 Rorlund: But with him!--with him!
 
 Dina: Can you tell me of any one else here who would have the courage
 to take me with him?
 
 Rorlund: Very well, then--you shall learn who he is.
 
 Johan: Do not speak!
 
 Bernick: Not a word more!
 
 Rorlund: If I did not, I should be unworthy to serve a community of
 whose morals I have been appointed a guardian, and should be acting
 most unjustifiably towards this young girl, in whose upbringing I have
 taken a material part, and who is to me--
 
 Johan: Take care what you are doing!
 
 Rorlund: She shall know! Dina, this is the man who was the cause of all
 your mother's misery and shame.
 
 Bernick: Mr. Rorlund--?
 
 Dina:  He! (TO JOHAN.) Is this true?
 
 Johan: Karsten, you answer.
 
 Bernick: Not a word more! Do not let us say another word about it today.
 
 Dina: Then it is true.
 
 Rorlund: Yes, it is true. And more than that, this fellow--whom you
 were going to trust--did not run away from home empty-handed; ask him
 about old Mrs. Bernick's cash-box.... Mr. Bernick can bear witness to
 that!
 
 Lona: Liar
 
 Bernick: Ah!
 
 Mrs. Bernick: My God! my God!
 
 Johan (rushing at RORLUND with uplifted arm): And you dare to--
 
 Lona (restraining him): Do not strike him, Johan!
 
 Rorlund: That is right, assault me! But the truth will out; and it is
 the truth--Mr. Bernick has admitted it--and the whole town knows it.
 Now, Dina, you know him. (A short silence.)
 
 Johan (softly, grasping BERNICK by the arm): Karsten, Karsten, what
 have you done?
 
 Mrs. Bernick (in tears): Oh, Karsten, to think that I should have mixed
 you up in all this disgrace!
 
 Sandstad (coming in hurriedly from the right, and calling out, with his
 hand still on the door-handle): You positively must come now, Mr.
 Bernick. The fate of the whole railway is hanging by a thread.
 
 Bernick (abstractedly): What is it? What have I to--
 
 Lona (earnestly and with emphasis): You have to go and be a pillar of
 society, brother-in-law.
 
 Sandstad: Yes, come along; we need the full weight of your moral
 excellence on our side.
 
 Johan (aside, to BERNICK): Karsten, we will have a talk about this
 tomorrow. (Goes out through the garden. BERNICK, looking half dazed,
 goes out to the right with SANDSTAD.)
 
 
 
 
 ACT III
 
 
 (SCENE--The same room. BERNICK, with a cane in his hand and evidently
 in a great rage, comes out of the farther room on the left, leaving the
 door half-open behind him.)
 
 Bernick (speaking to his wife, who is in the other room): There! I have
 given it him in earnest now; I don't think he will forget that
 thrashing! What do you say?--And I say that you are an injudicious
 mother! You make excuses for him, and countenance any sort of rascality
 on his part--Not rascality? What do you call it, then? Slipping out of
 the house at night, going out in a fishing boat, staying away till well
 on in the day, and giving me such a horrible fright when I have so much
 to worry me! And then the young scamp has the audacity to threaten that
 he will run away! Just let him try it!--You? No, very likely; you don't
 trouble yourself much about what happens to him. I really believe that
 if he were to get killed--! Oh, really? Well, I have work to leave
 behind me in the world; I have no fancy for being left childless--Now,
 do not raise objections, Betty; it shall be as I say--he is confined to
 the house. (Listens.) Hush; do not let any one notice anything. (KRAP
 comes in from the right.)
 
 Krap: Can you spare me a moment, Mr. Bernick?
 
 Bernick (throwing away the cane): Certainly, certainly. Have you come
 from the yard?
 
 Krap: Yes. Ahem--!
 
 Bernick: Well? Nothing wrong with the "Palm Tree," I hope?
 
 Krap: The "Palm Tree" can sail tomorrow, but
 
 Bernick: It is the "Indian Girl," then? I had a suspicion that that
 obstinate fellow--
 
 Krap: The "Indian Girl" can sail tomorrow, too; but I am sure she will
 not get very far.
 
 Bernick: What do you mean?
 
 Krap: Excuse me, sir; that door is standing ajar, and I think there is
 some one in the other room--
 
 Bernick (shutting the door): There, then! But what is this that no one
 else must hear?
 
 Krap: Just this--that I believe Aune intends to let the "Indian Girl"
 go to the bottom with every mother's son on board.
 
 Bernick: Good God!--what makes you think that?
 
 Krap: I cannot account for it any other way, sir.
 
 Bernick: Well, tell me as briefly as you can
 
 Krap: I will. You know yourself how slowly the work has gone on in the
 yard since we got the new machines and the new inexperienced hands?
 
 Bernick: Yes, yes.
 
 Krap: But this morning, when I went down there, I noticed that the
 repairs to the American boat had made extraordinary progress; the great
 hole in the bottom--the rotten patch, you know--
 
 Bernick: Yes, yes--what about it?
 
 Krap: Was completely repaired--to all appearance at any rate, covered
 up--looked as good as new. I heard that Aune himself had been working
 at it by lantern light the whole night.
 
 Bernick: Yes, yes--well?
 
 Krap: I turned it over in my head for a bit; the hands were away at
 their breakfast, so I found an opportunity to have a look around the
 boat, both outside and in, without anyone seeing me. I had a job to get
 down to the bottom through the cargo, but I learned the truth. There is
 something very suspicious going on, Mr. Bernick.
 
 Bernick: I cannot believe it, Krap. I cannot and will not believe such
 a thing of Aune.
 
 Krap: I am very sorry--but it is the simple truth. Something very
 suspicious is going on. No new timbers put in, as far as I could see,
 only stopped up and tinkered at, and covered over with sailcloth and
 tarpaulins and that sort of thing--an absolute fraud. The "Indian Girl"
 will never get to New York; she will go to the bottom like a cracked
 pot.
 
 Bernick: This is most horrible! But what can be his object, do you
 suppose?
 
 Krap: Probably he wants to bring the machines into discredit--wants to
 take his revenge--wants to force you to take the old hands on again.
 
 Bernick: And to do this he is willing to sacrifice the lives of all on
 board.
 
 Krap: He said the other day that there were no men on board the "Indian
 Girl"--only wild beasts.
 
 Bernick: Yes, but--apart from that--has he no regard for the great loss
 of capital it would mean?
 
 Krap: Aune does not look upon capital with a very friendly eye, Mr.
 Bernick.
 
 Bernick: That is perfectly true; he is an agitator and a fomenter of
 discontent; but such an unscrupulous thing as this--Look here, Krap;
 you must look into the matter once more. Not a word of it to any one.
 The blame will fall on our yard if any one hears anything of it.
 
 Krap: Of course, but--
 
 Bernick: When the hands are away at their dinner you must manage to get
 down there again; I must have absolute certainty about it.
 
 Krap: You shall, sir; but, excuse me, what do you propose to do?
 
 Bernick: Report the affair, naturally. We cannot, of course, let
 ourselves become accomplices in such a crime. I could not have such a
 thing on my conscience. Moreover, it will make a good impression, both
 on the press and on the public in general, if it is seen that I set all
 personal interests aside and let justice take its course.
 
 Krap: Quite true, Mr. Bernick.
 
 Bernick: But first of all I must be absolutely certain. And meanwhile,
 do not breathe a word of it.
 
 Krap: Not a word, sir. And you shall have your certainty. (Goes out
 through the garden and down the street.)
 
 Bernick (half aloud): Shocking!--But no, it is impossible!
 Inconceivable!
 
 (As he turns to go into his room, HILMAR comes in from the right.)
 
 Hilmar: Good morning, Karsten. Let me congratulate you on your triumph
 at the Commercial Association yesterday.
 
 Bernick: Thank you.
 
 Hilmar: It was a brilliant triumph, I hear; the triumph of intelligent
 public spirit over selfishness and prejudice--something like a raid of
 French troops on the Kabyles. It is astonishing that after that
 unpleasant scene here, you could--
 
 Bernick: Yes, yes--quite so.
 
 Hilmar: But the decisive battle has not been fought yet.
 
 Bernick: In the matter of the railway, do you mean?
 
 Hilmar: Yes; I suppose you know the trouble that Hammer is brewing?
 
 Bernick (anxiously): No, what is that?
 
 Hilmar: Oh, he is greatly taken up with the rumour that is going
 around, and is preparing to dish up an article about it.
 
 Bernick: What rumour?
 
 Hilmar: About the extensive purchase of property along the branch line,
 of course.
 
 Bernick: What? Is there such a rumour as that going about?
 
 Hilmar: It is all over the town. I heard it at the club when I looked
 in there. They say that one of our lawyers has quietly bought up, on
 commission, all the forest land, all the mining land, all the
 waterfalls--
 
 Bernick: Don't they say whom it was for?
 
 Hilmar: At the club they thought it must be for some company, not
 connected with this town, that has got a hint of the scheme you have in
 hand, and has made haste to buy before the price of these properties
 went up. Isn't it villainous?--ugh!
 
 Bernick: Villainous?
 
 Hilmar: Yes, to have strangers putting their fingers into our pie--and
 one of our own local lawyers lending himself to such a thing! And now
 it will be outsiders that will get all the profits!
 
 Bernick: But, after all, it is only an idle rumour.
 
 Hilmar: Meanwhile people are believing it, and tomorrow or the next
 day, I have no doubt Hammer will nail it to the counter as a fact.
 There is a general sense of exasperation in the town already. I heard
 several people say that if the rumour were confirmed they would take
 their names off the subscription lists.
 
 Bernick: Impossible!
 
 Hilmar: Is it? Why do you suppose these mercenary-minded creatures were
 so willing to go into the undertaking with you? Don't you suppose they
 have scented profit for themselves--
 
 Bernick: It is impossible, I am sure; there is so much public spirit in
 our little community--
 
 Hilmar: In our community? Of course you are a confirmed optimist, and
 so you judge others by yourself. But I, who am a tolerably experienced
 observer--! There isn't a single soul in the place--excepting
 ourselves, of course--not a single soul in the place who holds up the
 banner of the Ideal. (Goes towards the verandah.) Ugh, I can see them
 there--
 
 Bernick: See whom?
 
 Hilmar: Our two friends from America. (Looks out to the right.) And who
 is that they are walking with? As I am alive, if it is not the captain
 of the "Indian Girl." Ugh!
 
 Bernick: What can they want with him?
 
 Hilmar. Oh, he is just the right company for them. He looks as if he
 had been a slave-dealer or a pirate; and who knows what the other two
 may have been doing all these years.
 
 Bernick: Let me tell you that it is grossly unjust to think such things
 about them.
 
 Hilmar: Yes--you are an optimist. But here they are, bearing down upon
 us again; so I will get away while there is time. (Goes towards the
 door on the left. LONA comes in from the right.)
 
 Lona: Oh, Hilmar, am I driving you away?
 
 Hilmar: Not at all; I am in rather a hurry; I want to have a word with
 Betty. (Goes into the farthest room on the left.)
 
 Bernick (after a moment's silence): Well, Lona?
 
 Lona: Yes?
 
 Bernick: What do you think of me today?
 
 Lona: The same as I did yesterday. A lie more or less--
 
 Bernick: I must enlighten you about it. Where has Johan gone?
 
 Lona: He is coming; he had to see a man first.
 
 Bernick: After what you heard yesterday, you will understand that my
 whole life will be ruined if the truth comes to light.
 
 Lona: I can understand that.
 
 Bernick: Of course, it stands to reason that I was not guilty of the
 crime there was so much talk about here.
 
 Lona: That stands to reason. But who was the thief?
 
 Bernick: There was no thief. There was no money stolen--not a penny.
 
 Lona: How is that?
 
 Bernick: Not a penny, I tell you.
 
 Lona: But those rumours? How did that shameful rumour get about that
 Johan--
 
 Bernick: Lona, I think I can speak to you as I could to no one else. I
 will conceal nothing from you. I was partly to blame for spreading the
 rumour.
 
 Lona: You? You could act in that way towards a man who for your sake--!
 
 Bernick: Do not condemn me without bearing in mind how things stood at
 that time. I told you about it yesterday. I came home and found my
 mother involved in a mesh of injudicious undertakings; we had all
 manner of bad luck--it seemed as if misfortunes were raining upon us,
 and our house was on the verge of ruin. I was half reckless and half in
 despair. Lona, I believe it was mainly to deaden my thoughts that I let
 myself drift into that entanglement that ended in Johan's going away.
 
 Lona: Hm--
 
 Bernick: You can well imagine how every kind of rumour was set on foot
 after you and he had gone. People began to say that it was not his
 first piece of folly--that Dorf had received a large sum of money to
 hold his tongue and go away; other people said that she had received
 it. At the same time it was obvious that our house was finding it
 difficult to meet its obligations. What was more natural than that
 scandal-mongers should find some connection between these two rumours?
 And as the woman remained here, living in poverty, people declared that
 he had taken the money with him to America; and every time rumour
 mentioned the sum, it grew larger.
 
 Lona: And you, Karsten--?
 
 Bernick: I grasped at the rumour like a drowning man at a straw.
 
 Lona: You helped to spread it?
 
 Bernick: I did not contradict it. Our creditors had begun to be
 pressing, and I had the task of keeping them quiet. The result was the
 dissipating of any suspicion as to the stability of the firm; people
 said that we had been hit by a temporary piece of ill-luck--that all
 that was necessary was that they should not press us--only give us time
 and every creditor would be paid in full.
 
 Lona: And every creditor was paid in full?
 
 Bernick: Yes, Lona, that rumour saved our house and made me the man I
 now am.
 
 Lona: That is to say, a lie has made you the man you now are.
 
 Bernick: Whom did it injure at the time? It was Johan's intention never
 to come back.
 
 Lona: You ask whom it injured. Look into your own heart, and tell me if
 it has not injured you.
 
 Bernick: Look into any man's heart you please, and you will always
 find, in every one, at least one black spot which he has to keep
 concealed.
 
 Lona: And you call yourselves pillars of society!
 
 Bernick: Society has none better.
 
 Lona: And of what consequence is it whether such a society be propped
 up or not? What does it all consist of? Show and lies--and nothing
 else. Here are you, the first man in the town, living in grandeur and
 luxury, powerful and respected--you, who have branded an innocent man
 as a criminal.
 
 Bernick: Do you suppose I am not deeply conscious of the wrong I have
 done him? And do you suppose I am not ready to make amends to him for
 it?
 
 Lona: How? By speaking out?
 
 Bernick: Would you have the heart to insist on that?
 
 Lona: What else can make amends for such a wrong?
 
 Bernick: I am rich, Lona; Johan can demand any sum he pleases.
 
 Lona: Yes, offer him money, and you will hear what he will say.
 
 Bernick: Do you know what he intends to do?
 
 Lona: No; since yesterday he has been dumb. He looks as if this had
 made a grown man of him all at once.
 
 Bernick: I must talk to him.
 
 Lona: Here he comes. (JOHAN comes in from the right.)
 
 Bernick (going towards hint): Johan--!
 
 Johan (motioning him away): Listen to me first. Yesterday morning I
 gave you my word that I would hold my tongue.
 
 Bernick: You did.
 
 Johan: But then I did not know--
 
 Bernick: Johan, only let me say a word or two to explain the
 circumstances--
 
 Johan: It is unnecessary; I understand the circumstances perfectly. The
 firm was in a dangerous position at the time; I had gone off, and you
 had my defenceless name and reputation at your mercy. Well, I do not
 blame you so very much for what you did; we were young and thoughtless
 in those days. But now I have need of the truth, and now you must speak.
 
 Bernick: And just now I have need of all my reputation for morality,
 and therefore I cannot speak.
 
 Johan: I don't take much account of the false reports you spread about
 me; it is the other thing that you must take the blame of. I shall make
 Dina my wife, and here--here in your town--I mean to settle down and
 live with her.
 
 Lona: Is that what you mean to do?
 
 Bernick: With Dina? Dina as your wife?--in this town?
 
 Johan: Yes, here and nowhere else. I mean to stay here to defy all
 these liars and slanderers. But before I can win her, you must
 exonerate me.
 
 Bernick: Have you considered that, if I confess to the one thing, it
 will inevitably mean making myself responsible for the other as well?
 You will say that I can show by our books that nothing dishonest
 happened? But I cannot; our books were not so accurately kept in those
 days. And even if I could, what good would it do? Should I not in any
 case be pointed at as the man who had once saved himself by an untruth,
 and for fifteen years had allowed that untruth and all its consequences
 to stand without having raised a finger to demolish it? You do not know
 our community very much, or you would realise that it would ruin me
 utterly.
 
 Johan: I can only tell you that I mean to make Mrs. Dorf's daughter my
 wife, and live with her in this town.
 
 Bernick (wiping the perspiration from his forehead): Listen to me,
 Johan--and you too, Lona. The circumstances I am in just now are quite
 exceptional. I am situated in such a way that if you aim this blow at
 me you will not only destroy me, but will also destroy a great future,
 rich in blessings, that lies before the community which, after all, was
 the home of your childhood.
 
 Johan: And if I do not aim this blow at you, I shall be destroying all
 my future happiness with my own hand.
 
 Lona: Go on, Karsten.
 
 Bernick: I will tell you, then. It is mixed up with the railway
 project, and the whole thing is not quite so simple as you think. I
 suppose you have heard that last year there was some talk of a railway
 line along the coast? Many influential people backed up the
 idea--people in the town and the suburbs, and especially the press; but
 I managed to get the proposal quashed, on the ground that it would have
 injured our steamboat trade along the coast.
 
 Lona: Have you any interest in the steamboat trade?
 
 Bernick: Yes. But no one ventured to suspect me on that account; my
 honoured name fully protected me from that. For the matter of that, I
 could have stood the loss; but the place could not have stood it. So
 the inland line was decided upon. As soon as that was done, I assured
 myself--without saying anything about it--that a branch line could be
 laid to the town.
 
 Lona: Why did you say nothing about it, Karsten?
 
 Bernick: Have you heard the rumours of extensive buying up of forest
 lands, mines and waterfalls--?
 
 Johan: Yes, apparently it is some company from another part of the
 country.
 
 Bernick: As these properties are situated at present, they are as good
 as valueless to their owners, who are scattered about the
 neighbourhood; they have therefore been sold comparatively cheap. If
 the purchaser had waited till the branch line began to be talked of,
 the proprietors would have asked exorbitant prices.
 
 Lona: Well--what then?
 
 Bernick: Now I am going to tell you something that can be construed in
 different ways--a thing to which, in our community, a man could only
 confess provided he had an untarnished and honoured name to take his
 stand upon.
 
 Lona: Well?
 
 Bernick: It is I that have bought up the whole of them.
 
 Lona: You?
 
 Johan: On your own account?
 
 Bernick: On my own account. If the branch line becomes an accomplished
 fact, I am a millionaire; if it does not, I am ruined.
 
 Lona: It is a big risk, Karsten.
 
 Bernick: I have risked my whole fortune on it.
 
 Lona: I am not thinking of your fortune; but if it comes to light that--
 
 Bernick. Yes, that is the critical part of it. With the unblemished and
 honoured name I have hitherto borne, I can take the whole thing upon my
 shoulders, carry it through, and say to my fellow-citizens: "See, I
 have taken this risk for the good of the community."
 
 Lona: Of the community?
 
 Bernick: Yes; and not a soul will doubt my motives.
 
 Lona: Then some of those concerned in it have acted more
 openly--without any secret motives or considerations.
 
 Bernick: Who?
 
 Lona: Why, of course, Rummel and Sandstad and Vigeland.
 
 Bernick: To get them on my side I was obliged to let them into the
 secret.
 
 Lona: And they?
 
 Bernick: They have stipulated for a fifth part of the profits as their
 share.
 
 Lona: Oh, these pillars of society.
 
 Bernick: And isn't it society itself that forces us to use these
 underhanded means? What would have happened if I had not acted
 secretly? Everybody would have wanted to have a hand in the
 undertaking; the whole thing would have been divided up, mismanaged and
 bungled. There is not a single man in the town except myself who is
 capable of directing so big an affair as this will be. In this country,
 almost without exception, it is only foreigners who have settled here
 who have the aptitude for big business schemes. That is the reason why
 my conscience acquits me in the matter. It is only in my hands that
 these properties can become a real blessing to the many who have to
 make their daily bread.
 
 Lona: I believe you are right there, Karsten.
 
 Johan: But I have no concern with the many, and my life's happiness is
 at stake.
 
 Bernick: The welfare of your native place is also at stake. If things
 come out which cast reflections on my earlier conduct, then all my
 opponents will fall upon me with united vigour. A youthful folly is
 never allowed to be forgotten in our community. They would go through
 the whole of my previous life, bring up a thousand little incidents in
 it, interpret and explain them in the light of what has been revealed;
 they would crush me under the weight of rumours and slanders. I should
 be obliged to abandon the railway scheme; and, if I take my hand off
 that, it will come to nothing, and I shall be ruined and my life as a
 citizen will be over.
 
 Lona: Johan, after what we have just heard, you must go away from here
 and hold your tongue.
 
 Bernick: Yes, yes, Johan--you must!
 
 Johan: Yes, I will go away, and I will hold my tongue; but I shall come
 back, and then I shall speak.
 
 Bernick: Stay over there, Johan; hold your tongue, and I am willing to
 share with you--
 
 Johan: Keep your money, but give me back my name and reputation.
 
 Bernick: And sacrifice my own!
 
 Johan: You and your community must get out of that the best way you
 can. I must and shall win Dina for my wife. And therefore, I am going
 to sail tomorrow in the "Indian Girl"--
 
 Bernick: In the "Indian Girl"?
 
 Johan: Yes. The captain has promised to take me. I shall go over to
 America, as I say; I shall sell my farm, and set my affairs in order.
 In two months I shall be back.
 
 Bernick: And then you will speak?
 
 Johan: Then the guilty man must take his guilt on himself.
 
 Bernick: Have you forgotten that, if I do that, I must also take on
 myself guilt that is not mine?
 
 Johan: Who is it that for the last fifteen years has benefited by that
 shameful rumour?
 
 Bernick: You will drive me to desperation! Well, if you speak, I shall
 deny everything! I shall say it is a plot against me--that you have
 come here to blackmail me!
 
 Lona: For shame, Karsten!
 
 Bernick: I am a desperate man, I tell you, and I shall fight for my
 life. I shall deny everything--everything!
 
 Johan: I have your two letters. I found them in my box among my other
 papers. This morning I read them again; they are plain enough.
 
 Bernick: And will you make them public?
 
 Johan: If it becomes necessary.
 
 Bernick: And you will be back here in two months?
 
 Johan: I hope so. The wind is fair. In three weeks I shall be in New
 York--if the "Indian Girl" does not go to the bottom.
 
 Bernick (with a start): Go to the bottom? Why should the "Indian Girl"
 go to the bottom?
 
 Johan: Quite so--why should she?
 
 Bernick (scarcely audibly): Go to the bottom?
 
 Johan: Well, Karsten, now you know what is before you. You must find
 your own way out. Good-bye! You can say good-bye to Betty for me,
 although she has not treated me like a sister. But I must see Martha.
 She shall tell Dina---; she shall promise me--(Goes out through the
 farther door on the left.)
 
 Bernick (to himself): The "Indian Girl"--? (Quickly.)  Lona, you must
 prevent that!
 
 Lona: You see for yourself, Karsten--I have no influence over him any
 longer. (Follows JOHAN into the other room.)
 
 Bernick (a prey to uneasy thoughts): Go to the bottom--?
 
 (AUNE comes in from the right.)
 
 Aune: Excuse me, sir, but if it is convenient--
 
 Bernick (turning round angrily): What do you want?
 
 Aune: To know if I may ask you a question, sir.
 
 Bernick: Be quick about it, then. What is it?
 
 Aune: I wanted to ask if I am to consider it as certain--absolutely
 certain--that I should be dismissed from the yard if the "Indian Girl"
 were not ready to sail tomorrow?
 
 Bernick: What do you mean? The ship is ready to sail?
 
 Aune: Yes--it is. But suppose it were not, should I be discharged?
 
 Bernick: What is the use of asking such idle questions?
 
 Aune: Only that I should like to know, sir. Will you answer me
 that?--should I be discharged?
 
 Bernick: Am I in the habit of keeping my word or not?
 
 Aune: Then tomorrow I should have lost the position I hold in my house
 and among those near and dear to me--lost my influence over men of my
 own class--lost all opportunity of doing anything for the cause of the
 poorer and needier members of the community?
 
 Bernick: Aune, we have discussed all that before.
 
 Aune: Quite so--then the "Indian Girl" will sail.
 
 (A short silence.)
 
 Bernick: Look here--it is impossible for me to have my eyes
 everywhere--I cannot be answerable for everything. You can give me your
 assurance, I suppose, that the repairs have been satisfactorily carried
 out?
 
 Aune: You gave me very short grace, Mr. Bernick.
 
 Bernick: But I understand you to warrant the repairs?
 
 Aune: The weather is fine, and it is summer.
 
 (Another pause.)
 
 Bernick: Have you anything else to say to me?
 
 Aune: I think not, sir.
 
 Bernick: Then--the "Indian Girl" will sail...
 
 Aune: Tomorrow?
 
 Bernick: Yes.
 
 Aune: Very good. (Bows and goes out. BERNICK stands for a moment
 irresolute; then walks quickly towards the door, as if to call AUNE
 back; but stops, hesitatingly, with his hand on the door-handle. At
 that moment the door is opened from without, and KRAP comes in.)
 
 Krap (in a low voice): Aha, he has been here. Has he confessed?
 
 Bernick: Hm--; have you discovered anything?
 
 Krap: What need of that, sir? Could you not see the evil conscience
 looking out of the man's eyes?
 
 Bernick: Nonsense--such things don't show. Have you discovered
 anything, I want to know?
 
 Krap: I could not manage it; I was too late. They had already begun
 hauling the ship out of the dock. But their very haste in doing that
 plainly shows that--
 
 Bernick: It shows nothing. Has the inspection taken place, then?
 
 Krap: Of course; but--
 
 Bernick: There, you see! And of course they found nothing to complain
 of?
 
 Krap: Mr. Bernick, you know very well how much this inspection means,
 especially in a yard that has such a good name as ours has.
 
 Bernick: No matter--it takes all responsibility off us.
 
 Krap: But, sir, could you really not tell from Aune's manner that--?
 
 Bernick: Aune has completely reassured me, let me tell you.
 
 Krap: And let me tell you, sir, that I am morally certain that--
 
 Bernick: What does this mean, Krap? I see plainly enough that you want
 to get your knife into this man; but if you want to attack him, you
 must find some other occasion. You know how important it is to me--or,
 I should say, to the owners--that the "Indian Girl" should sail
 to-morrow.
 
 Krap: Very well--so be it; but if ever we hear of that ship again--hm!
 
 (VIGELAND comes in from the right.)
 
 Vigeland: I wish you a very good morning, Mr. Bernick. Have you a
 moment to spare?
 
 Bernick: At your service, Mr. Vigeland.
 
 Vigeland: I only want to know if you are also of opinion that the "Palm
 Tree" should sail tomorrow?
 
 Bernick: Certainly; I thought that was quite settled.
 
 Vigeland: Well, the captain came to me just now and told me that storm
 signals have been hoisted.
 
 Bernick: Oh! Are we to expect a storm?
 
 Vigeland: A stiff breeze, at all events; but not a contrary wind--just
 the opposite.
 
 Bernick: Hm--well, what do you say?
 
 Vigeland: I say, as I said to the captain, that the "Palm Tree" is in
 the hands of Providence. Besides, they are only going across the North
 Sea at first; and in England, freights are running tolerably high just
 now, so that--
 
 Bernick: Yes, it would probably mean a loss for us if we waited.
 
 Vigeland: Besides, she is a stout ship, and fully insured as well. It
 is more risky, now, for the "Indian Girl"--
 
 Bernick: What do you mean?
 
 Vigeland: She sails tomorrow, too.
 
 Bernick: Yes, the owners have been in such a hurry, and, besides--
 
 Vigeland:  Well, if that old hulk can venture out--and with such a
 crew, into the bargain--it would be a disgrace to us if we--
 
 Bernick: Quite so. I presume you have the ship's papers with you.
 
 Vigeland: Yes, here they are.
 
 Bernick: Good; then will you go in with Mr. Krap?
 
 Krap: Will you come in here, sir, and we will dispose of them at once.
 
 Vigeland: Thank you.--And the issue we leave in the hands of the
 Almighty, Mr. Bernick. (Goes with KRAP into BERNICK'S room. RORLUND
 comes up from the garden.)
 
 Rorlund:  At home at this time of day, Mr. Bernick?
 
 Bernick (lost in thought): As you see.
 
 Rorlund: It was really on your wife's account I came. I thought she
 might be in need of a word of comfort.
 
 Bernick: Very likely she is. But I want to have a little talk with you,
 too.
 
 Rorlund: With the greatest of pleasure, Mr. Bernick. But what is the
 matter with you? You look quite pale and upset.
 
 Bernick: Really? Do I? Well, what else could you expect--a man so
 loaded with responsibilities as I am? There is all my own big
 business--and now the planning of this railway.--But tell me something,
 Mr. Rorlund, let me put a question to you.
 
 Rorlund: With pleasure, Mr. Bernick.
 
 Bernick: It is about a thought that has occurred to me. Suppose a man
 is face to face with an undertaking which will concern the welfare of
 thousands, and suppose it should be necessary to make a sacrifice of
 one--?
 
 Rorlund: What do you mean?
 
 Bernick: For example, suppose a man were thinking of starting a large
 factory. He knows for certain--because all his experience has taught
 him so--that sooner or later a toll of human life will be exacted in
 the working of that factory.
 
 Rorlund: Yes, that is only too probable.
 
 Bernick: Or, say a man embarks on a mining enterprise. He takes into
 his service fathers of families and young men in the first flush of
 their youth. Is it not quite safe to predict that all of them will not
 come out of it alive?
 
 Rorlund: Yes, unhappily that is quite true.
 
 Bernick: Well--a man in that position will know beforehand that the
 undertaking he proposes to start must undoubtedly, at some time or
 other, mean a loss of human life. But the undertaking itself is for the
 public good; for every man's life that it costs, it will undoubtedly
 promote the welfare of many hundreds.
 
 Rorlund: Ah, you are thinking of the railway--of all the dangerous
 excavating and blasting, and that sort of thing--
 
 Bernick: Yes--quite so--I am thinking of the railway. And, besides, the
 coming of the railway will mean the starting of factories and mines.
 But do not think, nevertheless--
 
 Rorlund: My dear Mr. Bernick, you are almost over-conscientious. What I
 think is that, if you place the affair in the hands of Providence--
 
 Bernick: Yes--exactly; Providence--
 
 Rorlund: You are blameless in the matter. Go on and build your railway
 hopefully.
 
 Bernick: Yes, but now I will put a special instance to you. Suppose a
 charge of blasting-powder had to be exploded in a dangerous place, and
 that unless it were exploded the line could not be constructed? Suppose
 the engineer knew that it would cost the life of the workman who lit
 the fuse, but that it had to be lit, and that it was the engineer's
 duty to send a workman to do it?
 
 Rorlund: Hm--
 
 Bernick: I know what you will say. It would be a splendid thing if the
 engineer took the match himself and went and lit the fuse. But that is
 out of the question, so he must sacrifice a workman.
 
 Rorlund: That is a thing no engineer here would ever do.
 
 Bernick: No engineer in the bigger countries would think twice about
 doing it.
 
 Rorlund: In the bigger countries? No, I can quite believe it. In those
 depraved and unprincipled communities.
 
 Bernick: Oh, there is a good deal to be said for those communities.
 
 Rorlund: Can you say that?--you, who yourself--
 
 Bernick: In the bigger communities a man finds space to carry out a
 valuable project--finds the courage to make some sacrifice in a great
 cause; but here, a man is cramped by all kinds of petty considerations
 and scruples.
 
 Rorlund: Is human life a petty consideration?
 
 Bernick: When that human life threatens the welfare of thousands.
 
 Rorlund: But you are suggesting cases that are quite inconceivable, Mr.
 Bernick! I do not understand you at all today. And you quote the bigger
 countries--well, what do they think of human life there? They look upon
 it simply as part of the capital they have to use. But we look at
 things from a somewhat different moral standpoint, I should hope. Look
 at our respected shipping industry! Can you name a single one of our
 ship-owners who would sacrifice a human life for the sake of paltry
 gain? And then think of those scoundrels in the bigger countries, who
 for the sake of profit send out freights in one unseaworthy ship after
 another--
 
 Bernick: I am not talking of unseaworthy ships!
 
 Rorlund: But I am, Mr. Bernick.
 
 Bernick: Yes, but to what purpose? They have nothing to do with the
 question--Oh, these small, timid considerations! If a General from this
 country were to take his men under fire and some of them were shot, I
 suppose he would have sleepless nights after it! It is not so in other
 countries. You should bear what that fellow in there says--
 
 Rorlund: He? Who? The American--?
 
 Bernick: Yes. You should hear how in America--
 
 Rorlund: He, in there? And you did not tell me? I shall at once--
 
 Bernick: It is no use; you won't be able to do anything with him.
 
 Rorlund: We shall see. Ah, here he comes. (JOHAN comes in from the
 other room.)
 
 Johan (talking back through the open door): Yes, yes, Dina--as you
 please; but I do not mean to give you up, all the same. I shall come
 back, and then everything will come right between us.
 
 Rorlund: Excuse me, but what did you mean by that? What is it you
 propose to do?
 
 Johan: I propose that that young girl, before whom you blackened my
 character yesterday, shall become my wife.
 
 Rorlund: Your wife? And can you really suppose that--?
 
 Johan: I mean to marry her.
 
 Rorlund: Well, then you shall know the truth. (Goes to the half-open
 door.) Mrs. Bernick, will you be so kind as to come and be a
 witness--and you too, Miss Martha. And let Dina come. (Sees LONA at the
 door.) Ah, you here too?
 
 Lona: Shall I come too?
 
 Rorlund: As many as you please--the more the better.
 
 Bernick: What are you going to do? (LONA, MRS. BERNICK, MARTHA, DINA
 and HILMAR come in from the other room.)
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Mr. Rorlund, I have tried my hardest, but I cannot
 prevent him...
 
 Rorlund: I shall prevent him, Mrs. Bernick. Dina, you are a thoughtless
 girl, but I do not blame you so greatly. You have too long lacked the
 necessary moral support that should have sustained you. I blame myself
 for not having afforded you that support.
 
 Dina: You mustn't speak now!
 
 Mrs. Bernick: What is it?
 
 Rorlund: It is now that I must speak, Dina, although your conduct
 yesterday and today has made it ten times more difficult for me. But
 all other considerations must give way to the necessity for saving you.
 You remember that I gave you my word; you remember what you promised
 you would answer when I judged that the right time had come. Now I dare
 not hesitate any longer, and therefore--. (Turns to JOHAN.) This young
 girl, whom you are persecuting, is my betrothed.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: What?
 
 Bernick: Dina!
 
 Johan: She? Your--?
 
 Martha: No, no, Dina!
 
 Lona: It is a lie!
 
 Johan: Dina--is this man speaking the truth?
 
 Dina (after a short pause): Yes.
 
 Rorlund: I hope this has rendered all your arts of seduction powerless.
 The step I have determined to take for Dina's good, I now wish openly
 proclaimed to every one. I cherish the certain hope that it will not be
 misinterpreted. And now, Mrs. Bernick, I think it will be best for us
 to take her away from here, and try to bring back peace and
 tranquillity to her mind.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Yes, come with me. Oh, Dina--what a lucky girl you are!
 (Takes DINA Out to the left; RORLUND follows them.)
 
 Martha: Good-bye, Johan! (Goes out.)
 
 Hilmar (at the verandah door): Hm--I really must say...
 
 Lona (who has followed DINA with her eyes, to JOHAN): Don't be
 downhearted, my boy! I shall stay here and keep my eye on the parson.
 (Goes out to the right.)
 
 Bernick: Johan, you won't sail in the "Indian Girl" now?
 
 Johan: Indeed I shall.
 
 Bernick: But you won't come back?
 
 Johan: I am coming back.
 
 Bernick: After this? What have you to do here after this?
 
 Johan: Revenge myself on you all; crush as many of you as I can. (Goes
 out to the right. VIGELAND and KRAP come in from BERNICK'S room.)
 
 Vigeland: There, now the papers are in order, Mr. Bernick.
 
 Bernick: Good, good.
 
 Krap (in a low voice): And I suppose it is settled that the "Indian
 Girl" is to sail tomorrow?
 
 Bernick: Yes. (Goes into his room. VIGELAND and KRAP go out to the
 right. HILMAR is just going after them, when OLAF puts his head
 carefully out of the door on the left.)
 
 Olaf: Uncle! Uncle Hilmar!
 
 Hilmar: Ugh, is it you? Why don't you stay upstairs? You know you are
 confined to the house.
 
 Olaf (coming a step or two nearer): Hush! Uncle Hilmar, have you heard
 the news?
 
 Hilmar: Yes, I have heard that you got a thrashing today.
 
 Olaf (looking threateningly towards his father's room): He shan't
 thrash me any more. But have you heard that Uncle Johan is going to
 sail tomorrow with the Americans?
 
 Hilmar: What has that got to do with you? You had better run upstairs
 again.
 
 Olaf: Perhaps I shall be going for a buffalo hunt, too, one of these
 days, uncle.
 
 Hilmar: Rubbish! A coward like you--
 
 Olaf: Yes--just you wait! You will learn something tomorrow!
 
 Hilmar: Duffer! (Goes out through the garden. OLAF runs into the room
 again and shuts the door, as he sees KRAP coming in from the right.)
 
 Krap (going to the door of BERNICK'S room and opening it slightly):
 Excuse my bothering you again, Mr. Bernick; but there is a tremendous
 storm blowing up. (Waits a moment, but there is no answer.) Is the
 "Indian Girl" to sail, for all that? (After a short pause, the
 following answer is heard.)
 
 Bernick (from his room): The "Indian Girl" is to sail, for all that.
 
 (KRAP Shuts the door and goes out again to the right.)
 
 
 
 
 ACT IV
 
 
 (SCENE--The same room. The work-table has been taken away. It is a
 stormy evening and already dusk. Darkness sets in as the following
 scene is in progress. A man-servant is lighting the chandelier; two
 maids bring in pots of flowers, lamps and candles, which they place on
 tables and stands along the walls. RUMMEL, in dress clothes, with
 gloves and a white tie, is standing in the room giving instructions to
 the servants.)
 
 Rummel: Only every other candle, Jacob. It must not look as if it were
 arranged for the occasion--it has to come as a surprise, you know. And
 all these flowers--? Oh, well, let them be; it will probably look as if
 they stood there everyday. (BERNICK comes out of his room.)
 
 Bernick (stopping at the door): What does this mean?
 
 Rummel: Oh dear, is it you? (To the servants.) Yes, you might leave us
 for the present. (The servants go out.)
 
 Bernick: But, Rummel, what is the meaning of this?
 
 Rummel: It means that the proudest moment of your life has come. A
 procession of his fellow citizens is coming to do honour to the first
 man of the town.
 
 Bernick: What!
 
 Rummel: In procession--with banners and a band! We ought to have had
 torches too; but we did not like to risk that in this stormy weather.
 There will be illuminations--and that always sounds well in the
 newspapers.
 
 Bernick: Listen, Rummel--I won't have anything to do with this.
 
 Rummel: But it is too late now; they will be here in half-an-hour.
 
 Bernick: But why did you not tell me about this before?
 
 Rummel: Just because I was afraid you would raise objections to it. But
 I consulted your wife; she allowed me to take charge of the
 arrangements, while she looks after the refreshments.
 
 Bernick (listening): What is that noise? Are they coming already? I
 fancy I hear singing.
 
 Rummel (going to the verandah door): Singing? Oh, that is only the
 Americans. The "Indian Girl" is being towed out.
 
 Bernick: Towed out? Oh, yes. No, Rummel, I cannot this evening; I am
 not well.
 
 Rummel: You certainly do look bad. But you must pull yourself together;
 devil take it--you must! Sandstad and Vigeland and I all attach the
 greatest importance to carrying this thing through. We have got to
 crush our opponents under the weight of as complete an expression of
 public opinion as possible. Rumours are getting about the town; our
 announcement about the purchase of the property cannot be withheld any
 longer. It is imperative that this very evening--after songs and
 speeches, amidst the clink of glasses--in a word, in an ebullient
 atmosphere of festivity--you should inform them of the risk you have
 incurred for the good of the community. In such an ebullient atmosphere
 of festivity--as I just now described it--you can do an astonishing lot
 with the people here. But you must have that atmosphere, or the thing
 won't go.
 
 Bernick: Yes, yes.
 
 Rummel: And especially when so delicate and ticklish a point has to be
 negotiated. Well, thank goodness, you have a name that will be a tower
 of strength, Bernick. But listen now; we must make our arrangements, to
 some extent. Mr. Hilmar Tonnesen has written an ode to you. It begins
 very charmingly with the words: "Raise the Ideal's banner high!" And
 Mr. Rorlund has undertaken the task of making the speech of the
 evening. Of course you must reply to that.
 
 Bernick: I cannot tonight, Rummel. Couldn't you--?
 
 Rummel: It is impossible, however willing I might be; because, as you
 can imagine, his speech will be especially addressed to you. Of course
 it is possible he may say a word or two about the rest of us; I have
 spoken to Vigeland and Sandstad about it. Our idea is that, in
 replying, you should propose the toast of "Prosperity to our
 Community"; Sandstad will say a few words on the subject of harmonious
 relations between the different strata of society; then Vigeland will
 express the hope that this new undertaking may not disturb the sound
 moral basis upon which our community stands; and I propose, in a few
 suitable words, to refer to the ladies, whose work for the community,
 though more inconspicuous, is far from being without its importance.
 But you are not listening to me.
 
 Bernick: Yes--indeed I am. But, tell me, do you think there is a very
 heavy sea running outside?
 
 Rummel: Why, are you nervous about the "Palm Tree"? She is fully
 insured, you know.
 
 Bernick: Yes, she is insured; but--
 
 Rummel: And in good repair--and that is the main thing.
 
 Bernick: Hm--. Supposing anything does happen to a ship, it doesn't
 follow that human life will be in danger, does it? The ship and the
 cargo may be lost--and one might lose one's boxes and papers--
 
 Rummel: Good Lord--boxes and papers are not of much consequence.
 
 Bernick: Not of much consequence! No, no; I only meant--. Hush--I hear
 voices again.
 
 Rummel: It is on board the "Palm Tree."
 
 (VIGELAND comes in from the right.)
 
 Vigeland: Yes, they are just towing the "Palm Tree" out. Good evening,
 Mr. Bernick.
 
 Bernick: And you, as a seafaring man, are still of opinion that--
 
 Vigeland: I put my trust in Providence, Mr. Bernick. Moreover, I have
 been on board myself and distributed a few small tracts which I hope
 may carry a blessing with them.
 
 (SANDSTAD and KRAP come in from the right.)
 
 Sandstad (to some one at the door): Well, if that gets through all
 right, anything will. (Comes in.) Ah, good evening, good evening!
 
 Bernick: Is anything the matter, Krap?
 
 Krap: I say nothing, Mr. Bernick.
 
 Sandstad: The entire crew of the "Indian Girl" are drunk; I will stake
 my reputation on it that they won't come out of it alive. (LONA comes
 in from the right.)
 
 Lona: Ah, now I can say his good-byes for him.
 
 Bernick: Is he on board already?
 
 Lona: He will be directly, at any rate. We parted outside the hotel.
 
 Bernick: And he persists in his intention?
 
 Lona: As firm as a rock.
 
 Rummel (who is fumbling at the window): Confound these new-fangled
 contrivances; I cannot get the curtains drawn.
 
 Lona: Do you want them drawn? I thought, on the contrary--
 
 Rummel: Yes, drawn at first, Miss Hessel. You know what is in the wind,
 I suppose?
 
 Lona: Yes. Let me help you. (Takes hold of the cords.) I will draw down
 the curtains on my brother-in-law--though I would much rather draw them
 up.
 
 Rummel:  You can do that too, later on. When the garden is filled with
 a surging crowd, then the curtains shall be drawn back, and they will
 be able to look in upon a surprised and happy family. Citizens' lives
 should be such that they can live in glass houses! (BERNICK opens his
 mouth, as though he were going to say something; but he turns hurriedly
 away and goes into his room.)
 
 Rummel: Come along, let us have a final consultation. Come in, too, Mr.
 Krap; you must assist us with information on one or two points of
 detail. (All the men go into BERNICK'S room. LONA has drawn the
 curtains over the windows, and is just going to do the same over the
 open glass door, when OLAF jumps down from the room above on to the
 garden steps; he has a wrap over his shoulders and a bundle in his
 hand.)
 
 Lona: Bless me, child, how you frightened me!
 
 Olaf (hiding his bundle): Hush, aunt!
 
 Lona: Did you jump out of the window? Where are you going?
 
 Olaf: Hush!--don't say anything. I want to go to Uncle Johan--only on
 to the quay, you know--only to say goodbye to him. Good-night, aunt!
 (Runs out through the garden.)
 
 Lona: No--stop! Olaf--Olaf!
 
 (JOHAN, dressed for his journey, with a bag over his shoulder, comes
 warily in by the door on the right.)
 
 Johan: Lona!
 
 Lona (turning round): What! Back again?
 
 Johan: I have still a few minutes. I must see her once more; we cannot
 part like this. (The farther door on the left opens, and MARTHA and
 DINA, both with cloaks on, and the latter carrying a small travelling
 bag in her hand, come in.)
 
 Dina: Let me go to him! Let me go to him!
 
 Martha: Yes, you shall go to him, Dina!
 
 Dina: There he is!
 
 Johan: Dina!
 
 Dina: Take me with you!
 
 Johan: What--!
 
 Lona: You mean it?
 
 Dina: Yes, take me with you. The other has written to me that he means
 to announce to everyone this evening.
 
 Johan: Dina--you do not love him?
 
 Dina: I have never loved the man! I would rather drown myself in the
 fjord than be engaged to him! Oh, how he humiliated me yesterday with
 his condescending manner! How clear he made it that he felt he was
 lifting up a poor despised creature to his own level! I do not mean to
 be despised any longer. I mean to go away. May I go with you?
 
 Johan: Yes, yes--a thousand times, yes!
 
 Dina: I will not be a burden to you long. Only help me to get over
 there; help me to go the right way about things at first.
 
 Johan: Hurrah, it is all right after all, Dina!
 
 Lona (pointing to BERNICK'S door): Hush!--gently, gently!
 
 Johan: Dina, I shall look after you.
 
 Dina: I am not going to let you do that. I mean to look after myself;
 over there, I am sure I can do that. Only let me get away from here.
 Oh, these women!--you don't know--they have written to me today,
 too--exhorting me to realise my good fortune--impressing on me how
 magnanimous he has been. Tomorrow, and every day afterwards, they would
 be watching me to see if I were making myself worthy of it all. I am
 sick and tired of all this goodness!
 
 Johan: Tell me, Dina--is that the only reason you are coming away? Am I
 nothing to you?
 
 Dina: Yes, Johan, you are more to me than any one else in the world.
 
 Johan: Oh, Dina--!
 
 Dina: Every one here tells me I ought to hate and detest you--that it
 is my duty; but I cannot see that it is my duty, and shall never be
 able to.
 
 Lona: No more you shall, my dear!
 
 Martha: No, indeed you shall not; and that is why you shall go with him
 as his wife.
 
 Johan: Yes, yes!
 
 Lona: What? Give me a kiss, Martha. I never expected that from you!
 
 Martha: No, I dare say not; I would not have expected it myself. But I
 was bound to break out some time! Ah, what we suffer under the tyranny
 of habit and custom! Make a stand against that, Dina. Be his wife. Let
 me see you defy all this convention.
 
 Johan: What is your answer, Dina?
 
 Dina: Yes, I will be your wife.
 
 Johan: Dina!
 
 Dina: But first of all I want to work--to make something of myself--as
 you have done. I am not going to be merely a thing that is taken.
 
 Lona: Quite right--that is the way.
 
 Johan: Very well; I shall wait and hope--
 
 Lona: And win, my boy! But now you must get on board!
 
 Johan: Yes, on board! Ah, Lona, my dear sister, just one word with you.
 Look here-- (He takes her into the background and talks hurriedly to
 her.)
 
 Martha: Dina, you lucky girl, let me look at you, and kiss you once
 more--for the last time.
 
 Dina: Not for the last time; no, my darling aunt, we shall meet again.
 
 Martha: Never! Promise me, Dina, never to come back! (Grasps her hands
 and looks at her.) Now go to your happiness, my dear child--across the
 sea. How often, in my schoolroom, I have yearned to be over there! It
 must be beautiful; the skies are loftier than here--a freer air plays
 about your head--
 
 Dina: Oh, Aunt Martha, some day you will follow us.
 
 Martha: I? Never--never. I have my little vocation here, and now I
 really believe I can live to the full the life that I ought.
 
 Dina: I cannot imagine being parted from you.
 
 Martha: Ah, one can part from much, Dina. (Kisses her.) But I hope you
 may never experience that, my sweet child. Promise me to make him happy.
 
 Dina: I will promise nothing; I hate promises; things must happen as
 they will.
 
 Martha: Yes, yes, that is true; only remain what you are--true and
 faithful to yourself.
 
 Dina: I will, aunt.
 
 Lona (putting into her pocket some papers that JOHAN has given her):
 Splendid, splendid, my dear boy. But now you must be off.
 
 Johan: Yes, we have no time to waste now. Goodbye, Lona, and thank you
 for all your love. Goodbye, Martha, and thank you, too, for your loyal
 friendship.
 
 Martha: Goodbye, Johan! Goodbye, Dina! And may you be happy all your
 lives! (She and LONA hurry them to the door at the back. JOHAN and DINA
 go quickly down the steps and through the garden. LONA shuts the door
 and draws the curtains over it.)
 
 Lona: Now we are alone, Martha. You have lost her and I him.
 
 Martha: You--lost him?
 
 Lona: Oh, I had already half lost him over there. The boy was longing
 to stand on his own feet; that was why I pretended to be suffering from
 homesickness.
 
 Martha: So that was it? Ah, then I understand why you came. But he will
 want you back, Lona.
 
 Lona: An old step-sister--what use will he have for her now? Men break
 many very dear ties to win their happiness.
 
 Martha: That sometimes is so.
 
 Lona: But we two will stick together, Martha.
 
 Martha: Can I be anything to you?
 
 Lona: Who more so? We two foster-sisters--haven't we both lost our
 children? Now we are alone.
 
 Martha: Yes, alone. And therefore, you ought to know this too--I loved
 him more than anything in the world.
 
 Lona: Martha! (Grasps her by the arm.) Is that true?
 
 Martha: All my existence lies in those words. I have loved him and
 waited for him. Every summer I waited for him to come. And then he
 came--but he had no eyes for me.
 
 Lona: You loved him! And it was you yourself that put his happiness
 into his hands.
 
 Martha: Ought I not to be the one to put his happiness into his hands,
 since I loved him? Yes, I have loved him. All my life has been for him,
 ever since he went away. What reason had I to hope, you mean? Oh, I
 think I had some reason, all the same. But when he came back--then it
 seemed as if everything had been wiped out of his memory. He had no
 eyes for me.
 
 Lona: It was Dina that overshadowed you, Martha?
 
 Martha: And it is a good thing she did. At the time he went away, we
 were of the same age; but when I saw him again--oh, that dreadful
 moment!--I realised that now I was ten years older than he. He had gone
 out into the bright sparkling sunshine, and breathed in youth and
 health with every breath; and here I sat meanwhile, spinning and
 spinning--
 
 Lona: Spinning the thread of his happiness, Martha.
 
 Martha: Yes, it was a golden thread I spun. No bitterness! We have been
 two good sisters to him, haven't we, Lona?
 
 Lona (throwing her arms round her): Martha!
 
 (BERNICK comes in from his room.)
 
 Bernick (to the other men, who are in his room): Yes, yes, arrange it
 any way you please. When the time comes, I shall be able to--. (Shuts
 the door.) Ah, you are here. Look here, Martha--I think you had better
 change your dress; and tell Betty to do the same. I don't want anything
 elaborate, of course--something homely, but neat. But you must make
 haste.
 
 Lona: And a bright, cheerful face, Martha; your eyes must look happy.
 
 Bernick: Olaf is to come downstairs too; I will have him beside me.
 
 Lona: Hm! Olaf.
 
 Martha: I will give Betty your message. (Goes out by the farther door
 on the left.)
 
 Lona: Well, the great and solemn moment is at hand.
 
 Bernick (walking uneasily up and down): Yes, it is.
 
 Lona: At such a moment I should think a man would feel proud and happy.
 
 Bernick (looking at her): Hm!
 
 Lona: I hear the whole town is to be illuminated.
 
 Bernick: Yes, they have some idea of that sort.
 
 Lona: All the different clubs will assemble with their banners--your
 name will blaze out in letters of fire--tonight the telegraph will
 flash the news to every part of the country: "In the bosom of his happy
 family, Mr. Bernick received the homage of his fellow citizens, as one
 of the pillars of society."
 
 Bernick: That is so; and they will begin to cheer outside, and the
 crowd will shout in front of my house until I shall be obliged to go
 out and bow to them and thank them.
 
 Lona: Obliged to?
 
 Bernick. Do you suppose I shall feel happy at that moment?
 
 Lona: No, I don't suppose you will feel so very happy.
 
 Bernick: Lona, you despise me.
 
 Lona: Not yet.
 
 Bernick: And you have no right to; no right to despise me! Lona, you
 can have no idea how utterly alone I stand in this cramped and stunted
 community--where I have had, year after year, to stifle my ambition for
 a fuller life. My work may seem many-sided, but what have I really
 accomplished? Odds and ends--scraps. They would not stand anything else
 here. If I were to go a step in advance of the opinions and views that
 are current at the moment, I should lose all my influence. Do you know
 what we are--we who are looked upon as pillars of society? We are
 nothing more, nor less, than the tools of society.
 
 Lona: Why have you only begun to realise that now?
 
 Bernick: Because I have been thinking a great deal lately--since you
 came back--and this evening I have thought more seriously than ever
 before. Oh, Lona, why did not I really know you then--in the old days,
 I mean?
 
 Lona: And if you had?
 
 Bernick: I should never have let you go; and, if I had had you, I
 should not be in the position I am in tonight.
 
 Lona: And do you never consider what she might have been to you--she
 whom you chose in my place?
 
 Bernick: I know, at all events, that she has been nothing to me of what
 I needed.
 
 Lona: Because you have never shared your interests with her; because
 you have never allowed her full and frank exchange of thoughts with
 you; because you have allowed her to be borne under by self-reproach
 for the shame you cast upon one who was dear to her.
 
 Bernick: Yes, yes; it all comes from lying and deceit.
 
 Lona: Then why not break with all this lying and deceit?
 
 Bernick: Now? It is too late now, Lona.
 
 Lona: Karsten, tell me--what gratification does all this show and
 deception bring you?
 
 Bernick: It brings me none. I must disappear someday, and all this
 community of bunglers with me. But a generation is growing up that will
 follow us; it is my son that I work for--I am providing a career for
 him. There will come a time when truth will enter into the life of the
 community, and on that foundation he shall build up a happier existence
 than his father.
 
 Lona: With a lie at the bottom of it all? Consider what sort of an
 inheritance it is that you are leaving to your son.
 
 Bernick (in tones of suppressed despair): It is a thousand times worse
 than you think. But surely some day the curse must be lifted; and
 yet--nevertheless--. (Vehemently.) How could I bring all this upon my
 own head! Still, it is done now; I must go on with it now. You shall
 not succeed in crushing me! (HILMAR comes in hurriedly and agitatedly
 from the right, with an open letter in his hand.)
 
 Hilmar: But this is--Betty, Betty.
 
 Bernick: What is the matter? Are they coming already?
 
 Hilmar: No, no--but I must speak to some one immediately. (Goes out
 through the farther door on the left.)
 
 Lona: Karsten, you talk about our having come here to crush you. So let
 me tell you what sort of stuff this prodigal son, whom your moral
 community shuns as if he had the plague, is made of. He can do without
 any of you--for he is away now.
 
 Bernick: But he said he meant to come back
 
 Lona: Johan will never come back. He is gone for good, and Dina with
 him.
 
 Bernick: Never come back?--and Dina with him?
 
 Lona: Yes, to be his wife. That is how these two strike your virtuous
 community in the face, just as I did once--but never mind that.
 
 Bernick: Gone--and she too--in the "Indian Girl"--
 
 Lona: No; he would not trust so precious a freight to that rascally
 crew. Johan and Dina are on the "Palm Tree."
 
 Bernick: Ah! Then it is all in vain-- (Goes hurriedly to the door of
 his room, opens it and calls in.) Krap, stop the "Indian Girl"--she
 must not sail tonight!
 
 Krap (from within): The "Indian Girl" is already standing out to sea,
 Mr. Bernick.
 
 Bernick (shutting the door and speaking faintly): Too late--and all to
 no purpose--
 
 Lona: What do you mean?
 
 Bernick: Nothing, nothing. Leave me alone!
 
 Lona: Hm!--look here, Karsten. Johan was good enough to say that he
 entrusted to me the good name and reputation that he once lent to you,
 and also the good name that you stole from him while he was away. Johan
 will hold his tongue; and I can act just as I please in the matter.
 See, I have two letters in my hand.
 
 Bernick: You have got them! And you mean now--this very evening-perhaps
 when the procession comes--
 
 Lona: I did not come back here to betray you, but to stir your
 conscience so that you should speak of your own free will. I did not
 succeed in doing that--so you must remain as you are, with your life
 founded upon a lie. Look, I am tearing your two letters in pieces. Take
 the wretched things--there you are. Now there is no evidence against
 you, Karsten. You are safe now; be happy, too--if you can.
 
 Bernick (much moved): Lona--why did you not do that sooner! Now it is
 too late; life no longer seems good to me; I cannot live on after today.
 
 Lona: What has happened?
 
 Bernick: Do not ask me--But I must live on, nevertheless! I will
 live--for Olaf's sake. He shall make amends for everything--expiate
 everything.
 
 Lona: Karsten--! (HILMAR comes hurriedly back.)
 
 Hilmar: I cannot find anyone; they are all out--even Betty!
 
 Bernick: What is the matter with you?
 
 Hilmar: I daren't tell you.
 
 Bernick: What is it? You must tell me!
 
 Hilmar: Very well--Olaf has run away, on board the "Indian Girl."
 
 Bernick (stumbling back): Olaf--on board the "Indian Girl"! No, no!
 
 Lona: Yes, he is! Now I understand--I saw him jump out of the window.
 
 Bernick (calls in through the door of his room in a despairing voice):
 Krap, stop the "Indian Girl" at any cost!
 
 Krap: It is impossible, sir. How can you suppose--?
 
 Bernick: We must stop her; Olaf is on board!
 
 Krap: What!
 
 Rummel (coming out of BERNICK'S room): Olaf, run away? Impossible!
 
 Sandstad (following him): He will be sent back with the pilot, Mr.
 Bernick.
 
 Hilmar: No, no; he has written to me. (Shows the letter.) He says he
 means to hide among the cargo till they are in the open sea.
 
 Bernick: I shall never see him again!
 
 Rummel: What nonsense!--a good strong ship, newly repaired...
 
 Vigeland (who has followed the others out of BERNICK'S room): And in
 your own yard, Mr. Bernick!
 
 Bernick: I shall never see him again, I tell you. I have lost him,
 Lona; and--I see it now--he never was really mine. (Listens.) What is
 that?
 
 Rummel: Music. The procession must be coming.
 
 Bernick. I cannot take any part in it--I will not.
 
 Rummel: What are you thinking of! That is impossible.
 
 Sandstad: Impossible, Mr. Bernick; think what you have at stake.
 
 Bernick: What does it all matter to me now? What have I to work for now?
 
 Rummel: Can you ask? You have us and the community.
 
 Vigeland: Quite true.
 
 Sandstad: And surely, Mr. Bernick, you have not forgotten that
 we--.(MARTHA comes in through the farther door to the left. Music is
 heard in the distance, down the street.)
 
 Martha: The procession is just coming, but Betty is not in the house. I
 don't understand where she--
 
 Bernick: Not in the house! There, you see, Lona--no support to me,
 either in gladness or in sorrow.
 
 Rummel: Draw back the curtains! Come and help me, Mr. Krap--and you,
 Mr. Sandstad. It is a thousand pities that the family should not be
 united just now; it is quite contrary to the program. (They draw back
 all the curtains. The whole street is seen to be illuminated. Opposite
 the house is a large transparency, bearing the words: "Long live
 Karsten Bernick, Pillar of our Society ")
 
 Bernick (shrinking back): Take all that away! I don't want to see it!
 Put it out, put it out!
 
 Rummel: Excuse me, Mr. Bernick, but are you not well?
 
 Martha: What is the matter with him, Lona?
 
 Lona: Hush! (Whispers to her.)
 
 Bernick: Take away those mocking words, I tell you! Can't you see that
 all these lights are grinning at us?
 
 Rummel: Well, really, I must confess--
 
 Bernick: Oh, how could you understand--! But I, I--! It is all like
 candles in a dead-room!
 
 Rummel: Well, let me tell you that you are taking the thing a great
 deal too seriously.
 
 Sandstad: The boy will enjoy a trip across the Atlantic, and then you
 will have him back.
 
 Vigeland: Only put your trust in the Almighty, Mr. Bernick.
 
 Rummel: And in the vessel, Bernick; it is not likely to sink, I know.
 
 Krap: Hm--
 
 Rummel: Now if it were one of those floating coffins that one hears are
 sent out by men in the bigger countries--
 
 Bernick: I am sure my hair must be turning grey--
 
 (MRS. BERNICK comes in from the garden, with a shawl thrown over her
 head.)
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Karsten, Karsten, do you know--?
 
 Bernick: Yes. I know; but you--you, who see nothing that is going
 on--you, who have no mother's eyes for your son--!
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Listen to me, do!
 
 Bernick: Why did you not look after him? Now I have lost him. Give him
 back to me, if you can.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: I can! I have got him.
 
 Bernick: You have got him!
 
 The Men: Ah!
 
 Hilmar: Yes, I thought so.
 
 Martha: You have got him back, Karsten.
 
 Lona: Yes--make him your own, now.
 
 Bernick: You have got him! Is that true? Where is he?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: I shall not tell you, till you have forgiven him.
 
 Bernick: Forgiven! But how did you know--?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Do you not think a mother sees? I was in mortal fear of
 your getting to know anything about it. Some words he let fall
 yesterday--and then his room was empty, and his knapsack and clothes
 missing...
 
 Bernick: Yes, yes?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: I ran, and got hold of Aune; we went out in his boat; the
 American ship was on the point of sailing. Thank God, we were in
 time--got on board--searched the hold--found him! Oh, Karsten, you must
 not punish him!
 
 Bernick: Betty!
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Nor Aune, either!
 
 Bernick: Aune? What do you know about him? Is the "Indian Girl" under
 sail again?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: No, that is just it.
 
 Bernick: Speak, speak!
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Aune was just as agitated as I was; the search took us
 some time; it had grown dark, and the pilot made objections; and so
 Aune took upon himself--in your name--
 
 Bernick: Well?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: To stop the ship's sailing till tomorrow.
 
 Krap: Hm--
 
 Bernick: Oh, how glad I am!
 
 Mrs. Bernick: You are not angry?
 
 Bernick: I cannot tell you how glad I am, Betty
 
 Rummel: You really take things far too seriously.
 
 Hilmar: Oh yes, as soon as it is a question of a little struggle with
 the elements--ugh!
 
 Krap (going to the window): The procession is just coming through your
 garden gate, Mr. Bernick.
 
 Bernick: Yes, they can come now.
 
 Rummel: The whole garden is full of people.
 
 Sandstad: The whole street is crammed.
 
 Rummel: The whole town is afoot, Bernick. It really is a moment that
 makes one proud.
 
 Vigeland: Let us take it in a humble spirit, Mr. Rummel.
 
 Rummel: All the banners are out! What a procession! Here comes the
 committee with Mr. Rorlund at their head.
 
 Bernick: Yes, let them come in!
 
 Rummel: But, Bernick--in your present agitated frame of mind--
 
 Bernick: Well, what?
 
 Rummel: I am quite willing to speak instead of you, if you like.
 
 Bernick: No, thank you; I will speak for myself tonight.
 
 Rummel: But are you sure you know what to say?
 
 Bernick: Yes, make your mind easy, Rummel--I know now what to say.
 
 (The music grows louder. The verandah door is opened. RORLUND comes in,
 at the head of the Committee, escorted by a couple of hired waiters,
 who carry a covered basket. They are followed by townspeople of all
 classes, as many as can get into the room. An apparently endless crowd
 of people, waving banners and flags, are visible in the garden and the
 street.)
 
 Rorlund: Mr. Bernick! I see, from the surprise depicted upon your face,
 that it is as unexpected guests that we are intruding upon your happy
 family circle and your peaceful fireside, where we find you surrounded
 by honoured and energetic fellow citizens and friends. But it is our
 hearts that have bidden us come to offer you our homage--not for the
 first time, it is true, but for the first time on such a comprehensive
 scale. We have on many occasions given you our thanks for the broad
 moral foundation upon which you have, so to speak, reared the edifice
 of our community. On this occasion we offer our homage especially to
 the clear-sighted, indefatigable, unselfish--nay, self-sacrificing
 citizen who has taken the initiative in an undertaking which, we are
 assured on all sides, will give a powerful impetus to the temporal
 prosperity and welfare of our community.
 
 Voices: Bravo, bravo!
 
 Rorlund: You, sir, have for many years been a shining example in our
 midst. This is not the place for me to speak of your family life, which
 has been a model to us all; still less to enlarge upon your unblemished
 personal character. Such topics belong to the stillness of a man's own
 chamber, not to a festal occasion such as this! I am here to speak of
 your public life as a citizen, as it lies open to all men's eyes.
 Well-equipped vessels sail away from your shipyard and carry our flag
 far and wide over the seas. A numerous and happy band of workmen look
 up to you as to a father. By calling new branches of industry into
 existence, you have laid the foundations of the welfare of hundreds of
 families. In a word--you are, in the fullest sense of the term, the
 mainstay of our community.
 
 Voices: Hear, hear! Bravo!
 
 Rorlund: And, sir, it is just that disinterestedness, which colours all
 your conduct, that is so beneficial to our community--more so than
 words can express--and especially at the present moment. You are now on
 the point of procuring for us what I have no hesitation in calling
 bluntly by its prosaic name--a railway!
 
 Voices: Bravo, bravo!
 
 Rorlund: But it would seem as though the undertaking were beset by
 certain difficulties, the outcome of narrow and selfish considerations.
 
 Voices: Hear, hear!
 
 Rorlund: For the fact has come to light that certain individuals, who
 do not belong to our community, have stolen a march upon the
 hard-working citizens of this place, and have laid hands on certain
 sources of profit which by rights should have fallen to the share of
 our town.
 
 Voices: That's right! Hear, hear!
 
 Rorlund: This regrettable fact has naturally come to your knowledge
 also, Mr. Bernick. But it has not had the slightest effect in deterring
 you from proceeding steadily with your project, well knowing that a
 patriotic man should not solely take local interests into consideration.
 
 Voices: Oh!--No, no!--Yes, yes!
 
 Rorlund: It is to such a man--to the patriot citizen, whose character
 we all should emulate--that we bring our homage this evening. May your
 undertaking grow to be a real and lasting source of good fortune to
 this community! It is true enough that a railway may be the means of
 our exposing ourselves to the incursion of pernicious influences from
 without; but it gives us also the means of quickly expelling them from
 within. For even we, at the present time, cannot boast of being
 entirely free from the danger of such outside influences; but as we
 have, on this very evening--if rumour is to be believed--fortunately
 got rid of certain elements of that nature, sooner than was to be
 expected--
 
 Voices: Order, order!
 
 Rorlund:--I regard the occurrence as a happy omen for our undertaking.
 My alluding to such a thing at such a moment only emphasises the fact
 that the house in which we are now standing is one where the claims of
 morality are esteemed even above ties of family.
 
 Voices: Hear, hear! Bravo!
 
 Bernick (at the same moment): Allow me--
 
 Rorlund: I have only a few more words to say, Mr. Bernick. What you
 have done for your native place we all know has not been done with any
 underlying idea of its bringing tangible profit to yourself. But,
 nevertheless, you must not refuse to accept a slight token of grateful
 appreciation at the hands of your fellow-citizens--least of all at this
 important moment when, according to the assurances of practical men, we
 are standing on the threshold of a new era.
 
 Voices: Bravo! Hear, hear!
 
 (RORLUND signs to the servants, who bring forward the basket. During
 the following speech, members of the Committee take out and present the
 various objects mentioned.)
 
 Rorlund: And so, Mr. Bernick, we have the pleasure of presenting you
 with this silver coffee-service. Let it grace your board when in the
 future, as so often in the past, we have the happiness of being
 assembled under your hospitable roof. You, too, gentlemen, who have so
 generously seconded the leader of our community, we ask to accept a
 small souvenir. This silver goblet is for you, Mr. Rummel. Many a time
 have you, amidst the clink of glasses, defended the interests of your
 fellow-citizens in well-chosen words; may you often find similar worthy
 opportunities to raise and empty this goblet in some patriotic toast!
 To you, Mr. Sandstad, I present this album containing photographs of
 your fellow-citizens. Your well-known and conspicuous liberality has
 put you in the pleasant position of being able to number your friends
 amongst all classes of society. And to you, Mr. Vigeland, I have to
 offer this book of Family Devotions, printed on vellum and handsomely
 bound, to grace your study table. The mellowing influence of time has
 led you to take an earnest view of life; your zeal in carrying out your
 daily duties has, for a long period of years, been purified and enobled
 by thoughts of higher and holier things. (Turns to the crowd.) And now,
 friends, three cheers for Mr. Bernick and his fellow-workers! Three
 cheers for the Pillars of our Society!
 
 The whole crowd: Bernick! Pillars of Society! Hurrah-hurrah-hurrah!
 
 Lona: I congratulate you, brother-in-law.
 
 (An expectant hush follows.)
 
 Bernick (speaking seriously and slowly): Fellow citizens--your
 spokesman said just now that tonight we are standing on the threshold
 of a new era. I hope that will prove to be the case. But before that
 can come to pass, we must lay fast hold of truth--truth which, till
 tonight, has been altogether and in all circumstances a stranger to
 this community of ours. (Astonishment among the audience.) To that end,
 I must begin by deprecating the praises with which you, Mr. Rorlund,
 according to custom on such occasions, have overwhelmed me. I do not
 deserve them; because, until today, my actions have by no means been
 disinterested. Even though I may not always have aimed at pecuniary
 profit, I at all events recognise now that a craving for power,
 influence and position has been the moving spirit of most of my actions.
 
 Rummel (half aloud): What next!
 
 Bernick: Standing before my fellow citizens, I do not reproach myself
 for that; because I still think I am entitled to a place in the front
 rank of our capable men of affairs.
 
 Voices: Yes, yes, yes!
 
 Bernick: But what I charge myself with is that I have so often been
 weak enough to resort to deceitfulness, because I knew and feared the
 tendency of the community to espy unclean motives behind everything a
 prominent man here undertakes. And now I am coming to a point which
 will illustrate that.
 
 Rummel (uneasily): Hm-hm!
 
 Bernick: There have been rumours of extensive purchases of property
 outside the town. These purchases have been made by me--by me alone,
 and by no one else. (Murmurs are heard: "What does he
 say?--He?--Bernick?") The properties are, for the time being, in my
 hands. Naturally I have confided in my fellow-workers, Mr. Rummel, Mr.
 Vigeland and Mr. Sandstad, and we are all agreed that--
 
 Rummel: It is not true! Prove it--prove it!
 
 Vigeland: We are not all agreed about anything!
 
 Sandstad: Well, really I must say--!
 
 Bernick: That is quite true--we are not yet agreed upon the matter I
 was going to mention. But I confidently hope that these three gentlemen
 will agree with me when I announce to you that I have tonight come to
 the decision that these properties shall be exploited as a company of
 which the shares shall be offered for public subscription; any one that
 wishes can take shares.
 
 Voices: Hurrah! Three cheers for Bernick!
 
 Rummel (in a low voice, to BERNICK): This is the basest treachery--!
 
 Sandstad (also in an undertone): So you have been fooling us!
 
 Vigeland: Well, then, devil take--! Good Lord, what am I saying?
 (Cheers are heard without.)
 
 Bernick: Silence, gentlemen. I have no right to this homage you offer
 me; because the decision I have just come to does not represent what
 was my first intention. My intention was to keep the whole thing for
 myself; and, even now, I am of opinion that these properties would be
 worked to best advantage if they remained in one man's hands. But you
 are at liberty to choose. If you wish it, I am willing to administer
 them to the best of my abilities.
 
 Voices: Yes, yes, yes!
 
 Bernick: But, first of all, my fellow townsmen must know me thoroughly.
 And let each man seek to know himself thoroughly, too; and so let it
 really come to pass that tonight we begin a new era. The old era--with
 its affectation, its hypocrisy and its emptiness, its pretence of
 virtue and its miserable fear of public opinion--shall be for us like a
 museum, open for purposes of instruction; and to that museum we will
 present--shall we not, gentlemen?--the coffee service, and the goblet,
 and the album, and the Family Devotions printed on vellum, and
 handsomely bound.
 
 Rummel: Oh, of course.
 
 Vigeland (muttering): If you have taken everything else, then--
 
 Sandstad: By all means.
 
 Bernick: And now for the principal reckoning I have to make with the
 community. Mr. Rorlund said that certain pernicious elements had left
 us this evening. I can add what you do not yet know. The man referred
 to did not go away alone; with him, to become his wife, went--
 
 Lona (loudly): Dina Dorf!
 
 Rorlund: What?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: What? (Great commotion.)
 
 Rorlund: Fled? Run away--with him! Impossible!
 
 Bernick: To become his wife, Mr. Rorlund. And I will add more. (In a
 low voice, to his wife.) Betty, be strong to bear what is coming.
 (Aloud.) This is what I have to say: hats off to that man, for he has
 nobly taken another's guilt upon his shoulders. My friends, I want to
 have done with falsehood; it has very nearly poisoned every fibre of my
 being. You shall know all. Fifteen years ago, I was the guilty man.
 
 Mrs. Bernick (softly and tremblingly): Karsten!
 
 Martha (similarly): Ah, Johan--!
 
 Lona: Now at last you have found yourself!
 
 (Speechless consternation among the audience.)
 
 Bernick: Yes, friends, I was the guilty one, and he went away. The vile
 and lying rumours that were spread abroad afterwards, it is beyond
 human power to refute now; but I have no right to complain of that. For
 fifteen years I have climbed up the ladder of success by the help of
 those rumours; whether now they are to cast me down again, or not, each
 of you must decide in his own mind.
 
 Rorlund: What a thunderbolt! Our leading citizen--! (In a low voice, to
 BETTY.) How sorry I am for you, Mrs. Bernick!
 
 Hilmar: What a confession! Well, I must say--!
 
 Bernick: But come to no decision tonight. I entreat every one to go
 home--to collect his thoughts--to look into his own heart. When once
 more you can think calmly, then it will be seen whether I have lost or
 won by speaking out. Goodbye! I have still much--very much--to repent
 of; but that concerns my own conscience only. Good night! Take away all
 these signs of rejoicing. We must all feel that they are out of place
 here.
 
 Rorlund: That they certainly are. (In an undertone to MRS. BERNICK.)
 Run away! So then she was completely unworthy of me. (Louder, to the
 Committee.) Yes, gentlemen, after this I think we had better disperse
 as quietly as possible.
 
 Hilmar: How, after this, any one is to manage to hold the Ideal's
 banner high--Ugh!
 
 (Meantime the news has been whispered from mouth to mouth. The crowd
 gradually disperses from the garden. RUMMEL, SANDSTAD and VIGELAND go
 out, arguing eagerly but in a low voice. HILMAR slinks away to the
 right. When silence is restored, there only remain in the room BERNICK,
 MRS. BERNICK, MARTHA, LONA and KRAP.)
 
 Bernick: Betty, can you forgive me?
 
 Mrs. Bernick (looking at him with a smile): Do you know, Karsten, that
 you have opened out for me the happiest prospect I have had for many a
 year?
 
 Bernick: How?
 
 Mrs. Bernick: For many years, I have felt that once you were mine and
 that I had lost you. Now I know that you never have been mine yet; but
 I shall win you.
 
 Bernick (folding her in his arms): Oh, Betty, you have won me. It was
 through Lona that I first learned really to know you. But now let Olaf
 come to me.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Yes, you shall have him now. Mr. Krap--! (Talks softly to
 KRAP in the background. He goes out by the garden door. During what
 follows, the illuminations and lights in the houses are gradually
 extinguished.)
 
 Bernick (in a low voice): Thank you, Lona--you have saved what was best
 in me--and for me.
 
 Lona: Do you suppose I wanted to do anything else?
 
 Bernick: Yes, was that so--or not? I cannot quite make you out.
 
 Lona: Hm--
 
 Bernick: Then it was not hatred? Not revenge? Why did you come back,
 then?
 
 Lona: Old friendship does not rust.
 
 Bernick: Lona!
 
 Lona: When Johan told me about the lie, I swore to myself that the hero
 of my youth should stand free and true.
 
 Bernick: What a wretch I am!--and how little I have deserved it of you!
 
 Lona. Oh, if we women always looked for what we deserve, Karsten--!
 (AUNE comes in with OLAF from the garden.)
 
 Bernick (going to meet them): Olaf!
 
 Olaf: Father, I promise I will never do it again--
 
 Bernick: Never run away?
 
 Olaf: Yes, yes, I promise you, father.
 
 Bernick: And I promise you, you shall never have reason to. For the
 future you shall be allowed to grow up, not as the heir to my life's
 work, but as one who has his own life's work before him.
 
 Olaf: And shall I be allowed to be what I like, when I grow up?
 
 Bernick: Yes.
 
 Olaf. Oh, thank you! Then I won't be a pillar of society.
 
 Bernick: No? Why not?
 
 Olaf: No--I think it must be so dull.
 
 Bernick: You shall be yourself, Olaf; the rest may take care of
 itself--And you, Aune...
 
 Aune: I know, Mr. Bernick; I am dismissed.
 
 Bernick: We remain together, Aune; and forgive me.
 
 Aune: What? The ship has not sailed tonight.
 
 Bernick: Nor will it sail tomorrow, either. I gave you too short grace.
 It must be looked to more thoroughly.
 
 Aune: It shall, Mr. Bernick--and with the new machines!
 
 Bernick: By all means--but thoroughly and conscientiously. There are
 many among us who need thorough and conscientious repairs, Aune. Well,
 good night.
 
 Aune: Good-night, sir--and thank you, thank you. (Goes out.)
 
 Mrs. Bernick: Now they are all gone.
 
 Bernick: And we are alone. My name is not shining in letters of fire
 any longer; all the lights in the windows are out.
 
 Lona: Would you wish them lit again?
 
 Bernick: Not for anything in the world. Where have I been! You would be
 
 horrified if you knew. I feel now as if I had come back to my right
 senses, after being poisoned. But I feel this that I can be young and
 healthy again. Oh, come nearer--come closer round me. Come, Betty!
 Come, Olaf, my boy! And you, Martha--it seems to me as if I had never
 seen you all these years.
 
 Lona: No, I can believe that. Your community is a community of bachelor
 souls; you do not see women.
 
 Bernick: That is quite true; and for that very reason--this is a
 bargain, Lona--you must not leave Betty and me.
 
 Mrs. Bernick: No, Lona, you must not.
 
 Lona: No, how could I have the heart to go away and leave you young
 people who are just setting up housekeeping? Am I not your
 foster-mother? You and I, Martha, the two old aunts-- What are you
 looking at?
 
 Martha: Look how the sky is clearing, and how light it is over the sea.
 The "Palm Tree" is going to be lucky.
 
 Lona: It carries its good luck on board.
 
 Bernick: And we--we have a long earnest day of work ahead of us; I most
 of all. But let it come; only keep close round me you true, loyal
 women. I have learned this too, in these last few days; it is you women
 that are the pillars of society.
 
 Lona: You have learned a poor sort of wisdom, then, brother-in-law.
 (Lays her hand firmly upon his shoulder.) No, my friend; the spirit of
 truth and the spirit of freedom--they are the pillars of society.

 AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE
 
 
 
 
 ACT I
 
 
 (SCENE.--DR. STOCKMANN'S sitting-room. It is evening. The room is
 plainly but neatly appointed and furnished. In the right-hand wall are
 two doors; the farther leads out to the hall, the nearer to the
 doctor's study. In the left-hand wall, opposite the door leading to the
 hall, is a door leading to the other rooms occupied by the family. In
 the middle of the same wall stands the stove, and, further forward, a
 couch with a looking-glass hanging over it and an oval table in front
 of it. On the table, a lighted lamp, with a lampshade. At the back of
 the room, an open door leads to the dining-room. BILLING is seen
 sitting at the dining table, on which a lamp is burning. He has a
 napkin tucked under his chin, and MRS. STOCKMANN is standing by the
 table handing him a large plate-full of roast beef. The other places at
 the table are empty, and the table somewhat in disorder, evidently a
 meal having recently been finished.)
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. You see, if you come an hour late, Mr. Billing, you
 have to put up with cold meat.
 
 Billing (as he eats). It is uncommonly good, thank you--remarkably good.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. My husband makes such a point of having his meals
 punctually, you know.
 
 Billing. That doesn't affect me a bit. Indeed, I almost think I enjoy a
 meal all the better when I can sit down and eat all by myself, and
 undisturbed.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Oh well, as long as you are enjoying it--. (Turns to
 the hall door, listening.) I expect that is Mr. Hovstad coming too.
 
 Billing. Very likely.
 
 (PETER STOCKMANN comes in. He wears an overcoat and his official hat,
 and carries a stick.)
 
 Peter Stockmann. Good evening, Katherine.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (coming forward into the sitting-room). Ah, good
 evening--is it you? How good of you to come up and see us!
 
 Peter Stockmann. I happened to be passing, and so--(looks into the
 dining-room). But you have company with you, I see.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (a little embarrassed). Oh, no--it was quite by chance
 he came in. (Hurriedly.) Won't you come in and have something, too?
 
 Peter Stockmann. I! No, thank you. Good gracious--hot meat at night!
 Not with my digestion.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Oh, but just once in a way--
 
 Peter Stockmann. No, no, my dear lady; I stick to my tea and bread and
 butter. It is much more wholesome in the long run--and a little more
 economical, too.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (smiling). Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are
 spendthrifts.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Not you, my dear; I would never think that of you.
 (Points to the Doctor's study.) Is he not at home?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. No, he went out for a little turn after supper--he and
 the boys.
 
 Peter Stockmann. I doubt if that is a wise thing to do. (Listens.) I
 fancy I hear him coming now.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. No, I don't think it is he. (A knock is heard at the
 door.) Come in! (HOVSTAD comes in from the hall.) Oh, it is you, Mr.
 Hovstad!
 
 Hovstad. Yes, I hope you will forgive me, but I was delayed at the
 printers. Good evening, Mr. Mayor.
 
 Peter Stockmann (bowing a little distantly). Good evening. You have
 come on business, no doubt.
 
 Hovstad. Partly. It's about an article for the paper.
 
 Peter Stockmann. So I imagined. I hear my brother has become a prolific
 contributor to the "People's Messenger."
 
 Hovstad. Yes, he is good enough to write in the "People's Messenger"
 when he has any home truths to tell.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (to HOVSTAD). But won't you--? (Points to the
 dining-room.)
 
 Peter Stockmann. Quite so, quite so. I don't blame him in the least, as
 a writer, for addressing himself to the quarters where he will find the
 readiest sympathy. And, besides that, I personally have no reason to
 bear any ill will to your paper, Mr. Hovstad.
 
 Hovstad. I quite agree with you.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Taking one thing with another, there is an excellent
 spirit of toleration in the town--an admirable municipal spirit. And it
 all springs from the fact of our having a great common interest to
 unite us--an interest that is in an equally high degree the concern of
 every right-minded citizen.
 
 Hovstad. The Baths, yes.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Exactly---our fine, new, handsome Baths. Mark my
 words, Mr. Hovstad--the Baths will become the focus of our municipal
 life! Not a doubt of it!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. That is just what Thomas says.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Think how extraordinarily the place has developed
 within the last year or two! Money has been flowing in, and there is
 some life and some business doing in the town. Houses and landed
 property are rising in value every day.
 
 Hovstad. And unemployment is diminishing,
 
 Peter Stockmann. Yes, that is another thing. The burden on the poor
 rates has been lightened, to the great relief of the propertied
 classes; and that relief will be even greater if only we get a really
 good summer this year, and lots of visitors--plenty of invalids, who
 will make the Baths talked about.
 
 Hovstad. And there is a good prospect of that, I hear.
 
 Peter Stockmann. It looks very promising. Inquiries about apartments
 and that sort of thing are reaching us, every day.
 
 Hovstad. Well, the doctor's article will come in very suitably.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Has he been writing something just lately?
 
 Hovstad. This is something he wrote in the winter; a recommendation of
 the Baths--an account of the excellent sanitary conditions here. But I
 held the article over, temporarily.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Ah,--some little difficulty about it, I suppose?
 
 Hovstad. No, not at all; I thought it would be better to wait until the
 spring, because it is just at this time that people begin to think
 seriously about their summer quarters.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Quite right; you were perfectly right, Mr. Hovstad.
 
 Hovstad. Yes, Thomas is really indefatigable when it is a question of
 the Baths.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Well remember, he is the Medical Officer to the Baths.
 
 Hovstad. Yes, and what is more, they owe their existence to him.
 
 Peter Stockmann. To him? Indeed! It is true I have heard from time to
 time that some people are of that opinion. At the same time I must say
 I imagined that I took a modest part in the enterprise.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, that is what Thomas is always saying.
 
 Hovstad. But who denies it, Mr. Stockmann? You set the thing going and
 made a practical concern of it; we all know that. I only meant that the
 idea of it came first from the doctor.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Oh, ideas yes! My brother has had plenty of them in
 his time--unfortunately. But when it is a question of putting an idea
 into practical shape, you have to apply to a man of different mettle.
 Mr. Hovstad. And I certainly should have thought that in this house at
 least...
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. My dear Peter--
 
 Hovstad. How can you think that--?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Won't you go in and have something, Mr. Hovstad? My
 husband is sure to be back directly.
 
 Hovstad. Thank you, perhaps just a morsel. (Goes into the dining-room.)
 
 Peter Stockmann (lowering his voice a little). It is a curious thing
 that these farmers' sons never seem to lose their want of tact.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Surely it is not worth bothering about! Cannot you and
 Thomas share the credit as brothers?
 
 Peter Stockmann. I should have thought so; but apparently some people
 are not satisfied with a share.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. What nonsense! You and Thomas get on so capitally
 together. (Listens.) There he is at last, I think. (Goes out and opens
 the door leading to the hall.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann (laughing and talking outside). Look here--here is
 another guest for you, Katherine. Isn't that jolly! Come in, Captain
 Horster; hang your coat up on this peg. Ah, you don't wear an overcoat.
 Just think, Katherine; I met him in the street and could hardly
 persuade him to come up! (CAPTAIN HORSTER comes into the room and
 greets MRS. STOCKMANN. He is followed by DR. STOCKMANN.) Come along in,
 boys. They are ravenously hungry again, you know. Come along, Captain
 Horster; you must have a slice of beef. (Pushes HORSTER into the
 dining-room. EJLIF and MORTEN go in after them.)
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. But, Thomas, don't you see--?
 
 Dr. Stockmann (turning in the doorway). Oh, is it you, Peter? (Shakes
 hands with him.) Now that is very delightful.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Unfortunately I must go in a moment--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Rubbish! There is some toddy just coming in. You haven't
 forgotten the toddy, Katherine?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Of course not; the water is boiling now. (Goes into the
 dining-room.)
 
 Peter Stockmann. Toddy too!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, sit down and we will have it comfortably.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Thanks, I never care about an evening's drinking.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. But this isn't an evening's drinking.
 
 Peter Stockmann. It seems to me--. (Looks towards the dining-room.) It
 is extraordinary how they can put away all that food.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (rubbing his hands). Yes, isn't it splendid to see young
 people eat? They have always got an appetite, you know! That's as it
 should be. Lots of food--to build up their strength! They are the
 people who are going to stir up the fermenting forces of the future,
 Peter.
 
 Peter Stockmann. May I ask what they will find here to "stir up," as
 you put it?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Ah, you must ask the young people that--when the times
 comes. We shan't be able to see it, of course. That stands to
 reason--two old fogies, like us.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Really, really! I must say that is an extremely odd
 expression to--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Oh, you mustn't take me too literally, Peter. I am so
 heartily happy and contented, you know. I think it is such an
 extraordinary piece of good fortune to be in the middle of all this
 growing, germinating life. It is a splendid time to live in! It is as
 if a whole new world were being created around one.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Do you really think so?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Ah, naturally you can't appreciate it as keenly as I.
 You have lived all your life in these surroundings, and your
 impressions have been blunted. But I, who have been buried all these
 years in my little corner up north, almost without ever seeing a
 stranger who might bring new ideas with him--well, in my case it has
 just the same effect as if I had been transported into the middle of a
 crowded city.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Oh, a city--!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I know, I know; it is all cramped enough here, compared
 with many other places. But there is life here--there is promise--there
 are innumerable things to work for and fight for; and that is the main
 thing. (Calls.) Katherine, hasn't the postman been here?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (from the dining-room). No.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And then to be comfortably off, Peter! That is something
 one learns to value, when one has been on the brink of starvation, as
 we have.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Oh, surely--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Indeed I can assure you we have often been very hard put
 to it, up there. And now to be able to live like a lord! Today, for
 instance, we had roast beef for dinner--and, what is more, for supper
 too. Won't you come and have a little bit? Or let me show it you, at
 any rate? Come here--
 
 Peter Stockmann. No, no--not for worlds!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Well, but just come here then. Do you see, we have got a
 table-cover?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Yes, I noticed it.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And we have got a lamp-shade too. Do you see? All out of
 Katherine's savings! It makes the room so cosy. Don't you think so?
 Just stand here for a moment--no, no, not there--just here, that's it!
 Look now, when you get the light on it altogether. I really think it
 looks very nice, doesn't it?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Oh, if you can afford luxuries of this kind--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, I can afford it now. Katherine tells me I earn
 almost as much as we spend.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Almost--yes!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. But a scientific man must live in a little bit of style.
 I am quite sure an ordinary civil servant spends more in a year than I
 do.
 
 Peter Stockmann. I daresay. A civil servant--a man in a well-paid
 position...
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Well, any ordinary merchant, then! A man in that
 position spends two or three times as much as--
 
 Peter Stockmann. It just depends on circumstances.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. At all events I assure you I don't waste money
 unprofitably. But I can't find it in my heart to deny myself the
 pleasure of entertaining my friends. I need that sort of thing, you
 know. I have lived for so long shut out of it all, that it is a
 necessity of life to me to mix with young, eager, ambitious men, men of
 liberal and active minds; and that describes every one of those fellows
 who are enjoying their supper in there. I wish you knew more of Hovstad.
 
 Peter Stockmann. By the way, Hovstad was telling me he was going to
 print another article of yours.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. An article of mine?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Yes, about the Baths. An article you wrote in the
 winter.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Oh, that one! No, I don't intend that to appear just for
 the present.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Why not? It seems to me that this would be the most
 opportune moment.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, very likely--under normal conditions. (Crosses the
 room.)
 
 Peter Stockmann (following him with his eyes). Is there anything
 abnormal about the present conditions?
 
 Dr. Stockmann (standing still). To tell you the truth, Peter, I can't
 say just at this moment--at all events not tonight. There may be much
 that is very abnormal about the present conditions--and it is possible
 there may be nothing abnormal about them at all. It is quite possible
 it may be merely my imagination.
 
 Peter Stockmann. I must say it all sounds most mysterious. Is there
 something going on that I am to be kept in ignorance of? I should have
 imagined that I, as Chairman of the governing body of the Baths--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And I should have imagined that I--. Oh, come, don't let
 us fly out at one another, Peter.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Heaven forbid! I am not in the habit of flying out at
 people, as you call it. But I am entitled to request most emphatically
 that all arrangements shall be made in a businesslike manner, through
 the proper channels, and shall be dealt with by the legally constituted
 authorities. I can allow no going behind our backs by any roundabout
 means.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Have I ever at any time tried to go behind your backs?
 
 Peter Stockmann. You have an ingrained tendency to take your own way,
 at all events; and, that is almost equally inadmissible in a well
 ordered community, The individual ought undoubtedly to acquiesce in
 subordinating himself to the community--or, to speak more accurately,
 to the authorities who have the care of the community's welfare.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Very likely. But what the deuce has all this got to do
 with me?
 
 Peter Stockmann. That is exactly what you never appear to be willing to
 learn, my dear Thomas. But, mark my words, some day you will have to
 suffer for it--sooner or later. Now I have told you. Good-bye.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Have you taken leave of your senses? You are on the
 wrong scent altogether.
 
 Peter Stockmann. I am not usually that. You must excuse me now if I--
 (calls into the dining-room). Good night, Katherine. Good night,
 gentlemen. (Goes out.)
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (coming from the dining-room). Has he gone?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, and in such a bad temper.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. But, dear Thomas, what have you been doing to him again?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Nothing at all. And, anyhow, he can't oblige me to make
 my report before the proper time.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. What have you got to make a report to him about?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Hm! Leave that to me, Katherine. It is an extraordinary
 thing that the postman doesn't come.
 
 (HOVSTAD, BILLING and HORSTER have got up from the table and come into
 the sitting-room. EJLIF and MORTEN come in after them.)
 
 Billing (stretching himself). Ah!--one feels a new man after a meal
 like that.
 
 Hovstad. The mayor wasn't in a very sweet temper tonight, then.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. It is his stomach; he has wretched digestion.
 
 Hovstad. I rather think it was us two of the "People's Messenger" that
 he couldn't digest.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. I thought you came out of it pretty well with him.
 
 Hovstad. Oh yes; but it isn't anything more than a sort of truce.
 
 Billing. That is just what it is! That word sums up the situation.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. We must remember that Peter is a lonely man, poor chap.
 He has no home comforts of any kind; nothing but everlasting business.
 And all that infernal weak tea wash that he pours into himself! Now
 then, my boys, bring chairs up to the table. Aren't we going to have
 that toddy, Katherine?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (going into the dining-room). I am just getting it.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Sit down here on the couch beside me, Captain Horster.
 We so seldom see you. Please sit down, my friends. (They sit down at
 the table. MRS. STOCKMANN brings a tray, with a spirit-lamp, glasses,
 bottles, etc., upon it.)
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. There you are! This is arrack, and this is rum, and
 this one is the brandy. Now every one must help themselves.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (taking a glass). We will. (They all mix themselves some
 toddy.) And let us have the cigars. Ejlif, you know where the box is.
 And you, Morten, can fetch my pipe. (The two boys go into the room on
 the right.) I have a suspicion that Ejlif pockets a cigar now and
 then!--but I take no notice of it. (Calls out.) And my smoking-cap too,
 Morten. Katherine, you can tell him where I left it. Ah, he has got it.
 (The boys bring the various things.) Now, my friends. I stick to my
 pipe, you know. This one has seen plenty of bad weather with me up
 north. (Touches glasses with them.) Your good health! Ah, it is good to
 be sitting snug and warm here.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (who sits knitting). Do you sail soon, Captain Horster?
 
 Horster. I expect to be ready to sail next week.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. I suppose you are going to America?
 
 Horster. Yes, that is the plan.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Then you won't be able to take part in the coming
 election?
 
 Horster. Is there going to be an election?
 
 Billing. Didn't you know?
 
 Horster. No, I don't mix myself up with those things.
 
 Billing. But do you not take an interest in public affairs?
 
 Horster. No, I don't know anything about politics.
 
 Billing. All the same, one ought to vote, at any rate.
 
 Horster. Even if one doesn't know anything about what is going on?
 
 Billing. Doesn't know! What do you mean by that? A community is like a
 ship; everyone ought to be prepared to take the helm.
 
 Horster. Maybe that is all very well on shore; but on board ship it
 wouldn't work.
 
 Hovstad. It is astonishing how little most sailors care about what goes
 on on shore.
 
 Billing. Very extraordinary.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Sailors are like birds of passage; they feel equally at
 home in any latitude. And that is only an additional reason for our
 being all the more keen, Hovstad. Is there to be anything of public
 interest in tomorrow's "Messenger"?
 
 Hovstad. Nothing about municipal affairs. But the day after tomorrow I
 was thinking of printing your article--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Ah, devil take it--my article! Look here, that must wait
 a bit.
 
 Hovstad. Really? We had just got convenient space for it, and I thought
 it was just the opportune moment--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, yes, very likely you are right; but it must wait
 all the same. I will explain to you later. (PETRA comes in from the
 hall, in hat and cloak and with a bundle of exercise books under her
 arm.)
 
 Petra. Good evening.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Good evening, Petra; come along.
 
 (Mutual greetings; PETRA takes off her things and puts them down on a
 chair by the door.)
 
 Petra. And you have all been sitting here enjoying yourselves, while I
 have been out slaving!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Well, come and enjoy yourself too!
 
 Billing. May I mix a glass for you?
 
 Petra (coming to the table). Thanks, I would rather do it; you always
 mix it too strong. But I forgot, father--I have a letter for you. (Goes
 to the chair where she has laid her things.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann. A letter? From whom?
 
 Petra (looking in her coat pocket). The postman gave it to me just as I
 was going out.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (getting up and going to her). And you only give to me
 now!
 
 Petra. I really had not time to run up again. There it is!
 
 Dr. Stockmann (seizing the letter). Let's see, let's see, child! (Looks
 at the address.) Yes, that's all right!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Is it the one you have been expecting go anxiously,
 Thomas?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, it is. I must go to my room now and-- Where shall I
 get a light, Katherine? Is there no lamp in my room again?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, your lamp is already lit on your desk.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Good, good. Excuse me for a moment--, (Goes into his
 study.)
 
 Petra. What do you suppose it is, mother?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. I don't know; for the last day or two he has always
 been asking if the postman has not been.
 
 Billing. Probably some country patient.
 
 Petra. Poor old dad!--he will overwork himself soon. (Mixes a glass for
 herself.) There, that will taste good!
 
 Hovstad. Have you been teaching in the evening school again today?
 
 Petra (sipping from her glass). Two hours.
 
 Billing. And four hours of school in the morning?
 
 Petra. Five hours.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. And you have still got exercises to correct, I see.
 
 Petra. A whole heap, yes.
 
 Horster. You are pretty full up with work too, it seems to me.
 
 Petra. Yes--but that is good. One is so delightfully tired after it.
 
 Billing. Do you like that?
 
 Petra. Yes, because one sleeps so well then.
 
 Morten. You must be dreadfully wicked, Petra.
 
 Petra. Wicked?
 
 Morten. Yes, because you work so much. Mr. Rorlund says work is a
 punishment for our sins.
 
 Ejlif. Pooh, what a duffer, you are, to believe a thing like that!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Come, come, Ejlif!
 
 Billing (laughing). That's capital!
 
 Hovstad. Don't you want to work as hard as that, Morten?
 
 Morten. No, indeed I don't.
 
 Hovstad. What do you want to be, then?
 
 Morten. I should like best to be a Viking,
 
 Ejlif. You would have to be a pagan then.
 
 Morten. Well, I could become a pagan, couldn't I?
 
 Billing. I agree with you, Morten! My sentiments, exactly.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (signalling to him). I am sure that is not true, Mr.
 Billing.
 
 Billing. Yes, I swear it is! I am a pagan, and I am proud of it.
 Believe me, before long we shall all be pagans.
 
 Morten. And then shall be allowed to do anything we like?
 
 Billing. Well, you'll see, Morten.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. You must go to your room now, boys; I am sure you have
 some lessons to learn for tomorrow.
 
 Ejlif. I should like so much to stay a little longer--
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. No, no; away you go, both of you, (The boys say good
 night and go into the room on the left.)
 
 Hovstad. Do you really think it can do the boys any harm to hear such
 things?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. I don't know; but I don't like it.
 
 Petra. But you know, mother, I think you really are wrong about it.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Maybe, but I don't like it--not in our own home.
 
 Petra. There is so much falsehood both at home and at school. At home
 one must not speak, and at school we have to stand and tell lies to the
 children.
 
 Horster. Tell lies?
 
 Petra. Yes, don't you suppose we have to teach them all sorts of things
 that we don't believe?
 
 Billing. That is perfectly true.
 
 Petra. If only I had the means, I would start a school of my own; and
 it would be conducted on very different lines.
 
 Billing. Oh, bother the means--!
 
 Horster. Well if you are thinking of that, Miss Stockmann, I shall be
 delighted to provide you with a schoolroom. The great big old house my
 father left me is standing almost empty; there is an immense
 dining-room downstairs--
 
 Petra (laughing). Thank you very much; but I am afraid nothing will
 come of it.
 
 Hovstad. No, Miss Petra is much more likely to take to journalism, I
 expect. By the way, have you had time to do anything with that English
 story you promised to translate for us?
 
 Petra. No, not yet, but you shall have it in good time.
 
 (DR. STOCKMANN comes in from his room with an open letter in his hand.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann (waving the letter). Well, now the town will have
 something new to talk about, I can tell you!
 
 Billing. Something new?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. What is this?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. A great discovery, Katherine.
 
 Hovstad. Really?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. A discovery of yours?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. A discovery of mine. (Walks up and down.) Just let them
 come saying, as usual, that it is all fancy and a crazy man's
 imagination! But they will be careful what they say this time, I can
 tell you!
 
 Petra. But, father, tell us what it is.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, yes--only give me time, and you shall know all
 about it. If only I had Peter here now! It just shows how we men can go
 about forming our judgments, when in reality we are as blind as any
 moles--
 
 Hovstad. What are you driving at, Doctor?
 
 Dr. Stockmann (standing still by the table). Isn't it the universal
 opinion that our town is a healthy spot?
 
 Hovstad. Certainly.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Quite an unusually healthy spot, in fact--a place that
 deserves to be recommended in the warmest possible manner either for
 invalids or for people who are well--
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, but my dear Thomas--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And we have been recommending it and praising it--I have
 written and written, both in the "Messenger" and in pamphlets...
 
 Hovstad. Well, what then?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And the Baths--we have called them the "main artery of
 the town's life-blood," the "nerve-centre of our town," and the devil
 knows what else--
 
 Billing. "The town's pulsating heart" was the expression I once used on
 an important occasion.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Quite so. Well, do you know what they really are, these
 great, splendid, much praised Baths, that have cost so much money--do
 you know what they are?
 
 Hovstad. No, what are they?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, what are they?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. The whole place is a pest-house!
 
 Petra. The Baths, father?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (at the same time), Our Baths?
 
 Hovstad. But, Doctor--
 
 Billing. Absolutely incredible!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. The whole Bath establishment is a whited, poisoned
 sepulchre, I tell you--the gravest possible danger to the public
 health! All the nastiness up at Molledal, all that stinking filth, is
 infecting the water in the conduit-pipes leading to the reservoir; and
 the same cursed, filthy poison oozes out on the shore too--
 
 Horster. Where the bathing-place is?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Just there.
 
 Hovstad. How do you come to be so certain of all this, Doctor?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I have investigated the matter most conscientiously. For
 a long time past I have suspected something of the kind. Last year we
 had some very strange cases of illness among the visitors--typhoid
 cases, and cases of gastric fever--
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, that is quite true.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. At the time, we supposed the visitors had been infected
 before they came; but later on, in the winter, I began to have a
 different opinion; and so I set myself to examine the water, as well as
 I could.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Then that is what you have been so busy with?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Indeed I have been busy, Katherine. But here I had none
 of the necessary scientific apparatus; so I sent samples, both of the
 drinking-water and of the sea-water, up to the University, to have an
 accurate analysis made by a chemist.
 
 Hovstad. And have you got that?
 
 Dr. Stockmann (showing him the letter). Here it is! It proves the
 presence of decomposing organic matter in the water--it is full of
 infusoria. The water is absolutely dangerous to use, either internally
 or externally.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. What a mercy you discovered it in time.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. You may well say so.
 
 Hovstad. And what do you propose to do now, Doctor?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. To see the matter put right, naturally.
 
 Hovstad. Can that be done?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. It must be done. Otherwise the Baths will be absolutely
 useless and wasted. But we need not anticipate that; I have a very
 clear idea what we shall have to do.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. But why have you kept this all so secret, dear?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Do you suppose I was going to run about the town
 gossiping about it, before I had absolute proof? No, thank you. I am
 not such a fool.
 
 Petra. Still, you might have told us--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Not a living soul. But tomorrow you may run around to
 the old Badger--
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Oh, Thomas! Thomas!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Well, to your grandfather, then. The old boy will have
 something to be astonished at! I know he thinks I am cracked--and there
 are lots of other people who think so too, I have noticed. But now
 these good folks shall see--they shall just see! (Walks about, rubbing
 his hands.) There will be a nice upset in the town, Katherine; you
 can't imagine what it will be. All the conduit-pipes will have to be
 relaid.
 
 Hovstad (getting up). All the conduit-pipes--?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, of course. The intake is too low down; it will have
 to be lifted to a position much higher up.
 
 Petra. Then you were right after all.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Ah, you remember, Petra--I wrote opposing the plans
 before the work was begun. But at that time no one would listen to me.
 Well, I am going to let them have it now.  Of course I have prepared a
 report for the Baths Committee; I have had it ready for a week, and was
 only waiting for this to come. (Shows the letter.) Now it shall go off
 at once. (Goes into his room and comes back with some papers.) Look at
 that! Four closely written sheets!--and the letter shall go with them.
 Give me a bit of paper, Katherine--something to wrap them up in. That
 will do! Now give it to-to-(stamps his foot)--what the deuce is her
 name?--give it to the maid, and tell her to take it at once to the
 Mayor.
 
 (Mrs. Stockmann takes the packet and goes out through the dining-room.)
 
 Petra. What do you think Uncle Peter will say, father?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. What is there for him to say? I should think he would be
 very glad that such an important truth has been brought to light.
 
 Hovstad. Will you let me print a short note about your discovery in the
 "Messenger?"
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I shall be very much obliged if you will.
 
 Hovstad. It is very desirable that the public should be informed of it
 without delay.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Certainly.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (coming back). She has just gone with it.
 
 Billing. Upon my soul, Doctor, you are going to be the foremost man in
 the town!
 
  Dr. Stockmann (walking about happily). Nonsense! As a matter of
 fact I have done nothing more than my duty. I have only made a lucky
 find--that's all. Still, all the same...
 
 Billing. Hovstad, don't you think the town ought to give Dr. Stockmann
 some sort of testimonial?
 
 Hovstad. I will suggest it, anyway.
 
 Billing. And I will speak to Aslaksen about it.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. No, my good friends, don't let us have any of that
 nonsense. I won't hear anything of the kind. And if the Baths Committee
 should think of voting me an increase of salary, I will not accept it.
 Do you hear, Katherine?--I won't accept it.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. You are quite right, Thomas.
 
 Petra (lifting her glass). Your health, father!
 
 Hovstad and Billing. Your health, Doctor! Good health!
 
 Horster (touches glasses with DR. STOCKMANN). I hope it will bring you
 nothing but good luck.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Thank you, thank you, my dear fellows! I feel
 tremendously happy! It is a splendid thing for a man to be able to feel
 that he has done a service to his native town and to his
 fellow-citizens. Hurrah, Katherine! (He puts his arms round her and
 whirls her round and round, while she protests with laughing cries.
 They all laugh, clap their hands, and cheer the DOCTOR. The boys put
 their heads in at the door to see what is going on.)
 
 
 
 
 ACT II
 
 
 (SCENE,--The same. The door into the dining room is shut. It is
 morning. MRS. STOCKMANN, with a sealed letter in her hand, comes in
 from the dining room, goes to the door of the DOCTOR'S study, and peeps
 in.)
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Are you in, Thomas?
 
 Dr. Stockmann (from within his room). Yes, I have just come in. (Comes
 into the room.) What is it?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. A letter from your brother.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Aha, let us see! (Opens the letter and reads:) "I return
 herewith the manuscript you sent me" (reads on in a low murmur) H'm!--
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. What does he say?
 
 Dr. Stockmann (putting the papers in his pocket). Oh, he only writes
 that he will come up here himself about midday.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Well, try and remember to be at home this time.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. That will be all right; I have got through all my
 morning visits.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. I am extremely curious to know how he takes it.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. You will see he won't like it's having been I, and not
 he, that made the discovery.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Aren't you a little nervous about that?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Oh, he really will be pleased enough, you know. But, at
 the same time, Peter is so confoundedly afraid of anyone's doing any
 service to the town except himself.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. I will tell you what, Thomas--you should be good
 natured, and share the credit of this with him. Couldn't you make out
 that it was he who set you on the scent of this discovery?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I am quite willing. If only I can get the thing set
 right. I--
 
 (MORTEN KIIL puts his head in through the door leading from the hall,
 looks around in an enquiring manner, and chuckles.)
 
 Morten Kiil (slyly). Is it--is it true?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (going to the door). Father!--is it you?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Ah, Mr. Kiil--good morning, good morning!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. But come along in.
 
 Morten Kiil. If it is true, I will; if not, I am off.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. If what is true?
 
 Morten Kiil. This tale about the water supply, is it true?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Certainly it is true, but how did you come to hear it?
 
 Morten Kid (coming in). Petra ran in on her way to the school--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Did she?
 
 Morten Kiil. Yes; and she declares that--I thought she was only making
 a fool of me--but it isn't like Petra to do that.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Of course not. How could you imagine such a thing!
 
 Morten Kiil. Oh well, it is better never to trust anybody; you may find
 you have been made a fool of before you know where you are. But it is
 really true, all the same?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. You can depend upon it that it is true. Won't you sit
 down? (Settles him on the couch.) Isn't it a real bit of luck for the
 town--
 
 Morten Kiil (suppressing his laughter). A bit of luck for the town?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, that I made the discovery in good time.
 
 Morten Kiil (as before). Yes, yes, Yes!--But I should never have
 thought you the sort of man to pull your own brother's leg like this!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Pull his leg!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Really, father dear--
 
 Morten Kiil (resting his hands and his chin on the handle of his stick
 and winking slyly at the DOCTOR). Let me see, what was the story? Some
 kind of beast that had got into the water-pipes, wasn't it?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Infusoria--yes.
 
 Morten Kiil. And a lot of these beasts had got in, according to
 Petra--a tremendous lot.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Certainly; hundreds of thousands of them, probably.
 
 Morten Kiil. But no one can see them--isn't that so?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes; you can't see them,
 
 Morten Kiil (with a quiet chuckle). Damn--it's the finest story I have
 ever heard!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. What do you mean?
 
 Morten Kiil. But you will never get the Mayor to believe a thing like
 that.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. We shall see.
 
 Morten Kiil. Do you think he will be fool enough to--?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I hope the whole town will be fools enough.
 
 Morten Kiil. The whole town! Well, it wouldn't be a bad thing. It would
 just serve them right, and teach them a lesson. They think themselves
 so much cleverer than we old fellows. They hounded me out of the
 council; they did, I tell you--they hounded me out. Now they shall pay
 for it. You pull their legs too, Thomas!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Really, I--
 
 Morten Kiil. You pull their legs! (Gets up.) If you can work it so that
 the Mayor and his friends all swallow the same bait, I will give ten
 pounds to a charity--like a shot!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. That is very kind of you.
 
 Morten Kiil. Yes, I haven't got much money to throw away, I can tell
 you; but, if you can work this, I will give five pounds to a charity at
 Christmas.
 
 (HOVSTAD comes in by the hall door.)
 
 Hovstad. Good morning! (Stops.) Oh, I beg your pardon
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Not at all; come in.
 
 Morten Kiil (with another chuckle). Oho!--is he in this too?
 
 Hovstad. What do you mean?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Certainly he is.
 
 Morten Kiil. I might have known it! It must get into the papers. You
 know how to do it, Thomas! Set your wits to work. Now I must go.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Won't you stay a little while?
 
 Morten Kiil. No, I must be off now. You keep up this game for all it is
 worth; you won't repent it, I'm damned if you will!
 
 (He goes out; MRS. STOCKMANN follows him into the hall.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann (laughing). Just imagine--the old chap doesn't believe a
 word of all this about the water supply.
 
 Hovstad. Oh that was it, then?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, that was what we were talking about. Perhaps it is
 the same thing that brings you here?
 
 Hovstad. Yes, it is, Can you spare me a few minutes, Doctor?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. As long as you like, my dear fellow.
 
 Hovstad. Have you heard from the Mayor yet?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Not yet. He is coming here later.
 
 Hovstad. I have given the matter a great deal of thought since last
 night.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Well?
 
 Hovstad. From your point of view, as a doctor and a man of science,
 this affair of the water supply is an isolated matter. I mean, you do
 not realise that it involves a great many other things.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. How, do you mean?--Let us sit down, my dear fellow. No,
 sit here on the couch. (HOVSTAD Sits down on the couch, DR. STOCKMANN
 On a chair on the other side of the table.) Now then. You mean that--?
 
 Hovstad. You said yesterday that the pollution of the water was due to
 impurities in the soil.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, unquestionably it is due to that poisonous morass
 up at Molledal.
 
 Hovstad. Begging your pardon, Doctor, I fancy it is due to quite
 another morass altogether.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. What morass?
 
 Hovstad. The morass that the whole life of our town is built on and is
 rotting in.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. What the deuce are you driving at, Hovstad?
 
 Hovstad. The whole of the town's interests have, little by little, got
 into the hands of a pack of officials.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Oh, come!--they are not all officials.
 
 Hovstad. No, but those that are not officials are at any rate the
 officials' friends and adherents; it is the wealthy folk, the old
 families in the town, that have got us entirely in their hands.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, but after all they are men of ability and knowledge.
 
 Hovstad. Did they show any ability or knowledge when they laid the
 conduit pipes where they are now?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. No, of course that was a great piece of stupidity on
 their part. But that is going to be set right now.
 
 Hovstad. Do you think that will be all such plain sailing?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Plain sailing or no, it has got to be done, anyway.
 
 Hovstad. Yes, provided the press takes up the question.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I don't think that will be necessary, my dear fellow, I
 am certain my brother--
 
 Hovstad. Excuse me, doctor; I feel bound to tell you I am inclined to
 take the matter up.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. In the paper?
 
 Hovstad. Yes. When I took over the "People's Messenger" my idea was to
 break up this ring of self-opinionated old fossils who had got hold of
 all the influence.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. But you know you told me yourself what the result had
 been; you nearly ruined your paper.
 
 Hovstad. Yes, at the time we were obliged to climb down a peg or two,
 it is quite true--because there was a danger of the whole project of
 the Baths coming to nothing if they failed us. But now the scheme has
 been carried through, and we can dispense with these grand gentlemen.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Dispense with them, yes; but, we owe them a great debt
 of gratitude.
 
 Hovstad. That shall be recognised ungrudgingly, But a journalist of my
 democratic tendencies cannot let such an opportunity as this slip. The
 bubble of official infallibility must be pricked. This superstition
 must be destroyed, like any other.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I am whole-heartedly with you in that, Mr. Hovstad; if
 it is a superstition, away with it!
 
 Hovstad. I should be very reluctant to bring the Mayor into it, because
 he is your brother. But I am sure you will agree with me that truth
 should be the first consideration.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. That goes without saying. (With sudden emphasis.) Yes,
 but--but--
 
 Hovstad. You must not misjudge me. I am neither more self-interested
 nor more ambitious than most men.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. My dear fellow--who suggests anything of the kind?
 
 Hovstad. I am of humble origin, as you know; and that has given me
 opportunities of knowing what is the most crying need in the humbler
 ranks of life. It is that they should be allowed some part in the
 direction of public affairs, Doctor. That is what will develop their
 faculties and intelligence and self respect--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I quite appreciate that.
 
 Hovstad. Yes--and in my opinion a journalist incurs a heavy
 responsibility if he neglects a favourable opportunity of emancipating
 the masses--the humble and oppressed. I know well enough that in
 exalted circles I shall be called an agitator, and all that sort of
 thing; but they may call what they like. If only my conscience doesn't
 reproach me, then--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Quite right! Quite right, Mr. Hovstad. But all the
 same--devil take it! (A knock is heard at the door.) Come in!
 
 (ASLAKSEN appears at the door. He is poorly but decently dressed, in
 black, with a slightly crumpled white neckcloth; he wears gloves and
 has a felt hat in his hand.)
 
 Aslaksen (bowing). Excuse my taking the liberty, Doctor--
 
 Dr. Stockmann (getting up). Ah, it is you, Aslaksen!
 
 Aslaksen. Yes, Doctor.
 
 Hovstad (standing up). Is it me you want, Aslaksen?
 
 Aslaksen. No; I didn't know I should find you here. No, it was the
 Doctor I--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I am quite at your service. What is it?
 
 Aslaksen. Is what I heard from Mr. Billing true, sir--that you mean to
 improve our water supply?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, for the Baths.
 
 Aslaksen. Quite so, I understand. Well, I have come to say that I will
 back that up by every means in my power.
 
 Hovstad (to the DOCTOR). You see!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I shall be very grateful to you, but--
 
 Aslaksen. Because it may be no bad thing to have us small tradesmen at
 your back. We form, as it were, a compact majority in the town--if we
 choose. And it is always a good thing to have the majority with you,
 Doctor.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. That is undeniably true; but I confess I don't see why
 such unusual precautions should be necessary in this case. It seems to
 me that such a plain, straightforward thing.
 
 Aslaksen. Oh, it may be very desirable, all the same. I know our local
 authorities so well; officials are not generally very ready to act on
 proposals that come from other people. That is why I think it would not
 be at all amiss if we made a little demonstration.
 
 Hovstad. That's right.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Demonstration, did you say? What on earth are you going
 to make a demonstration about?
 
 Aslaksen. We shall proceed with the greatest moderation, Doctor.
 Moderation is always my aim; it is the greatest virtue in a citizen--at
 least, I think so.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. It is well known to be a characteristic of yours, Mr.
 Aslaksen.
 
 Aslaksen. Yes, I think I may pride myself on that. And this matter of
 the water supply is of the greatest importance to us small tradesmen.
 The Baths promise to be a regular gold-mine for the town. We shall all
 make our living out of them, especially those of us who are
 householders. That is why we will back up the project as strongly as
 possible. And as I am at present Chairman of the Householders'
 Association.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes--?
 
 Aslaksen. And, what is more, local secretary of the Temperance
 Society--you know, sir, I suppose, that I am a worker in the temperance
 cause?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Of course, of course.
 
 Aslaksen. Well, you can understand that I come into contact with a
 great many people. And as I have the reputation of a temperate and
 law-abiding citizen--like yourself, Doctor--I have a certain influence
 in the town, a little bit of power, if I may be allowed to say so.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I know that quite well, Mr. Aslaksen.
 
 Aslaksen. So you see it would be an easy matter for me to set on foot
 some testimonial, if necessary.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. A testimonial?
 
 Aslaksen. Yes, some kind of an address of thanks from the townsmen for
 your share in a matter of such importance to the community. I need
 scarcely say that it would have to be drawn up with the greatest regard
 to moderation, so as not to offend the authorities--who, after all,
 have the reins in their hands. If we pay strict attention to that, no
 one can take it amiss, I should think!
 
 Hovstad. Well, and even supposing they didn't like it--
 
 Aslaksen. No, no, no; there must be no discourtesy to the authorities,
 Mr. Hovstad. It is no use falling foul of those upon whom our welfare
 so closely depends. I have done that in my time, and no good ever comes
 of it. But no one can take exception to a reasonable and frank
 expression of a citizen's views.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (shaking him by the hand). I can't tell you, dear Mr.
 Aslaksen, how extremely pleased I am to find such hearty support among
 my fellow-citizens. I am delighted--delighted! Now, you will take a
 small glass of sherry, eh?
 
 Aslaksen. No, thank you; I never drink alcohol of that kind.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Well, what do you say to a glass of beer, then?
 
 Aslaksen. Nor that either, thank you, Doctor. I never drink anything as
 early as this. I am going into town now to talk this over with one or
 two householders, and prepare the ground.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. It is tremendously kind of you, Mr. Aslaksen; but I
 really cannot understand the necessity for all these precautions. It
 seems to me that the thing should go of itself.
 
 Aslaksen. The authorities are somewhat slow to move, Doctor. Far be it
 from me to seem to blame them--
 
 Hovstad. We are going to stir them up in the paper tomorrow, Aslaksen.
 
 Aslaksen. But not violently, I trust, Mr. Hovstad. Proceed with
 moderation, or you will do nothing with them. You may take my advice; I
 have gathered my experience in the school of life. Well, I must say
 goodbye, Doctor. You know now that we small tradesmen are at your back
 at all events, like a solid wall. You have the compact majority on your
 side Doctor.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I am very much obliged, dear Mr. Aslaksen, (Shakes hands
 with him.) Goodbye, goodbye.
 
 Aslaksen. Are you going my way, towards the printing-office. Mr.
 Hovstad?
 
 Hovstad, I will come later; I have something to settle up first.
 
 Aslaksen. Very well. (Bows and goes out; STOCKMANN follows him into the
 hall.)
 
 Hovstad (as STOCKMANN comes in again). Well, what do you think of that,
 Doctor? Don't you think it is high time we stirred a little life into
 all this slackness and vacillation and cowardice?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Are you referring to Aslaksen?
 
 Hovstad, Yes, I am. He is one of those who are floundering in a
 bog--decent enough fellow though he may be, otherwise. And most of the
 people here are in just the same case--see-sawing and edging first to
 one side and then to the other, so overcome with caution and scruple
 that they never dare to take any decided step.
 
 Dr. Stockmann, Yes, but Aslaksen seemed to me so thoroughly
 well-intentioned.
 
 Hovstad. There is one thing I esteem higher than that; and that is for
 a man to be self-reliant and sure of himself.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I think you are perfectly right there.
 
 Hovstad. That is why I want to seize this opportunity, and try if I
 cannot manage to put a little virility into these well-intentioned
 people for once. The idol of Authority must be shattered in this town.
 This gross and inexcusable blunder about the water supply must be
 brought home to the mind of every municipal voter.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Very well; if you are of opinion that it is for the good
 of the community, so be it. But not until I have had a talk with my
 brother.
 
 Hovstad. Anyway, I will get a leading article ready; and if the Mayor
 refuses to take the matter up--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. How can you suppose such a thing possible!
 
 Hovstad. It is conceivable. And in that case--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. In that case I promise you--. Look here, in that case
 you may print my report--every word of it.
 
 Hovstad. May I? Have I your word for it?
 
 Dr. Stockmann (giving him the MS.). Here it is; take it with you. It
 can do no harm for you to read it through, and you can give it me back
 later on.
 
 Hovstad. Good, good! That is what I will do. And now goodbye, Doctor.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Goodbye, goodbye. You will see everything will run quite
 smoothly, Mr. Hovstad--quite smoothly.
 
 Hovstad. Hm!--we shall see. (Bows and goes out.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann (opens the dining-room door and looks in). Katherine! Oh,
 you are back, Petra?
 
 Petra (coming in). Yes, I have just come from the school.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (coming in). Has he not been here yet?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Peter? No, but I have had a long talk with Hovstad. He
 is quite excited about my discovery, I find it has a much wider bearing
 than I at first imagined. And he has put his paper at my disposal if
 necessity should arise.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Do you think it will?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Not for a moment. But at all events it makes me feel
 proud to know that I have the liberal-minded independent press on my
 side. Yes, and just imagine--I have had a visit from the Chairman of
 the Householders' Association!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Oh! What did he want?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. To offer me his support too. They will support me in a
 body if it should be necessary. Katherine--do you know what I have got
 behind me?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Behind you? No, what have you got behind you?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. The compact majority.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Really? Is that a good thing for you Thomas?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I should think it was a good thing. (Walks up and down
 rubbing his hands.) By Jove, it's a fine thing to feel this bond of
 brotherhood between oneself and one's fellow citizens!
 
 Petra. And to be able to do so much that is good and useful, father!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And for one's own native town into the bargain, my child!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. That was a ring at the bell.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. It must be he, then. (A knock is heard at the door.)
 Come in!
 
 Peter Stockmann (comes in from the hall). Good morning.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Glad to see you, Peter!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Good morning, Peter, How are you?
 
 Peter Stockmann. So so, thank you. (To DR. STOCKMANN.) I received from
 you yesterday, after office hours, a report dealing with the condition
 of the water at the Baths.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes. Have you read it?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Yes, I have,
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And what have you to say to it?
 
 Peter Stockmann (with a sidelong glance). Hm!--
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Come along, Petra. (She and PETRA go into the room on
 the left.)
 
 Peter Stockmann (after a pause). Was it necessary to make all these
 investigations behind my back?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, because until I was absolutely certain about it--
 
 Peter Stockmann. Then you mean that you are absolutely certain now?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Surely you are convinced of that.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Is it your intention to bring this document before the
 Baths Committee as a sort of official communication?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Certainly. Something must be done in the matter--and
 that quickly.
 
 Peter Stockmann. As usual, you employ violent expressions in your
 report. You say, amongst other things, that what we offer visitors in
 our Baths is a permanent supply of poison.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Well, can you describe it any other way, Peter? Just
 think--water that is poisonous, whether you drink it or bathe in it!
 And this we offer to the poor sick folk who come to us trustfully and
 pay us at an exorbitant rate to be made well again!
 
 Peter Stockmann. And your reasoning leads you to this conclusion, that
 we must build a sewer to draw off the alleged impurities from Molledal
 and must relay the water conduits.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes. Do you see any other way out of it? I don't.
 
 Peter Stockmann. I made a pretext this morning to go and see the town
 engineer, and, as if only half seriously, broached the subject of these
 proposals as a thing we might perhaps have to take under consideration
 some time later on.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Some time later on!
 
 Peter Stockmann. He smiled at what he considered to be my extravagance,
 naturally. Have you taken the trouble to consider what your proposed
 alterations would cost? According to the information I obtained, the
 expenses would probably mount up to fifteen or twenty thousand pounds.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Would it cost so much?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Yes; and the worst part of it would be that the work
 would take at least two years.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Two years? Two whole years?
 
 Peter Stockmann. At least. And what are we to do with the Baths in the
 meantime? Close them? Indeed we should be obliged to. And do you
 suppose anyone would come near the place after it had got out that the
 water was dangerous?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes but, Peter, that is what it is.
 
 Peter Stockmann. And all this at this juncture--just as the Baths are
 beginning to be known. There are other towns in the neighbourhood with
 qualifications to attract visitors for bathing purposes. Don't you
 suppose they would immediately strain every nerve to divert the entire
 stream of strangers to themselves? Unquestionably they would; and then
 where should we be? We should probably have to abandon the whole thing,
 which has cost us so much money-and then you would have ruined your
 native town.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I--should have ruined--!
 
 Peter Stockmann. It is simply and solely through the Baths that the
 town has before it any future worth mentioning. You know that just as
 well as I.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. But what do you think ought to be done, then?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Your report has not convinced me that the condition of
 the water at the Baths is as bad as you represent it to be.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I tell you it is even worse!--or at all events it will
 be in summer, when the warm weather comes.
 
 Peter Stockmann. As I said, I believe you exaggerate the matter
 considerably. A capable physician ought to know what measures to
 take--he ought to be capable of preventing injurious influences or of
 remedying them if they become obviously persistent.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Well? What more?
 
 Peter Stockmann. The water supply for the Baths is now an established
 fact, and in consequence must be treated as such. But probably the
 Committee, at its discretion, will not be disinclined to consider the
 question of how far it might be possible to introduce certain
 improvements consistently with a reasonable expenditure.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And do you suppose that I will have anything to do with
 such a piece of trickery as that?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Trickery!!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, it would be a trick--a fraud, a lie, a downright
 crime towards the public, towards the whole community!
 
 Peter Stockmann. I have not, as I remarked before, been able to
 convince myself that there is actually any imminent danger.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. You have! It is impossible that you should not be
 convinced. I know I have represented the facts absolutely truthfully
 and fairly. And you know it very well, Peter, only you won't
 acknowledge it. It was owing to your action that both the Baths and the
 water conduits were built where they are; and that is what you won't
 acknowledge--that damnable blunder of yours. Pooh!--do you suppose I
 don't see through you?
 
 Peter Stockmann. And even if that were true? If I perhaps guard my
 reputation somewhat anxiously, it is in the interests of the town.
 Without moral authority I am powerless to direct public affairs as
 seems, to my judgment, to be best for the common good. And on that
 account--and for various other reasons too--it appears to me to be a
 matter of importance that your report should not be delivered to the
 Committee. In the interests of the public, you must withhold it. Then,
 later on, I will raise the question and we will do our best, privately;
 but, nothing of this unfortunate affair not a single word of it--must
 come to the ears of the public.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I am afraid you will not be able to prevent that now, my
 dear Peter.
 
 Peter Stockmann. It must and shall be prevented.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. It is no use, I tell you. There are too many people that
 know about it.
 
 Peter Stockmann. That know about it? Who? Surely you don't mean those
 fellows on the "People's Messenger"?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, they know. The liberal-minded independent press is
 going to see that you do your duty.
 
 Peter Stockmann (after a short pause). You are an extraordinarily
 independent man, Thomas. Have you given no thought to the consequences
 this may have for yourself?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Consequences?--for me?
 
 Peter Stockmann. For you and yours, yes.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. What the deuce do you mean?
 
 Peter Stockmann. I believe I have always behaved in a brotherly way to
 you--haven't I always been ready to oblige or to help you?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, you have, and I am grateful to you for it.
 
 Peter Stockmann. There is no need. Indeed, to some extent I was forced
 to do so--for my own sake. I always hoped that, if I helped to improve
 your financial position, I should be able to keep some check on you.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. What! Then it was only for your own sake--!
 
 Peter Stockmann. Up to a certain point, yes. It is painful for a man in
 an official position to have his nearest relative compromising himself
 time after time.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And do you consider that I do that?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Yes, unfortunately, you do, without even being aware
 of it. You have a restless, pugnacious, rebellious disposition. And
 then there is that disastrous propensity of yours to want to write
 about every sort of possible and impossible thing. The moment an idea
 comes into your head, you must needs go and write a newspaper article
 or a whole pamphlet about it.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Well, but is it not the duty of a citizen to let the
 public share in any new ideas he may have?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Oh, the public doesn't require any new ideas. The
 public is best served by the good, old established ideas it already has.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And that is your honest opinion?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Yes, and for once I must talk frankly to you. Hitherto
 I have tried to avoid doing so, because I know how irritable you are;
 but now I must tell you the truth, Thomas. You have no conception what
 an amount of harm you do yourself by your impetuosity. You complain of
 the authorities, you even complain of the government--you are always
 pulling them to pieces; you insist that you have been neglected and
 persecuted. But what else can such a cantankerous man as you expect?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. What next! Cantankerous, am I?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Yes, Thomas, you are an extremely cantankerous man to
 work with--I know that to my cost. You disregard everything that you
 ought to have consideration for. You seem completely to forget that it
 is me you have to thank for your appointment here as medical officer to
 the Baths.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I was entitled to it as a matter of course!--I and
 nobody else! I was the first person to see that the town could be made
 into a flourishing watering-place, and I was the only one who saw it at
 that time. I had to fight single-handed in support of the idea for many
 years; and I wrote and wrote--
 
 Peter Stockmann. Undoubtedly. But things were not ripe for the scheme
 then--though, of course, you could not judge of that in your
 out-of-the-way corner up north. But as soon as the opportune moment
 came I--and the others--took the matter into our hands.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, and made this mess of all my beautiful plan. It is
 pretty obvious now what clever fellows you were!
 
 Peter Stockmann. To my mind the whole thing only seems to mean that you
 are seeking another outlet for your combativeness. You want to pick a
 quarrel with your superiors--an old habit of yours. You cannot put up
 with any authority over you. You look askance at anyone who occupies a
 superior official position; you regard him as a personal enemy, and
 then any stick is good enough to beat him with. But now I have called
 your attention to the fact that the town's interests are at stake--and,
 incidentally, my own too. And therefore, I must tell you, Thomas, that
 you will find me inexorable with regard to what I am about to require
 you to do.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And what is that?
 
 Peter Stockmann. As you have been so indiscreet as to speak of this
 delicate matter to outsiders, despite the fact that you ought to have
 treated it as entirely official and confidential, it is obviously
 impossible to hush it up now. All sorts of rumours will get about
 directly, and everybody who has a grudge against us will take care to
 embellish these rumours. So it will be necessary for you to refute them
 publicly.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I! How? I don't understand.
 
 Peter Stockmann. What we shall expect is that, after making further
 investigations, you will come to the conclusion that the matter is not
 by any means as dangerous or as critical as you imagined in the first
 instance.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Oho!--so that is what you expect!
 
 Peter Stockmann. And, what is more, we shall expect you to make public
 profession of your confidence in the Committee and in their readiness
 to consider fully and conscientiously what steps may be necessary to
 remedy any possible defects.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. But you will never be able to do that by patching and
 tinkering at it--never! Take my word for it, Peter; I mean what I say,
 as deliberately and emphatically as possible.
 
 Peter Stockmann. As an officer under the Committee, you have no right
 to any individual opinion.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (amazed). No right?
 
 Peter Stockmann. In your official capacity, no. As a private person, it
 is quite another matter. But as a subordinate member of the staff of
 the Baths, you have no right to express any opinion which runs contrary
 to that of your superiors.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. This is too much! I, a doctor, a man of science, have no
 right to--!
 
 Peter Stockmann. The matter in hand is not simply a scientific one. It
 is a complicated matter, and has its economic as well as its technical
 side.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I don't care what it is! I intend to be free to express
 my opinion on any subject under the sun.
 
 Peter Stockmann. As you please--but not on any subject concerning the
 Baths. That we forbid.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (shouting). You forbid--! You! A pack of--
 
 Peter Stockmann.  I forbid it--I, your chief; and if I forbid it, you
 have to obey.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (controlling himself). Peter--if you were not my brother--
 
 Petra (throwing open the door). Father, you shan't stand this!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (coming in after her). Petra, Petra!
 
 Peter Stockmann. Oh, so you have been eavesdropping.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. You were talking so loud, we couldn't help it!
 
 Petra. Yes, I was listening.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Well, after all, I am very glad--
 
 Dr. Stockmann (going up to him). You were saying something about
 forbidding and obeying?
 
 Peter Stockmann. You obliged me to take that tone with you.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And so I am to give myself the lie, publicly?
 
 Peter Stockmann. We consider it absolutely necessary that you should
 make some such public statement as I have asked for.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And if I do not--obey?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Then we shall publish a statement ourselves to
 reassure the public.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Very well; but in that case I shall use my pen against
 you. I stick to what I have said; I will show that I am right and that
 you are wrong. And what will you do then?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Then I shall not be able to prevent your being
 dismissed.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. What--?
 
 Petra. Father--dismissed!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Dismissed!
 
 Peter Stockmann. Dismissed from the staff of the Baths. I shall be
 obliged to propose that you shall immediately be given notice, and
 shall not be allowed any further participation in the Baths' affairs.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. You would dare to do that!
 
 Peter Stockmann. It is you that are playing the daring game.
 
 Petra. Uncle, that is a shameful way to treat a man like father!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Do hold your tongue, Petra!
 
 Peter Stockmann (looking at PETRA). Oh, so we volunteer our opinions
 already, do we? Of course. (To MRS. STOCKMANN.) Katherine, I imagine
 you are the most sensible person in this house. Use any influence you
 may have over your husband, and make him see what this will entail for
 his family as well as--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. My family is my own concern and nobody else's!
 
 Peter Stockmann. --for his own family, as I was saying, as well as for
 the town he lives in.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. It is I who have the real good of the town at heart! I
 want to lay bare the defects that sooner or later must come to the
 light of day. I will show whether I love my native town.
 
 Peter Stockmann. You, who in your blind obstinacy want to cut off the
 most important source of the town's welfare?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. The source is poisoned, man! Are you mad? We are making
 our living by retailing filth and corruption! The whole of our
 flourishing municipal life derives its sustenance from a lie!
 
 Peter Stockmann. All imagination--or something even worse. The man who
 can throw out such offensive insinuations about his native town must be
 an enemy to our community.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (going up to him). Do you dare to--!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (throwing herself between them). Thomas!
 
 Petra (catching her father by the arm). Don't lose your temper, father!
 
 Peter Stockmann. I will not expose myself to violence. Now you have had
 a warning; so reflect on what you owe to yourself and your family.
 Goodbye. (Goes out.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann (walking up and down). Am I to put up with such treatment
 as this? In my own house, Katherine! What do you think of that!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Indeed it is both shameful and absurd, Thomas--
 
 Petra. If only I could give uncle a piece of my mind--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. It is my own fault. I ought to have flown out at him
 long ago!--shown my teeth!--bitten! To hear him call me an enemy to our
 community! Me! I shall not take that lying down, upon my soul!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. But, dear Thomas, your brother has power on his side.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, but I have right on mine, I tell you.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Oh yes, right--right. What is the use of having right
 on your side if you have not got might?
 
 Petra. Oh, mother!--how can you say such a thing!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Do you imagine that in a free country it is no use
 having right on your side? You are absurd, Katherine. Besides, haven't
 I got the liberal-minded, independent press to lead the way, and the
 compact majority behind me? That is might enough, I should think!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. But, good heavens, Thomas, you don't mean to?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Don't mean to what?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. To set yourself up in opposition to your brother.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. In God's name, what else do you suppose I should do but
 take my stand on right and truth?
 
 Petra. Yes, I was just going to say that.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. But it won't do you any earthly good. If they won't do
 it, they won't.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Oho, Katherine! Just give me time, and you will see how
 I will carry the war into their camp.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, you carry the war into their camp, and you get
 your dismissal--that is what you will do.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. In any case I shall have done my duty towards the
 public--towards the community, I, who am called its enemy!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. But towards your family, Thomas? Towards your own home!
 Do you think that is doing your duty towards those you have to provide
 for?
 
 Petra. Ah, don't think always first of us, mother.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Oh, it is easy for you to talk; you are able to shift
 for yourself, if need be. But remember the boys, Thomas; and think a
 little of yourself too, and of me--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I think you are out of your senses, Katherine! If I were
 to be such a miserable coward as to go on my knees to Peter and his
 damned crew, do you suppose I should ever know an hour's peace of mind
 all my life afterwards?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. I don't know anything about that; but God preserve us
 from the peace of mind we shall have, all the same, if you go on
 defying him! You will find yourself again without the means of
 subsistence, with no income to count upon. I should think we had had
 enough of that in the old days. Remember that, Thomas; think what that
 means.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (collecting himself with a struggle and clenching his
 fists). And this is what this slavery can bring upon a free, honourable
 man! Isn't it horrible, Katherine?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, it is sinful to treat you so, it is perfectly
 true. But, good heavens, one has to put up with so much injustice in
 this world. There are the boys, Thomas! Look at them! What is to become
 of them? Oh, no, no, you can never have the heart--. (EJLIF and MORTEN
 have come in, while she was speaking, with their school books in their
 hands.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann. The boys-- I (Recovers himself suddenly.) No, even if
 the whole world goes to pieces, I will never bow my neck to this yokel
 (Goes towards his room.)
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (following him). Thomas--what are you going to do!
 
 Dr. Stockmann (at his door). I mean to have the right to look my sons
 in the face when they are grown men. (Goes into his room.)
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (bursting into tears). God help us all!
 
 Petra. Father is splendid! He will not give in.
 
 (The boys look on in amazement; PETRA signs to them not to speak.)
 
 
 
 
 ACT III
 
 
 (SCENE.--The editorial office of the "People's Messenger." The entrance
 door is on the left-hand side of the back wall; on the right-hand side
 is another door with glass panels through which the printing room can
 be seen. Another door in the right-hand wall. In the middle of the room
 is a large table covered with papers, newspapers and books. In the
 foreground on the left a window, before which stands a desk and a high
 stool. There are a couple of easy chairs by the table, and other chairs
 standing along the wall. The room is dingy and uncomfortable; the
 furniture is old, the chairs stained and torn. In the printing room the
 compositors are seen at work, and a printer is working a handpress.
 HOVSTAD is sitting at the desk, writing. BILLING comes in from the
 right with DR. STOCKMANN'S manuscript in his hand.)
 
 Billing. Well, I must say!
 
 Hovstad (still writing). Have you read it through?
 
 Billing (laying the MS. on the desk). Yes, indeed I have.
 
 Hovstad. Don't you think the Doctor hits them pretty hard?
 
 Billing. Hard? Bless my soul, he's crushing! Every word falls like--how
 shall I put it?--like the blow of a sledgehammer.
 
 Hovstad. Yes, but they are not the people to throw up the sponge at the
 first blow.
 
 Billing. That is true; and for that reason we must strike blow upon
 blow until the whole of this aristocracy tumbles to pieces. As I sat in
 there reading this, I almost seemed to see a revolution in being.
 
 Hovstad (turning round). Hush!--Speak so that Aslaksen cannot hear you.
 
 Billing (lowering his voice). Aslaksen is a chicken-hearted chap, a
 coward; there is nothing of the man in him. But this time you will
 insist on your own way, won't you? You will put the Doctor's article in?
 
 Hovstad. Yes, and if the Mayor doesn't like it--
 
 Billing. That will be the devil of a nuisance.
 
 Hovstad. Well, fortunately we can turn the situation to good account,
 whatever happens. If the Mayor will not fall in with the Doctor's
 project, he will have all the small tradesmen down on him--the whole of
 the Householders' Association and the rest of them. And if he does fall
 in with it, he will fall out with the whole crowd of large shareholders
 in the Baths, who up to now have been his most valuable supporters--
 
 Billing. Yes, because they will certainly have to fork out a pretty
 penny--
 
 Hovstad. Yes, you may be sure they will. And in this way the ring will
 be broken up, you see, and then in every issue of the paper we will
 enlighten the public on the Mayor's incapability on one point and
 another, and make it clear that all the positions of trust in the town,
 the whole control of municipal affairs, ought to be put in the hands of
 the Liberals.
 
 Billing. That is perfectly true! I see it coming--I see it coming; we
 are on the threshold of a revolution!
 
 (A knock is heard at the door.)
 
 Hovstad. Hush! (Calls out.) Come in! (DR. STOCKMANN comes in by the
 street door. HOVSTAD goes to meet him.) Ah, it is you, Doctor! Well?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. You may set to work and print it, Mr. Hovstad!
 
 Hovstad. Has it come to that, then?
 
 Billing. Hurrah!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, print away. Undoubtedly it has come to that. Now
 they must take what they get. There is going to be a fight in the town,
 Mr. Billing!
 
 Billing. War to the knife, I hope! We will get our knives to their
 throats, Doctor!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. This article is only a beginning. I have already got
 four or five more sketched out in my head. Where is Aslaksen?
 
 Billing (calls into the printing-room). Aslaksen, just come here for a
 minute!
 
 Hovstad. Four or five more articles, did you say? On the same subject?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. No--far from it, my dear fellow. No, they are about
 quite another matter. But they all spring from the question of the
 water supply and the drainage. One thing leads to another, you know. It
 is like beginning to pull down an old house, exactly.
 
 Billing. Upon my soul, it's true; you find you are not done till you
 have pulled all the old rubbish down.
 
 Aslaksen (coming in). Pulled down? You are not thinking of pulling down
 the Baths surely, Doctor?
 
 Hovstad. Far from it, don't be afraid.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. No, we meant something quite different. Well, what do
 you think of my article, Mr. Hovstad?
 
 Hovstad. I think it is simply a masterpiece.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Do you really think so? Well, I am very pleased, very
 pleased.
 
 Hovstad. It is so clear and intelligible. One need have no special
 knowledge to understand the bearing of it. You will have every
 enlightened man on your side.
 
 Aslaksen. And every prudent man too, I hope?
 
 Billing. The prudent and the imprudent--almost the whole town.
 
 Aslaksen. In that case we may venture to print it.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I should think so!
 
 Hovstad. We will put it in tomorrow morning.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Of course--you must not lose a single day. What I wanted
 to ask you, Mr. Aslaksen, was if you would supervise the printing of it
 yourself.
 
 Aslaksen. With pleasure.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Take care of it as if it were a treasure! No
 misprints--every word is important. I will look in again a little
 later; perhaps you will be able to let me see a proof. I can't tell you
 how eager I am to see it in print, and see it burst upon the public--
 
 Billing. Burst upon them--yes, like a flash of lightning!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. --and to have it submitted to the judgment of my
 intelligent fellow townsmen. You cannot imagine what I have gone
 through today. I have been threatened first with one thing and then
 with another; they have tried to rob me of my most elementary rights as
 a man--
 
 Billing. What! Your rights as a man!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. --they have tried to degrade me, to make a coward of me,
 to force me to put personal interests before my most sacred convictions.
 
 Billing. That is too much--I'm damned if it isn't.
 
 Hovstad. Oh, you mustn't be surprised at anything from that quarter.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Well, they will get the worst of it with me; they may
 assure themselves of that. I shall consider the "People's Messenger" my
 sheet-anchor now, and every single day I will bombard them with one
 article after another, like bombshells--
 
 Aslaksen. Yes, but
 
 Billing. Hurrah!--it is war, it is war!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I shall smite them to the ground--I shall crush them--I
 shall break down all their defenses, before the eyes of the honest
 public! That is what I shall do!
 
 Aslaksen, Yes, but in moderation, Doctor--proceed with moderation.
 
 Billing. Not a bit of it, not a bit of it! Don't spare the dynamite!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Because it is not merely a question of water-supply and
 drains now, you know. No--it is the whole of our social life that we
 have got to purify and disinfect--
 
 Billing. Spoken like a deliverer!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. All the incapables must be turned out, you
 understand--and that in every walk of life! Endless vistas have opened
 themselves to my mind's eye today. I cannot see it all quite clearly
 yet, but I shall in time. Young and vigorous standard-bearers--those
 are what we need and must seek, my friends; we must have new men in
 command at all our outposts.
 
 Billing. Hear hear!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. We only need to stand by one another, and it will all be
 perfectly easy. The revolution will be launched like a ship that runs
 smoothly off the stocks. Don't you think so?
 
 Hovstad. For my part I think we have now a prospect of getting the
 municipal authority into the hands where it should lie.
 
 Aslaksen. And if only we proceed with moderation, I cannot imagine that
 there will be any risk.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Who the devil cares whether there is any risk or not!
 What I am doing, I am doing in the name of truth and for the sake of my
 conscience.
 
 Hovstad. You are a man who deserves to be supported, Doctor.
 
 Aslaksen. Yes, there is no denying that the Doctor is a true friend to
 the town--a real friend to the community, that he is.
 
 Billing. Take my word for it, Aslaksen, Dr. Stockmann is a friend of
 the people.
 
 Aslaksen. I fancy the Householders' Association will make use of that
 expression before long.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (affected, grasps their hands). Thank you, thank you, my
 dear staunch friends. It is very refreshing to me to hear you say that;
 my brother called me something quite different. By Jove, he shall have
 it back, with interest! But now I must be off to see a poor devil--I
 will come back, as I said. Keep a very careful eye on the manuscript,
 Aslaksen, and don't for worlds leave out any of my notes of
 exclamation! Rather put one or two more in! Capital, capital! Well,
 good-bye for the present--goodbye, goodbye! (They show him to the door,
 and bow him out.)
 
 Hovstad. He may prove an invaluably useful man to us.
 
 Aslaksen. Yes, so long as he confines himself to this matter of the
 Baths. But if he goes farther afield, I don't think it would be
 advisable to follow him.
 
 Hovstad. Hm!--that all depends--
 
 Billing. You are so infernally timid, Aslaksen!
 
 Aslaksen. Timid? Yes, when it is a question of the local authorities, I
 am timid, Mr. Billing; it is a lesson I have learned in the school of
 experience, let me tell you. But try me in higher politics, in matters
 that concern the government itself, and then see if I am timid.
 
 Billing. No, you aren't, I admit. But this is simply contradicting
 yourself.
 
 Aslaksen. I am a man with a conscience, and that is the whole matter.
 If you attack the government, you don't do the community any harm,
 anyway; those fellows pay no attention to attacks, you see--they go on
 just as they are, in spite of them. But local authorities are
 different; they can be turned out, and then perhaps you may get an
 ignorant lot into office who may do irreparable harm to the
 householders and everybody else.
 
 Hovstad. But what of the education of citizens by self
 government--don't you attach any importance to that?
 
 Aslaksen. When a man has interests of his own to protect, he cannot
 think of everything, Mr. Hovstad.
 
 Hovstad. Then I hope I shall never have interests of my own to protect!
 
 Billing. Hear, hear!
 
 Aslaksen (with a smile). Hm! (Points to the desk.) Mr. Sheriff
 Stensgaard was your predecessor at that editorial desk.
 
 Billing (spitting). Bah! That turncoat.
 
 Hovstad. I am not a weathercock--and never will be.
 
 Aslaksen. A politician should never be too certain of anything, Mr.
 Hovstad. And as for you, Mr. Billing, I should think it is time for you
 to be taking in a reef or two in your sails, seeing that you are
 applying for the post of secretary to the Bench.
 
 Billing. I--!
 
 Hovstad. Are you, Billing?
 
 Billing. Well, yes--but you must clearly understand I am only doing it
 to annoy the bigwigs.
 
 Aslaksen. Anyhow, it is no business of mine. But if I am to be accused
 of timidity and of inconsistency in my principles, this is what I want
 to point out: my political past is an open book. I have never changed,
 except perhaps to become a little more moderate, you see. My heart is
 still with the people; but I don't deny that my reason has a certain
 bias towards the authorities--the local ones, I mean. (Goes into the
 printing room.)
 
 Billing. Oughtn't we to try and get rid of him, Hovstad?
 
 Hovstad. Do you know anyone else who will advance the money for our
 paper and printing bill?
 
 Billing. It is an infernal nuisance that we don't possess some capital
 to trade on.
 
 Hovstad (sitting down at his desk). Yes, if we only had that, then--
 
 Billing. Suppose you were to apply to Dr. Stockmann?
 
 Hovstad (turning over some papers). What is the use? He has got nothing.
 
 Billing. No, but he has got a warm man in the background, old Morten
 Kiil--"the Badger," as they call him.
 
 Hovstad (writing). Are you so sure he has got anything?
 
 Billing. Good Lord, of course he has! And some of it must come to the
 Stockmanns. Most probably he will do something for the children, at all
 events.
 
 Hovstad (turning half round). Are you counting on that?
 
 Billing. Counting on it? Of course I am not counting on anything.
 
 Hovstad. That is right. And I should not count on the secretaryship to
 the Bench either, if I were you; for I can assure you--you won't get it.
 
 Billing. Do you think I am not quite aware of that? My object is
 precisely not to get it. A slight of that kind stimulates a man's
 fighting power--it is like getting a supply of fresh bile--and I am
 sure one needs that badly enough in a hole-and-corner place like this,
 where it is so seldom anything happens to stir one up.
 
 Hovstad (writing). Quite so, quite so.
 
 Billing. Ah, I shall be heard of yet!--Now I shall go and write the
 appeal to the Householders' Association. (Goes into the room on the
 right.)
 
 Hovstad (sitting al his desk, biting his penholder, says slowly).
 Hm!--that's it, is it. (A knock is heard.) Come in! (PETRA comes in by
 the outer door. HOVSTAD gets up.) What, you!--here?
 
 Petra. Yes, you must forgive me--
 
 Hovstad (pulling a chair forward). Won't you sit down?
 
 Petra. No, thank you; I must go again in a moment.
 
 Hovstad. Have you come with a message from your father, by any chance?
 
 Petra. No, I have come on my own account. (Takes a book out of her coat
 pocket.) Here is the English story.
 
 Hovstad. Why have you brought it back?
 
 Petra. Because I am not going to translate it.
 
 Hovstad. But you promised me faithfully.
 
 Petra. Yes, but then I had not read it, I don't suppose you have read
 it either?
 
 Hovstad. No, you know quite well I don't understand English; but--
 
 Petra. Quite so. That is why I wanted to tell you that you must find
 something else. (Lays the book on the table.) You can't use this for
 the "People's Messenger."
 
 Hovstad. Why not?
 
 Petra. Because it conflicts with all your opinions.
 
 Hovstad. Oh, for that matter--
 
 Petra. You don't understand me. The burden of this story is that there
 is a supernatural power that looks after the so-called good people in
 this world and makes everything happen for the best in their
 case--while all the so-called bad people are punished.
 
 Hovstad. Well, but that is all right. That is just what our readers
 want.
 
 Petra. And are you going to be the one to give it to them? For myself,
 I do not believe a word of it. You know quite well that things do not
 happen so in reality.
 
 Hovstad. You are perfectly right; but an editor cannot always act as he
 would prefer. He is often obliged to bow to the wishes of the public in
 unimportant matters. Politics are the most important thing in life--for
 a newspaper, anyway; and if I want to carry my public with me on the
 path that leads to liberty and progress, I must not frighten them away.
 If they find a moral tale of this sort in the serial at the bottom of
 the page, they will be all the more ready to read what is printed above
 it; they feel more secure, as it were.
 
 Petra. For shame! You would never go and set a snare like that for your
 readers; you are not a spider!
 
 Hovstad (smiling). Thank you for having such a good opinion of me. No;
 as a matter of fact that is Billing's idea and not mine.
 
 Petra. Billing's!
 
 Hovstad. Yes; anyway, he propounded that theory here one day. And it is
 Billing who is so anxious to have that story in the paper; I don't know
 anything about the book.
 
 Petra. But how can Billing, with his emancipated views--
 
 Hovstad. Oh, Billing is a many-sided man. He is applying for the post
 of secretary to the Bench, too, I hear.
 
 Petra. I don't believe it, Mr. Hovstad. How could he possibly bring
 himself to do such a thing?
 
 Hovstad. Ah, you must ask him that.
 
 Petra. I should never have thought it of him.
 
 Hovstad (looking more closely at her). No? Does it really surprise you
 so much?
 
 Petra. Yes. Or perhaps not altogether. Really, I don't quite know
 
 Hovstad. We journalists are not much worth, Miss Stockmann.
 
 Petra. Do you really mean that?
 
 Hovstad. I think so sometimes.
 
 Petra. Yes, in the ordinary affairs of everyday life, perhaps; I can
 understand that. But now, when you have taken a weighty matter in hand--
 
 Hovstad. This matter of your father's, you mean?
 
 Petra. Exactly. It seems to me that now you must feel you are a man
 worth more than most.
 
 Hovstad. Yes, today I do feel something of that sort.
 
 Petra. Of course you do, don't you? It is a splendid vocation you have
 chosen--to smooth the way for the march of unappreciated truths, and
 new and courageous lines of thought. If it were nothing more than
 because you stand fearlessly in the open and take up the cause of an
 injured man--
 
 Hovstad. Especially when that injured man is--ahem!--I don't rightly
 know how to--
 
 Petra. When that man is so upright and so honest, you mean?
 
 Hovstad (more gently). Especially when he is your father I meant.
 
 Petra (suddenly checked). That?
 
 Hovstad. Yes, Petra--Miss Petra.
 
 Petra. Is it that, that is first and foremost with you? Not the matter
 itself? Not the truth?--not my father's big generous heart?
 
 Hovstad. Certainly--of course--that too.
 
 Petra. No, thank you; you have betrayed yourself, Mr. Hovstad, and now
 I shall never trust you again in anything.
 
 Hovstad. Can you really take it so amiss in me that it is mostly for
 your sake--?
 
 Petra. What I am angry with you for, is for not having been honest with
 my father. You talked to him as if the truth and the good of the
 community were what lay nearest to your heart. You have made fools of
 both my father and me. You are not the man you made yourself out to be.
 And that I shall never forgive you-never!
 
 Hovstad. You ought not to speak so bitterly, Miss Petra--least of all
 now.
 
 Petra. Why not now, especially?
 
 Hovstad. Because your father cannot do without my help.
 
 Petra (looking him up and down). Are you that sort of man too? For
 shame!
 
 Hovstad. No, no, I am not. This came upon me so unexpectedly--you must
 believe that.
 
 Petra. I know what to believe. Goodbye.
 
 Aslaksen (coming from the printing room, hurriedly and with an air of
 mystery). Damnation, Hovstad!--(Sees PETRA.) Oh, this is awkward--
 
 Petra. There is the book; you must give it to some one else. (Goes
 towards the door.)
 
 Hovstad (following her). But, Miss Stockmann--
 
 Petra. Goodbye. (Goes out.)
 
 Aslaksen. I say--Mr. Hovstad--
 
 Hovstad. Well well!--what is it?
 
 Aslaksen. The Mayor is outside in the printing room.
 
 Hovstad. The Mayor, did you say?
 
 Aslaksen. Yes he wants to speak to you. He came in by the back
 door--didn't want to be seen, you understand.
 
 Hovstad. What can he want? Wait a bit--I will go myself. (Goes to the
 door of the printing room, opens it, bows and invites PETER STOCKMANN
 in.) Just see, Aslaksen, that no one--
 
 Aslaksen. Quite so. (Goes into the printing-room.)
 
 Peter Stockmann. You did not expect to see me here, Mr. Hovstad?
 
 Hovstad. No, I confess I did not.
 
 Peter Stockmann (looking round). You are very snug in here--very nice
 indeed.
 
 Hovstad. Oh--
 
 Peter Stockmann. And here I come, without any notice, to take up your
 time!
 
 Hovstad. By all means, Mr. Mayor. I am at your service. But let me
 relieve you of your--(takes STOCKMANN's hat and stick and puts them on
 a chair). Won't you sit down?
 
 Peter Stockmann (sitting down by the table). Thank you. (HOVSTAD sits
 down.) I have had an extremely annoying experience to-day, Mr. Hovstad.
 
 Hovstad. Really? Ah well, I expect with all the various business you
 have to attend to--
 
 Peter Stockmann. The Medical Officer of the Baths is responsible for
 what happened today.
 
 Hovstad. Indeed? The Doctor?
 
 Peter Stockmann. He has addressed a kind of report to the Baths
 Committee on the subject of certain supposed defects in the Baths.
 
 Hovstad. Has he indeed?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Yes--has he not told you? I thought he said--
 
 Hovstad. Ah, yes--it is true he did mention something about--
 
 Aslaksen (coming from the printing-room). I ought to have that copy.
 
 Hovstad (angrily). Ahem!--there it is on the desk.
 
 Aslaksen (taking it). Right.
 
 Peter Stockmann. But look there--that is the thing I was speaking of!
 
 Aslaksen. Yes, that is the Doctor's article, Mr. Mayor.
 
 Hovstad. Oh, is THAT what you were speaking about?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Yes, that is it. What do you think of it?
 
 Hovstad. Oh, I am only a layman--and I have only taken a very cursory
 glance at it.
 
 Peter Stockmann. But you are going to print it?
 
 Hovstad. I cannot very well refuse a distinguished man.
 
 Aslaksen. I have nothing to do with editing the paper, Mr. Mayor--
 
 Peter Stockmann. I understand.
 
 Aslaksen. I merely print what is put into my hands.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Quite so.
 
 Aslaksen. And so I must-- (moves off towards the printing-room).
 
 Peter Stockmann. No, but wait a moment, Mr. Aslaksen. You will allow
 me, Mr. Hovstad?
 
 Hovstad. If you please, Mr. Mayor.
 
 Peter Stockmann. You are a discreet and thoughtful man, Mr. Aslaksen.
 
 Aslaksen. I am delighted to hear you think so, sir.
 
 Peter Stockmann. And a man of very considerable influence.
 
 Aslaksen. Chiefly among the small tradesmen, sir.
 
 Peter Stockmann. The small tax-payers are the majority--here as
 everywhere else.
 
 Aslaksen. That is true.
 
 Peter Stockmann. And I have no doubt you know the general trend of
 opinion among them, don't you?
 
 Aslaksen. Yes I think I may say I do, Mr. Mayor.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Yes. Well, since there is such a praiseworthy spirit
 of self-sacrifice among the less wealthy citizens of our town--
 
 Aslaksen. What?
 
 Hovstad. Self-sacrifice?
 
 Peter Stockmann. It is pleasing evidence of a public-spirited feeling,
 extremely pleasing evidence. I might almost say I hardly expected it.
 But you have a closer knowledge of public opinion than I.
 
 Aslaksen. But, Mr. Mayor--
 
 Peter Stockmann. And indeed it is no small sacrifice that the town is
 going to make.
 
 Hovstad. The town?
 
 Aslaksen. But I don't understand. Is it the Baths--?
 
 Peter Stockmann. At a provisional estimate, the alterations that the
 Medical Officer asserts to be desirable will cost somewhere about
 twenty thousand pounds.
 
 Aslaksen. That is a lot of money, but--
 
 Peter Stockmann. Of course it will be necessary to raise a municipal
 loan.
 
 Hovstad (getting up). Surely you never mean that the town must pay--?
 
 Aslaksen. Do you mean that it must come out of the municipal
 funds?--out of the ill-filled pockets of the small tradesmen?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Well, my dear Mr. Aslaksen, where else is the money to
 come from?
 
 Aslaksen. The gentlemen who own the Baths ought to provide that.
 
 Peter Stockmann. The proprietors of the Baths are not in a position to
 incur any further expense.
 
 Aslaksen. Is that absolutely certain, Mr. Mayor?
 
 Peter Stockmann. I have satisfied myself that it is so. If the town
 wants these very extensive alterations, it will have to pay for them.
 
 Aslaksen. But, damn it all--I beg your pardon--this is quite another
 matter, Mr. Hovstad!
 
 Hovstad. It is, indeed.
 
 Peter Stockmann. The most fatal part of it is that we shall be obliged
 to shut the Baths for a couple of years.
 
 Hovstad. Shut them? Shut them altogether?
 
 Aslaksen. For two years?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Yes, the work will take as long as that--at least.
 
 Aslaksen. I'm damned if we will stand that, Mr. Mayor! What are we
 householders to live upon in the meantime?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Unfortunately, that is an extremely difficult question
 to answer, Mr. Aslaksen. But what would you have us do? Do you suppose
 we shall have a single visitor in the town, if we go about proclaiming
 that our water is polluted, that we are living over a plague spot, that
 the entire town--
 
 Aslaksen. And the whole thing is merely imagination?
 
 Peter Stockmann. With the best will in the world, I have not been able
 to come to any other conclusion.
 
 Aslaksen. Well then I must say it is absolutely unjustifiable of Dr.
 Stockmann--I beg your pardon, Mr. Mayor.
 
 Peter Stockmann. What you say is lamentably true, Mr. Aslaksen. My
 brother has unfortunately always been a headstrong man.
 
 Aslaksen. After this, do you mean to give him your support, Mr. Hovstad?
 
 Hovstad. Can you suppose for a moment that I--?
 
 Peter Stockmann. I have drawn up a short resume of the situation as it
 appears from a reasonable man's point of view. In it I have indicated
 how certain possible defects might suitably be remedied without
 outrunning the resources of the Baths Committee.
 
 Hovstad. Have you got it with you, Mr. Mayor?
 
 Peter Stockmann (fumbling in his pocket). Yes, I brought it with me in
 case you should--
 
 Aslaksen. Good Lord, there he is!
 
 Peter Stockmann. Who? My brother?
 
 Hovstad. Where? Where?
 
 Aslaksen. He has just gone through the printing room.
 
 Peter Stockmann. How unlucky! I don't want to meet him here, and I had
 still several things to speak to you about.
 
 Hovstad (pointing to the door on the right). Go in there for the
 present.
 
 Peter Stockmann. But--?
 
 Hovstad. You will only find Billing in there.
 
 Aslaksen. Quick, quick, Mr. Mayor--he is just coming.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Yes, very well; but see that you get rid of him
 quickly. (Goes out through the door on the right, which ASLAKSEN opens
 for him and shuts after him.)
 
 Hovstad. Pretend to be doing something, Aslaksen. (Sits down and
 writes. ASLAKSEN begins foraging among a heap of newspapers that are
 lying on a chair.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann (coming in from the printing room). Here I am again.
 (Puts down his hat and stick.)
 
 Hovstad (writing). Already, Doctor? Hurry up with what we were speaking
 about, Aslaksen. We are very pressed for time today.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (to ASLAKSEN). No proof for me to see yet, I hear.
 
 Aslaksen (without turning round). You couldn't expect it yet, Doctor.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. No, no; but I am impatient, as you can understand. I
 shall not know a moment's peace of mind until I see it in print.
 
 Hovstad. Hm!--It will take a good while yet, won't it, Aslaksen?
 
 Aslaksen. Yes, I am almost afraid it will.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. All right, my dear friends; I will come back. I do not
 mind coming back twice if necessary. A matter of such great
 importance--the welfare of the town at stake--it is no time to shirk
 trouble, (is just going, but stops and comes back.) Look here--there is
 one thing more I want to speak to you about.
 
 Hovstad. Excuse me, but could it not wait till some other time?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I can tell you in half a dozen words. It is only this.
 When my article is read tomorrow and it is realised that I have been
 quietly working the whole winter for the welfare of the town--
 
 Hovstad. Yes but, Doctor--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I know what you are going to say. You don't see how on
 earth it was any more than my duty--my obvious duty as a citizen. Of
 course it wasn't; I know that as well as you. But my fellow citizens,
 you know--! Good Lord, think of all the good souls who think so highly
 of me--!
 
 Aslaksen. Yes, our townsfolk have had a very high opinion of you so
 far, Doctor.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, and that is just why I am afraid they--. Well, this
 is the point; when this reaches them, especially the poorer classes,
 and sounds in their ears like a summons to take the town's affairs into
 their own hands for the future...
 
 Hovstad (getting up). Ahem I Doctor, I won't conceal from you the fact--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Ah I--I knew there was something in the wind! But I
 won't hear a word of it. If anything of that sort is being set on foot--
 
 Hovstad. Of what sort?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Well, whatever it is--whether it is a demonstration in
 my honour, or a banquet, or a subscription list for some presentation
 to me--whatever it is, you most promise me solemnly and faithfully to
 put a stop to it. You too, Mr. Aslaksen; do you understand?
 
 Hovstad. You must forgive me, Doctor, but sooner or later we must tell
 you the plain truth--
 
 (He is interrupted by the entrance Of MRS. STOCKMANN, who comes in from
 the street door.)
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (seeing her husband). Just as I thought!
 
 Hovstad (going towards her). You too, Mrs. Stockmann?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. What on earth do you want here, Katherine?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. I should think you know very well what I want.
 
 Hovstad, Won't you sit down? Or perhaps--
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. No, thank you; don't trouble. And you must not be
 offended at my coming to fetch my husband; I am the mother of three
 children, you know.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Nonsense!--we know all about that.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Well, one would not give you credit for much thought
 for your wife and children today; if you had had that, you would not
 have gone and dragged us all into misfortune.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Are you out of your senses, Katherine! Because a man has
 a wife and children, is he not to be allowed to proclaim the truth-is
 he not to be allowed to be an actively useful citizen--is he not to be
 allowed to do a service to his native town!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, Thomas--in reason.
 
 Aslaksen. Just what I say. Moderation in everything.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. And that is why you wrong us, Mr. Hovstad, in enticing
 my husband away from his home and making a dupe of him in all this.
 
 Hovstad. I certainly am making a dupe of no one--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Making a dupe of me! Do you suppose I should allow
 myself to be duped!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. It is just what you do. I know quite well you have more
 brains than anyone in the town, but you are extremely easily duped,
 Thomas. (To Hovstad.) Please do realise that he loses his post at the
 Baths if you print what he has written.
 
 Aslaksen. What!
 
 Hovstad. Look here, Doctor!
 
 Dr. Stockmann (laughing). Ha-ha!--just let them try! No, no--they will
 take good care not to. I have got the compact majority behind me, let
 me tell you!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, that is just the worst of it--your having any such
 horrid thing behind you.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Rubbish, Katherine!--Go home and look after your house
 and leave me to look after the community. How can you be so afraid,
 when I am so confident and happy? (Walks up and down, rubbing his
 hands.) Truth and the People will win the fight, you may be certain! I
 see the whole of the broad-minded middle class marching like a
 victorious army--! (Stops beside a chair.) What the deuce is that lying
 there?
 
 Aslaksen Good Lord!
 
 Hovstad. Ahem!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Here we have the topmost pinnacle of authority! (Takes
 the Mayor's official hat carefully between his finger-tips and holds it
 up in the air.)
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. The Mayor's hat!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And here is the staff of office too. How in the name of
 all that's wonderful--?
 
 Hovstad. Well, you see--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Oh, I understand. He has been here trying to talk you
 over. Ha-ha!--he made rather a mistake there! And as soon as he caught
 sight of me in the printing room. (Bursts out laughing.) Did he run
 away, Mr. Aslaksen?
 
 Aslaksen (hurriedly). Yes, he ran away, Doctor.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Ran away without his stick or his--. Fiddlesticks! Peter
 doesn't run away and leave his belongings behind him. But what the
 deuce have you done with him? Ah!--in there, of course. Now you shall
 see, Katherine!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Thomas--please don't--!
 
 Aslaksen. Don't be rash, Doctor.
 
 (DR. STOCKMANN has put on the Mayor's hat and taken his stick in his
 hand. He goes up to the door, opens it, and stands with his hand to his
 hat at the salute. PETER STOCKMANN comes in, red with anger. BILLING
 follows him.)
 
 Peter Stockmann. What does this tomfoolery mean?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Be respectful, my good Peter. I am the chief authority
 in the town now. (Walks up and down.)
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (almost in tears). Really, Thomas!
 
 Peter Stockmann (following him about). Give me my hat and stick.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (in the same tone as before). If you are chief constable,
 let me tell you that I am the Mayor--I am the master of the whole town,
 please understand!
 
 Peter Stockmann. Take off my hat, I tell you. Remember it is part of an
 official uniform.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Pooh! Do you think the newly awakened lionhearted people
 are going to be frightened by an official hat? There is going to be a
 revolution in the town tomorrow, let me tell you. You thought you could
 turn me out; but now I shall turn you out--turn you out of all your
 various offices. Do you think I cannot? Listen to me. I have triumphant
 social forces behind me. Hovstad and Billing will thunder in the
 "People's Messenger," and Aslaksen will take the field at the head of
 the whole Householders' Association--
 
 Aslaksen. That I won't, Doctor.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Of course you will--
 
 Peter Stockmann. Ah!--may I ask then if Mr. Hovstad intends to join
 this agitation?
 
 Hovstad. No, Mr. Mayor.
 
 Aslaksen. No, Mr. Hovstad is not such a fool as to go and ruin his
 paper and himself for the sake of an imaginary grievance.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (looking round him). What does this mean?
 
 Hovstad. You have represented your case in a false light, Doctor, and
 therefore I am unable to give you my support.
 
 Billing. And after what the Mayor was so kind as to tell me just now,
 I--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. A false light! Leave that part of it to me. Only print
 my article; I am quite capable of defending it.
 
 Hovstad. I am not going to print it. I cannot and will not and dare not
 print it.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. You dare not? What nonsense!--you are the editor; and an
 editor controls his paper, I suppose!
 
 Aslaksen. No, it is the subscribers, Doctor.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Fortunately, yes.
 
 Aslaksen. It is public opinion--the enlightened public--householders
 and people of that kind; they control the newspapers.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (composedly). And I have all these influences against me?
 
 Aslaksen. Yes, you have. It would mean the absolute ruin of the
 community if your article were to appear.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Indeed.
 
 Peter Stockmann. My hat and stick, if you please. (DR. STOCKMANN takes
 off the hat and lays it on the table with the stick. PETER STOCKMANN
 takes them up.) Your authority as mayor has come to an untimely end.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. We have not got to the end yet. (To HOVSTAD.) Then it is
 quite impossible for you to print my article in the "People's
 Messenger"?
 
 Hovstad. Quite impossible--out of regard for your family as well.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. You need not concern yourself about his family, thank
 you, Mr. Hovstad.
 
 Peter Stockmann (taking a paper from his pocket). It will be
 sufficient, for the guidance of the public, if this appears. It is an
 official statement. May I trouble you?
 
 Hovstad (taking the paper). Certainly; I will see that it is printed.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. But not mine. Do you imagine that you can silence me and
 stifle the truth! You will not find it so easy as you suppose. Mr.
 Aslaksen, kindly take my manuscript at once and print it as a
 pamphlet--at my expense. I will have four hundred copies--no, five or
 six hundred.
 
 Aslaksen. If you offered me its weight in gold, I could not lend my
 press for any such purpose, Doctor. It would be flying in the face of
 public opinion. You will not get it printed anywhere in the town.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Then give it me back.
 
 Hovstad (giving him the MS.). Here it is.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (taking his hat and stick). It shall be made public all
 the same. I will read it out at a mass meeting of the townspeople. All
 my fellow-citizens shall hear the voice of truth!
 
 Peter Stockmann. You will not find any public body in the town that
 will give you the use of their hall for such a purpose.
 
 Aslaksen. Not a single one, I am certain.
 
 Billing. No, I'm damned if you will find one.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. But this is too shameful! Why should every one turn
 against you like that?
 
 Dr. Stockmann (angrily). I will tell you why. It is because all the men
 in this town are old women--like you; they all think of nothing but
 their families, and never of the community.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (putting her arm into his). Then I will show them that
 an old woman can be a man for once. I am going to stand by you, Thomas!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Bravely said, Katherine! It shall be made public--as I
 am a living soul! If I can't hire a hall, I shall hire a drum, and
 parade the town with it and read it at every street-corner.
 
 Peter Stockmann. You are surely not such an errant fool as that!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, I am.
 
 Aslaksen. You won't find a single man in the whole town to go with you.
 
 Billing. No, I'm damned if you will.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Don't give in, Thomas. I will tell the boys to go with
 you.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. That is a splendid idea!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Morten will be delighted; and Ejlif will do whatever he
 does.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, and Petra!--and you too, Katherine!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. No, I won't do that; but I will stand at the window and
 watch you, that's what I will do.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (puts his arms round her and kisses her). Thank you, my
 dear! Now you and I are going to try a fall, my fine gentlemen! I am
 going to see whether a pack of cowards can succeed in gagging a patriot
 who wants to purify society! (He and his wife go out by the street
 door.)
 
 Peter Stockmann (shaking his head seriously). Now he has sent her out
 of her senses, too.
 
 
 
 
 ACT IV
 
 
 (SCENE.--A big old-fashioned room in CAPTAIN HORSTER'S house. At the
 back folding-doors, which are standing open, lead to an ante-room.
 Three windows in the left-hand wall. In the middle of the opposite wall
 a platform has been erected. On this is a small table with two candles,
 a water-bottle and glass, and a bell. The room is lit by lamps placed
 between the windows. In the foreground on the left there is a table
 with candles and a chair. To the right is a door and some chairs
 standing near it. The room is nearly filled with a crowd of townspeople
 of all sorts, a few women and schoolboys being amongst them. People are
 still streaming in from the back, and the room is soon filled.)
 
 1st Citizen (meeting another). Hullo, Lamstad! You here too?
 
 2nd Citizen. I go to every public meeting, I do.
 
 3rd Citizen. Brought your whistle too, I expect!
 
 2nd Citizen. I should think so. Haven't you?
 
 3rd Citizen. Rather! And old Evensen said he was going to bring a
 cow-horn, he did.
 
 2nd Citizen. Good old Evensen! (Laughter among the crowd.)
 
 4th Citizen (coming up to them). I say, tell me what is going on here
 tonight?
 
 2nd Citizen. Dr. Stockmann is going to deliver an address attacking the
 Mayor.
 
 4th Citizen. But the Mayor is his brother.
 
 1st Citizen. That doesn't matter; Dr. Stockmann's not the chap to be
 afraid.
 
 Peter Stockmann. For various reasons, which you will easily understand,
 I must beg to be excused. But fortunately we have amongst us a man who
 I think will be acceptable to you all. I refer to the President of the
 Householders' Association, Mr. Aslaksen.
 
 Several voices. Yes--Aslaksen! Bravo Aslaksen!
 
 (DR. STOCKMANN takes up his MS. and walks up and down the platform.)
 
 Aslaksen. Since my fellow-citizens choose to entrust me with this duty,
 I cannot refuse.
 
 (Loud applause. ASLAKSEN mounts the platform.)
 
 Billing (writing), "Mr. Aslaksen was elected with enthusiasm."
 
 Aslaksen. And now, as I am in this position, I should like to say a few
 brief words. I am a quiet and peaceable man, who believes in discreet
 moderation, and--and--in moderate discretion. All my friends can bear
 witness to that.
 
 Several Voices. That's right! That's right, Aslaksen!
 
 Aslaksen. I have learned in the school of life and experience that
 moderation is the most valuable virtue a citizen can possess--
 
 Peter Stockmann. Hear, hear!
 
 Aslaksen. --And moreover, that discretion and moderation are what
 enable a man to be of most service to the community. I would therefore
 suggest to our esteemed fellow-citizen, who has called this meeting,
 that he should strive to keep strictly within the bounds of moderation.
 
 A Man by the door. Three cheers for the Moderation Society!
 
 A Voice. Shame!
 
 Several Voices. Sh!-Sh!
 
 Aslaksen. No interruptions, gentlemen, please! Does anyone wish to make
 any remarks?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Mr. Chairman.
 
 Aslaksen. The Mayor will address the meeting.
 
 Peter Stockmann. In consideration of the close relationship in which,
 as you all know, I stand to the present Medical Officer of the Baths, I
 should have preferred not to speak this evening. But my official
 position with regard to the Baths and my solicitude for the vital
 interests of the town compel me to bring forward a motion. I venture to
 presume that there is not a single one of our citizens present who
 considers it desirable that unreliable and exaggerated accounts of the
 sanitary condition of the Baths and the town should be spread abroad.
 
 Several Voices. No, no! Certainly not! We protest against it!
 
 Peter Stockmann. Therefore, I should like to propose that the meeting
 should not permit the Medical Officer either to read or to comment on
 his proposed lecture.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (impatiently). Not permit--! What the devil--!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (coughing). Ahem!-ahem!
 
 Dr. Stockmann (collecting himself). Very well, Go ahead!
 
 Peter Stockmann. In my communication to the "People's Messenger," I
 have put the essential facts before the public in such a way that every
 fair-minded citizen can easily form his own opinion. From it you will
 see that the main result of the Medical Officer's proposals--apart from
 their constituting a vote of censure on the leading men of the
 town--would be to saddle the ratepayers with an unnecessary expenditure
 of at least some thousands of pounds.
 
 (Sounds of disapproval among the audience, and some cat-calls.)
 
 Aslaksen (ringing his bell). Silence, please, gentlemen! I beg to
 support the Mayor's motion. I quite agree with him that there is
 something behind this agitation started by the Doctor. He talks about
 the Baths; but it is a revolution he is aiming at--he wants to get the
 administration of the town put into new hands. No one doubts the
 honesty of the Doctor's intentions--no one will suggest that there can
 be any two opinions as to that, I myself am a believer in
 self-government for the people, provided it does not fall too heavily
 on the ratepayers. But that would be the case here; and that is why I
 will see Dr. Stockmann damned--I beg your pardon--before I go with him
 in the matter. You can pay too dearly for a thing sometimes; that is my
 opinion.
 
 (Loud applause on all sides.)
 
 Hovstad. I, too, feel called upon to explain my position. Dr.
 Stockmann's agitation appeared to be gaining a certain amount of
 sympathy at first, so I supported it as impartially as I could. But
 presently we had reason to suspect that we had allowed ourselves to be
 misled by misrepresentation of the state of affairs--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Misrepresentation--!
 
 Hovstad. Well, let us say a not entirely trustworthy representation.
 The Mayor's statement has proved that. I hope no one here has any doubt
 as to my liberal principles; the attitude of the "People's Messenger"
 towards important political questions is well known to everyone. But
 the advice of experienced and thoughtful men has convinced me that in
 purely local matters a newspaper ought to proceed with a certain
 caution.
 
 Aslaksen. I entirely agree with the speaker.
 
 Hovstad. And, in the matter before us, it is now an undoubted fact that
 Dr. Stockmann has public opinion against him. Now, what is an editor's
 first and most obvious duty, gentlemen? Is it not to work in harmony
 with his readers? Has he not received a sort of tacit mandate to work
 persistently and assiduously for the welfare of those whose opinions he
 represents? Or is it possible I am mistaken in that?
 
 Voices from the crowd. No, no! You are quite right!
 
 Hovstad. It has cost me a severe struggle to break with a man in whose
 house I have been lately a frequent guest--a man who till today has
 been able to pride himself on the undivided goodwill of his
 fellow-citizens--a man whose only, or at all events whose essential,
 failing is that he is swayed by his heart rather than his head.
 
 A few scattered voices. That is true! Bravo, Stockmann!
 
 Hovstad. But my duty to the community obliged me to break with him. And
 there is another consideration that impels me to oppose him, and, as
 far as possible, to arrest him on the perilous course he has adopted;
 that is, consideration for his family--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Please stick to the water-supply and drainage!
 
 Hovstad. --consideration, I repeat, for his wife and his children for
 whom he has made no provision.
 
 Morten. Is that us, mother?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Hush!
 
 Aslaksen. I will now put the Mayor's proposition to the vote.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. There is no necessity! Tonight I have no intention of
 dealing with all that filth down at the Baths. No; I have something
 quite different to say to you.
 
 Peter Stockmann (aside). What is coming now?
 
 A Drunken Man (by the entrance door). I am a ratepayer! And therefore,
 I have a right to speak too! And my entire--firm--inconceivable opinion
 is--
 
 A number of voices. Be quiet, at the back there!
 
 Others. He is drunk! Turn him out! (They turn him out.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Am I allowed to speak?
 
 Aslaksen (ringing his bell). Dr. Stockmann will address the meeting.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I should like to have seen anyone, a few days ago, dare
 to attempt to silence me as has been done tonight! I would have
 defended my sacred rights as a man, like a lion! But now it is all one
 to me; I have something of even weightier importance to say to you.
 (The crowd presses nearer to him, MORTEN Kiil conspicuous among them.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann (continuing). I have thought and pondered a great deal,
 these last few days--pondered over such a variety of things that in the
 end my head seemed too full to hold them--
 
 Peter Stockmann (with a cough). Ahem!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. --but I got them clear in my mind at last, and then I
 saw the whole situation lucidly. And that is why I am standing here
 to-night. I have a great revelation to make to you, my fellow-citizens!
 I will impart to you a discovery of a far wider scope than the trifling
 matter that our water supply is poisoned and our medicinal Baths are
 standing on pestiferous soil.
 
 A number of voices (shouting). Don't talk about the Baths! We won't
 hear you! None of that!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I have already told you that what I want to speak about
 is the great discovery I have made lately--the discovery that all the
 sources of our moral life are poisoned and that the whole fabric of our
 civic community is founded on the pestiferous soil of falsehood.
 
 Voices of disconcerted Citizens. What is that he says?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Such an insinuation--!
 
 Aslaksen (with his hand on his bell). I call upon the speaker to
 moderate his language.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I have always loved my native town as a man only can
 love the home of his youthful days. I was not old when I went away from
 here; and exile, longing and memories cast as it were an additional
 halo over both the town and its inhabitants. (Some clapping and
 applause.) And there I stayed, for many years, in a horrible hole far
 away up north. When I came into contact with some of the people that
 lived scattered about among the rocks, I often thought it would of been
 more service to the poor half-starved creatures if a veterinary doctor
 had been sent up there, instead of a man like me. (Murmurs among the
 crowd.)
 
 Billing (laying down his pen). I'm damned if I have ever heard--!
 
 Hovstad. It is an insult to a respectable population!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Wait a bit! I do not think anyone will charge me with
 having forgotten my native town up there. I was like one of the
 eider-ducks brooding on its nest, and what I hatched was the plans for
 these Baths. (Applause and protests.) And then when fate at last
 decreed for me the great happiness of coming home again--I assure you,
 gentlemen, I thought I had nothing more in the world to wish for. Or
 rather, there was one thing I wished for--eagerly, untiringly,
 ardently--and that was to be able to be of service to my native town
 and the good of the community.
 
 Peter Stockmann (looking at the ceiling). You chose a strange way of
 doing it--ahem!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And so, with my eyes blinded to the real facts, I
 revelled in happiness. But yesterday morning--no, to be precise, it was
 yesterday afternoon--the eyes of my mind were opened wide, and the
 first thing I realised was the colossal stupidity of the authorities--.
 (Uproar, shouts and laughter, MRS. STOCKMANN coughs persistently.)
 
 Peter Stockmann. Mr. Chairman!
 
 Aslaksen (ringing his bell). By virtue of my authority--!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. It is a petty thing to catch me up on a word, Mr.
 Aslaksen. What I mean is only that I got scent of the unbelievable
 piggishness our leading men had been responsible for down at the Baths.
 I can't stand leading men at any price!--I have had enough of such
 people in my time. They are like billy-goats on a young plantation;
 they do mischief everywhere. They stand in a free man's way, whichever
 way he turns, and what I should like best would be to see them
 exterminated like any other vermin--. (Uproar.)
 
 Peter Stockmann. Mr. Chairman, can we allow such expressions to pass?
 
 Aslaksen (with his hand on his bell). Doctor--!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I cannot understand how it is that I have only now
 acquired a clear conception of what these gentry are, when I had almost
 daily before my eyes in this town such an excellent specimen of
 them--my brother Peter--slow-witted and hide-bound in prejudice--.
 (Laughter, uproar and hisses. MRS. STOCKMANN Sits coughing assiduously.
 ASLAKSEN rings his bell violently.)
 
 The Drunken Man (who has got in again). Is it me he is talking about?
 My name's Petersen, all right--but devil take me if I--
 
 Angry Voices. Turn out that drunken man! Turn him out. (He is turned
 out again.)
 
 Peter Stockmann. Who was that person?
 
 1st Citizen. I don't know who he is, Mr. Mayor.
 
 2nd Citizen. He doesn't belong here.
 
 3rd Citizen. I expect he is a navvy from over at--(the rest is
 inaudible).
 
 Aslaksen. He had obviously had too much beer. Proceed, Doctor; but
 please strive to be moderate in your language.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Very well, gentlemen, I will say no more about our
 leading men. And if anyone imagines, from what I have just said, that
 my object is to attack these people this evening, he is
 wrong--absolutely wide of the mark. For I cherish the comforting
 conviction that these parasites--all these venerable relics of a dying
 school of thought--are most admirably paving the way for their own
 extinction; they need no doctor's help to hasten their end. Nor is it
 folk of that kind who constitute the most pressing danger to the
 community. It is not they who are most instrumental in poisoning the
 sources of our moral life and infecting the ground on which we stand.
 It is not they who are the most dangerous enemies of truth and freedom
 amongst us.
 
 Shouts from all sides. Who then? Who is it? Name! Name!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. You may depend upon it--I shall name them! That is
 precisely the great discovery I made yesterday. (Raises his voice.) The
 most dangerous enemy of truth and freedom amongst us is the compact
 majority--yes, the damned compact Liberal majority--that is it! Now you
 know! (Tremendous uproar. Most of the crowd are shouting, stamping and
 hissing. Some of the older men among them exchange stolen glances and
 seem to be enjoying themselves. MRS. STOCKMANN gets up, looking
 anxious. EJLIF and MORTEN advance threateningly upon some schoolboys
 who are playing pranks. ASLAKSEN rings his bell and begs for silence.
 HOVSTAD and BILLING both talk at once, but are inaudible. At last quiet
 is restored.)
 
 Aslaksen. As Chairman, I call upon the speaker to withdraw the
 ill-considered expressions he has just used.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Never, Mr. Aslaksen! It is the majority in our community
 that denies me my freedom and seeks to prevent my speaking the truth.
 
 Hovstad. The majority always has right on its side.
 
 Billing. And truth too, by God!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. The majority never has right on its side. Never, I say!
 That is one of these social lies against which an independent,
 intelligent man must wage war. Who is it that constitute the majority
 of the population in a country? Is it the clever folk, or the stupid? I
 don't imagine you will dispute the fact that at present the stupid
 people are in an absolutely overwhelming majority all the world over.
 But, good Lord!--you can never pretend that it is right that the stupid
 folk should govern the clever ones I (Uproar and cries.) Oh, yes--you
 can shout me down, I know! But you cannot answer me. The majority has
 might on its side--unfortunately; but right it has not. I am in the
 right--I and a few other scattered individuals. The minority is always
 in the right. (Renewed uproar.)
 
 Hovstad. Aha!--so Dr. Stockmann has become an aristocrat since the day
 before yesterday!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I have already said that I don't intend to waste a word
 on the puny, narrow-chested, short-winded crew whom we are leaving
 astern. Pulsating life no longer concerns itself with them. I am
 thinking of the few, the scattered few amongst us, who have absorbed
 new and vigorous truths. Such men stand, as it were, at the outposts,
 so far ahead that the compact majority has not yet been able to come up
 with them; and there they are fighting for truths that are too
 newly-born into the world of consciousness to have any considerable
 number of people on their side as yet.
 
 Hovstad. So the Doctor is a revolutionary now!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Good heavens--of course I am, Mr. Hovstad! I propose to
 raise a revolution against the lie that the majority has the monopoly
 of the truth. What sort of truths are they that the majority usually
 supports? They are truths that are of such advanced age that they are
 beginning to break up. And if a truth is as old as that, it is also in
 a fair way to become a lie, gentlemen. (Laughter and mocking cries.)
 Yes, believe me or not, as you like; but truths are by no means as
 long-lived at Methuselah--as some folk imagine. A normally constituted
 truth lives, let us say, as a rule seventeen or eighteen, or at most
 twenty years--seldom longer. But truths as aged as that are always worn
 frightfully thin, and nevertheless it is only then that the majority
 recognises them and recommends them to the community as wholesome moral
 nourishment. There is no great nutritive value in that sort of fare, I
 can assure you; and, as a doctor, I ought to know. These "majority
 truths" are like last year's cured meat--like rancid, tainted ham; and
 they are the origin of the moral scurvy that is rampant in our
 communities.
 
 Aslaksen. It appears to me that the speaker is wandering a long way
 from his subject.
 
 Peter Stockmann. I quite agree with the Chairman.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Have you gone clean out of your senses, Peter? I am
 sticking as closely to my subject as I can; for my subject is precisely
 this, that it is the masses, the majority--this infernal compact
 majority--that poisons the sources of our moral life and infects the
 ground we stand on.
 
 Hovstad. And all this because the great, broadminded majority of the
 people is prudent enough to show deference only to well-ascertained and
 well-approved truths?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Ah, my good Mr. Hovstad, don't talk nonsense about
 well-ascertained truths! The truths of which the masses now approve are
 the very truths that the fighters at the outposts held to in the days
 of our grandfathers. We fighters at the outposts nowadays no longer
 approve of them; and I do not believe there is any other
 well-ascertained truth except this, that no community can live a
 healthy life if it is nourished only on such old marrowless truths.
 
 Hovstad. But, instead of standing there using vague generalities, it
 would be interesting if you would tell us what these old marrowless
 truths are, that we are nourished on.
 
 (Applause from many quarters.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Oh, I could give you a whole string of such
 abominations; but to begin with I will confine myself to one
 well-approved truth, which at bottom is a foul lie, but upon which
 nevertheless Mr. Hovstad and the "People's Messenger" and all the
 "Messenger's" supporters are nourished.
 
 Hovstad. And that is--?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. That is, the doctrine you have inherited from your
 forefathers and proclaim thoughtlessly far and wide--the doctrine that
 the public, the crowd, the masses, are the essential part of the
 population--that they constitute the People--that the common folk, the
 ignorant and incomplete element in the community, have the same right
 to pronounce judgment and to, approve, to direct and to govern, as the
 isolated, intellectually superior personalities in it.
 
 Billing. Well, damn me if ever I--
 
 Hovstad (at the same time, shouting out). Fellow-citizens, take good
 note of that!
 
 A number of voices (angrily). Oho!--we are not the People! Only the
 superior folk are to govern, are they!
 
 A Workman. Turn the fellow out for talking such rubbish!
 
 Another. Out with him!
 
 Another (calling out). Blow your horn, Evensen!
 
 (A horn is blown loudly, amidst hisses and an angry uproar.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann (when the noise has somewhat abated). Be reasonable!
 Can't you stand hearing the voice of truth for once? I don't in the
 least expect you to agree with me all at once; but I must say I did
 expect Mr. Hovstad to admit I was right, when he had recovered his
 composure a little. He claims to be a freethinker--
 
 Voices (in murmurs of astonishment). Freethinker, did he say? Is
 Hovstad a freethinker?
 
 Hovstad (shouting). Prove it, Dr. Stockmann! When have I said so in
 print?
 
 Dr. Stockmann (reflecting). No, confound it, you are right!--you have
 never had the courage to. Well, I won't put you in a hole, Mr. Hovstad.
 Let us say it is I that am the freethinker, then. I am going to prove
 to you, scientifically, that the "People's Messenger" leads you by the
 nose in a shameful manner when it tells you that you--that the common
 people, the crowd, the masses, are the real essence of the People. That
 is only a newspaper lie, I tell you! The common people are nothing more
 than the raw material of which a People is made. (Groans, laughter and
 uproar.) Well, isn't that the case? Isn't there an enormous difference
 between a well-bred and an ill-bred strain of animals? Take, for
 instance, a common barn-door hen. What sort of eating do you get from a
 shrivelled up old scrag of a fowl like that? Not much, do you! And what
 sort of eggs does it lay? A fairly good crow or a raven can lay pretty
 nearly as good an egg. But take a well-bred Spanish or Japanese hen, or
 a good pheasant or a turkey--then you will see the difference. Or take
 the case of dogs, with whom we humans are on such intimate terms. Think
 first of an ordinary common cur--I mean one of the horrible,
 coarse-haired, low-bred curs that do nothing but run about the streets
 and befoul the walls of the houses. Compare one of these curs with a
 poodle whose sires for many generations have been bred in a gentleman's
 house, where they have had the best of food and had the opportunity of
 hearing soft voices and music. Do you not think that the poodle's brain
 is developed to quite a different degree from that of the cur? Of
 course it is. It is puppies of well-bred poodles like that, that
 showmen train to do incredibly clever tricks--things that a common cur
 could never learn to do even if it stood on its head. (Uproar and
 mocking cries.)
 
 A Citizen (calls out). Are you going to make out we are dogs, now?
 
 Another Citizen. We are not animals, Doctor!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes but, bless my soul, we are, my friend! It is true we
 are the finest animals anyone could wish for; but, even among us,
 exceptionally fine animals are rare. There is a tremendous difference
 between poodle-men and cur-men. And the amusing part of it is, that Mr.
 Hovstad quite agrees with me as long as it is a question of four-footed
 animals--
 
 Hovstad. Yes, it is true enough as far as they are concerned.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Very well. But as soon as I extend the principle and
 apply it to two-legged animals, Mr. Hovstad stops short. He no longer
 dares to think independently, or to pursue his ideas to their logical
 conclusion; so, he turns the whole theory upside down and proclaims in
 the "People's Messenger" that it is the barn-door hens and street curs
 that are the finest specimens in the menagerie. But that is always the
 way, as long as a man retains the traces of common origin and has not
 worked his way up to intellectual distinction.
 
 Hovstad. I lay no claim to any sort of distinction, I am the son of
 humble country-folk, and I am proud that the stock I come from is
 rooted deep among the common people he insults.
 
 Voices. Bravo, Hovstad! Bravo! Bravo!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. The kind of common people I mean are not only to be
 found low down in the social scale; they crawl and swarm all around
 us--even in the highest social positions. You have only to look at your
 own fine, distinguished Mayor! My brother Peter is every bit as
 plebeian as anyone that walks in two shoes-- (laughter and hisses)
 
 Peter Stockmann. I protest against personal allusions of this kind.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (imperturbably).--and that, not because he is like
 myself, descended from some old rascal of a pirate from Pomerania or
 thereabouts--because that is who we are descended from--
 
 Peter Stockmann. An absurd legend. I deny it!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. --but because he thinks what his superiors think, and
 holds the same opinions as they, People who do that are, intellectually
 speaking, common people; and, that is why my magnificent brother Peter
 is in reality so very far from any distinction--and consequently also
 so far from being liberal-minded.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Mr. Chairman--!
 
 Hovstad. So it is only the distinguished men that are liberal-minded in
 this country? We are learning something quite new! (Laughter.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, that is part of my new discovery too. And another
 part of it is that broad-mindedness is almost precisely the same thing
 as morality. That is why I maintain that it is absolutely inexcusable
 in the "People's Messenger" to proclaim, day in and day out, the false
 doctrine that it is the masses, the crowd, the compact majority, that
 have the monopoly of broad-mindedness and morality--and that vice and
 corruption and every kind of intellectual depravity are the result of
 culture, just as all the filth that is draining into our Baths is the
 result of the tanneries up at Molledal! (Uproar and interruptions. DR.
 STOCKMANN is undisturbed, and goes on, carried away by his ardour, with
 a smile.) And yet this same "People's Messenger" can go on preaching
 that the masses ought to be elevated to higher conditions of life! But,
 bless my soul, if the "Messenger's" teaching is to be depended upon,
 this very raising up the masses would mean nothing more or less than
 setting them straightway upon the paths of depravity! Happily the
 theory that culture demoralises is only an old falsehood that our
 forefathers believed in and we have inherited. No, it is ignorance,
 poverty, ugly conditions of life, that do the devil's work! In a house
 which does not get aired and swept every day--my wife Katherine
 maintains that the floor ought to be scrubbed as well, but that is a
 debatable question--in such a house, let me tell you, people will lose
 within two or three years the power of thinking or acting in a moral
 manner. Lack of oxygen weakens the conscience. And there must be a
 plentiful lack of oxygen in very many houses in this town, I should
 think, judging from the fact that the whole compact majority can be
 unconscientious enough to wish to build the town's prosperity on a
 quagmire of falsehood and deceit.
 
 Aslaksen. We cannot allow such a grave accusation to be flung at a
 citizen community.
 
 A Citizen. I move that the Chairman direct the speaker to sit down.
 
 Voices (angrily). Hear, hear! Quite right! Make him sit down!
 
 Dr. Stockmann (losing his self-control). Then I will go and shout the
 truth at every street corner! I will write it in other towns'
 newspapers! The whole country shall know what is going on here!
 
 Hovstad. It almost seems as if Dr. Stockmann's intention were to ruin
 the town.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, my native town is so dear to me that I would rather
 ruin it than see it flourishing upon a lie.
 
 Aslaksen. This is really serious. (Uproar and cat-calls MRS. STOCKMANN
 coughs, but to no purpose; her husband does not listen to her any
 longer.)
 
 Hovstad (shouting above the din). A man must be a public enemy to wish
 to ruin a whole community!
 
 Dr. Stockmann (with growing fervor). What does the destruction of a
 community matter, if it lives on lies? It ought to be razed to the
 ground. I tell you-- All who live by lies ought to be exterminated like
 vermin! You will end by infecting the whole country; you will bring
 about such a state of things that the whole country will deserve to be
 ruined. And if things come to that pass, I shall say from the bottom of
 my heart: Let the whole country perish, let all these people be
 exterminated!
 
 Voices from the crowd. That is talking like an out-and-out enemy of the
 people!
 
 Billing. There sounded the voice of the people, by all that's holy!
 
 The whole crowd (shouting). Yes, yes! He is an enemy of the people! He
 hates his country! He hates his own people!
 
 Aslaksen. Both as a citizen and as an individual, I am profoundly
 disturbed by what we have had to listen to. Dr. Stockmann has shown
 himself in a light I should never have dreamed of. I am unhappily
 obliged to subscribe to the opinion which I have just heard my
 estimable fellow-citizens utter; and I propose that we should give
 expression to that opinion in a resolution. I propose a resolution as
 follows: "This meeting declares that it considers Dr. Thomas Stockmann,
 Medical Officer of the Baths, to be an enemy of the people." (A storm
 of cheers and applause. A number of men surround the DOCTOR and hiss
 him. MRS. STOCKMANN and PETRA have got up from their seats. MORTEN and
 EJLIF are fighting the other schoolboys for hissing; some of their
 elders separate them.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann (to the men who are hissing him). Oh, you fools! I tell
 you that--
 
 Aslaksen (ringing his bell). We cannot hear you now, Doctor. A formal
 vote is about to be taken; but, out of regard for personal feelings, it
 shall be by ballot and not verbal. Have you any clean paper, Mr.
 Billing?
 
 Billing. I have both blue and white here.
 
 Aslaksen (going to him). That will do nicely; we shall get on more
 quickly that way. Cut it up into small strips--yes, that's it. (To the
 meeting.) Blue means no; white means yes. I will come round myself and
 collect votes. (PETER STOCKMANN leaves the hall. ASLAKSEN and one or
 two others go round the room with the slips of paper in their hats.)
 
 1st Citizen (to HOVSTAD). I say, what has come to the Doctor? What are
 we to think of it?
 
 Hovstad. Oh, you know how headstrong he is.
 
 2nd Citizen (to BILLING). Billing, you go to their house--have you ever
 noticed if the fellow drinks?
 
 Billing. Well I'm hanged if I know what to say. There are always
 spirits on the table when you go.
 
 3rd Citizen. I rather think he goes quite off his head sometimes.
 
 1st Citizen. I wonder if there is any madness in his family?
 
 Billing. I shouldn't wonder if there were.
 
 4th Citizen. No, it is nothing more than sheer malice; he wants to get
 even with somebody for something or other.
 
 Billing. Well certainly he suggested a rise in his salary on one
 occasion lately, and did not get it.
 
 The Citizens (together). Ah!--then it is easy to understand how it is!
 
 The Drunken Man (who has got among the audience again). I want a blue
 one, I do! And I want a white one too!
 
 Voices. It's that drunken chap again! Turn him out!
 
 Morten Kiil. (going up to DR. STOCKMANN). Well, Stockmann, do you see
 what these monkey tricks of yours lead to?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I have done my duty.
 
 Morten Kiil. What was that you said about the tanneries at Molledal?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. You heard well enough. I said they were the source of
 all the filth.
 
 Morten Kiil. My tannery too?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Unfortunately your tannery is by far the worst.
 
 Morten Kiil. Are you going to put that in the papers?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I shall conceal nothing.
 
 Morten Kiil. That may cost you dearly, Stockmann. (Goes out.)
 
 A Stout Man (going UP to CAPTAIN HORSTER, Without taking any notice of
 the ladies). Well, Captain, so you lend your house to enemies of the
 people?
 
 Horster. I imagine I can do what I like with my own possessions, Mr.
 Vik.
 
 The Stout Man. Then you can have no objection to my doing the same with
 mine.
 
 Horster. What do you mean, sir?
 
 The Stout Man. You shall hear from me in the morning. (Turns his back
 on him and moves off.)
 
 Petra. Was that not your owner, Captain Horster?
 
 Horster. Yes, that was Mr. Vik the shipowner.
 
 Aslaksen (with the voting-papers in his hands, gets up on to the
 platform and rings his bell). Gentlemen, allow me to announce the
 result. By the votes of every one here except one person--
 
 A Young Man. That is the drunk chap!
 
 Aslaksen. By the votes of everyone here except a tipsy man, this
 meeting of citizens declares Dr. Thomas Stockmann to be an enemy of the
 people. (Shouts and applause.) Three cheers for our ancient and
 honourable citizen community! (Renewed applause.) Three cheers for our
 able and energetic Mayor, who has so loyally suppressed the promptings
 of family feeling! (Cheers.) The meeting is dissolved. (Gets down.)
 
 Billing. Three cheers for the Chairman!
 
 The whole crowd. Three cheers for Aslaksen! Hurrah!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. My hat and coat, Petra! Captain, have you room on your
 ship for passengers to the New World?
 
 Horster. For you and yours we will make room, Doctor.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (as PETRA helps him into his coat), Good. Come,
 Katherine! Come, boys!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (in an undertone). Thomas, dear, let us go out by the
 back way.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. No back ways for me, Katherine, (Raising his voice.) You
 will hear more of this enemy of the people, before he shakes the dust
 off his shoes upon you! I am not so forgiving as a certain Person; I do
 not say: "I forgive you, for ye know not what ye do."
 
 Aslaksen (shouting). That is a blasphemous comparison, Dr. Stockmann!
 
 Billing. It is, by God! It's dreadful for an earnest man to listen to.
 
 A Coarse Voice. Threatens us now, does he!
 
 Other Voices (excitedly). Let's go and break his windows! Duck him in
 the fjord!
 
 Another Voice. Blow your horn, Evensen! Pip, pip!
 
 (Horn-blowing, hisses, and wild cries. DR. STOCKMANN goes out through
 the hall with his family, HORSTER elbowing a way for them.)
 
 The Whole Crowd (howling after them as they go). Enemy of the People!
 Enemy of the People!
 
 Billing (as he puts his papers together). Well, I'm damned if I go and
 drink toddy with the Stockmanns tonight!
 
 (The crowd press towards the exit. The uproar continues outside; shouts
 of "Enemy of the People!" are heard from without.)
 
 
 
 
 ACT V
 
 
 (SCENE.--DR. STOCKMANN'S study. Bookcases and cabinets containing
 specimens, line the walls. At the back is a door leading to the hall;
 in the foreground on the left, a door leading to the sitting-room. In
 the righthand wall are two windows, of which all the panes are broken.
 The DOCTOR'S desk, littered with books and papers, stands in the middle
 of the room, which is in disorder. It is morning. DR. STOCKMANN in
 dressing-gown, slippers and a smoking-cap, is bending down and raking
 with an umbrella under one of the cabinets. After a little while he
 rakes out a stone.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann (calling through the open sitting-room door). Katherine,
 I have found another one.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (from the sitting-room). Oh, you will find a lot more
 yet, I expect.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (adding the stone to a heap of others on the table). I
 shall treasure these stones as relics. Ejlif and Morten shall look at
 them every day, and when they are grown up they shall inherit them as
 heirlooms. (Rakes about under a bookcase.) Hasn't--what the deuce is
 her name?--the girl, you know--hasn't she been to fetch the glazier yet?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (coming in). Yes, but he said he didn't know if he would
 be able to come today.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. You will see he won't dare to come.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Well, that is just what Randine thought--that he didn't
 dare to, on account of the neighbours. (Calls into the sitting-room.)
 What is it you want, Randine? Give it to me. (Goes in, and comes out
 again directly.) Here is a letter for you, Thomas.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Let me see it. (Opens and reads it.) Ah!--of course.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Who is it from?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. From the landlord. Notice to quit.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Is it possible? Such a nice man
 
 Dr. Stockmann (looking at the letter). Does not dare do otherwise, he
 says. Doesn't like doing it, but dare not do otherwise--on account of
 his fellow-citizens--out of regard for public opinion. Is in a
 dependent position--dares not offend certain influential men.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. There, you see, Thomas!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, yes, I see well enough; the whole lot of them in
 the town are cowards; not a man among them dares do anything for fear
 of the others. (Throws the letter on to the table.) But it doesn't
 matter to us, Katherine. We are going to sail away to the New World,
 and--
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. But, Thomas, are you sure we are well advised to take
 this step?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Are you suggesting that I should stay here, where they
 have pilloried me as an enemy of the people--branded me--broken my
 windows! And just look here, Katherine--they have torn a great rent in
 my black trousers too!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Oh, dear!--and they are the best pair you have got!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. You should never wear your best trousers when you go out
 to fight for freedom and truth. It is not that I care so much about the
 trousers, you know; you can always sew them up again for me. But that
 the common herd should dare to make this attack on me, as if they were
 my equals--that is what I cannot, for the life of me, swallow!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. There is no doubt they have behaved very ill toward
 you, Thomas; but is that sufficient reason for our leaving our native
 country for good and all?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. If we went to another town, do you suppose we should not
 find the common people just as insolent as they are here? Depend upon
 it, there is not much to choose between them. Oh, well, let the curs
 snap--that is not the worst part of it. The worst is that, from one end
 of this country to the other, every man is the slave of his Party.
 Although, as far as that goes, I daresay it is not much better in the
 free West either; the compact majority, and liberal public opinion, and
 all that infernal old bag of tricks are probably rampant there too. But
 there things are done on a larger scale, you see. They may kill you,
 but they won't put you to death by slow torture. They don't squeeze a
 free man's soul in a vice, as they do here. And, if need be, one can
 live in solitude. (Walks up and down.) If only I knew where there was a
 virgin forest or a small South Sea island for sale, cheap--
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. But think of the boys, Thomas!
 
 Dr. Stockmann (standing still). What a strange woman you are,
 Katherine! Would you prefer to have the boys grow up in a society like
 this? You saw for yourself last night that half the population are out
 of their minds; and if the other half have not lost their senses, it is
 because they are mere brutes, with no sense to lose.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. But, Thomas dear, the imprudent things you said had
 something to do with it, you know.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Well, isn't what I said perfectly true? Don't they turn
 every idea topsy-turvy? Don't they make a regular hotchpotch of right
 and wrong? Don't they say that the things I know are true, are lies?
 The craziest part of it all is the fact of these "liberals," men of
 full age, going about in crowds imagining that they are the
 broad-minded party! Did you ever hear anything like it, Katherine!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, yes, it's mad enough of them, certainly;
 but--(PETRA comes in from the silting-room). Back from school already?
 
 Petra. Yes. I have been given notice of dismissal.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Dismissal?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. You too?
 
 Petra. Mrs. Busk gave me my notice; so I thought it was best to go at
 once.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. You were perfectly right, too!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Who would have thought Mrs. Busk was a woman like that!
 
 Petra. Mrs. Busk isn't a bit like that, mother; I saw quite plainly how
 it hurt her to do it. But she didn't dare do otherwise, she said; and
 so I got my notice.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (laughing and rubbing his hands). She didn't dare do
 otherwise, either! It's delicious!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Well, after the dreadful scenes last night--
 
 Petra. It was not only that. Just listen to this, father!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Well?
 
 Petra. Mrs. Busk showed me no less than three letters she received this
 morning--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Anonymous, I suppose?
 
 Petra. Yes.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, because they didn't dare to risk signing their
 names, Katherine!
 
 Petra. And two of them were to the effect that a man, who has been our
 guest here, was declaring last night at the Club that my views on
 various subjects are extremely emancipated--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. You did not deny that, I hope?
 
 Petra. No, you know I wouldn't. Mrs. Busk's own views are tolerably
 emancipated, when we are alone together; but now that this report about
 me is being spread, she dare not keep me on any longer.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. And someone who had been a guest of ours! That shows
 you the return you get for your hospitality, Thomas!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. We won't live in such a disgusting hole any longer. Pack
 up as quickly as you can, Katherine; the sooner we can get away, the
 better.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Be quiet--I think I hear someone in the hall. See who
 it is, Petra.
 
 Petra (opening the door). Oh, it's you, Captain Horster! Do come in.
 
 Horster (coming in). Good morning. I thought I would just come in and
 see how you were.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (shaking his hand). Thanks--that is really kind of you.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. And thank you, too, for helping us through the crowd,
 Captain Horster.
 
 Petra. How did you manage to get home again?
 
 Horster. Oh, somehow or other. I am fairly strong, and there is more
 sound than fury about these folk.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, isn't their swinish cowardice astonishing? Look
 here, I will show you something! There are all the stones they have
 thrown through my windows. Just look at them! I'm hanged if there are
 more than two decently large bits of hard stone in the whole heap; the
 rest are nothing but gravel--wretched little things. And yet they stood
 out there bawling and swearing that they would do me some violence; but
 as for doing anything--you don't see much of that in this town.
 
 Horster. Just as well for you this time, doctor!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. True enough. But it makes one angry all the same;
 because if some day it should be a question of a national fight in real
 earnest, you will see that public opinion will be in favour of taking
 to one's heels, and the compact majority will turn tail like a flock of
 sheep, Captain Horster. That is what is so mournful to think of; it
 gives me so much concern, that--. No, devil take it, it is ridiculous
 to care about it! They have called me an enemy of the people, so an
 enemy of the people let me be!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. You will never be that, Thomas.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Don't swear to that, Katherine. To be called an ugly
 name may have the same effect as a pin-scratch in the lung. And that
 hateful name--I can't get quit of it. It is sticking here in the pit of
 my stomach, eating into me like a corrosive acid. And no magnesia will
 remove it.
 
 Petra. Bah!--you should only laugh at them, father,
 
 Horster. They will change their minds some day, Doctor.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, Thomas, as sure as you are standing here.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Perhaps, when it is too late. Much good may it do them!
 They may wallow in their filth then and rue the day when they drove a
 patriot into exile. When do you sail, Captain Horster?
 
 Horster. Hm!--that was just what I had come to speak about--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Why, has anything gone wrong with the ship?
 
 Horster. No; but what has happened is that I am not to sail in it.
 
 Petra. Do you mean that you have been dismissed from your command?
 
 Horster (smiling). Yes, that's just it.
 
 Petra. You too.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. There, you see, Thomas!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And that for the truth's sake! Oh, if I had thought such
 a thing possible--
 
 Horster. You mustn't take it to heart; I shall be sure to find a job
 with some ship-owner or other, elsewhere.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And that is this man Vik--a wealthy man, independent of
 everyone and everything--! Shame on him!
 
 Horster. He is quite an excellent fellow otherwise; he told me himself
 he would willingly have kept me on, if only he had dared--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. But he didn't dare? No, of course not.
 
 Horster. It is not such an easy matter, he said, for a party man--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. The worthy man spoke the truth. A party is like a
 sausage machine; it mashes up all sorts of heads together into the same
 mincemeat--fatheads and blockheads, all in one mash!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Come, come, Thomas dear!
 
 Petra (to HORSTER). If only you had not come home with us, things might
 not have come to this pass.
 
 Horster. I do not regret it.
 
 Petra (holding out her hand to him). Thank you for that!
 
 Horster (to DR. STOCKMANN). And so what I came to say was that if you
 are determined to go away, I have thought of another plan--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. That's splendid!--if only we can get away at once.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Hush!--wasn't that some one knocking?
 
 Petra. That is uncle, surely.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Aha! (Calls out.) Come in!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Dear Thomas, promise me definitely--. (PETER STOCKMANN
 comes in from the hall.)
 
 Peter Stockmann. Oh, you are engaged. In that case, I will--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. No, no, come in.
 
 Peter Stockmann. But I wanted to speak to you alone.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. We will go into the sitting-room in the meanwhile.
 
 Horster. And I will look in again later.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. No, go in there with them, Captain Horster; I want to
 hear more about--.
 
 Horster. Very well, I will wait, then. (He follows MRS. STOCKMANN and
 PETRA into the sitting-room.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I daresay you find it rather draughty here today. Put
 your hat on.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Thank you, if I may. (Does so.) I think I caught cold
 last night; I stood and shivered--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Really? I found it warm enough.
 
 Peter Stockmann. I regret that it was not in my power to prevent those
 excesses last night.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Have you anything in particular to say to me besides
 that?
 
 Peter Stockmann (taking a big letter from his pocket). I have this
 document for you, from the Baths Committee.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. My dismissal?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Yes, dating from today. (Lays the letter on the
 table.) It gives us pain to do it; but, to speak frankly, we dared not
 do otherwise on account of public opinion.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (smiling). Dared not? I seem to have heard that word
 before, today.
 
 Peter Stockmann. I must beg you to understand your position clearly.
 For the future you must not count on any practice whatever in the town.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Devil take the practice! But why are you so sure of that?
 
 Peter Stockmann. The Householders' Association is circulating a list
 from house to house. All right-minded citizens are being called upon to
 give up employing you; and I can assure you that not a single head of a
 family will risk refusing his signature. They simply dare not.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. No, no; I don't doubt it. But what then?
 
 Peter Stockmann. If I might advise you, it would be best to leave the
 place for a little while--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, the propriety of leaving the place has occurred to
 me.
 
 Peter Stockmann. Good. And then, when you have had six months to think
 things over, if, after mature consideration, you can persuade yourself
 to write a few words of regret, acknowledging your error--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I might have my appointment restored to me, do you mean?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Perhaps. It is not at all impossible.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. But what about public opinion, then? Surely you would
 not dare to do it on account of public feeling...
 
 Peter Stockmann. Public opinion is an extremely mutable thing. And, to
 be quite candid with you, it is a matter of great importance to us to
 have some admission of that sort from you in writing.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Oh, that's what you are after, is it! I will just
 trouble you to remember what I said to you lately about foxy tricks of
 that sort!
 
 Peter Stockmann. Your position was quite different then. At that time
 you had reason to suppose you had the whole town at your back--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, and now I feel I have the whole town ON my
 back--(flaring up). I would not do it if I had the devil and his dam on
 my back--! Never--never, I tell you!
 
 Peter Stockmann. A man with a family has no right to behave as you do.
 You have no right to do it, Thomas.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I have no right! There is only one single thing in the
 world a free man has no right to do. Do you know what that is?
 
 Peter Stockmann. No.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Of course you don't, but I will tell you. A free man has
 no right to soil himself with filth; he has no right to behave in a way
 that would justify his spitting in his own face.
 
 Peter Stockmann. This sort of thing sounds extremely plausible, of
 course; and if there were no other explanation for your obstinacy--.
 But as it happens that there is.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. What do you mean?
 
 Peter Stockmann. You understand, very well what I mean. But, as your
 brother and as a man of discretion, I advise you not to build too much
 upon expectations and prospects that may so very easily fail you.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. What in the world is all this about?
 
 Peter Stockmann. Do you really ask me to believe that you are ignorant
 of the terms of Mr. Kiil's will?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I know that the small amount he possesses is to go to an
 institution for indigent old workpeople. How does that concern me?
 
 Peter Stockmann. In the first place, it is by no means a small amount
 that is in question. Mr. Kiil is a fairly wealthy man.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I had no notion of that!
 
 Peter Stockmann. Hm!--hadn't you really? Then I suppose you had no
 notion, either, that a considerable portion of his wealth will come to
 your children, you and your wife having a life-rent of the capital. Has
 he never told you so?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Never, on my honour! Quite the reverse; he has
 consistently done nothing but fume at being so unconscionably heavily
 taxed. But are you perfectly certain of this, Peter?
 
 Peter Stockmann. I have it from an absolutely reliable source.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Then, thank God, Katherine is provided for--and the
 children too! I must tell her this at once--(calls out) Katherine,
 Katherine!
 
 Peter Stockmann (restraining him). Hush, don't say a word yet!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (opening the door). What is the matter?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Oh, nothing, nothing; you can go back. (She shuts the
 door. DR. STOCKMANN walks up and down in his excitement.) Provided
 for!--Just think of it, we are all provided for! And for life! What a
 blessed feeling it is to know one is provided for!
 
 Peter Stockmann. Yes, but that is just exactly what you are not. Mr.
 Kiil can alter his will any day he likes.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. But he won't do that, my dear Peter. The "Badger" is
 much too delighted at my attack on you and your wise friends.
 
 Peter Stockmann (starts and looks intently at him). Ali, that throws a
 light on various things.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. What things?
 
 Peter Stockmann. I see that the whole thing was a combined manoeuvre on
 your part and his. These violent, reckless attacks that you have made
 against the leading men of the town, under the pretence that it was in
 the name of truth--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. What about them?
 
 Peter Stockmann. I see that they were nothing else than the stipulated
 price for that vindictive old man's will.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (almost speechless). Peter--you are the most disgusting
 plebeian I have ever met in all my life.
 
 Peter Stockmann. All is over between us. Your dismissal is
 irrevocable--we have a weapon against you now. (Goes out.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann. For shame! For shame! (Calls out.) Katherine, you must
 have the floor scrubbed after him! Let--what's her name--devil take it,
 the girl who has always got soot on her nose--
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. (in the sitting-room). Hush, Thomas, be quiet!
 
 Petra (coming to the door). Father, grandfather is here, asking if he
 may speak to you alone.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Certainly he may. (Going to the door.) Come in, Mr.
 Kiil. (MORTEN KIIL comes in. DR. STOCKMANN shuts the door after him.)
 What can I do for you? Won't you sit down?
 
 Morten Kiil. I won't sit. (Looks around.) You look very comfortable
 here today, Thomas.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, don't we!
 
 Morten Kiil. Very comfortable--plenty of fresh air. I should think you
 have got enough to-day of that oxygen you were talking about yesterday.
 Your conscience must be in splendid order to-day, I should think.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. It is.
 
 Morten Kiil. So I should think. (Taps his chest.) Do you know what I
 have got here?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. A good conscience, too, I hope.
 
 Morten Kiil. Bah!--No, it is something better than that. (He takes a
 thick pocket-book from his breast-pocket, opens it, and displays a
 packet of papers.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann (looking at him in astonishment). Shares in the Baths?
 
 Morten Kiil. They were not difficult to get today.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And you have been buying--?
 
 Morten Kiil. As many as I could pay for.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. But, my dear Mr. Kiil--consider the state of the Baths'
 affairs!
 
 Morten Kiil. If you behave like a reasonable man, you can soon set the
 Baths on their feet again.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Well, you can see for yourself that I have done all I
 can, but--. They are all mad in this town!
 
 Morten Kiil. You said yesterday that the worst of this pollution came
 from my tannery. If that is true, then my grandfather and my father
 before me, and I myself, for many years past, have been poisoning the
 town like three destroying angels. Do you think I am going to sit quiet
 under that reproach?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Unfortunately I am afraid you will have to.
 
 Morten Kiil. No, thank you. I am jealous of my name and reputation.
 They call me "the Badger," I am told. A badger is a kind of pig, I
 believe; but I am not going to give them the right to call me that. I
 mean to live and die a clean man.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And how are you going to set about it?
 
 Morten Kiil. You shall cleanse me, Thomas.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I!
 
 Morten Kiil. Do you know what money I have bought these shares with?
 No, of course you can't know--but I will tell you. It is the money that
 Katherine and Petra and the boys will have when I am gone. Because I
 have been able to save a little bit after all, you know.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (flaring up). And you have gone and taken Katherine's
 money for this!
 
 Morten Kiil. Yes, the whole of the money is invested in the Baths now.
 And now I just want to see whether you are quite stark, staring mad,
 Thomas! If you still make out that these animals and other nasty things
 of that sort come from my tannery, it will be exactly as if you were to
 flay broad strips of skin from Katherine's body, and Petra's, and the
 boys'; and no decent man would do that--unless he were mad.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (walking up and down). Yes, but I am mad; I am mad!
 
 Morten Kiil. You cannot be so absurdly mad as all that, when it is a
 question of your wife and children.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (standing still in front of him). Why couldn't you
 consult me about it, before you went and bought all that trash?
 
 Morten Kiil. What is done cannot be undone.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (walks about uneasily). If only I were not so certain
 about it--! But I am absolutely convinced that I am right.
 
 Morten Kiil (weighing the pocket-book in his hand). If you stick to
 your mad idea, this won't be worth much, you know. (Puts the
 pocket-book in his pocket.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann. But, hang it all! It might be possible for science to
 discover some prophylactic, I should think--or some antidote of some
 kind--
 
 Morten Kiil. To kill these animals, do you mean?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, or to make them innocuous.
 
 Morten Kiil. Couldn't you try some rat's-bane?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Don't talk nonsense! They all say it is only
 imagination, you know. Well, let it go at that! Let them have their own
 way about it! Haven't the ignorant, narrow-minded curs reviled me as an
 enemy of the people?--and haven't they been ready to tear the clothes
 off my back too?
 
 Morten Kiil. And broken all your windows to pieces!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And then there is my duty to my family. I must talk it
 over with Katherine; she is great on those things.
 
 Morten Kiil. That is right; be guided by a reasonable woman's advice.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (advancing towards him). To think you could do such a
 preposterous thing!  Risking Katherine's money in this way, and putting
 me in such a horribly painful dilemma! When I look at you, I think I
 see the devil himself--.
 
 Morten Kiil. Then I had better go. But I must have an answer from you
 before two o'clock--yes or no. If it is no, the shares go to a charity,
 and that this very day.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And what does Katherine get?
 
 Morten Kiil. Not a halfpenny. (The door leading to the hall opens, and
 HOVSTAD and ASLAKSEN make their appearance.) Look at those two!
 
 Dr. Stockmann (staring at them). What the devil!--have YOU actually the
 face to come into my house?
 
 Hovstad. Certainly.
 
 Aslaksen. We have something to say to you, you see.
 
 Morten Kiil (in a whisper). Yes or no--before two o'clock.
 
 Aslaksen (glancing at HOVSTAD). Aha! (MORTEN KIIL goes out.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Well, what do you want with me? Be brief.
 
 Hovstad. I can quite understand that you are annoyed with us for our
 attitude at the meeting yesterday.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Attitude, do you call it? Yes, it was a charming
 attitude! I call it weak, womanish--damnably shameful!
 
 Hovstad. Call it what you like, we could not do otherwise.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. You DARED not do otherwise--isn't that it?
 
 Hovstad. Well, if you like to put it that way.
 
 Aslaksen. But why did you not let us have word of it beforehand?--just
 a hint to Mr. Hovstad or to me?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. A hint? Of what?
 
 Aslaksen. Of what was behind it all.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I don't understand you in the least--
 
 Aslaksen (with a confidential nod). Oh yes, you do, Dr. Stockmann.
 
 Hovstad. It is no good making a mystery of it any longer.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (looking first at one of them and then at the other).
 What the devil do you both mean?
 
 Aslaksen. May I ask if your father-in-law is not going round the town
 buying up all the shares in the Baths?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, he has been buying Baths shares today; but--
 
 Aslaksen. It would have been more prudent to get someone else to do
 it--someone less nearly related to you.
 
 Hovstad. And you should not have let your name appear in the affair.
 There was no need for anyone to know that the attack on the Baths came
 from you. You ought to have consulted me, Dr. Stockmann.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (looks in front of him; then a light seems to dawn on him
 and he says in amazement.) Are such things conceivable? Are such things
 possible?
 
 Aslaksen (with a smile). Evidently they are. But it is better to use a
 little finesse, you know.
 
 Hovstad. And it is much better to have several persons in a thing of
 that sort; because the responsibility of each individual is lessened,
 when there are others with him.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (composedly). Come to the point, gentlemen. What do you
 want?
 
 Aslaksen. Perhaps Mr. Hovstad had better--
 
 Hovstad. No, you tell him, Aslaksen.
 
 Aslaksen. Well, the fact is that, now we know the bearings of the whole
 affair, we think we might venture to put the "People's Messenger" at
 your disposal.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Do you dare do that now? What about public opinion? Are
 you not afraid of a storm breaking upon our heads?
 
 Hovstad. We will try to weather it.
 
 Aslaksen. And you must be ready to go off quickly on a new tack,
 Doctor. As soon as your invective has done its work--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Do you mean, as soon as my father-in-law and I have got
 hold of the shares at a low figure?
 
 Hovstad. Your reasons for wishing to get the control of the Baths are
 mainly scientific, I take it.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Of course; it was for scientific reasons that I
 persuaded the old "Badger" to stand in with me in the matter. So we
 will tinker at the conduit-pipes a little, and dig up a little bit of
 the shore, and it shan't cost the town a sixpence. That will be all
 right--eh?
 
 Hovstad. I think so--if you have the "People's Messenger" behind you.
 
 Aslaksen. The Press is a power in a free community. Doctor.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Quite so. And so is public opinion. And you, Mr.
 Aslaksen--I suppose you will be answerable for the Householders'
 Association?
 
 Aslaksen. Yes, and for the Temperance Society. You may rely on that.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. But, gentlemen--I really am ashamed to ask the
 question--but, what return do you--?
 
 Hovstad. We should prefer to help you without any return whatever,
 believe me. But the "People's Messenger" is in rather a shaky
 condition; it doesn't go really well; and I should be very unwilling to
 suspend the paper now, when there is so much work to do here in the
 political way.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Quite so; that would be a great trial to such a friend
 of the people as you are. (Flares up.) But I am an enemy of the people,
 remember! (Walks about the room.) Where have I put my stick? Where the
 devil is my stick?
 
 Hovstad. What's that?
 
 Aslaksen. Surely you never mean--
 
 Dr. Stockmann (standing still.) And suppose I don't give you a single
 penny of all I get out of it? Money is not very easy to get out of us
 rich folk, please to remember!
 
 Hovstad. And you please to remember that this affair of the shares can
 be represented in two ways!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, and you are just the man to do it. If I don't come
 to the rescue of the "People's Messenger," you will certainly take an
 evil view of the affair; you will hunt me down, I can well
 imagine--pursue me--try to throttle me as a dog does a hare.
 
 Hovstad. It is a natural law; every animal must fight for its own
 livelihood.
 
 Aslaksen. And get its food where it can, you know.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (walking about the room). Then you go and look for yours
 in the gutter; because I am going to show you which is the strongest
 animal of us three! (Finds an umbrella and brandishes it above his
 head.) Ah, now--!
 
 Hovstad. You are surely not going to use violence!
 
 Aslaksen. Take care what you are doing with that umbrella.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Out of the window with you, Mr. Hovstad!
 
 Hovstad (edging to the door). Are you quite mad!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Out of the window, Mr. Aslaksen! Jump, I tell you! You
 will have to do it, sooner or later.
 
 Aslaksen (running round the writing-table). Moderation, Doctor--I am a
 delicate man--I can stand so little--(calls out) help, help!
 
 (MRS. STOCKMANN, PETRA and HORSTER come in from the sitting-room.)
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Good gracious, Thomas! What is happening?
 
 Dr. Stockmann (brandishing the umbrella). Jump out, I tell you! Out
 into the gutter!
 
 Hovstad. An assault on an unoffending man! I call you to witness,
 Captain Horster. (Hurries out through the hall.)
 
 Aslaksen (irresolutely). If only I knew the way about here--. (Steals
 out through the sitting-room.)
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (holding her husband back). Control yourself, Thomas!
 
 Dr. Stockmann (throwing down the umbrella). Upon my soul, they have
 escaped after all.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. What did they want you to do?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I will tell you later on; I have something else to think
 about now. (Goes to the table and writes something on a calling-card.)
 Look there, Katherine; what is written there?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Three big Noes; what does that mean.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. I will tell you that too, later on. (Holds out the card
 to PETRA.) There, Petra; tell sooty-face to run over to the "Badger's"
 with that, as quick as she can. Hurry up! (PETRA takes the card and
 goes out to the hall.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Well, I think I have had a visit from every one of the
 devil's messengers to-day! But now I am going to sharpen my pen till
 they can feel its point; I shall dip it in venom and gall; I shall hurl
 my inkpot at their heads!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, but we are going away, you know, Thomas.
 
 (PETRA comes back.)
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Well?
 
 Petra. She has gone with it.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Good.--Going away, did you say? No, I'll be hanged if we
 are going away! We are going to stay where we are, Katherine!
 
 Petra. Stay here?
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Here, in the town?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, here. This is the field of battle--this is where
 the fight will be. This is where I shall triumph! As soon as I have had
 my trousers sewn up I shall go out and look for another house. We must
 have a roof over our heads for the winter.
 
 Horster. That you shall have in my house.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Can I?
 
 Horsier. Yes, quite well. I have plenty of room, and I am almost never
 at home.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. How good of you, Captain Horster!
 
 Petra. Thank you!
 
 Dr. Stockmann (grasping his hand). Thank you, thank you! That is one
 trouble over! Now I can set to work in earnest at once. There is an
 endless amount of things to look through here, Katherine! Luckily I
 shall have all my time at my disposal; because I have been dismissed
 from the Baths, you know.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (with a sigh). Oh yes, I expected that.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And they want to take my practice away from me too. Let
 them! I have got the poor people to fall back upon, anyway--those that
 don't pay anything; and, after all, they need me most, too. But, by
 Jove, they will have to listen to me; I shall preach to them in season
 and out of season, as it says somewhere.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. But, dear Thomas, I should have thought events had
 showed you what use it is to preach.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. You are really ridiculous, Katherine. Do you want me to
 let myself be beaten off the field by public opinion and the compact
 majority and all that devilry? No, thank you! And what I want to do is
 so simple and clear and straightforward. I only want to drum into the
 heads of these curs the fact that the liberals are the most insidious
 enemies of freedom--that party programmes strangle every young and
 vigorous truth--that considerations of expediency turn morality and
 justice upside down--and that they will end by making life here
 unbearable. Don't you think, Captain Horster, that I ought to be able
 to make people understand that?
 
 Horster. Very likely; I don't know much about such things myself.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Well, look here--I will explain! It is the party leaders
 that must be exterminated. A party leader is like a wolf, you see--like
 a voracious wolf. He requires a certain number of smaller victims to
 prey upon every year, if he is to live. Just look at Hovstad and
 Aslaksen! How many smaller victims have they not put an end to--or at
 any rate maimed and mangled until they are fit for nothing except to be
 householders or subscribers to the "People's Messenger"! (Sits down on
 the edge of the table.) Come here, Katherine--look how beautifully the
 sun shines to-day! And this lovely spring air I am drinking in!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, if only we could live on sunshine and spring air,
 Thomas.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Oh, you will have to pinch and save a bit--then we shall
 get along. That gives me very little concern. What is much worse is,
 that I know of no one who is liberal-minded and high-minded enough to
 venture to take up my work after me.
 
 Petra. Don't think about that, father; you have plenty of time before
 you.--Hello, here are the boys already!
 
 (EJLIF and MORTEN come in from the sitting-room.)
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Have you got a holiday?
 
 Morten. No; but we were fighting with the other boys between lessons--
 
 Ejlif. That isn't true; it was the other boys were fighting with us.
 
 Morten. Well, and then Mr. Rorlund said we had better stay at home for
 a day or two.
 
 Dr. Stockmann (snapping his fingers and getting up from the table). I
 have it! I have it, by Jove! You shall never set foot in the school
 again!
 
 The Boys. No more school!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. But, Thomas--
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Never, I say. I will educate you myself; that is to say,
 you shan't learn a blessed thing--
 
 Morten. Hooray!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. --but I will make liberal-minded and high-minded men of
 you. You must help me with that, Petra.
 
 Petra, Yes, father, you may be sure I will.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. And my school shall be in the room where they insulted
 me and called me an enemy of the people. But we are too few as we are;
 I must have at least twelve boys to begin with.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. You will certainly never get them in this town.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. We shall. (To the boys.) Don't you know any street
 urchins--regular ragamuffins--?
 
 Morten. Yes, father, I know lots!
 
 Dr. Stockmann. That's capital! Bring me some specimens of them. I am
 going to experiment with curs, just for once; there may be some
 exceptional heads among them.
 
 Morten. And what are we going to do, when you have made liberal-minded
 and high-minded men of us?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Then you shall drive all the wolves out of the country,
 my boys!
 
 (EJLIF looks rather doubtful about it; MORTEN jumps about crying
 "Hurrah!")
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Let us hope it won't be the wolves that will drive you
 out of the country, Thomas.
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Are you out of your mind, Katherine? Drive me out!
 Now--when I am the strongest man in the town!
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. The strongest--now?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes, and I will go so far as to say that now I am the
 strongest man in the whole world.
 
 Morten. I say!
 
 Dr. Stockmann (lowering his voice). Hush! You mustn't say anything
 about it yet; but I have made a great discovery.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann. Another one?
 
 Dr. Stockmann. Yes. (Gathers them round him, and says confidentially:)
 It is this, let me tell you--that the strongest man in the world is he
 who stands most alone.
 
 Mrs. Stockmann (smiling and shaking her head). Oh, Thomas, Thomas!
 
 Petra (encouragingly, as she grasps her father's hands). Father!

 GHOSTS
 
 
 
 
 ACT I
 
 
 (SCENE.--A large room looking upon a garden door in the left-hand wall,
 and two in the right. In the middle of the room, a round table with
 chairs set about it, and books, magazines and newspapers upon it. In
 the foreground on the left, a window, by which is a small sofa with a
 work-table in front of it. At the back the room opens into a
 conservatory rather smaller than the room. From the right-hand side of
 this, a door leads to the garden. Through the large panes of glass that
 form the outer wall of the conservatory, a gloomy fjord landscape can
 be discerned, half-obscured by steady rain.
 
 ENGSTRAND is standing close to the garden door. His left leg is
 slightly deformed, and he wears a boot with a clump of wood under the
 sole. REGINA, with an empty garden-syringe in her hand, is trying to
 prevent his coming in.)
 
 Regina (below her breath). What is it you want? Stay where you are. The
 rain is dripping off you.
 
 Engstrand. God's good rain, my girl.
 
 Regina. The Devil's own rain, that's what it is!
 
 Engstrand. Lord, how you talk, Regina. (Takes a few limping steps
 forward.) What I wanted to tell you was this--
 
 Regina. Don't clump about like that, stupid! The young master is lying
 asleep upstairs.
 
 Engstrand. Asleep still? In the middle of the day?
 
 Regina. Well, it's no business of yours.
 
 Engstrand. I was out on a spree last night--
 
 Regina. I don't doubt it.
 
 Engstrand. Yes, we are poor weak mortals, my girl--
 
 Regina. We are indeed.
 
 Engstrand. --and the temptations of the world are manifold, you
 know--but, for all that, here I was at my work at half-past five this
 morning.
 
 Regina. Yes, yes, but make yourself scarce now. I am not going to stand
 here as if I had a rendezvous with you.
 
 Engstrand. As if you had a what?
 
 Regina. I am not going to have anyone find you here; so now you know,
 and you can go.
 
 Engstrand (coming a few steps nearer). Not a bit of it! Not before we
 have had a little chat. This afternoon I shall have finished my job
 down at the school house, and I shall be off home to town by tonight's
 boat.
 
 Regina (mutters). Pleasant journey to you!
 
 Engstrand. Thanks, my girl. Tomorrow is the opening of the Orphanage,
 and I expect there will be a fine kick-up here and plenty of good
 strong drink, don't you know. And no one shall say of Jacob Engstrand
 that he can't hold off when temptation comes in his way.
 
 Regina. Oho!
 
 Engstrand. Yes, because there will be a lot of fine folk here tomorrow.
 Parson Manders is expected from town, too.
 
 Regina: What's more, he's coming today.
 
 Engstrand. There you are! And I'm going to be precious careful he
 doesn't have anything to say against me, do you see?
 
 Regina. Oh, that's your game, is it?
 
 Engstrand. What do you mean?
 
 Regina (with a significant look at him). What is it you want to humbug
 Mr. Manders out of this time?
 
 Engstrand. Sh! Sh! Are you crazy? Do you suppose I would want to humbug
 Mr. Manders? No, no--Mr. Manders has always been too kind a friend for
 me to do that. But what I wanted to talk to you about, was my going
 back home tonight.
 
 Regina. The sooner you go, the better I shall be pleased.
 
 Engstrand. Yes, only I want to take you with me, Regina.
 
 Regina (open-mouthed). You want to take me--? What did you say?
 
 Engstrand. I want to take you home with me, I said.
 
 Regina (contemptuously). You will never get me home with you.
 
 Engstrand. Ah, we shall see about that.
 
 Regina. Yes, you can be quite certain we shall see about that. I, who
 have been brought up by a lady like Mrs. Alving?--I, who have been
 treated almost as if I were her own child?--do you suppose I am going
 home with you?--to such a house as yours? Not likely!
 
 Engstrand. What the devil do you mean? Are you setting yourself up
 against your father, you hussy?
 
 Regina (mutters, without looking at him). You have often told me I was
 none of yours.
 
 Engstrand. Bah!--why do you want to pay any attention to that?
 
 Regina. Haven't you many and many a time abused me and called me a --?
 For shame?
 
 Engstrand. I'll swear I never used such an ugly word.
 
 Regina. Oh, it doesn't matter what word you used.
 
 Engstrand. Besides, that was only when I was a bit fuddled...hm!
 Temptations are manifold in this world, Regina.
 
 Regina. Ugh!
 
 Engstrand. And it was when your mother was in a nasty temper. I had to
 find some way of getting my knife into her, my girl. She was always so
 precious gentile. (Mimicking her.) "Let go, Jacob! Let me be! Please to
 remember that I was three years with the Alvings at Rosenvold, and they
 were people who went to Court!" (Laughs.) Bless my soul, she never
 could forget that Captain Alving got a Court appointment while she was
 in service here.
 
 Regina. Poor mother--you worried her into her grave pretty soon.
 
 Engstrand (shrugging his shoulders). Of course, of course; I have got
 to take the blame for everything.
 
 Regina (beneath her breath, as she turns away). Ugh--that leg, too!
 
 Engstrand. What are you saying, my girl?
 
 Regina. Pied de mouton.
 
 Engstrand. Is that English?
 
 Regina. Yes.
 
 Engstrand. You have had a good education out here, and no mistake; and
 it may stand you in good stead now, Regina.
 
 Regina (after a short silence). And what was it you wanted me to come
 to town for?
 
 Engstrand. Need you ask why a father wants his only child? Ain't I a
 poor lonely widower?
 
 Regina. Oh, don't come to me with that tale. Why do you want me to go?
 
 Engstrand. Well, I must tell you I am thinking of taking up a new line
 now.
 
 Regina (whistles). You have tried that so often--but it has always
 proved a fool's errand.
 
 Engstrand. Ah, but this time you will just see, Regina! Strike me dead
 if--
 
 Regina (stamping her foot). Stop swearing!
 
 Engstrand. Sh! Sh!--you're quite right, my girl, quite right! What I
 wanted to say was only this, that I have put by a tidy penny out of
 what I have made by working at this new Orphanage up here.
 
 Regina. Have you? All the better for you.
 
 Engstrand. What is there for a man to spend his money on, out here in
 the country?
 
 Regina. Well, what then?
 
 Engstrand. Well, you see, I thought of putting the money into something
 that would pay. I thought of some kind of an eating-house for seafaring
 folk--
 
 Regina. Heavens!
 
 Engstrand. Oh, a high-class eating-house, of course--not a pigsty for
 common sailors. Damn it, no; it would be a place ships' captains and
 first mates would come to; really good sort of people, you know.
 
 Regina. And what should I--?
 
 Engstrand. You would help there: But only to make show, you know. You
 wouldn't find it hard work, I can promise you, my girl. You should do
 exactly as you liked.
 
 Regina. Oh, yes, quite so!
 
 Engstrand. But we must have some women in the house; that is as clear
 as daylight. Because in the evening we must make the place a little
 attractive--some singing and dancing, and that sort of thing. Remember
 they are seafolk--wayfarers on the waters of life! (Coming nearer to
 her.) Now don't be a fool and stand in your own way, Regina. What good
 are you going to do here? Will this education, that your mistress has
 paid for, be of any use? You are to look after the children in the new
 Home, I hear. Is that the sort of work for you? Are you so frightfully
 anxious to go and wear out your health and strength for the sake of
 these dirty brats?
 
 Regina. No, if things were to go as I want them to, then--. Well, it
 may happen; who knows? It may happen!
 
 Engstrand. What may happen?
 
 Regina. Never you mind. Is it much that you have put by, up here?
 
 Engstrand. Taking it all round, I should say about forty or fifty
 pounds.
 
 Regina. That's not so bad.
 
 Engstrand. It's enough to make a start with, my girl.
 
 Regina. Don't you mean to give me any of the money?
 
 Engstrand. No, I'm hanged if I do.
 
 Regina. Don't you mean to send me as much as a dress-length of stuff,
 just for once?
 
 Engstrand. Come and live in the town with me and you shall have plenty
 of dresses.
 
 Regina: Pooh!--I can get that much for myself, if I have a mind to.
 
 Engstrand. But it's far better to have a father's guiding hand, Regina.
 Just now I can get a nice house in Little Harbour Street. They don't
 want much money down for it--and we could make it like a sort of
 seamen's home, don't you know.
 
 Regina. But I have no intention of living with you! I'll have nothing
 whatever to do with you: So now, be off!
 
 Engstrand. You wouldn't be living with me long, my girl. No such
 luck--not if you knew how to play your cards. Such a fine wench as you
 have grown this last year or two...
 
 Regina. Well--?
 
 Engstrand. It wouldn't be very long before some first mate came
 along--or perhaps a captain.
 
 Regina. I don't mean to marry a man of that sort. Sailors have no
 savoir-vivre.
 
 Engstrand. What haven't they got?
 
 Regina. I know what sailors are, I tell you. They aren't the sort of
 people to marry.
 
 Engstrand. Well, don't bother about marrying them. You can make it pay
 just as well. (More confidentially.) That fellow--the Englishman--the
 one with the yacht--he gave seventy pounds, he did; and she wasn't a
 bit prettier than you.
 
 Regina (advancing towards him). Get out!
 
 Engstrand (stepping back). Here! here!--you're not going to hit me, I
 suppose?
 
 Regina. Yes! If you talk like that of mother, I will hit you. Get out,
 I tell. You! (Pushes him up to the garden door.) And don't bang the
 doors. Young Mr. Alving--
 
 Engstrand. Is asleep--I know. It's funny how anxious you are about
 young Mr. Alving. (In a lower tone.) Oho! is it possible that it is he
 that--?
 
 Regina. Get out, and be quick about it! Your wits are wandering, my
 good man. No, don't go that way; Mr. Manders is just coming along. Be
 off down the kitchen stairs.
 
 Engstrand (moving towards the right). Yes, yes--all right. But have a
 bit of a chat with him that's coming along. He's the chap to tell you
 what a child owes to its father. For I am your father, anyway, you
 know, I can prove it by the Register. (He goes out through the farther
 door which REGINA has opened. She shuts it after him, looks hastily at
 herself in the mirror, fans herself with her handkerchief and sets her
 collar straight; then busies herself with the flowers. MANDERS enters
 the conservatory through the garden door. He wears an overcoat, carries
 an umbrella, and has a small travelling-bag slung over his shoulder on
 a strap.)
 
 Manders. Good morning, Miss Engstrand.
 
 Regina (turning round with a look of pleased surprise), Oh, Mr.
 Manders, good morning. The boat is in, then?
 
 Manders. Just in. (Comes into the room.) It is most tiresome, this rain
 every day.
 
 Regina (following him in). It's a splendid rain for the farmers, Mr.
 Manders.
 
 Manders. Yes, you are quite right. We townfolk think so little about
 that. (Begins to take off his overcoat.)
 
 Regina. Oh, let me help you. That's it. Why, how wet it is! I will hang
 it up in the hall. Give me your umbrella, too; I will leave it open, so
 that it will dry.
 
 (She goes out with the things by the farther door on the right. MANDERS
 lays his bag and his hat down on a chair. REGINA re-enters.)
 
 Manders. Ah, it's very pleasant to get indoors. Well, is everything
 going on well here?
 
 Regina. Yes, thanks.
 
 Manders. Properly busy, though, I expect, getting ready for tomorrow?
 
 Regina. Oh, yes, there is plenty to do.
 
 Manders. And Mrs. Alving is at home, I hope?
 
 Regina. Yes, she is. She has just gone upstairs to take the young
 master his chocolate.
 
 Manders. Tell me--I heard down at the pier that Oswald had come back.
 
 Regina. Yes, he came the day before yesterday. We didn't expect him
 until today.
 
 Manders. Strong and well, I hope?
 
 Regina. Yes, thank you, well enough. But dreadfully tired after his
 journey. He came straight from Paris without a stop--I mean, he came
 all the way without breaking his journey. I fancy he is having a sleep
 now, so we must talk a little bit more quietly, if you don't mind.
 
 Manders. All right, we will be very quiet.
 
 Regina (while she moves an armchair up to the table), Please sit down,
 Mr. Manders, and make yourself at home. (He sits down; she puts a
 footstool under his feet.) There! Is that comfortable?
 
 Manders. Thank you, thank you. That is most comfortable; (Looks at
 her.) I'll tell you what, Miss Engstrand, I certainly think you have
 grown since I saw you last.
 
 Regina. Do you think so? Mrs. Alving says, too--that I have developed.
 
 Manders. Developed? Well, perhaps a little--just suitably. (A short
 pause.)
 
 Regina. Shall I tell Mrs. Alving you are here?
 
 Manders. Thanks, there is no hurry, my dear child. Now tell me, Regina
 my dear, how has your father been getting on here?
 
 Regina. Thank you, Mr. Manders, he is getting on pretty well.
 
 Manders. He came to see me the last time he was in town.
 
 Regina. Did he? He is always so glad when he can have a chat with you.
 
 Manders. And I suppose you have seen him pretty regularly every day?
 
 Regina. I? Oh, yes, I do--whenever I have time, that is to say.
 
 Manders. Your father has not a very strong character, Miss Engstrand.
 He sadly needs a guiding hand.
 
 Regina. Yes, I can quite believe that.
 
 Manders. He needs someone with him that he can cling to, someone whose
 judgment he can rely on. He acknowledged that freely himself, the last
 time he came up to see me.
 
 Regina. Yes, he has said something of the same sort to me. But I don't
 know whether Mrs. Alving could do without me--most of all just now,
 when we have the new Orphanage to see about. And I should be dreadfully
 unwilling to leave Mrs. Alving, too; she has always been so good to me.
 
 Manders. But a daughter's duty, my good child--. Naturally we should
 have to get your mistress' consent first.
 
 Regina. Still I don't know whether it would be quite the thing, at my
 age, to keep house for a single man.
 
 Manders. What! My dear Miss Engstrand, it is your own father we are
 speaking of!
 
 Regina. Yes, I dare say, but still--. Now, if it were in a good house
 and with a real gentleman--
 
 Manders. But, my dear Regina!
 
 Regina. --one whom I could feel an affection for, and really feel in
 the position of a daughter to...
 
 Manders. Come, come--my dear good child--
 
 Regina. I should like very much to live in town.  Out here it is
 terribly lonely; and you know yourself, Mr. Manders, what it is to be
 alone in the world. And, though I say it, I really am both capable and
 willing. Don't you know any place that would be suitable for me, Mr.
 Manders?
 
 Manders. I? No, indeed I don't.
 
 Regina. But, dear Mr. Manders--at any rate don't forget me, in case--
 
 Manders (getting up). No, I won't forget you, Miss Engstrand.
 
 Regina. Because, if I--
 
 Manders. Perhaps you will be so kind as to let Mrs. Alving know I am
 here?
 
 Regina. I will fetch her at once, Mr. Manders. (Goes out to the left.
 MANDERS walks up and down the room once or twice, stands for a moment
 at the farther end of the room with his hands behind his back and looks
 out into the garden. Then he comes back to the table, takes up a book
 and looks at the title page, gives a start, and looks at some of the
 others.)
 
 Manders. Hm!--Really!
 
 (MRS. ALVING comes in by the door on the left. She is followed by
 REGINA, who goes out again at once through the nearer door on the
 right.)
 
 Mrs. Alving (holding out her hand). I am very glad to see you, Mr.
 Manders.
 
 Manders. How do you do, Mrs. Alving. Here I am, as I promised.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Always punctual!
 
 Manders. Indeed, I was hard put to it to get away. What with vestry
 meetings and committees.
 
 Mrs. Alving. It was all the kinder of you to come in such good time; we
 can settle our business before dinner. But where is your luggage?
 
 Manders (quickly). My things are down at the village shop. I am going
 to sleep there tonight.
 
 Mrs. Alving (repressing a smile). Can't I really persuade you to stay
 the night here this time?
 
 Manders. No, no; many thanks all the same; I will put up there, as
 usual. It is so handy for getting on board the boat again.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Of course, you shall do as you please. But it seems to me
 quite another thing, now we are two old people--
 
 Manders. Ha! ha! You will have your joke! And it's natural you should
 be in high spirits today--first of all there is the great event
 tomorrow, and also you have got Oswald home.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, am I not a lucky woman! It is more than two years
 since he was home last, and he has promised to stay the whole winter
 with me.
 
 Manders, Has he, really? That is very nice and filial of him; because
 there must be many more attractions in his life in Rome or in Paris, I
 should think.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, but he has his mother here, you see. Bless the dear
 boy, he has got a corner in his heart for his mother still.
 
 Manders. Oh, it would be very sad if absence and preoccupation with
 such a thing as Art were to dull the natural affections.
 
 Mrs. Alving. It would, indeed. But there is no fear of that with him, I
 am glad to say. I am quite curious to see if you recognise him again.
 He will be down directly; he is just lying down for a little on the
 sofa upstairs. But do sit down, my dear friend.
 
 Manders. Thank you. You are sure I am not disturbing you?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Of course not. (She sits down at the table.)
 
 Manders. Good. Then I will show you--. (He goes to the chair where his
 bag is lying and takes a packet of papers from it; then sits down at
 the opposite side of the table and looks for a clear space to put the
 papers down.) Now first of all, here is--(breaks off). Tell me, Mrs.
 Alving, what are these books doing here?
 
 Mrs. Alving. These books? I am reading them,
 
 Manders. Do you read this sort of thing?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Certainly I do.
 
 Manders. Do you feel any the better or the happier for reading books of
 this kind?
 
 Mrs. Alving. I think it makes me, as it were, more self-reliant.
 
 Manders. That is remarkable. But why?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Well, they give me an explanation or a confirmation of
 lots of different ideas that have come into my own mind. But what
 surprises me, Mr. Manders, is that, properly speaking, there is nothing
 at all new in these books. There is nothing more in them than what most
 people think and believe. The only thing is, that most people either
 take no account of it or won't admit it to themselves.
 
 Manders. But, good heavens, do you seriously think that most people--?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, indeed, I do.
 
 Manders. But not here in the country at any rate? Not here amongst
 people like ourselves?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, amongst people like ourselves too.
 
 Manders. Well, really, I must say--!
 
 Mrs. Alving. But what is the particular objection that you have to
 these books?
 
 Manders. What objection? You surely don't suppose that I take any
 particular interest in such productions?
 
 Mrs. Alving. In fact, you don't know anything about what you are
 denouncing?
 
 Manders. I have read quite enough about these books to disapprove of
 them:
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, but your own opinion--
 
 Manders. My dear Mrs. Alving, there are many occasions in life when one
 has to rely on the opinion of others. That is the way in this world,
 and it is quite right that it should be so. What would become of
 society, otherwise?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Well, you may be right.
 
 Manders. Apart from that, naturally I don't deny that literature of
 this kind may have a considerable attraction. And I cannot blame you,
 either, for wishing to make yourself acquainted with the intellectual
 tendencies which I am told are at work in the wider world in which you
 have allowed your son to wander for so long but--
 
 Mrs. Alving. But--?
 
 Manders (lowering his voice). But one doesn't talk about it, Mrs.
 Alving. One certainly is not called upon to account to everyone for
 what one reads or thinks in the privacy of one's own room.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Certainly not. I quite agree with you.
 
 Manders. Just think of the consideration you owe to this Orphanage,
 which you decided to build at a time when your thoughts on such
 subjects were very different from what they are now--as far as I am
 able to judge.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, I freely admit that. But it was about the Orphanage...
 
 Manders. It was about the Orphanage we were going to talk; quite so.
 Well--walk warily, dear Mrs. Alving! And now let us turn to the
 business in hand. (Opens an envelope and takes out some papers.) You
 see these?
 
 Mrs. Alving. The deeds?
 
 Manders. Yes, the whole lot--and everything in order; I can tell you it
 has been no easy matter to get them in time. I had positively to put
 pressure on the authorities; they are almost painfully conscientious
 when it is a question of settling property. But here they are at last.
 (Turns over the papers.) Here is the deed of conveyance of that part of
 the Rosenvold estate known as the Solvik property, together with the
 buildings newly erected thereon--the school, the masters' houses and
 the chapel. And here is the legal sanction for the statutes of the
 institution. Here, you see--(reads) "Statutes for the Captain Alving
 Orphanage."
 
 Mrs. Alving (after a long look at the papers). That seems all in order.
 
 Manders. I thought "Captain" was the better title to use, rather than
 your husband's Court title of "Chamberlain." "Captain" seems less
 ostentatious.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, yes; just as you think best.
 
 Manders. And here is the certificate for the investment of the capital
 in the bank, the interest being earmarked for the current expenses of
 the Orphanage.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Many thanks; but I think it will be most convenient if you
 will kindly take charge of them.
 
 Manders. With pleasure. I think it will be best to leave the money in
 the bank for the present. The interest is not very high, it is true;
 four per cent at six months' call; later on, if we can find some good
 mortgage--of course it must be a first mortgage and on unexceptionable
 security--we can consider the matter further.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, yes, my dear Mr. Manders, you know best about all
 that.
 
 Manders. I will keep my eye on it, anyway. But there is one thing in
 connection with it that I have often meant to ask you about.
 
 Mrs. Alving. What is that?
 
 Manders. Shall we insure the buildings, or not?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Of course we must insure them.
 
 Manders. Ah, but wait a moment, dear lady. Let us look into the matter
 a little more closely.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Everything of mine is insured--the house and its contents,
 my livestock--everything.
 
 Manders. Naturally. They are your own property. I do exactly the same,
 of course. But this, you see, is quite a different case. The Orphanage
 is, so to speak, dedicated to higher uses.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Certainly, but--
 
 Manders. As far as I am personally concerned, I can conscientiously say
 that I don't see the smallest objection to our insuring ourselves
 against all risks.
 
 Mrs. Alving. That is exactly what I think.
 
 Manders. But what about the opinion of the people hereabouts?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Their opinion--?
 
 Manders. Is there any considerable body of opinion here--opinion of
 some account, I mean--that might take exception to it?
 
 Mrs. Alving. What, exactly, do you mean by opinion of some account?
 
 Manders. Well, I was thinking particularly of persons of such
 independent and influential position that one could hardly refuse to
 attach weight to their opinion.
 
 Mrs. Alving. There are a certain number of such people here, who might
 perhaps take exception to it if we--
 
 Manders. That's just it, you see. In town there are lots of them. All
 my fellow-clergymen's congregations, for instance! It would be so
 extremely easy for them to interpret it as meaning that neither you nor
 I had a proper reliance on Divine protection.
 
 Mrs. Alving. But as far as you are concerned, my dear friend, you have
 at all events the consciousness that--
 
 Manders. Yes I know I know; my own mind is quite easy about it, it is
 true. But we should not be able to prevent a wrong and injurious
 interpretation of our action. And that sort of thing, moreover, might
 very easily end in exercising a hampering influence on the work of the
 Orphanage.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Oh, well, if that is likely to be the effect of it--
 
 Manders. Nor can I entirely overlook the difficult--indeed, I may say,
 painful--position I might possibly be placed in. In the best circles in
 town the matter of this Orphanage is attracting a great deal of
 attention. Indeed the Orphanage is to some extent built for the benefit
 of the town too, and it is to be hoped that it may result in the
 lowering of our poor-rate by a considerable amount. But as I have been
 your adviser in the matter and have taken charge of the business side
 of it, I should be afraid that it would be I that spiteful persons
 would attack first of all.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, you ought not to expose yourself to that.
 
 Manders. Not to mention the attacks that would undoubtedly be made upon
 me in certain newspapers and reviews.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Say no more about it, dear Mr. Manders; that quite decides
 it.
 
 Manders. Then you don't wish it to be insured?
 
 Mrs. Alving. No, we will give up the idea.
 
 Manders (leaning back in his chair). But suppose, now, that some
 accident happened?--one can never tell--would you be prepared to make
 good the damage?
 
 Mrs. Alving. No; I tell you quite plainly I would not do so under any
 circumstances.
 
 Manders. Still, you know, Mrs. Alving--after all, it is a serious
 responsibility that we are taking upon ourselves.
 
 Mrs. Alving. But do you think we can do otherwise?
 
 Manders. No, that's just it. We really can't do otherwise. We ought not
 to expose ourselves to a mistaken judgment; and we have no right to do
 anything that will scandalise the community.
 
 Mrs. Alving. You ought not to, as a clergyman, at any rate.
 
 Manders. And, what is more, I certainly think that we may count upon
 our enterprise being attended by good fortune--indeed, that it will be
 under a special protection.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Let us hope so, Mr. Manders.
 
 Manders. Then we will leave it alone?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Certainly.
 
 Manders. Very good. As you wish. (Makes a note.) No insurance, then.
 
 Mrs. Alving. It's a funny thing that you should just have happened to
 speak about that today--
 
 Manders. I have often meant to ask you about it.
 
 Mrs. Alving. --because yesterday we very nearly had a fire up there.
 
 Manders. Do you mean it!
 
 Mrs. Alving. Oh, as a matter of fact it was nothing of any consequence.
 Some shavings in the carpenter's shop caught fire.
 
 Manders. Where Engstrand works?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes. They say he is often so careless with matches.
 
 Manders. He has so many things on his mind, poor fellow--so many
 anxieties. Heaven be thanked, I am told he is really making an effort
 to live a blameless life.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Really? Who told you so?
 
 Manders. He assured me himself that it is so. He's good workman, too.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Oh, yes, when he is sober.
 
 Manders. Ah, that sad weakness of his! But the pain in his poor leg
 often drives him to it, he tells me. The last time he was in town, I
 was really quite touched by him. He came to my house and thanked me so
 gratefully for getting him work here, where he could have the chance of
 being with Regina.
 
 Mrs. Alving. He doesn't see very much of her.
 
 Manders. But he assured me that he saw her every day.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Oh well, perhaps he does.
 
 Manders. He feels so strongly that he needs someone who can keep a hold
 on him when temptations assail him. That is the most winning thing
 about Jacob Engstrand; he comes to one like a helpless child and
 accuses himself and confesses his frailty. The last time he came and
 had a talk with me... Suppose now, Mrs. Alving, that it were really a
 necessity of his existence to have Regina at home with him again--
 
 Mrs. Alving (standing up suddenly). Regina!
 
 Manders. --you ought not to set yourself against him.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Indeed, I set myself very definitely against that. And,
 besides, you know Regina is to have a post in the Orphanage.
 
 Manders. But consider, after all he is her father--
 
 Mrs. Alving. I know best what sort of a father he has been to her. No,
 she shall never go to him with my consent.
 
 Manders (getting up). My dear lady, don't judge so hastily. It is very
 sad how you misjudge poor Engstrand. One would really think you were
 afraid...
 
 Mrs. Alving (more calmly). That is not the question. I have taken
 Regina into my charge, and in my charge she remains. (Listens.) Hush,
 dear Mr. Manders, don't say any more about it. (Her face brightens with
 pleasure.) Listen! Oswald is coming downstairs. We will only think
 about him now.
 
 (OSWALD ALVING, in a light overcoat, hat in hand and smoking a big
 meerschaum pipe, comes in by the door on the left.)
 
 Oswald (standing in the doorway). Oh, I beg your pardon, I thought you
 were in the office. (Comes in.) Good morning, Mr. Manders.
 
 Manders (staring at him). Well! It's most extraordinary.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, what do you think of him, Mr. Manders?
 
 Manders. I-I-no, can it possibly be--?
 
 Oswald. Yes, it really is the prodigal son, Mr. Manders.
 
 Manders. Oh, my dear young friend--
 
 Oswald. Well, the son came home, then.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Oswald is thinking of the time when you were so opposed to
 the idea of his being a painter.
 
 Manders. We are only fallible, and many steps seem to us hazardous at
 first, that afterwards--(grasps his hand). Welcome, welcome! Really, my
 dear Oswald--may I still call you Oswald?
 
 Oswald. What else would you think of calling me?
 
 Manders. Thank you. What I mean, my dear Oswald, is that you must not
 imagine that I have any unqualified disapproval of the artist's life. I
 admit that there are many who, even in that career, can keep the inner
 man free from harm.
 
 Oswald. Let us hope so.
 
 Mrs. Alving (beaming with pleasure). I know one who has kept both the
 inner and the outer man free from harm. Just take a look at him, Mr.
 Manders.
 
 Oswald (walks across the room). Yes, yes, mother dear, of course.
 
 Manders. Undoubtedly--no one can deny it. And I hear you have begun to
 make a name for yourself. I have often seen mention of you in the
 papers--and extremely favourable mention, too. Although, I must admit,
 lately I have not seen your name so often.
 
 Oswald (going towards the conservatory). I haven't done so much
 painting just lately.
 
 Mrs. Alving. An artist must take a rest sometimes, like other people.
 
 Manders. Of course, of course. At those times the artist is preparing
 and strengthening himself for a greater effort.
 
 Oswald. Yes. Mother, will dinner soon be ready?
 
 Mrs. Alving. In half an hour. He has a fine appetite, thank goodness.
 
 Manders. And a liking for tobacco too.
 
 Oswald. I found father's pipe in the room upstairs, and--
 
 Manders. Ah, that is what it was!
 
 Mrs. Alving. What?
 
 Manders. When Oswald came in at that door with the pipe in his mouth, I
 thought for the moment it was his father in the flesh.
 
 Oswald. Really?
 
 Mrs. Alving. How can you say so! Oswald takes after me.
 
 Manders. Yes, but there is an expression about the corners of his
 mouth--something about the lips--that reminds me so exactly of Mr.
 Alving--especially when he smokes.
 
 Mrs. Alving. I don't think so at all. To my mind, Oswald has much more
 of a clergyman's mouth.
 
 Menders. Well, yes--a good many of my colleagues in the church have a
 similar expression.
 
 Mrs. Alving. But put your pipe down, my dear boy. I don't allow any
 smoking in here.
 
 Oswald (puts down his pipe). All right, I only wanted to try it,
 because I smoked it once when I was a child.
 
 Mrs. Alving. You?
 
 Oswald. Yes; it was when I was quite a little chap. And I can remember
 going upstairs to father's room one evening when he was in very good
 spirits.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Oh, you can't remember anything about those days.
 
 Oswald. Yes, I remember plainly that he took me on his knee and let me
 smoke his pipe. "Smoke, my boy," he said, "have a good smoke, boy!" And
 I smoked as hard as I could, until I felt I was turning quite pale and
 the perspiration was standing in great drops on my forehead. Then he
 laughed--such a hearty laugh.
 
 Manders. It was an extremely odd thing to do.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Dear Mr. Manders, Oswald only dreamt it.
 
 Oswald. No indeed, mother, it was no dream. Because--don't you
 remember--you came into the room and carried me off to the nursery,
 where I was sick, and I saw that you were crying. Did father often play
 such tricks?
 
 Manders. In his young days he was full of fun--
 
 Oswald. And, for all that, he did so much with his life--so much that
 was good and useful, I mean--short as his life was.
 
 Manders. Yes, my dear Oswald Alving, you have inherited the name of a
 man who undoubtedly was both energetic and worthy. Let us hope it will
 be a spur to your energies.
 
 Oswald. It ought to be, certainly.
 
 Manders. In any case it was nice of you to come home for the day that
 is to honour his memory.
 
 Oswald. I could do no less for my father.
 
 Mrs. Alving. And to let me keep him so long here--that's the nicest
 part of what he has done.
 
 Manders. Yes, I hear you are going to spend the winter at home.
 
 Oswald. I am here for an indefinite time, Mr. Manders.--Oh, it's good
 to be at home again!
 
 Mrs. Alving (beaming). Yes, isn't it?
 
 Manders (looking sympathetically at him). You went out into the world
 very young, my dear Oswald.
 
 Oswald. I did. Sometimes I wonder if I wasn't too young.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Not a bit of it. It is the best thing for an active boy,
 and especially for an only child. It's a pity when they are kept at
 home with their parents and get spoiled.
 
 Manders. That is a very debatable question, Mrs. Alving. A child's own
 home is, and always must be, his proper place.
 
 Oswald. There I agree entirely with Mr. Manders.
 
 Manders. Take the case of your own son. Oh yes, we can talk about it
 before him. What has the result been in his case? He is six or seven
 and twenty, and has never yet had the opportunity of learning what a
 well-regulated home means.
 
 Oswald. Excuse me, Mr. Manders, you are quite wrong there.
 
 Manders. Indeed? I imagined that your life abroad had practically been
 spent entirely in artistic circles.
 
 Oswald. So it has.
 
 Manders. And chiefly amongst the younger artists.
 
 Oswald. Certainly.
 
 Manders. But I imagined that those gentry, as a rule, had not the means
 necessary for family life and the support of a home.
 
 Oswald. There are a considerable number of them who have not the means
 to marry, Mr. Manders.
 
 Manders. That is exactly my point.
 
 Oswald. But they can have a home of their own, all the same; a good
 many of them have. And they are very well-regulated and very
 comfortable homes, too.
 
 (MRS. ALVING, who has listened to him attentively, nods assent, but
 says nothing.)
 
 Manders. Oh, but I am not talking of bachelor establishments. By a home
 I mean family life--the life a man lives with his wife and children.
 
 Oswald. Exactly, or with his children and his children's mother.
 
 Manders (starts and clasps his hands). Good heavens!
 
 Oswald. What is the matter?
 
 Manders. Lives with-with-his children's mother.
 
 Oswald. Well, would you rather he should repudiate his children's
 mother?
 
 Manders. Then what you are speaking of are those unprincipled
 conditions known as irregular unions!
 
 Oswald. I have never noticed anything particularly unprincipled about
 these people's lives.
 
 Manders. But do you mean to say that it is possible for a man of any
 sort of bringing up, and a young woman, to reconcile themselves to such
 a way of living--and to make no secret of it, either!
 
 Oswald. What else are they to do? A poor artist, and a poor girl--it
 costs a good deal to get married. What else are they to do?
 
 Manders. What are they to do? Well, Mr. Alving, I will tell you what
 they ought to do. They ought to keep away from each other from the very
 beginning--that is what they ought to do!
 
 Oswald. That advice wouldn't have much effect upon hot-blooded young
 folk who are in love.
 
 Mrs. Alving. No, indeed it wouldn't.
 
 Manders (persistently). And to think that the authorities tolerate such
 things! That they are allowed to go on, openly! (Turns to MRS. ALVING.)
 Had I so little reason, then, to be sadly concerned about your son? In
 circles where open immorality is rampant--where, one may say, it is
 honoured--
 
 Oswald. Let me tell you this, Mr. Manders. I have been a constant
 Sunday guest at one or two of these "irregular" households.
 
 Manders. On Sunday, too!
 
 Oswald. Yes, that is the day of leisure. But never have I heard one
 objectionable word there, still less have I ever seen anything that
 could be called immoral. No; but do you know when and where I have met
 with immorality in artists' circles?
 
 Manders. No, thank heaven, I don't!
 
 Oswald. Well, then, I shall have the pleasure of telling you. I have
 met with it when someone or other of your model husbands and fathers
 have come out there to have a bit of a look round on their own account,
 and have done the artists the honour of looking them up in their humble
 quarters. Then we had a chance of learning something, I can tell you.
 These gentlemen were able to instruct us about places and things that
 we had never so much as dreamt of.
 
 Manders. What? Do you want me to believe that honourable men when they
 get away from home will--
 
 Oswald. Have you never, when these same honourable men come home again,
 heard them deliver themselves on the subject of the prevalence of
 immorality abroad?
 
 Manders. Yes, of course, but--
 
 Mrs. Alving. I have heard them, too.
 
 Oswald. Well, you can take their word for it, unhesitatingly. Some of
 them are experts in the matter. (Putting his hands to his head.) To
 think that the glorious freedom of the beautiful life over there should
 be so besmirched!
 
 Mrs. Alving. You mustn't get too heated, Oswald; you gain nothing by
 that.
 
 Oswald. No, you are quite right, mother. Besides, it isn't good for me.
 It's because I am so infernally tired, you know. I will go out and take
 a turn before dinner. I beg your pardon, Mr. Manders. It is impossible
 for you to realise the feeling; but it takes me that way (Goes out by
 the farther door on the right.)
 
 Mrs. Alving. My poor boy!
 
 Manders. You may well say so. This is what it has brought him to! (MRS.
 ALVING looks at him, but does not speak.) He called himself the
 prodigal son. It's only too true, alas--only too true! (MRS. ALVING
 looks steadily at him.) And what do you say to all this?
 
 Mrs. Alving. I say that Oswald was right in every single word he said.
 
 Manders. Right? Right? To hold such principles as that?
 
 Mrs. Alving. In my loneliness here I have come to just the same
 opinions as he, Mr. Manders. But I have never presumed to venture upon
 such topics in conversation. Now there is no need; my boy shall speak
 for me.
 
 Manders. You deserve the deepest pity, Mrs. Alving. It is my duty to
 say an earnest word to you. It is no longer your businessman and
 adviser, no longer your old friend and your dead husband's old friend,
 that stands before you now. It is your priest that stands before you,
 just as he did once at the most critical moment of your life.
 
 Mrs. Alving. And what is it that my priest has to say to me?
 
 Manders. First of all I must stir your memory. The moment is well
 chosen. Tomorrow is the tenth anniversary of your husband's death;
 tomorrow the memorial to the departed will be unveiled; tomorrow I
 shall speak to the whole assembly that will be met together, But today
 I want to speak to you alone.
 
 Mrs. Alving, Very well, Mr. Manders, speak!
 
 Manders. Have you forgotten that after barely a year of married life
 you were standing at the very edge of a precipice?--that you forsook
 your house and home? that you ran away from your husband--yes, Mrs.
 Alving, ran away, ran away-=and refused to return to him in spite of
 his requests and entreaties?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Have you forgotten how unspeakably unhappy I was during
 that first year?
 
 Manders. To crave for happiness in this world is simply to be possessed
 by a spirit of revolt. What right have we to happiness? No! we must do
 our duty, Mrs. Alving. And your duty was to cleave to the man you had
 chosen and to whom you were bound by a sacred bond.
 
 Mrs. Alving. You know quite well what sort of a life my husband was
 living at that time--what excesses he was guilty of.
 
 Menders. I know only too well what rumour used to say of him; and I
 should be the last person to approve of his conduct as a young man,
 supposing that rumour spoke the truth. But it is not a wife's part to
 be her husband's judge. You should have considered it your bounden duty
 humbly to have borne the cross that a higher will had laid upon you.
 But, instead of that, you rebelliously cast off your cross, you
 deserted the man whose stumbling footsteps you should have supported,
 you did what was bound to imperil your good name and reputation, and
 came very near to imperilling the reputation of others into the bargain.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Of others? Of one other, you mean.
 
 Manders. It was the height of imprudence, your seeking refuge with me.
 
 Mrs. Alving. With our priest? With our intimate friend?
 
 Manders. All the more on that account; you should thank God that I
 possessed the necessary strength of mind--that I was able to turn you
 from your outrageous intention, and that it was vouchsafed to me to
 succeed in leading you back into the path of duty, and back to your
 lawful husband.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, Mr. Manders, that certainly was your doing.
 
 Manders. I was but the humble instrument of a higher power. And is it
 not true that my having been able to bring you again under the yoke of
 duty and obedience sowed the seeds of a rich blessing on all the rest
 of your life? Did things not turn out as I foretold to you? Did not
 your husband turn from straying in the wrong path, as a man should? Did
 he not, after that, live a life of love and good report with you all
 his days? Did he not become a benefactor to the neighbourhood? Did he
 not so raise you up to his level, so that by degree you became his
 fellow-worker in all his undertakings--and a noble fellow-worker, too.
 I know, Mrs. Alving; that praise I will give you. But now I come to the
 second serious false step in your life.
 
 Mrs. Alving. What do you mean?
 
 Manders, Just as once you forsook your duty as a wife, so, since then,
 you have forsaken your duty as a mother.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Oh--!
 
 Manders. You have been overmastered all your life by a disastrous
 spirit of willfulness. All your impulses have led you towards what is
 undisciplined and lawless. You have never been willing to submit to any
 restraint.  Anything in life that has seemed irksome to you, you have
 thrown aside recklessly and unscrupulously, as if it were a burden that
 you were free to rid yourself of if you would. It did not please you to
 be a wife any longer, and so you left your husband. Your duties as a
 mother were irksome to you, so you sent your child away among strangers.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, that is true; I did that.
 
 Menders. And that is why you have become a stranger to him.
 
 Mrs. Alving. No, no, I am not that!
 
 Manders. You are; you must be. And what sort of a son is it that you
 have got back? Think over it seriously, Mrs. Alving. You erred
 grievously in your husband's case--you acknowledge as much, by erecting
 this memorial to him. Now you are bound to acknowledge how much you
 have erred in your son's case; possibly there may still be time to
 reclaim him from the path of wickedness. Turn over a new leaf, and set
 yourself to reform what there may still be that is capable of
 reformation in him. Because (with uplifted forefinger) in very truth,
 Mrs. Alving, you are a guilty mother!--That is what I have thought it
 my duty to say to you.
 
 (A short silence.)
 
 Mrs. Alving (speaking slowly and with self-control). You have had your
 say, Mr. Manders, and tomorrow you will be making a public speech in
 memory of my husband. I shall not speak tomorrow. But now I wish to
 speak to you for a little, just as you have been speaking to me.
 
 Manders. By all means; no doubt you wish to bring forward some excuses
 for your behaviour.
 
 Mrs. Alving. No. I only want to tell you something--
 
 Manders. Well?
 
 Mrs. Alving. In all that you said just now about me and my husband, and
 about our life together after you had, as you put it, led me back into
 the path of duty--there was nothing that you knew at first hand. From
 that moment you never again set foot in our house--you, who had been
 our daily companion before that.
 
 Manders. Remember that you and your husband moved out of town
 immediately afterwards.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, and you never once came out here to see us in my
 husband's lifetime. It was only the business in connection with the
 Orphanage that obliged you to come and see me.
 
 Manders (in a low and uncertain voice). Helen--if that is a reproach, I
 can only beg you to consider--
 
 Mrs. Alving. --the respect you owed by your calling?--yes. All the more
 as I was a wife who had tried to run away from her husband. One can
 never be too careful to have nothing to do with such reckless women.
 
 Manders. My dear--Mrs. Alving, you are exaggerating dreadfully.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, yes,--very well. What I mean is this, that when you
 condemn my conduct as a wife you have nothing more to go upon than
 ordinary public opinion.
 
 Manders. I admit it. What then?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Well now, Mr. Manders, now I am going to tell you the
 truth. I had sworn to myself that you should know it one day--you, and
 you only!
 
 Manders. And what may the truth be?
 
 Mrs. Alving. The truth is this, that my husband died just as great a
 profligate as he had been all his life.
 
 Manders (feeling for a chair). What are you saying?
 
 Mrs. Alving. After nineteen years of married life, just as
 profligate--in his desires at all events--as he was before you married
 us.
 
 Manders. And can you talk of his youthful indiscretions--his
 irregularities--his excesses, if you like--as a profligate life!
 
 Mrs. Alving. That was what the doctor who attended him called it.
 
 Manders. I don't understand what you mean.
 
 Mrs. Alving. It is not necessary that you should.
 
 Manders. It makes my brain reel. To think that your marriage--all the
 years of wedded life you spent with your husband--were nothing but a
 hidden abyss of misery.
 
 Mrs. Alving. That and nothing else. Now you know.
 
 Manders. This--this bewilders me. I can't understand it! I can't grasp
 it! How in the world was it possible? How could such a state of things
 remain concealed?
 
 Mrs. Alving. That was just what I had to fight for incessantly, day
 after day. When Oswald was born, I thought I saw a slight improvement.
 But it didn't last long. And after that I had to fight doubly
 hard--fight a desperate fight so that no one should know what sort of a
 man my child's father was. You know quite well what an attractive
 manner he had; it seemed as if people could believe nothing but good of
 him. He was one of those men whose mode of life seems to have no effect
 upon their reputations. But at last, Mr. Manders--you must hear this
 too--at last something happened more abominable than everything else.
 
 Manders. More abominable than what you have told me!
 
 Mrs. Alving. I had borne with it all, though I knew only too well what
 he indulged in in secret, when he was out of the house. But when it
 came to the point of the scandal coming within our four walls--
 
 Manders. Can you mean it! Here?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, here, in our own home. It was in there (pointing to
 the nearer door on the right) in the dining-room that I got the first
 hint of it. I had something to do in there and the door was standing
 ajar. I heard our maid come up from the garden with water for the
 flowers in the conservatory.
 
 Manders. Well--?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Shortly afterwards I heard my husband come in too. I heard
 him say something to her in a low voice. And then I heard--(with a
 short laugh)--oh, it rings in my ears still, with its mixture of what
 was heartbreaking and what was so ridiculous--I heard my own servant
 whisper: "Let me go, Mr. Alving! Let me be!"
 
 Manders. What unseemly levity on his part! But surely nothing more than
 levity, Mrs. Alving, believe me.
 
 Mrs. Alving. I soon knew what to believe. My husband had his will of
 the girl--and that intimacy had consequences, Mr. Manders.
 
 Manders (as if turned to stone). And all that in this house! In this
 house!
 
 Mrs. Alving. I have suffered a good deal in this house. To keep him at
 home in the evening--and at night--I have had to play the part of boon
 companion in his secret drinking-bouts in his room up there. I have had
 to sit there alone with him, have had to hobnob and drink with him,
 have had to listen to his ribald senseless talk, have had to fight with
 brute force to get him to bed--
 
 Manders (trembling). And you were able to endure all this!
 
 Mrs. Alving. I had my little boy, and endured it for his sake. But when
 the crowning insult came--when my own servant--then I made up my mind
 that there should be an end of it. I took the upper hand in the house,
 absolutely--both with him and all the others. I had a weapon to use
 against him, you see; he didn't dare to speak. It was then that Oswald
 was sent away. He was about seven then, and was beginning to notice
 things and ask questions as children will. I could endure all that, my
 friend. It seemed to me that the child would be poisoned if he breathed
 the air of this polluted house. That was why I sent him away. And now
 you understand, too, why he never set foot here as long as his father
 was alive. No one knows what it meant to me.
 
 Manders. You have indeed had a pitiable experience.
 
 Mrs. Alving. I could never have gone through with it, if I had not had
 my work. Indeed, I can boast that I have worked. All the increase in
 the value of the property, all the improvements, all the useful
 arrangements that my husband got the honour and glory of--do you
 suppose that he troubled himself about any of them? He, who used to lie
 the whole day on the sofa reading old official lists! No, you may as
 well know that too. It was I that kept him up to the mark when he had
 his lucid intervals; it was I that had to bear the whole burden of it
 when he began his excesses again or took to whining about his miserable
 condition.
 
 Manders. And this is the man you are building a memorial to!
 
 Mrs. Alving. There you see the power of an uneasy conscience.
 
 Manders. An uneasy conscience? What do you mean?
 
 Mrs. Alving. I had always before me the fear that it was impossible
 that the truth should not come out and be believed. That is why the
 Orphanage is to exist, to silence all rumours and clear away all doubt.
 
 Manders. You certainly have not fallen short of the mark in that, Mrs.
 Alving.
 
 Mrs. Alving. I had another very good reason. I did not wish Oswald, my
 own son, to inherit a penny that belonged to his father.
 
 Manders. Then it is with Mr. Alving's property.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes. The sums of money that, year after year, I have given
 towards this Orphanage, make up the amount of property--I have reckoned
 it carefully--which in the old days made Lieutenant Alving a catch.
 
 Manders. I understand.
 
 Mrs. Alving. That was my purchase money. I don't wish it to pass into
 Oswald's hands. My son shall have everything from me, I am determined.
 
 (OSWALD comes in by the farther door on the right. He has left his hat
 and coat outside.)
 
 Mrs. Alving. Back again, my own dear boy?
 
 Oswald. Yes, what can one do outside in this everlasting rain? I hear
 dinner is nearly ready. That's good!
 
 (REGINA comes in front the dining-room, carrying a parcel.)
 
 Regina. This parcel has come for you, ma'am. (Gives it to her.)
 
 Mrs. Alving (glancing at MANDERS). The ode to be sung tomorrow, I
 expect.
 
 Manders. Hm--!
 
 Regina. And dinner is ready.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Good. We will come in a moment. I will just--(begins to
 open the parcel).
 
 Regina (to OSWALD). Will you drink white or red wine, sir?
 
 Oswald. Both, Miss Engstrand.
 
 Regina. Bien--very good, Mr. Alving. (Goes into the dining-room.)
 
 Oswald. I may as well help you to uncork it--. (Follows her into the
 dining-room, leaving the door ajar after him.)
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, I thought so. Here is the ode, Mr Manders.
 
 Manders (clasping his hands). How shall I ever have the courage
 tomorrow to speak the address that--
 
 Mrs. Alving. Oh, you will get through it.
 
 Manders (in a low voice, fearing to be heard in the dining room). Yes,
 we must raise no suspicions.
 
 Mrs. Alving (quietly but firmly). No; and then this long dreadful
 comedy will be at an end. After tomorrow, I shall feel as if my dead
 husband had never lived in this house. There will be no one else here
 then but my boy and his mother.
 
 (From the dining-room is heard the noise of a chair falling; then
 REGINA'S voice is heard in a loud whisper: Oswald! Are you mad? Let me
 go!)
 
 Mrs. Alving (starting in horror). Oh--!
 
 (She stares wildly at the half-open door. OSWALD is heard coughing and
 humming, then the sound of a bottle being uncorked.)
 
 Manders (in an agitated manner). What's the matter? What is it, Mrs.
 Alving?
 
 Mrs. Alving (hoarsely). Ghosts. The couple in the conservatory--over
 again.
 
 Manders. What are you saying! Regina--? Is SHE--!
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, Come. Not a word--!
 
 (Grips MANDERS by the arm and walks unsteadily with him into the
 dining-room.)
 
 
 
 
 ACT II
 
 
 (The same scene. The landscape is still obscured by Mist. MANDERS and
 MRS. ALVING come in from the dining-room.)
 
 Mrs. Alving (calls into the dining-room from the doorway). Aren't you
 coming in here, Oswald?
 
 Oswald. No, thanks; I think I will go out for a bit.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, do; the weather is clearing a little. (She shuts the
 dining-room door, then goes to the hall door and calls.) Regina!
 
 Regina (from without). Yes, ma'am?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Go down into the laundry and help with the garlands.
 
 Regina. Yes, ma'am.
 
 (MRS. ALVING satisfies herself that she has gone, then shuts the door.)
 
 Manders. I suppose he can't hear us?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Not when the door is shut. Besides, he is going out.
 
 Manders. I am still quite bewildered. I don't know how I managed to
 swallow a mouthful of your excellent dinner.
 
 Mrs. Alving (walking up and down, and trying to control her agitation).
 Nor I. But, what are we to do?
 
 Manders. Yes, what are we to do? Upon my word I don't know; I am so
 completely unaccustomed to things of this kind.
 
 Mrs. Alving. I am convinced that nothing serious has happened yet.
 
 Manders. Heaven forbid! But it is most unseemly behaviour, for all that.
 
 Mrs. Alving. It is nothing more than a foolish jest of Oswald's, you
 may be sure.
 
 Manders. Well, of course, as I said, I am quite inexperienced in such
 matters; but it certainly seems to me--
 
 Mrs. Alving. Out of the house she shall go--and at once. That part of
 it is as clear as daylight--
 
 Manders. Yes, that is quite clear.
 
 Mrs. Alving. But where is she to go? We should not be justified in--
 
 Manders. Where to? Home to her father, of course.
 
 Mrs. Alving. To whom, did you say?
 
 Manders. To her--. No, of course Engstrand isn't--. But, great heavens,
 Mrs. Alving, how is such a thing possible? You surely may have been
 mistaken, in spite of everything.
 
 Mrs. Alving. There was no chance of mistake, more's the pity. Joanna
 was obliged to confess it to me--and my husband couldn't deny it. So
 there was nothing else to do but to hush it up.
 
 Manders. No, that was the only thing to do.
 
 Mrs. Alving. The girl was sent away at once, and was given a tolerably
 liberal sum to hold her tongue. She looked after the rest herself when
 she got to town. She renewed an old acquaintance with the carpenter
 Engstrand; gave him a hint, I suppose, of how much money she had got,
 and told him some fairy tale about a foreigner who had been here in his
 yacht in the summer. So she and Engstrand were married in a great
 hurry. Why, you married them yourself!
 
 Manders. I can't understand it--, I remember clearly Engstrand's coming
 to arrange about the marriage. He was full of contrition, and accused
 himself bitterly for the light conduct he and his fiancee had been
 guilty of.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Of course he had to take the blame on himself.
 
 Manders. But the deceitfulness of it! And with me, too! I positively
 would not have believed it of Jacob Engstrand. I shall most certainly
 give him a serious talking to. And the immorality of such a marriage!
 Simply for the sake of the money--! What sum was it that the girl had?
 
 Mrs. Alving. It was seventy pounds.
 
 Manders. Just think of it--for a paltry seventy pounds to let yourself
 be bound in marriage to a fallen woman!
 
 Mrs. Alving. What about myself, then?--I let myself be bound in
 marriage to a fallen man.
 
 Manders. Heaven forgive you! What are you saying? A fallen man?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Do you suppose my husband was any purer, when I went with
 him to the altar, than Joanna was when Engstrand agreed to marry her?
 
 Manders. The two cases are as different as day from night.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Not so very different, after all. It is true there was a
 great difference in the price paid, between a paltry seventy pounds and
 a whole fortune.
 
 Manders. How can you compare such totally different things! I presume
 you consulted your own heart--and your relations.
 
 Mrs. Alving (looking away from him). I thought you understood where
 what you call my heart had strayed to at that time.
 
 Manders (in a constrained voice). If I had understood anything of the
 kind, I would not have been a daily guest in your husband's house.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Well, at any rate this much is certain--I didn't consult
 myself in the matter at all.
 
 Manders. Still you consulted those nearest to you, as was only
 right--your mother, your two aunts.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, that is true. The three of them settled the whole
 matter for me. It seems incredible to me now, how clearly they made out
 that it would be sheer folly to reject such an offer. If my mother
 could only see what all that fine prospect has led to!
 
 Manders. No one can be responsible for the result of it. Anyway there
 is this to be said, that the match was made in complete conformity with
 law and order.
 
 Mrs. Alving (going to the window). Oh, law and order! I often think it
 is that that is at the bottom of all the misery in the world.
 
 Manders. Mrs. Alving, it is very wicked of you to say that.
 
 Mrs. Alving. That may be so; but I don't attach importance to those
 obligations and considerations any longer. I cannot! I must struggle
 for my freedom.
 
 Manders. What do you mean?
 
 Mrs. Alving (taping on the window panes). I ought never to have
 concealed what sort of a life my husband led. But I had not the courage
 to do otherwise then--for my own sake, either. I was too much of a
 coward.
 
 Manders. A coward?
 
 Mrs. Alving. If others had known anything of what happened, they would
 have said: "Poor man, it is natural enough that he should go astray,
 when he has a wife that has run away from him."
 
 Manders. They would have had a certain amount of justification for
 saying so.
 
 Mrs. Alving (looking fixedly at him). If I had been the woman I ought,
 I would have taken Oswald into my confidence and said to him: "Listen,
 my son, your father was a dissolute man"--
 
 Manders. Miserable woman.
 
 Mrs. Alving. --and I would have told him all I have told you, from
 beginning to end.
 
 Manders. I am almost shocked at you, Mrs. Alving.
 
 Mrs. Alving. I know. I know quite well! I am shocked at myself when I
 think of it. (Comes away from the window.) I am coward enough for that.
 
 Manders. Can you call it cowardice that you simply did your duty? Have
 you forgotten that a child should love and honour his father and mother?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Don't let us talk in such general terms. Suppose we say:
 "Ought Oswald to love and honour Mr. Alving?"
 
 Manders. You are a mother--isn't there a voice in your heart that
 forbids you to shatter your son's ideals?
 
 Mrs. Alving. And what about the truth?
 
 Manders. What about his ideals?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Oh--ideals, ideals! If only I were not such a coward as I
 am!
 
 Manders. Do not spurn ideals, Mrs. Alving--they have a way of avenging
 themselves cruelly. Take Oswald's own case, now. He hasn't many ideals,
 more's the pity. But this much I have seen, that his father is
 something of an ideal to him.
 
 Mrs. Alving. You are right there.
 
 Manders. And his conception of his father is what you inspired and
 encouraged by your letters.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, I was swayed by duty and consideration for others;
 that was why I lied to my son, year in and year out. Oh, what a
 coward--what a coward I have been!
 
 Manders. You have built up a happy illusion in your son's mind, Mrs.
 Alving--and that is a thing you certainly ought not to undervalue.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Ah, who knows if that is such a desirable thing after
 all!--But anyway I don't intend to put up with any goings on with
 Regina. I am not going to let him get the poor girl into trouble.
 
 Manders. Good heavens, no--that would be a frightful thing!
 
 Mrs. Alving. If only I knew whether he meant it seriously, and whether
 it would mean happiness for him.
 
 Manders. In what way? I don't understand.
 
 Mrs. Alving. But that is impossible; Regina is not equal to it,
 unfortunately.
 
 Manders, I don't understand: What do you mean?
 
 Mrs. Alving. If I were not such a miserable coward, I would say to him:
 "Marry her, or make any arrangement you like with her--only let there
 be no deceit in the matter."
 
 Manders. Heaven forgive you! Are you actually suggesting anything so
 abominable, so unheard of, as a marriage between them!
 
 Mrs. Alving. Unheard of, do you call it? Tell me honestly, Mr. Manders,
 don't you suppose there are plenty of married couples out here in the
 country that are just as nearly related as they are?
 
 Manders. I am sure I don't understand you.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Indeed you do.
 
 Manders. I suppose you are thinking of cases where possibly--. It is
 only too true, unfortunately, that family life is not always as
 stainless as it should be. But as for the sort of thing you hint
 at--well, it's impossible to tell, at all events, with any certainty.
 Here on the other hand--for you, a mother, to be willing to allow your--
 
 Mrs. Alving. But I am not willing to allow it; I would not allow it for
 anything in the world; that is just what I was saying.
 
 Manders. No, because you are a coward, as you put it. But, supposing
 you were not a coward--! Great heavens--such a revolting union!
 
 Mrs. Alving. Well, for the matter of that, we are all descended from a
 union of that description, so we are told. And who was it that was
 responsible for this state of things, Mr. Manders?
 
 Manders. I can't discuss such questions with you, Mrs. Alving; you are
 by no means in the right frame of mind for that. But for you to dare to
 say that it is cowardly of you--!
 
 Mrs. Alving. I will tell you what I mean by that. I am frightened and
 timid, because I am obsessed by the presence of ghosts that I never can
 get rid of.
 
 Manders. The presence of what?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Ghosts. When I heard Regina and Oswald in there, it was
 just like seeing ghosts before my eyes. I am half inclined to think we
 are all ghosts, Mr. Manders. It is not only what we have inherited from
 our fathers and mothers that exists again in us, but all sorts of old
 dead ideas and all kinds of old dead beliefs and things of that kind.
 They are not actually alive in us; but there they are dormant, all the
 same, and we can never be rid of them. Whenever I take up a newspaper
 and read it, I fancy I see ghosts creeping between the lines. There
 must be ghosts all over the world. They must be as countless as the
 grains of the sands, it seems to me. And we are so miserably afraid of
 the light, all of us.
 
 Manders. Ah!--there we have the outcome of your reading. Fine fruit it
 has borne--this abominable, subversive, free-thinking literature!
 
 Mrs. Alving. You are wrong there, my friend. You are the one who made
 me begin to think; and I owe you my best thanks for it.
 
 Menders. I!
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, by forcing me to submit to what you called my duty
 and my obligations; by praising as right and lust what my whole soul
 revolted against, as it would against something abominable. That was
 what led me to examine your teachings critically. I only wanted to
 unravel one point in them; but as soon as I had got that unravelled,
 the whole fabric came to pieces. And then I realised that it was only
 machine-made.
 
 Manders (softly, and with emotion). Is that all I accomplished by the
 hardest struggle of my life?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Call it rather the most ignominious defeat of your life.
 
 Manders. It was the greatest victory of my life, Helen; victory over
 myself.
 
 Mrs. Alving. It was a wrong done to both of us.
 
 Manders. A wrong?--wrong for me to entreat you as a wife to go back to
 your lawful husband, when you came to me half distracted and crying:
 "Here I am, take me!" Was that a wrong?
 
 Mrs. Alving. I think it was.
 
 Menders. We two do not understand one another.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Not now, at all events.
 
 Manders. Never--even in my most secret thoughts--have I for a moment
 regarded you as anything but the wife of another.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Do you believe what you say?
 
 Manders. Helen--!
 
 Mrs. Alving. One so easily forgets one's own feelings. Manders. Not I.
 I am the same as I always was.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, yes--don't let us talk any more about the old days.
 You are buried up to your eyes now in committees and all sorts of
 business; and I am here, fighting with ghosts both without and within
 me.
 
 Manders. I can at all events help you to get the better of those
 without you. After all that I have been horrified to hear you from
 today, I cannot conscientiously allow a young defenceless girl to
 remain in your house.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Don't you think it would be best if we could get her
 settled?--by some suitable marriage, I mean.
 
 Manders. Undoubtedly. I think, in any case, it would have been
 desirable for her. Regina is at an age now that--well, I don't know
 much about these things, but--
 
 Mrs. Alving. Regina developed very early.
 
 Manders. Yes, didn't she. I fancy I remember thinking she was
 remarkably well developed, bodily, at the time I prepared her for
 Confirmation. But, for the time being, she must in any case go home.
 Under her father's care--no, but of course Engstrand is not. To think
 that he, of all men, could so conceal the truth from me! (A knock is
 heard at the hall door.)
 
 Mrs. Alving. Who can that be? Come in!
 
 (ENGSTRAND, dressed in his Sunday clothes, appears in the doorway.)
 
 Engstrand. I humbly beg pardon, but--
 
 Manders. Aha! Hm!
 
 Mrs. Alving. Oh, it's you, Engstrand!
 
 Engstrand. There were none of the maids about, so I took the great
 liberty of knocking.
 
 Mrs. Alving. That's all right. Come in. Do you want to speak to me?
 
 Engstrand (coming in). No, thank you very much, ma'am. It was Mr.
 Menders I wanted to speak to for a moment.
 
 Manders (walking up and down). Hm!--do you. You want to speak to me, do
 you?
 
 Engstrand. Yes, sir, I wanted so very much to--
 
 Manders (stopping in front of him). Well, may I ask what it is you want?
 
 Engstrand. It's this way, Mr. Manders. We are being paid off now. And
 many thanks to you, Mrs. Alving. And now the work is quite finished, I
 thought it would be so nice and suitable if all of us, who have worked
 so honestly together all this time, were to finish up with a few
 prayers this evening.
 
 Manders. Prayers? Up at the Orphanage?
 
 Engstrand. Yes, sir, but if it isn't agreeable to you, then--
 
 Manders. Oh, certainly--but--hm!--
 
 Engstrand. I have made a practice of saying a few prayers there myself
 each evening.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Have you?
 
 Engstrand. Yes, ma'am, now--and then--just as a little edification, so
 to speak. But I am only a poor common man, and haven't rightly the
 gift, alas--and so I thought that as Mr. Manders happened to be here,
 perhaps--
 
 Manders. Look here, Engstrand! First of all I must ask you a question.
 Are you in a proper frame of mind for such a thing? Is your conscience
 free and untroubled?
 
 Engstrand. Heaven have mercy on me a sinner! My conscience isn't worth
 our speaking about, Mr. Manders.
 
 Manders. But it is just what we must speak about. What do you say to my
 question?
 
 Engstrand. My conscience? Well--it's uneasy sometimes, of course.
 
 Manders. Ah, you admit that at all events. Now will you tell me,
 without any concealment--what is your relationship to Regina?
 
 Mrs. Alving (hastily). Mr. Manders!
 
 Manders (calming her).--Leave it to me!
 
 Engstrand. With Regina? Good Lord, how you frightened me! (Looks at MRS
 ALVING.) There is nothing wrong with Regina, is there?
 
 Manders. Let us hope not. What I want to know is, what is your
 relationship to her? You pass as her father, don't you?
 
 Engstrand (unsteadily): Well--hm!--you know, sir, what happened between
 me and my poor Joanna.
 
 Manders. No more distortion of the truth! Your late wife made a full
 confession to Mrs. Alving, before she left her service...
 
 Engstrand. What!--do you mean to say--? Did she do that after all?
 
 Manders. You see it has all come out, Engstrand.
 
 Engstrand. Do you mean to say that she, who gave me her promise and
 solemn oath--
 
 Manders. Did she take an oath?
 
 Engstrand. Well, no--she only gave me her word, but as seriously as a
 woman could.
 
 Manders. And all these years you have been hiding the truth from
 me--from me, who have had such complete and absolute faith in you.
 
 Engstrand. I am sorry to say I have, sir.
 
 Manders. Did I deserve that from you, Engstrand? Haven't I been always
 ready to help you in word and deed as far as lay in my power? Answer
 me! Is it not so?
 
 Engstrand. Indeed there's many a time I should have been very badly off
 without you, sir.
 
 Manders. And this is the way you repay me--by causing me to make false
 entries in the church registers, and afterwards keeping back from me
 for years the information which you owed it both to me and to your
 sense of the truth to divulge. Your conduct has been absolutely
 inexcusable, Engstrand, and from today everything is at an end between
 us.
 
 Engstrand (with a sigh). Yes, I can see that's what it means.
 
 Manders. Yes, because how can you possibly justify what you did?
 
 Engstrand. Was the poor girl to go and increase her load of shame by
 talking about it? Just suppose, sir, for a moment that your reverence
 was in the same predicament as my poor Joanna.
 
 Manders. I!
 
 Engstrand. Good Lord, sir, I don't mean the same predicament. I mean,
 suppose there were something your reverence was ashamed of in the eyes
 of the world, so to speak. We men ought not judge a poor woman too
 hardly, Mr. Manders.
 
 Manders. But I am not doing so at all. It is you I am blaming.
 
 Engstrand. Will your reverence grant me leave to ask you a small
 question?
 
 Manders. Ask away.
 
 Engstrand. Shouldn't you say it was right for a man to raise up the
 fallen?
 
 Manders. Of course it is.
 
 Engstrand. And isn't a man bound to keep his word of honour?
 
 Manders. Certainly he is; but--
 
 Engstrand. At the time when Joanna had her misfortune with this
 Englishman--or maybe he was an American or a Russian, as they call
 'em--well, sir, then she came to town. Poor thing, she had refused me
 once or twice before; she only had eyes for good-looking men in those
 days, and I had this crooked leg then. Your reverence will remember how
 I had ventured up into a dancing-saloon where seafaring men were
 revelling in drunkenness and intoxication, as they say. And when I
 tried to exhort them to turn from their evil ways--
 
 Mrs. Alving (coughs from the window). Ahem!
 
 Manders. I know, Engstrand, I know--the rough brutes threw you
 downstairs. You have told me about that incident before. The affliction
 to your leg is a credit to you.
 
 Engstrand. I don't want to claim credit for it, your reverence. But
 what I wanted to tell you was that she came then and confided in me
 with tears and gnashing of teeth. I can tell you, sir, it went to my
 heart to hear her.
 
 Manders. Did it, indeed, Engstrand? Well, what then?
 
 Engstrand. Well, then I said to her: "The American is roaming about on
 the high seas, he is. And you, Joanna," I said, "you have committed a
 sin and are a fallen woman. But here stands Jacob Engstrand," I said,
 "on two strong legs"--of course that was only speaking in a kind of
 metaphor, as it were, your reverence.
 
 Manders. I quite understand. Go on.
 
 Engstrand. Well, sir, that was how I rescued her and made her my lawful
 wife, so that no one should know how recklessly she had carried on with
 the stranger.
 
 Manders. That was all very kindly done. The only thing I cannot justify
 was your bringing yourself to accept the money.
 
 Engstrand. Money? I? Not a farthing.
 
 Manders (to MRS. ALVING, in a questioning tare). But--
 
 Engstrand. Ah, yes!--wait a bit; I remember now. Joanna did have a
 trifle of money, you are quite right. But I didn't want to know
 anything about that. "Fie," I said, "on the mammon of unrighteousness,
 it's the price of your sin; as for this tainted gold"--or notes, or
 whatever it was--"we will throw it back in the American's face," I
 said. But he had gone away and disappeared on the stormy seas, your
 reverence.
 
 Manders. Was that how it was, my good fellow?
 
 Engstrand. It was, sir. So then Joanna and I decided that the money
 should go towards the child's bringing-up, and that's what became of
 it; and I can give a faithful account of every single penny of it.
 
 Manders. This alters the complexion of the affair very considerably.
 
 Engstrand. That's how it was, your reverence. And I make bold to say
 that I have been a good father to Regina--as far as was in my
 power--for I am a poor erring mortal, alas!
 
 Manders. There, there, my dear Engstrand.
 
 Engstrand. Yes, I do make bold to say that I brought up the child, and
 made my poor Joanna a loving and careful husband, as the Bible says we
 ought. But it never occurred to me to go to your reverence and claim
 credit for it or boast about it because I had done one good deed in
 this world. No; when Jacob Engstrand does a thing like that, he holds
 his tongue about it. Unfortunately it doesn't often happen, I know that
 only too well. And whenever I do come to see your reverence, I never
 seem to have anything but trouble and wickedness to talk about.
 Because, as I said just now--and I say it again--conscience can be very
 hard on us sometimes.
 
 Manders. Give me your hand, Jacob Engstrand,
 
 Engstrand. Oh, sir, I don't like--
 
 Manders. No nonsense, (Grasps his hand.) That's it!
 
 Engstrand. And may I make bold humbly to beg your reverence's pardon--
 
 Manders. You? On the contrary it is for me to beg your pardon--
 
 Engstrand. Oh no, sir.
 
 Manders. Yes, certainly it is, and I do it with my whole heart. Forgive
 me for having so much misjudged you. And I assure you that if I can do
 anything for you to prove my sincere regret and my goodwill towards
 you--
 
 Engstrand. Do you mean it, sir?
 
 Manders. It would give me the greatest pleasure.
 
 Engstrand. As a matter of fact, sir, you could do it now. I am thinking
 of using the honest money I have put away out of my wages up here, in
 establishing a sort of Sailors' Home in the town.
 
 Mrs. Alving. You?
 
 Engstrand. Yes, to be a sort of Refuge, as it were, There are such
 manifold temptations lying in wait for sailor men when they are roaming
 about on shore. But my idea is that in this house of mine they should
 have a sort of parental care looking after them.
 
 Menders. What do you say to that, Mrs. Alving!
 
 Engstrand. I haven't much to begin such a work with, I know; but Heaven
 might prosper it, and if I found any helping hand stretched out to me,
 then--
 
 Manders. Quite so; we will talk over the matter further. Your project
 attracts me enormously. But in the meantime go back to the Orphanage
 and put everything tidy and light the lights, so that the occasion may
 seem a little solemn. And then we will spend a little edifying time
 together, my dear Engstrand, for now I am sure you are in a suitable
 frame of mind.
 
 Engstrand. I believe I am, sir, truly. Goodbye, then, Mrs. Alving, and
 thank you for all your kindness; and take good care of Regina for me.
 (Wipes a tear from his eye.) Poor Joanna's child--it is an
 extraordinary thing, but she seems to have grown into my life and to
 hold me by the heartstrings. That's how I feel about it, truly. (Bows,
 and goes out.)
 
 Manders. Now then, what do you think of him, Mrs Alving! That was quite
 another explanation that he gave us.
 
 Mrs. Alving. It was, indeed.
 
 Manders. There, you see how exceedingly careful we ought to be in
 condemning our fellow-men. But at the same time it gives one genuine
 pleasure to find that one was mistaken. Don't you think so?
 
 Mrs. Alving. What I think is that you are, and always will remain, a
 big baby, Mr. Manders.
 
 Menders. I?
 
 Mrs. Alving (laying her hands on his shoulders). And I think that I
 should like very much to give you a good hug.
 
 Manders (drawing beck hastily). No, no, good gracious! What an idea!
 
 Mrs. Alving (with a smile). Oh, you needn't be afraid of me.
 
 Manders (standing by the table). You choose such an extravagant way of
 expressing yourself sometimes. Now I must get these papers together and
 put them in my bag. (Does so.) That's it. And now goodbye, for the
 present. Keep your eyes open when Oswald comes back. I will come back
 and see you again presently.
 
 (He takes his hat and goes out by the hall door. MRS. ALVING sighs,
 glances out of the window, puts one or two things tidy in the room and
 turns to go into the dining-room. She stops in the doorway with a
 stifled cry.)
 
 Mrs. Alving. Oswald, are you still sitting at table!
 
 Oswald (from the dining-room). I am only finishing my cigar.
 
 Mrs. Alving. I thought you had gone out for a little turn.
 
 Oswald (from within the room). In weather like this? (A glass is heard
 clinking. MRS. ALVING leaves the door open and sits down with her
 knitting on the couch by the window.) Wasn't that Mr. Manders that went
 out just now?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, he has gone over to the Orphanage.
 
 Oswald. Oh. (The clink of a bottle on a glass is heard again.)
 
 Mrs. Alving (with an uneasy expression.) Oswald, dear, you should be
 careful with that liqueur. It is strong.
 
 Oswald. It's a good protective against the damp.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Wouldn't you rather come in here?
 
 Oswald. You know you don't like smoking in there.
 
 Mrs. Alving. You may smoke a cigar in here, certainly.
 
 Oswald. All right; I will come in, then. Just one drop more. There!
 (Comes in, smoking a cigar, and shuts the door after him. A short
 silence.) Where has the parson gone?
 
 Mrs. Alving. I told you he had gone over to the Orphanage.
 
 Oswald. Oh, so you did.
 
 Mrs. Alving. You shouldn't sit so long at table, Oswald,
 
 Oswald (holding his cigar behind his back). But it's so nice and cosy,
 mother dear. (Caresses her with one hand.) Think what it means to
 me--to have come home; to sit at my mother's own table, in my mother's
 own room, and to enjoy the charming meals she gives me.
 
 Mrs. Alving. My dear, dear boy!
 
 Oswald (a little impatiently, as he walks tip and down smoking.) And
 what else is there for me to do here? I have no occupation--
 
 Mrs. Alving. No occupation?
 
 Oswald. Not in this ghastly weather, when there isn't a blink of
 sunshine all day long. (Walks up and down the floor.) Not to be able to
 work, it's--!
 
 Mrs. Alving. I don't believe you were wise to come home.
 
 Oswald. Yes, mother; I had to.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Because I would ten times rather give up the happiness of
 having you with me, sooner than that you should--
 
 Oswald (standing still by the table). Tell me, mother--is it really
 such a great happiness for you to have me at home?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Can you ask?
 
 Oswald (crumpling up a newspaper). I should have thought it would have
 been pretty much the same to you whether I were here or away.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Have you the heart to say that to your mother, Oswald?
 
 Oswald. But you have been quite happy living without me so far.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, I have lived without you--that is true.
 
 (A silence. The dusk falls by degrees. OSWALD walks restlessly up and
 down. He has laid aside his cigar.) Oswald (stopping beside MRS.
 ALVING). Mother, may I sit on the couch beside you?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Of course, my dear boy.
 
 Oswald (sitting down). Now I must tell you something mother.
 
 Mrs. Alving (anxiously). What?
 
 Oswald (staring in front of him). I can't bear it any longer.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Bear what? What do you mean?
 
 Oswald (as before). I couldn't bring myself to write to you about it;
 and since I have been at home--
 
 Mrs. Alving (catching him by the arm). Oswald, what is it?
 
 Oswald. Both yesterday and today I have tried to push my thoughts away
 from me--to free myself from them. But I can't.
 
 Mrs. Alving (getting up). You must speak plainly, Oswald!
 
 Oswald (drawing her down to her seat again). Sit still, and I will try
 and tell you. I have made a great deal of the fatigue I felt after my
 journey--
 
 Mrs. Alving. Well, what of that?
 
 Oswald. But that isn't what is the matter. It is no ordinary fatigue--
 
 Mrs. Alving (trying to get up). You are not ill, Oswald!
 
 Oswald (pulling her down again). Sit still, mother. Do take it quietly.
 I am not exactly ill--not ill in the usual sense. (Takes his head in
 his hands.) Mother, it's my mind that has broken down--gone to
 pieces--I shall never be able to work anymore! (Buries his face in his
 hands and throws himself at her knees in an outburst of sobs.)
 
 Mrs. Alving (pale and trembling). Oswald! Look at me! No, no, it isn't
 true!
 
 Oswald (looking up with a distracted expression). Never to be able to
 work anymore! Never--never! A living death! Mother, can you imagine
 anything so horrible!
 
 Mrs. Alving. My poor unhappy boy? How has this terrible thing happened?
 
 Oswald (sitting up again). That is just what I cannot possibly
 understand. I have never lived recklessly, in any sense. You must
 believe that of me, mother, I have never done that.
 
 Mrs. Alving. I haven't a doubt of it, Oswald.
 
 Oswald. And yet this comes upon me all the same; this terrible disaster!
 
 Mrs. Alving. Oh, but it will all come right again, my dear precious
 boy. It is nothing but overwork. Believe me, that is so.
 
 Oswald (dully). I thought so too, at first; but it isn't so.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Tell me all about it.
 
 Oswald. Yes, I will.
 
 Mrs. Alving. When did you first feel anything?
 
 Oswald. It was just after I had been home last time and had got back to
 Paris. I began to feel the most violent pains in my head--mostly at the
 back, I think. It was as if a tight band of iron was pressing on me
 from my neck upwards.
 
 Mrs. Alving. And then?
 
 Oswald. At first I thought it was nothing but the headaches I always
 used to be so much troubled with while I was growing.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, yes.
 
 Oswald. But it wasn't; I soon saw that. I couldn't work any longer. I
 would try and start some big new picture; but it seemed as if all my
 faculties had forsaken me, as if all my strengths were paralysed. I
 couldn't manage to collect my thoughts; my head seemed to
 swim--everything went round and round. It was a horrible feeling! At
 last I sent for a doctor--and from him I learned the truth.
 
 Mrs. Alving. In what way, do you mean?
 
 Oswald. He was one of the best doctors there. He made me describe what
 I felt, and then he began to ask me a whole heap of questions which
 seemed to me to have nothing to do with the matter. I couldn't see what
 he was driving at--
 
 Mrs. Alving. Well?
 
 Oswald. At last he said: "You have had the canker of disease in you
 practically from your birth"--the actual word he used was "vermoulu"...
 
 Mrs. Alving (anxiously). What did he mean by that? Oswald. I couldn't
 understand, either--and I asked him for a clearer explanation, And then
 the old cynic said--(clenching his fist). Oh!
 
 Mrs. Alving. What did he say?
 
 Oswald. He said: "The sins of the fathers are visited on the children."
 
 Mrs. Alving (getting up slowly). The sins of the fathers--!
 
 Oswald. I nearly struck him in the face.
 
 Mrs. Alving (walking across the room). The sins of the fathers--!
 
 Oswald (smiling sadly). Yes, just imagine! Naturally I assured him that
 what he thought was impossible. But do you think he paid any heed to
 me? No, he persisted in his opinion; and it was only when I got out
 your letters and translated to him all the passages that referred to my
 father--
 
 Mrs. Alving. Well, and then?
 
 Oswald. Well, then of course he had to admit that he was on the wrong
 track; and then I learned the truth--the incomprehensible truth! I
 ought to have had nothing to do with the joyous happy life I had lived
 with my comrades. It had been too much for my strength. So it was my
 own fault!
 
 Mrs. Alving. No, no, Oswald! Don't believe that--
 
 Oswald. There was no other explanation of it possible, he said. That is
 the most horrible part of it. My whole life incurably ruined--just
 because of my own imprudence. All that I wanted to do in the world-=not
 to dare to think of it any more--not to be able to think of it! Oh! if
 only I could live my life over again--if only I could undo what I have
 done! (Throws himself on his face on the couch. MRS. ALVING wrings her
 hands, and walks up and down silently fighting with herself.)
 
 Oswald (looks up after a while, raising himself on his elbows). If only
 it had been something I had inherited--something I could not help. But,
 instead of that, to have disgracefully, stupidly, thoughtlessly thrown
 away one's happiness, one's health, everything in the world--one's
 future, one's life!
 
 Mrs. Alving. No, no, my darling boy; that is impossible! (Bending over
 him.) Things are not so desperate as you think.
 
 Oswald. Ah, you don't know--(Springs up.) And to think, mother, that I
 should bring all this sorrow upon you! Many a time I have almost wished
 and hoped that you really did not care so very much for me.
 
 Mrs. Alving. I, Oswald? My only son! All that I have in the world! The
 only thing I care about!
 
 Oswald (taking hold of her hands and kissing them). Yes, yes, I know
 that is so. When I am at home I know that is true. And that is one of
 the hardest parts of it to me. But now you know all about it; and now
 we won't talk anymore about it today. I can't stand thinking about it
 long at a time. (Walks across the room.) Let me have something to
 drink, mother!
 
 Mrs. Alving. To drink? What do you want?
 
 Oswald. Oh, anything you like. I suppose you have got some punch in the
 house.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, but my dear Oswald--!
 
 Oswald. Don't tell me I mustn't, mother. Do be nice! I must have
 something to drown these gnawing thoughts. (Goes into the
 conservatory.) And how--how gloomy it is here! (MRS. ALVING rings the
 bell.) And this incessant rain. It may go on week after week--a whole
 month. Never a ray of sunshine. I don't remember ever having seen the
 sunshine once when I have been at home.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Oswald--you are thinking of going away from me!
 
 Oswald. Hm!--(sighs deeply). I am not thinking about anything. I can't
 think about anything! (In a low voice.) I have to let that alone.
 
 Regina (coming from the dining-room). Did you ring, ma'am?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, let us have the lamp in.
 
 Regina. In a moment, ma'am; it is all ready lit. (Goes out.)
 
 Mrs. Alving (going up to OSWALD). Oswald, don't keep anything back from
 me.
 
 Oswald. I don't, mother. (Goes to the table.) It seems to me I have
 told you a good lot.
 
 (REGINA brings the lamp and puts it upon the table.)
 
 Mrs. Alving. Regina, you might bring us a small bottle of champagne.
 
 Regina. Yes, ma'am. (Goes out.)
 
 Oswald (taking hold of his mother's face). That's right; I knew my
 mother wouldn't let her son go thirsty.
 
 Mrs. Alving. My poor dear boy, how could I refuse you anything now?
 
 Oswald (eagerly). Is that true, mother? Do you mean it?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Mean what?
 
 Oswald. That you couldn't deny me anything?
 
 Mrs. Alving. My dear Oswald--
 
 Oswald. Hush!
 
 (REGINA brings in a tray with a small bottle of champagne and two
 glasses, which she puts on the table.)
 
 Regina. Shall I open the bottle?
 
 Oswald. No, thank you, I will do it. (REGINA goes out.)
 
 Mrs. Alving (sitting clown at the table). What did you mean, when you
 asked if I could refuse you nothing?
 
 Oswald (busy opening the bottle). Let us have a glass first--or two.
 
 (He draws the cork, fills one glass and is going to fill the other.)
 
 Mrs. Alving (holding her hand over the second glass) No, thanks--not
 for me.
 
 Oswald. Oh, well, for me then! (He empties his glass, fills it again
 and empties it; then sits down at the table.)
 
 Mrs. Alving (expectantly). Now, tell me.
 
 Oswald (without looking at her). Tell me this; I thought you and Mr.
 Manders seemed so strange--so quiet--at dinner.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Did you notice that?
 
 Oswald. Yes. Ahem! (After a short pause.) Tell me--what do you think of
 Regina?
 
 Mrs. Alving. What do I think of her?
 
 Oswald. Yes, isn't she splendid!
 
 Mrs. Alving. Dear Oswald, you don't know her as well as I do--
 
 Oswald. What of that?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Regina was too long at home, unfortunately. I ought to
 have taken her under my charge sooner.
 
 Oswald. Yes, but isn't she splendid to look at, mother? (Fills his
 glass,)
 
 Mrs. Alving. Regina has many serious faults--
 
 Oswald. Yes, but what of that? (Drinks.)
 
 Mrs. Alving. But I am fond of her, all the same; and I have made myself
 responsible for her. I wouldn't for the world she should come to any
 harm.
 
 Oswald (jumping up). Mother, Regina is my only hope of salvation!
 
 Mrs. Alving (getting up). What do you mean?
 
 Oswald. I can't go on bearing all this agony of mind alone.
 
 Mrs. Alving, Haven't you your mother to help you to bear it?
 
 Oswald. Yes, I thought so; that was why I came home to you. But it is
 no use; I see that it isn't. I cannot spend my life here.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Oswald!
 
 Oswald. I must live a different sort of life, mother; so I shall have
 to go away from you, I don't want you watching it.
 
 Mrs. Alving. My unhappy boy! But, Oswald, as long as you are ill like
 this--
 
 Oswald. If it was only a matter of feeling ill, I would stay with you,
 mother. You are the best friend I have in the world.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, I am that, Oswald, am I not?
 
 Oswald (walking restlessly about). But all this torment--the regret,
 the remorse--and the deadly fear. Oh--this horrible fear!
 
 Mrs. Alving (following him). Fear? Fear of what? What do you mean?
 
 Oswald. Oh, don't ask me any more about it. I don't know what it is. I
 can't put it into words. (MRS. ALVING crosses the room and rings the
 bell.) What do you want?
 
 Mrs. Alving. I want my boy to be happy, that's what I want. He mustn't
 brood over anything. (To REGINA, who has come to the door.) More
 champagne--a large bottle.
 
 Oswald. Mother!
 
 Mrs. Alving. Do you think we country people don't know how to live?
 
 Oswald. Isn't she splendid to look at? What a figure! And the picture
 of health!
 
 Mrs. Alving (sitting down at the table). Sit down, Oswald, and let us
 have a quiet talk.
 
 Oswald (sitting down). You don't know, mother, that I owe Regina a
 little reparation.
 
 Mrs. Alving. You!
 
 Oswald. Oh, it was only a little thoughtlessness--call it what you
 like. Something quite innocent, anyway. The last time I was home--
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes?
 
 Oswald. --she used often to ask me questions about Paris, and I told
 her one thing and another about the life there. And I remember saying
 one day: "Wouldn't you like to go there yourself?"
 
 Mrs. Alving. Well?
 
 Oswald. I saw her blush, and she said: "Yes, I should like to very
 much." "All right." I said, "I daresay it might be managed"--or
 something of that sort.
 
 Mrs. Alving. And then?
 
 Oswald. I naturally had forgotten all about it; but the day before
 yesterday I happened to ask her if she was glad I was to be so long at
 home--
 
 Mrs. Alving. Well?
 
 Oswald. --and she looked so queerly at me, and asked: "But what is to
 become of my trip to Paris?"
 
 Mrs. Alving. Her trip!
 
 Oswald. And then I got it out of her that she had taken the thing
 seriously, and had been thinking about me all the time, and had set
 herself to learn French--
 
 Mrs. Alving. So that was why--
 
 Oswald. Mother--when I saw this fine, splendid, handsome girl standing
 there in front of me--I had never paid any attention to her before
 then--but now, when she stood there as if with open arms ready for me
 to take her to myself--
 
 Mrs. Alving. Oswald!
 
 Oswald. --then I realised that my salvation lay in her, for I saw the
 joy of life in her!
 
 Mrs. Alving (starting back). The joy of life--? Is there salvation in
 that?
 
 Regina (coming in from the dining-room with a bottle of champagne).
 Excuse me for being so long; but I had to go to the cellar. (Puts the
 bottle down on the table.)
 
 Oswald. Bring another glass, too.
 
 Regina (looking at him in astonishment). The mistress's glass is there,
 sir.
 
 Oswald. Yes, but fetch one for yourself, Regina (REGINA starts, and
 gives a quick shy glance at MRS. ALVING.) Well?
 
 Regina (in a low and hesitating voice). Do you wish me to, ma'am?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Fetch the glass, Regina. (REGINA goes into the
 dining-room.)
 
 Oswald (looking after her). Have you noticed how well she walks?--so
 firmly and confidently!
 
 Mrs. Alving. It cannot be, Oswald.
 
 Oswald. It is settled. You must see that. It is no use forbidding it.
 (REGINA comes in with a glass, which she holds in her hand.) Sit down,
 Regina. (REGINA looks questioningly at MRS. ALVING.)
 
 Mrs. Alving. Sit down. (REGINA sits down on a chair near the
 dining-room door, still holding the glass in her hand.) Oswald, what
 was it you were saying about the joy of life?
 
 Oswald. Ah, mother--the joy of life! You don't know very much about
 that at home here. I shall never realise it here.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Not even when you are with me?
 
 Oswald. Never at home. But you can't understand that.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, indeed I almost think I do understand you now.
 
 Oswald. That--and the joy of work. They are really the same thing at
 bottom. Put you don't know anything about that either.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Perhaps you are right. Tell me some more about it, Oswald.
 
 Oswald. Well, all I mean is that here people are brought up to believe
 that work is a curse and a punishment for sin, and that life is a state
 of wretchedness and that the sooner we can get out of it the better.
 
 Mrs. Alving. A vale of tears, yes.  And we quite conscientiously make
 it so.
 
 Oswald. But the people over there will have none of that. There is no
 one there who really believes doctrines of that kind any longer. Over
 there the mere fact of being alive is thought to be a matter for
 exultant happiness. Mother, have you noticed that everything I have
 painted has turned upon the joy of life?--always upon the joy of life,
 unfailingly. There is light there, and sunshine, and a holiday
 feeling--and people's faces beaming with happiness. That is why I am
 afraid to stay at home here with you.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Afraid? What are you afraid of here, with me?
 
 Oswald. I am afraid that all these feelings that are so strong in me
 would degenerate into something ugly here.
 
 Mrs. Alving (looking steadily at him). Do you think that is what would
 happen?
 
 Oswald. I am certain it would. Even if one lived the same life at home
 here, as over there--it would never really be the same life.
 
 Mrs. Alving (who has listened anxiously to him, gets up with a
 thoughtful expression and says:) Now I see clearly how it all happened.
 
 Oswald. What do you see?
 
 Mrs. Alving. I see it now for the first time. And now I can speak.
 
 Oswald (getting up). Mother, I don't understand you.
 
 Regina (who has got up also). Perhaps I had better go.
 
 Mrs. Alving. No, stay here. Now I can speak. Now, my son, you shall
 know the whole truth. Oswald! Regina!
 
 Oswald. Hush!--here is the parson.
 
 (MANDERS comes in by the hall door.)
 
 Manders. Well, my friends, we have been spending an edifying time over
 there.
 
 Oswald. So have we.
 
 Manders. Engstrand must have help with his Sailors Home. Regina must go
 home with him and give him her assistance.
 
 Regina. No, thank you, Mr. Manders.
 
 Manders (perceiving her for the first time). What--? You in here? --and
 with a wineglass in your hand!
 
 Regina (putting down the glass hastily). I beg your pardon--!
 
 Oswald. Regina is going away with me, Mr. Manders.
 
 Manders. Going away! With you!
 
 Oswald. Yes, as my wife--if she insists on that.
 
 Manders. But, good heavens--!
 
 Regina. It is not my fault, Mr. Manders.
 
 Oswald. Or else she stays here if I stay.
 
 Regina (involuntarily). Here!
 
 Manders. I am amazed at you, Mrs. Alving.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Neither of those things will happen, for now I can speak
 openly.
 
 Manders. But you won't do that! No, no, no!
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, I can and I will. And without destroying anyone's
 ideals.
 
 Oswald. Mother, what is it that is being concealed from me?
 
 Regina (listening). Mrs. Alving! Listen! They are shouting outside.
 
 (Goes into the conservatory and looks out.)
 
 Oswald (going to the window on the left). What can be the matter? Where
 does that glare come from?
 
 Regina (calls out). The Orphanage is on fire!
 
 Mrs. Alving (going to the window). On fire?
 
 Manders. On fire? Impossible. I was there just a moment ago.
 
 Oswald. Where is my hat? Oh, never mind that. Father's Orphanage--!
 
 (Runs out through the garden door.)
 
 Mrs. Alving. My shawl, Regina! The whole place is in flames.
 
 Manders. How terrible! Mrs. Alving, that fire is a judgment on this
 house of sin!
 
 Mrs. Alving. Quite so. Come, Regina.
 
 (She and REGINA hurry out.)
 
 Manders (clasping his hands). And no insurance! (Follows them out.)
 
 
 
 
 ACT III
 
 
 (The same scene. All the doors are standing open. The lamp is still
 burning on the table. It is dark outside, except for a faint glimmer of
 light seen through the windows at the back. MRS. ALVING, with a shawl
 over her head, is standing in the conservatory, looking out. REGINA,
 also wrapped in a shawl, is standing a little behind her.)
 
 Mrs. Alving. Everything bured--down to the ground.
 
 Regina. It is burning still in the basement.
 
 Mrs. Alving. I can't think why Oswald doesn't come back. There is no
 chance of saving anything.
 
 Regina. Shall I go and take his hat to him?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Hasn't he even got his hat?
 
 Regina (pointing to the hall). No, there it is, hanging up.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Never mind. He is sure to come back soon. I will go and
 see what he is doing. (Goes out by the garden door. MANDERS comes in
 from the hall.)
 
 Manders. Isn't Mrs. Alving here?
 
 Regina. She has just this moment gone down into the garden.
 
 Manders. I have never spent such a terrible night in my life.
 
 Regina. Isn't it a shocking misfortune, sir!
 
 Manders. Oh, don't speak about it. I scarcely dare to think about it.
 
 Regina. But how can it have happened?
 
 Manders. Don't ask me, Miss Engstrand! How should I know? Are you going
 to suggest too--? Isn't it enough that your father--?
 
 Regina. What has he done?
 
 Manders. He has nearly driven me crazy.
 
 Engstrand (coming in from the hall). Mr. Manders--!
 
 Manders (turning round with a start). Have you ever followed me here!
 
 Engstrand. Yes, God help us all--! Great heavens! What a dreadful
 thing, your reverence!
 
 Manders (walking up and down). Oh dear, oh dear!
 
 Regina. What do you mean?
 
 Engstrand. Our little prayer-meeting was the cause of it all, don't you
 see? (Aside, to REGINA.) Now we've got the old fool, my girl. (Aloud.)
 And to think it is my fault that Mr. Manders should be the cause of
 such a thing!
 
 Manders. I assure you, Engstrand--
 
 Engstrand. But there was no one else carrying a light there except you,
 sir.
 
 Manders (standing still). Yes, so you say. But I have no clear
 recollection of having had a light in my hand.
 
 Engstrand. But I saw quite distinctly your reverence take a candle and
 snuff it with your fingers and throw away the burning bit of wick among
 the shavings.
 
 Manders. Did you see that?
 
 Engstrand. Yes, distinctly.
 
 Manders. I can't understand it at all. It is never my habit to snuff a
 candle with my fingers.
 
 Engstrand. Yes, it wasn't like you to do that, sir. But, who would have
 thought it could be such a dangerous thing to do?
 
 Manders (walking restlessly backwards and forwards) Oh, don't ask me!
 
 Engstrand (following him about). And you hadn't insured it either, had
 you, sir?
 
 Manders. No, no, no; you heard me say so.
 
 Engstrand. You hadn't insured it--and then went and set light to the
 whole place! Good Lord, what bad luck!
 
 Manders (wiping the perspiration from his forehead). You may well say
 so, Engstrand.
 
 Engstrand. And that it should happen to a charitable institution that
 would have been of service both to the town and the country, so to
 speak! The newspapers won't be very kind to your reverence, I expect.
 
 Manders. No, that is just what I am thinking of. It is almost the worst
 part of the whole thing. The spiteful attacks and accusations--it is
 horrible to think of!
 
 Mrs. Alving (coming in from the garden). I can't get him away from the
 fire.
 
 Manders. Oh, there you are, Mrs. Alving.
 
 Mrs. Alving. You will escape having to make your inaugural address now,
 at all events, Mr. Manders.
 
 Manders. Oh, I would so gladly have--
 
 Mrs. Alving (in a dull voice). It is just as well it has happened. This
 Orphanage would never have come to any good.
 
 Manders. Don't you think so?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Do you?
 
 Manders. But it is none the less an extraordinary piece of ill luck.
 
 Mrs. Alving. We will discuss it simply as a business matter. Are you
 waiting for Mr. Manders, Engstrand?
 
 Engstrand (at the hall door). Yes, I am.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Sit down then, while you are waiting.
 
 Engstrand. Thank you, I would rather stand.
 
 Mrs. Alving (to MANDERS). I suppose you are going by the boat?
 
 Manders. Yes: It goes in about an hour--
 
 Mrs. Alving. Please take all the documents back with you. I don't want
 to hear another word about the matter. I have something else to think
 about now.
 
 Manders. Mrs. Alving--
 
 Mrs. Alving. Later on I will send you a power of attorney to deal with
 it exactly as you please.
 
 Manders. I shall be most happy to undertake that; I am afraid the
 original intention of the bequest will have to be entirely altered now.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Of course.
 
 Meanders. Provisionally, I should suggest this way of disposing of it:
 Make over the Solvik property to the parish. The land is undoubtedly
 not without a certain value; it will always be useful for some purpose
 or another. And as for the interest on the remaining capital that is on
 deposit in the bank, possibly I might make suitable use of that in
 support of some undertaking that promises to be of use to the town.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Do exactly as you please. The whole thing is a matter of
 indifference to me now.
 
 Engstrand. You will think of my Sailors' Home, Mr. Manders?
 
 Manders. Yes, certainly, that is a suggestion. But we must consider the
 matter carefully.
 
 Engstrand (aside). Consider!--devil take it! Oh Lord.
 
 Manders (sighing). And unfortunately I can't tell how much longer I may
 have anything to do with the matter--whether public opinion may not
 force me to retire from it altogether. That depends entirely upon the
 result of the inquiry into the cause of the fire.
 
 Mrs. Alving. What do you say?
 
 Manders. And one cannot in any way reckon upon the result beforehand.
 
 Engstrand (going nearer to him). Yes, indeed one can; because here
 stand I, Jacob Engstrand.
 
 Manders. Quite so, but--
 
 Engstrand (lowering his voice). And Jacob Engstrand isn't the man to
 desert a worthy benefactor in the hour of need, as the saying is.
 
 Manders. Yes, but, my dear fellow-how--?
 
 Engstrand. You might say Jacob Engstrand is an angel of salvation, so
 to speak, your reverence.
 
 Manders. No, no, I couldn't possibly accept that.
 
 Engstrand. That's how it will be, all the same. I know someone who has
 taken the blame for someone else on his shoulders before now, I do.
 
 Manders. Jacob! (Grasps his hand.) You are one in a thousand! You shall
 have assistance in the matter of your Sailors' Home, you may rely upon
 that.
 
 (ENGSTRAND tries to thank him, but is prevented by emotion.)
 
 Manders (hanging his wallet over his shoulder). Now we must be off. We
 will travel together.
 
 Engstrand (by the dining-room door, says aside to REGINA). Come with
 me, you hussy! You shall be as cosy as the yolk in an egg!
 
 Regina (tossing her head). Merci!
 
 (She goes out into the hall and brings back MANDERS' luggage.)
 
 Manders. Good-bye, Mrs. Alving! And may the spirit of order and of what
 is lawful speedily enter into this house.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Goodbye, Mr. Manders.
 
 (She goes into the conservatory, as she sees OSWALD coming in by the
 garden door.)
 
 Engstrand (as he and REGINA are helping MANDERS on with his coat).
 Goodbye, my child. And if anything should happen to you, you know where
 Jacob Engstrand is to be found. (Lowering his voice.) Little Harbour
 Street, ahem--! (To MRS. ALVING and OSWALD.) And my house for poor
 seafaring men shall be called the "Alving Home," it shall. And, if I
 can carry out my own ideas about it, I shall make bold to hope that it
 may be worthy of bearing the late Mr. Alving's name.
 
 Manders (at the door). Ahem--ahem! Come along, my dear Engstrand.
 Goodbye--goodbye!
 
 (He and ENGSTRAND go out by the hall door.)
 
 Oswald (going to the table). What house was he speaking about?
 
 Mrs. Alving. I believe it is some sort of a Home that he and Mr.
 Manders want to start.
 
 Oswald. It will be burned up just like this one.
 
 Mrs. Alving. What makes you think that?
 
 Oswald. Everything will be burned up; nothing will be left that is in
 memory of my father. Here am I being burned up, too.
 
 (REGINA looks at him in alarm.)
 
 Mrs. Alving. Oswald! You should not have stayed so long over there, my
 poor boy.
 
 Oswald (sitting down at the table). I almost believe you are right.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Let me dry your face, Oswald; you are all wet. (Wipes his
 face with her handkerchief.)
 
 Oswald (looking straight before him, with no expression in his eyes).
 Thank you, mother.
 
 Mrs. Alving. And aren't you tired, Oswald? Don't you want to go to
 sleep?
 
 Oswald (uneasily). No, no--not to sleep! I never sleep; I only pretend
 to. (Gloomily.) That will come soon enough.
 
 Mrs. Alving (looking at him anxiously). Anyhow you are really ill, my
 darling boy.
 
 Regina (intently). Is Mr. Alving ill?
 
 Oswald (impatiently). And do shut all the doors! This deadly fear--
 
 Mrs. Alving. Shut the doors, Regina. (REGINA shuts the doors and
 remains standing by the hall door. MRS. ALVING takes off her shawl;
 REGINA does the same. MRS. ALVING draws up a chair near to OSWALD'S and
 sits down beside him.) That's it! Now I will sit beside you--
 
 Oswald. Yes, do. And Regina must stay in here too; Regina must always
 be near me. You must give me a helping hand, you know, Regina. Won't
 you do that?
 
 Regina. I don't understand--
 
 Mrs. Alving. A helping hand?
 
 Oswald. Yes--when there is need for it.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Oswald, have you not your mother to give you a helping
 hand?
 
 Oswald. You? (Smiles.) No, mother, you will never give me the kind of
 helping hand I mean. (Laughs grimly.) You! Ha, ha! (Looks gravely at
 her.) After all, you have the best right. (Impetuously.) Why don't you
 call me by my Christian name, Regina? Why don't you say Oswald?
 
 Regina (in a low voice). I did not think Mrs. Alving would like it.
 
 Mrs. Alving. It will not be long before you have the right to do it.
 Sit down here now beside us, too. (REGINA sits down quietly and
 hesitatingly at the other side of the table.) And now, my poor tortured
 boy, I am going to take the burden off your mind--
 
 Oswald. You, mother?
 
 Mrs. Alving. --all that you call remorse and regret and self-reproach.
 
 Oswald. And you think you can do that?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, now I can, Oswald. A little while ago you were
 talking about the joy of life, and what you said seemed to shed a new
 light upon everything in my whole life.
 
 Oswald (shaking his head). I don't in the least understand what you
 mean.
 
 Mrs. Alving. You should have known your father in his young days in the
 army. He was full of the joy of life, I can tell you.
 
 Oswald. Yes, I know.
 
 Mrs. Alving. It gave me a holiday feeling only to look at him, full of
 irrepressible energy and exuberant spirits.
 
 Oswald. What then?
 
 Mrs. Alving, Well, then this boy, full of the joy of life--for he was
 just like a boy, then--had to make his home in a second-rate town which
 had none of the joy of life to offer him, but only dissipations. He had
 to come out here and live an aimless life; he had only an official
 post. He had no work worth devoting his whole mind to; he had nothing
 more than official routine to attend to. He had not a single companion
 capable of appreciating what the joy of life meant; nothing but idlers
 and tipplers...
 
 Oswald. Mother--!
 
 Mrs. Alving. And so the inevitable happened!
 
 Oswald. What was the inevitable?
 
 Mrs. Alving. You said yourself this evening what would happen in your
 case if you stayed at home.
 
 Oswald. Do you mean by that, that father--?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Your poor father never found any outlet for the
 overmastering joy of life that was in him. And I brought no holiday
 spirit into his home, either.
 
 Oswald. You didn't, either?
 
 Mrs. Alving. I had been taught about duty, and the sort of thing that I
 believed in so long here. Everything seemed to turn upon duty--my duty,
 or his duty--and I am afraid I made your poor father's home unbearable
 to him, Oswald.
 
 Oswald. Why didn't you ever say anything about it to me in your letters?
 
 Mrs. Alving. I never looked at it as a thing I could speak of to you,
 who were his son.
 
 Oswald. What way did you look at it, then?
 
 Mrs. Alving. I only saw the one fact, that your father was a lost man
 before ever you were born.
 
 Oswald (in a choking voice). Ah--! (He gets up and goes to the window.)
 
 Mrs. Alving. And then I had the one thought in my mind, day and night,
 that Regina in fact had as good a right in this house--as my own boy
 had.
 
 Oswald (turns round suddenly), Regina--?
 
 
 Regina (gets up and asks in choking tones). I--?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, now you both know it.
 
 Oswald. Regina!
 
 Regina (to herself). So mother was one of that sort too.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Your mother had many good qualities, Regina.
 
 Regina. Yes, but she was one of that sort too, all the same. I have
 even thought so myself, sometimes, but--. Then, if you please, Mrs.
 Alving, may I have permission to leave at once?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Do you really wish to, Regina?
 
 Regina. Yes, indeed, I certainly wish to.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Of course you shall do as you like, but--
 
 Oswald (going up to REGINA). Leave now? This is your home.
 
 Regina. Merci, Mr. Alving--oh, of course I may say Oswald now, but that
 is not the way I thought it would become allowable.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Regina, I have not been open with you--
 
 Regina. No, I can't say you have! If I had known Oswald was ill-- And
 now that there can never be anything serious between us--. No, I really
 can't stay here in the country and wear myself out looking after
 invalids.
 
 Oswald. Not even for the sake of one who has so near a claim on you?
 
 Regina. No, indeed I can't. A poor girl must make some use of her
 youth, otherwise she may easily land herself out in the cold before she
 knows where she is. And I have got the joy of life in me too, Mrs.
 Alving!
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, unfortunately; but don't throw yourself away, Regina.
 
 Regina. Oh, what's going to happen will happen. If Oswald takes after
 his father, it is just as likely I take after my mother, I expect.--May
 I ask, Mrs. Alving, whether Mr. Manders knows this about me?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Mr. Manders knows everything.
 
 Regina (putting on her shawl). Oh, well then, the best thing I can do
 is to get away by the boat as soon as I can. Mr. Manders is such a nice
 gentleman to deal with; and it certainly seems to me that I have just
 as much right to some of that money as he--as that horrid carpenter.
 
 Mrs. Alving. You are quite welcome to it, Regina.
 
 Regina (looking at her fixedly). You might as well have brought me up
 like a gentleman's daughter; it would have been more suitable. (Tosses
 her head.) Oh, well--never mind! (With a bitter glance at the unopened
 bottle.) I daresay someday I shall be drinking champagne with
 gentlefolk, after all.
 
 Mrs. Alving. If ever you need a home, Regina, come to me.
 
 Regina. No, thank you, Mrs. Alving. Mr. Manders takes an interest in
 me, I know. And if things should go very badly with me, I know one
 house at any rate where I shall feel at home.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Where is that?
 
 Regina. In the "Alving Home."
 
 Mrs. Alving. Regina--I can see quite well--you are going to your ruin!
 
 Regina. Pooh!--goodbye.
 
 (She bows to them and goes out through the hall.)
 
 Oswald (standing by the window and looking out). Has she gone?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes.
 
 Oswald (muttering to himself). I think it's all wrong.
 
 Mrs. Alving (going up to him from behind and putting her hands on his
 shoulders). Oswald, my dear boy--has it been a great shock to you?
 
 Oswald (turning his face towards her). All this about father, do you
 mean?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, about your unhappy father. I am so afraid it may have
 been too much for you.
 
 Oswald. What makes you think that? Naturally it has taken me entirely
 by surprise; but, after all, I don't know that it matters much to me.
 
 Mrs. Alving (drawing back her hands). Doesn't matter!--that your
 father's life was such a terrible failure!
 
 Oswald. Of course I can feel sympathy for him, just as I would for
 anyone else, but--
 
 Mrs. Alving. No more than that! For your own father!
 
 Oswald (impatiently). Father--father! I never knew anything of my
 father. I don't remember anything else about him except that he once
 made me sick.
 
 Mrs. Alving. It is dreadful to think of!--But surely a child should
 feel some affection for his father, whatever happens?
 
 Oswald. When the child has nothing to thank his father for? When he has
 never known him? Do you really cling to that antiquated
 superstition--you, who are so broad-minded in other things?
 
 Mrs. Alving. You call it nothing but a superstition!
 
 Oswald. Yes, and you can see that for yourself quite well, mother. It
 is one of those beliefs that are put into circulation in the world,
 and--
 
 Mrs. Alving. Ghosts of beliefs!
 
 Oswald (walking across the room). Yes, you might call them ghosts.
 
 Mrs. Alving (with an outburst of feeling). Oswald! then you don't love
 me either!
 
 Oswald. You I know, at any rate--
 
 Mrs. Alving. You know me, yes; but is that all?
 
 Oswald. And I know how fond you are of me, and I ought to be grateful
 to you for that. Besides, you can be so tremendously useful to me, now
 that I am ill.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, can't I, Oswald! I could almost bless your illness,
 as it has driven you home to me. For I see quite well that you are not
 my very own yet; you must be won.
 
 Oswald (impatiently). Yes, yes, yes; all that is just a way of talking.
 You must remember I am a sick man, mother. I can't concern myself much
 with anyone else; I have enough to do, thinking about myself.
 
 Mrs. Alving (gently). I will be very good and patient.
 
 Oswald. And cheerful too, mother!
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, my dear boy, you are quite right. (Goes up to him.)
 Now have I taken away all your remorse and self-reproach?
 
 Oswald. Yes, you have done that. But who will take away the fear?
 
 Mrs. Alving. The fear?
 
 Oswald (crossing the room). Regina would have done it for one kind word.
 
 Mrs. Alving. I don't understand you. What fear do you mean--and what
 has Regina to do with it?
 
 Oswald. Is it very late, mother?
 
 Mrs. Alving. It is early morning. (Looks out through the conservatory
 windows.) The dawn is breaking already on the heights. And the sky is
 clear, Oswald. In a little while you will see the sun.
 
 Oswald. I am glad of that. After all, there may be many things yet for
 me to be glad of and to live for--
 
 Mrs. Alving. I should hope so!
 
 Oswald. Even if I am not able to work--
 
 Mrs. Alving. You will soon find you are able to work again now, my dear
 boy. You have no longer all those painful depressing thoughts to brood
 over.
 
 Oswald. No, it is a good thing that you have been able to rid me of
 those fancies; if only, now, I could overcome this one thing-- (Sits
 down on the couch.) Let us have a little chat, mother.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, let us. (Pushes an armchair near to the couch and
 sits down beside him.)
 
 Oswald. The sun is rising--and you know all about it; so I don't feel
 the fear any longer.
 
 Mrs. Alving. I know all about what?
 
 Oswald (without listening to her). Mother, isn't it the case that you
 said this evening there was nothing in the world you would not do for
 me if I asked you?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, certainly I said so.
 
 Oswald. And will you be as good as your word, mother?
 
 Mrs. Alving. You may rely upon that, my own dear boy. I have nothing
 else to live for, but you.
 
 Oswald. Yes, yes; well, listen to me, mother, You are very
 strong-minded, I know. I want you to sit quite quiet when you hear what
 I am going to tell you.
 
 Mrs. Alving. But what is this dreadful thing--?
 
 Oswald. You mustn't scream. Do you hear? Will you promise me that? We
 are going to sit and talk it over quite quietly. Will you promise me
 that, mother?
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, yes, I promise--only tell me what it is.
 
 Oswald. Well, then, you must know that this fatigue of mine--and my mot
 being able to think about my work--all that is not really the illness
 itself--
 
 Mrs. Alving. What is the illness itself?
 
 Oswald. What I am suffering from is hereditary; it--(touches his
 forehead, and speaks very quietly)--it lies here.
 
 Mrs. Alving (almost speechless). Oswald! No--no!
 
 Oswald. Don't scream; I can't stand it. Yes, I tell you, it lies here,
 waiting. And any time, any moment, it may break out.
 
 Mrs. Alving. How horrible--!
 
 Oswald. Do keep quiet. That is the state I am in--
 
 Mrs. Alving (springing up). It isn't true, Oswald! It is impossible! It
 can't be that!
 
 Oswald. I had one attack while I was abroad. It passed off quickly. But
 when I learned the condition I had been in, then this dreadful haunting
 fear took possession of me.
 
 Mrs. Alving. That was the fear, then--
 
 Oswald. Yes, it is so indescribably horrible, you know If only it had
 been an ordinary mortal disease--. I am not so much afraid of dying;
 though, of course, I should like to live as long as I can.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Yes, yes, Oswald, you must!
 
 Oswald. But this is so appallingly horrible. To become like a helpless
 child again--to have to be fed, to have to be--. Oh, it's unspeakable!
 
 Mrs. Alving. My child has his mother to tend him.
 
 Oswald (jumping up). No, never; that is just what I won't endure! I
 dare not think what it would mean to linger on like that for years--to
 get old and grey like that. And you might die before I did. (Sits down
 in MRS. ALVING'S chair.) Because it doesn't necessarily have a fatal
 end quickly, the doctor said; he called it a kind of softening of the
 brain--or something of that sort. (Smiles mournfully.) I think that
 expression sounds so nice. It always makes me think of cherry-coloured
 velvet curtains--something that is soft to stroke.
 
 Mrs. Alving (with a scream). Oswald!
 
 Oswald (jumps up and walks about the room). And now you have taken
 Regina from me! If I had only had her, she would have given me a
 helping hand, I know.
 
 Mrs. Alving (going up to him). What do you mean, my darling boy? Is
 there any help in the world I would not be willing to give you?
 
 Oswald. When I had recovered from the attack I had abroad, the doctor
 told me that when it recurred--and it will recur--there would be no
 more hope.
 
 Mrs. Alving. And he was heartless enough to--
 
 Oswald. I insisted on knowing. I told him I had arrangements to make--.
 (Smiles cunningly.) And so I had. (Takes a small box from his inner
 breast-pocket.) Mother, do you see this?
 
 Mrs. Alving. What is it?
 
 Oswald. Morphia powders.
 
 Mrs. Alving (looking at him in terror). Oswald--my boy!
 
 Oswald. I have twelve of them saved up--
 
 Mrs. Alving (snatching at it). Give me the box, Oswald!
 
 Oswald. Not yet, mother. (Puts it lack in his pocket.)
 
 Mrs. Alving. I shall never get over this!
 
 Oswald, You must. If I had had Regina here now, I would have told her
 quietly how things stand with me--and asked her to give me this last
 helping hand. She would have helped me, I am certain.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Never!
 
 Oswald. If this horrible thing had come upon me and she had seen me
 lying helpless, like a baby, past help, past saving, past hope--with no
 chance of recovering--
 
 Mrs. Alving. Never in the world would Regina have done it.
 
 Oswald. Regina would have done it. Regina was so splendidly
 light-hearted. And she would very soon have tired of looking after an
 invalid like me.
 
 Mrs. Alving. Then thank heaven Regina is not here!
 
 Oswald. Well, now you have got to give me that helping hand, mother.
 
 Mrs. Alving (with a loud scream). I!
 
 Oswald. Who has a better right than you?
 
 Mrs. Alving. I! Your mother!
 
 Oswald. Just for that reason.
 
 Mrs. Alving. I, who gave you your life!
 
 Oswald, I never asked you for life. And what kind of a life was it that
 you gave me? I don't want it! You shall take it back!
 
 Mrs. Alving. Help! Help! (Runs into the hall.)
 
 Oswald (following her). Don't leave me! Where are you going?
 
 Mrs. Alving (in the hall). To fetch the doctor to you, Oswald! Let me
 out!
 
 Oswald (going into the hall). You shan't go out. And no one shall come
 in. (Turns the key in the lock.)
 
 Mrs. Alving (coming in again). Oswald! Oswald!--my child!
 
 Oswald (following her). Have you a mother's heart--and can bear to see
 me suffering this unspeakable terror?
 
 Mrs. Alving (controlling herself, after a moment's silence). There is
 my hand on it.
 
 Oswald. Will you--?
 
 Mrs. Alving. If it becomes necessary. But it shan't become necessary:
 No, no--it is impossible it should!
 
 Oswald. Let us hope so. And let us live together as long as we can.
 Thank you, mother.
 
 (He sits down in the armchair, which MRS. ALVING had moved beside the
 couch. Day is breaking; the lamp is still burning on the table.)
 
 Mrs. Alving (coming cautiously nearer). Do you feel calmer now?
 
 Oswald. Yes.
 
 Mrs. Alving (bending over him). It has only been a dreadful fancy of
 yours, Oswald. Nothing but fancy. All this upset has been bad for you.
 But now you will get some rest, at home with your own mother, my
 darling boy. You shall have everything you want, just as you did when
 you were a little child.--There, now. The attack is over. You see how
 easily it passed off! I knew it would.--And look, Oswald, what a lovely
 day we are going to have? Brilliant sunshine. Now you will be able to
 see your home properly. (She goes to the table and puts out the lamp.
 It is sunrise. The glaciers and peaks in the distance are seen bathed
 in bright morning fight.)
 
 Oswald (who has been sitting motionless in the armchair, with his back
 to the scene outside, suddenly says:) Mother, give me the sun.
 
 Mrs. Alving (standing at the table, and looking at him in amazement).
 What do you say?
 
 Oswald (repeats in a dull, toneless voice). The sun--the sun.
 
 Mrs. Alving (going up to him). Oswald, what is the matter with you?
 (OSWALD seems to shrink up in the chair; all his muscles relax; his
 face loses its expression, and his eyes stare stupidly. MRS. ALVING is
 trembling with terror.) What is it! (Screams.) Oswald! What is the
 matter with you! (Throws herself on her knees beside him and shakes
 him.) Oswald! Oswald! Look at me! Don't you know me!
 
 Oswald (in an expressionless voice, as before). The sun--the sun.
 
 Mrs. Alving (jumps up despairingly, beats her head with her hands, and
 screams). I can't bear it! (Whispers as though paralysed with fear.) I
 can't bear it... I Never! (Suddenly.) Where has he got it? (Passes her
 hand quickly over his coat.) Here! (Draws back a little spay and
 cries:) No, no, no!--Yes!--no, no! (She stands a few steps from him,
 her hands thrust into her hair, and stares at him in speechless terror.)
 
 Oswald (sitting motionless, as before). The sun--the sun.

      A DOLL'S HOUSE
 
 
 
 
 ACT I
 
 (SCENE.--A room furnished comfortably and tastefully, but not
 extravagantly. At the back, a door to the right leads to the
 entrance-hall, another to the left leads to Helmer's study. Between the
 doors stands a piano. In the middle of the left-hand wall is a door, and
 beyond it a window. Near the window are a round table, arm-chairs and
 a small sofa. In the right-hand wall, at the farther end, another door;
 and on the same side, nearer the footlights, a stove, two easy chairs
 and a rocking-chair; between the stove and the door, a small table.
 Engravings on the walls; a cabinet with china and other small objects;
 a small book-case with well-bound books. The floors are carpeted, and a
 fire burns in the stove. It is winter.
 
 A bell rings in the hall; shortly afterwards the door is heard to open.
 Enter NORA, humming a tune and in high spirits. She is in outdoor dress
 and carries a number of parcels; these she lays on the table to the
 right. She leaves the outer door open after her, and through it is seen
 a PORTER who is carrying a Christmas Tree and a basket, which he gives
 to the MAID who has opened the door.)
 
 Nora. Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children
 do not see it until this evening, when it is dressed. (To the PORTER,
 taking out her purse.) How much?
 
 Porter. Sixpence.
 
 Nora. There is a shilling. No, keep the change. (The PORTER thanks her,
 and goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she
 takes off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her
 pocket and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband's door
 and listens.) Yes, he is in. (Still humming, she goes to the table on
 the right.)
 
 Helmer (calls out from his room). Is that my little lark twittering out
 there?
 
 Nora (busy opening some of the parcels). Yes, it is!
 
 Helmer. Is it my little squirrel bustling about?
 
 Nora. Yes!
 
 Helmer. When did my squirrel come home?
 
 Nora. Just now. (Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her
 mouth.) Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.
 
 Helmer. Don't disturb me. (A little later, he opens the door and looks
 into the room, pen in hand.) Bought, did you say? All these things? Has
 my little spendthrift been wasting money again?
 
 Nora. Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go
 a little. This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to
 economise.
 
 Helmer. Still, you know, we can't spend money recklessly. Nora. Yes,
 Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn't we? Just a tiny
 wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots of
 money.
 
 Helmer. Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter
 before the salary is due.
 
 Nora. Pooh! we can borrow until then.
 
 Helmer. Nora! (Goes up to her and takes her playfully by the ear.) The
 same little featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds
 today, and you spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New
 Year's Eve a slate fell on my head and killed me, and--Nora (putting her
 hands over his mouth). Oh! don't say such horrid things.
 
 Helmer. Still, suppose that happened,--what then?
 
 Nora. If that were to happen, I don't suppose I should care whether I
 owed money or not.
 
 Helmer. Yes, but what about the people who had lent it?
 
 Nora. They? Who would bother about them? I should not know who they
 were.
 
 Helmer. That is like a woman! But seriously, Nora, you know what I think
 about that. No debt, no borrowing. There can be no freedom or beauty
 about a home life that depends on borrowing and debt. We two have kept
 bravely on the straight road so far, and we will go on the same way for
 the short time longer that there need be any struggle.
 
 Nora (moving towards the stove). As you please, Torvald.
 
 Helmer (following her). Come, come, my little skylark must not droop her
 wings. What is this! Is my little squirrel out of temper? (Taking out
 his purse.) Nora, what do you think I have got here?
 
 Nora (turning round quickly). Money!
 
 Helmer. There you are. (Gives her some money.) Do you think I don't know
 what a lot is wanted for housekeeping at Christmas-time?
 
 Nora (counting). Ten shillings--a pound--two pounds! Thank you, thank
 you, Torvald; that will keep me going for a long time.
 
 Helmer. Indeed it must.
 
 Nora. Yes, yes, it will. But come here and let me show you what I have
 bought. And all so cheap! Look, here is a new suit for Ivar, and
 a sword; and a horse and a trumpet for Bob; and a doll and dolly's
 bedstead for Emmy,--they are very plain, but anyway she will soon break
 them in pieces. And here are dress-lengths and handkerchiefs for the
 maids; old Anne ought really to have something better.
 
 Helmer. And what is in this parcel?
 
 Nora (crying out). No, no! you mustn't see that until this evening.
 
 Helmer. Very well. But now tell me, you extravagant little person, what
 would you like for yourself?
 
 Nora. For myself? Oh, I am sure I don't want anything.
 
 Helmer. Yes, but you must. Tell me something reasonable that you would
 particularly like to have.
 
 Nora. No, I really can't think of anything--unless, Torvald--
 
 Helmer. Well?
 
 Nora (playing with his coat buttons, and without raising her eyes to
 his). If you really want to give me something, you might--you might--
 
 Helmer. Well, out with it!
 
 Nora (speaking quickly). You might give me money, Torvald. Only just as
 much as you can afford; and then one of these days I will buy something
 with it.
 
 Helmer. But, Nora--
 
 Nora. Oh, do! dear Torvald; please, please do! Then I will wrap it up in
 beautiful gilt paper and hang it on the Christmas Tree. Wouldn't that be
 fun?
 
 Helmer. What are little people called that are always wasting money?
 
 Nora. Spendthrifts--I know. Let us do as you suggest, Torvald, and then
 I shall have time to think what I am most in want of. That is a very
 sensible plan, isn't it?
 
 Helmer (smiling). Indeed it is--that is to say, if you were really to
 save out of the money I give you, and then really buy something for
 yourself. But if you spend it all on the housekeeping and any number of
 unnecessary things, then I merely have to pay up again.
 
 Nora. Oh but, Torvald--
 
 Helmer. You can't deny it, my dear little Nora. (Puts his arm round
 her waist.) It's a sweet little spendthrift, but she uses up a deal of
 money. One would hardly believe how expensive such little persons are!
 
 Nora. It's a shame to say that. I do really save all I can.
 
 Helmer (laughing). That's very true,--all you can. But you can't save
 anything!
 
 Nora (smiling quietly and happily). You haven't any idea how many
 expenses we skylarks and squirrels have, Torvald.
 
 Helmer. You are an odd little soul. Very like your father. You always
 find some new way of wheedling money out of me, and, as soon as you
 have got it, it seems to melt in your hands. You never know where it
 has gone. Still, one must take you as you are. It is in the blood; for
 indeed it is true that you can inherit these things, Nora.
 
 Nora. Ah, I wish I had inherited many of papa's qualities.
 
 Helmer. And I would not wish you to be anything but just what you are,
 my sweet little skylark. But, do you know, it strikes me that you are
 looking rather--what shall I say--rather uneasy today?
 
 Nora. Do I?
 
 Helmer. You do, really. Look straight at me.
 
 Nora (looks at him). Well?
 
 Helmer (wagging his finger at her). Hasn't Miss Sweet Tooth been
 breaking rules in town today?
 
 Nora. No; what makes you think that?
 
 Helmer. Hasn't she paid a visit to the confectioner's?
 
 Nora. No, I assure you, Torvald--
 
 Helmer. Not been nibbling sweets?
 
 Nora. No, certainly not.
 
 Helmer. Not even taken a bite at a macaroon or two?
 
 Nora. No, Torvald, I assure you really--
 
 Helmer. There, there, of course I was only joking.
 
 Nora (going to the table on the right). I should not think of going
 against your wishes.
 
 Helmer. No, I am sure of that; besides, you gave me your word-- (Going
 up to her.) Keep your little Christmas secrets to yourself, my darling.
 They will all be revealed tonight when the Christmas Tree is lit, no
 doubt.
 
 Nora. Did you remember to invite Doctor Rank?
 
 Helmer. No. But there is no need; as a matter of course he will come to
 dinner with us. However, I will ask him when he comes in this morning.
 I have ordered some good wine. Nora, you can't think how I am looking
 forward to this evening.
 
 Nora. So am I! And how the children will enjoy themselves, Torvald!
 
 Helmer. It is splendid to feel that one has a perfectly safe
 appointment, and a big enough income. It's delightful to think of, isn't
 it?
 
 Nora. It's wonderful!
 
 Helmer. Do you remember last Christmas? For a full three weeks
 beforehand you shut yourself up every evening until long after midnight,
 making ornaments for the Christmas Tree, and all the other fine things
 that were to be a surprise to us. It was the dullest three weeks I ever
 spent!
 
 Nora. I didn't find it dull.
 
 Helmer (smiling). But there was precious little result, Nora.
 
 Nora. Oh, you shouldn't tease me about that again. How could I help the
 cat's going in and tearing everything to pieces?
 
 Helmer. Of course you couldn't, poor little girl. You had the best of
 intentions to please us all, and that's the main thing. But it is a good
 thing that our hard times are over.
 
 Nora. Yes, it is really wonderful.
 
 Helmer. This time I needn't sit here and be dull all alone, and you
 needn't ruin your dear eyes and your pretty little hands--
 
 Nora (clapping her hands). No, Torvald, I needn't any longer, need I!
 It's wonderfully lovely to hear you say so! (Taking his arm.) Now I will
 tell you how I have been thinking we ought to arrange things, Torvald.
 As soon as Christmas is over--(A bell rings in the hall.) There's the
 bell. (She tidies the room a little.) There's some one at the door. What
 a nuisance!
 
 Helmer. If it is a caller, remember I am not at home.
 
 Maid (in the doorway). A lady to see you, ma'am,--a stranger.
 
 Nora. Ask her to come in.
 
 Maid (to HELMER). The doctor came at the same time, sir.
 
 Helmer. Did he go straight into my room?
 
 Maid. Yes, sir.
 
 (HELMER goes into his room. The MAID ushers in Mrs. LINDE, who is in
 travelling dress, and shuts the door.) Mrs. Linde (in a dejected and
 timid voice). How do you do, Nora?
 
 Nora (doubtfully). How do you do--Mrs. Linde. You don't recognise me, I
 suppose.
 
 Nora. No, I don't know--yes, to be sure, I seem to--(Suddenly.) Yes!
 Christine! Is it really you?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, it is I.
 
 Nora. Christine! To think of my not recognising you! And yet how could
 I--(In a gentle voice.) How you have altered, Christine!
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, I have indeed. In nine, ten long years--
 
 Nora. Is it so long since we met? I suppose it is. The last eight years
 have been a happy time for me, I can tell you. And so now you have come
 into the town, and have taken this long journey in winter--that was
 plucky of you.
 
 Mrs. Linde. I arrived by steamer this morning.
 
 Nora. To have some fun at Christmas-time, of course. How delightful! We
 will have such fun together! But take off your things. You are not cold,
 I hope. (Helps her.) Now we will sit down by the stove, and be cosy.
 No, take this armchair; I will sit here in the rocking-chair. (Takes
 her hands.) Now you look like your old self again; it was only the first
 moment--You are a little paler, Christine, and perhaps a little thinner.
 
 Mrs. Linde. And much, much older, Nora.
 
 Nora. Perhaps a little older; very, very little; certainly not much.
 (Stops suddenly and speaks seriously.) What a thoughtless creature I am,
 chattering away like this. My poor, dear Christine, do forgive me.
 
 Mrs. Linde. What do you mean, Nora?
 
 Nora (gently). Poor Christine, you are a widow.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes; it is three years ago now.
 
 Nora. Yes, I knew; I saw it in the papers. I assure you, Christine, I
 meant ever so often to write to you at the time, but I always put it off
 and something always prevented me.
 
 Mrs. Linde. I quite understand, dear.
 
 Nora. It was very bad of me, Christine. Poor thing, how you must have
 suffered. And he left you nothing?
 
 Mrs. Linde. No.
 
 Nora. And no children?
 
 Mrs. Linde. No.
 
 Nora. Nothing at all, then.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Not even any sorrow or grief to live upon.
 
 Nora (looking incredulously at her). But, Christine, is that possible?
 
 Mrs. Linde (smiles sadly and strokes her hair). It sometimes happens,
 Nora.
 
 Nora. So you are quite alone. How dreadfully sad that must be. I have
 three lovely children. You can't see them just now, for they are out
 with their nurse. But now you must tell me all about it.
 
 Mrs. Linde. No, no; I want to hear about you.
 
 Nora. No, you must begin. I mustn't be selfish today; today I must only
 think of your affairs. But there is one thing I must tell you. Do you
 know we have just had a great piece of good luck?
 
 Mrs. Linde. No, what is it?
 
 Nora. Just fancy, my husband has been made manager of the Bank!
 
 Mrs. Linde. Your husband? What good luck!
 
 Nora. Yes, tremendous! A barrister's profession is such an uncertain
 thing, especially if he won't undertake unsavoury cases; and naturally
 Torvald has never been willing to do that, and I quite agree with him.
 You may imagine how pleased we are! He is to take up his work in the
 Bank at the New Year, and then he will have a big salary and lots of
 commissions. For the future we can live quite differently--we can do
 just as we like. I feel so relieved and so happy, Christine! It will be
 splendid to have heaps of money and not need to have any anxiety, won't
 it?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, anyhow I think it would be delightful to have what one
 needs.
 
 Nora. No, not only what one needs, but heaps and heaps of money.
 
 Mrs. Linde (smiling). Nora, Nora, haven't you learned sense yet? In our
 schooldays you were a great spendthrift.
 
 Nora (laughing). Yes, that is what Torvald says now. (Wags her finger at
 her.) But "Nora, Nora" is not so silly as you think. We have not been in
 a position for me to waste money. We have both had to work.
 
 Mrs. Linde. You too?
 
 Nora. Yes; odds and ends, needlework, crotchet-work, embroidery, and
 that kind of thing. (Dropping her voice.) And other things as well. You
 know Torvald left his office when we were married? There was no prospect
 of promotion there, and he had to try and earn more than before. But
 during the first year he over-worked himself dreadfully. You see, he had
 to make money every way he could, and he worked early and late; but he
 couldn't stand it, and fell dreadfully ill, and the doctors said it was
 necessary for him to go south.
 
 Mrs. Linde. You spent a whole year in Italy, didn't you?
 
 Nora. Yes. It was no easy matter to get away, I can tell you. It
 was just after Ivar was born; but naturally we had to go. It was a
 wonderfully beautiful journey, and it saved Torvald's life. But it cost
 a tremendous lot of money, Christine.
 
 Mrs. Linde. So I should think.
 
 Nora. It cost about two hundred and fifty pounds. That's a lot, isn't
 it?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, and in emergencies like that it is lucky to have the
 money.
 
 Nora. I ought to tell you that we had it from papa.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Oh, I see. It was just about that time that he died, wasn't
 it?
 
 Nora. Yes; and, just think of it, I couldn't go and nurse him. I was
 expecting little Ivar's birth every day and I had my poor sick Torvald
 to look after. My dear, kind father--I never saw him again, Christine.
 That was the saddest time I have known since our marriage.
 
 Mrs. Linde. I know how fond you were of him. And then you went off to
 Italy?
 
 Nora. Yes; you see we had money then, and the doctors insisted on our
 going, so we started a month later.
 
 Mrs. Linde. And your husband came back quite well?
 
 Nora. As sound as a bell!
 
 Mrs. Linde. But--the doctor?
 
 Nora. What doctor?
 
 Mrs. Linde. I thought your maid said the gentleman who arrived here just
 as I did, was the doctor?
 
 Nora. Yes, that was Doctor Rank, but he doesn't come here
 professionally. He is our greatest friend, and comes in at least once
 every day. No, Torvald has not had an hour's illness since then, and our
 children are strong and healthy and so am I. (Jumps up and claps her
 hands.) Christine! Christine! it's good to be alive and happy!--But how
 horrid of me; I am talking of nothing but my own affairs. (Sits on a
 stool near her, and rests her arms on her knees.) You mustn't be angry
 with me. Tell me, is it really true that you did not love your husband?
 Why did you marry him?
 
 Mrs. Linde. My mother was alive then, and was bedridden and helpless,
 and I had to provide for my two younger brothers; so I did not think I
 was justified in refusing his offer.
 
 Nora. No, perhaps you were quite right. He was rich at that time, then?
 
 Mrs. Linde. I believe he was quite well off. But his business was a
 precarious one; and, when he died, it all went to pieces and there was
 nothing left.
 
 Nora. And then?--
 
 Mrs. Linde. Well, I had to turn my hand to anything I could find--first
 a small shop, then a small school, and so on. The last three years have
 seemed like one long working-day, with no rest. Now it is at an end,
 Nora. My poor mother needs me no more, for she is gone; and the boys
 do not need me either; they have got situations and can shift for
 themselves.
 
 Nora. What a relief you must feel if--
 
 Mrs. Linde. No, indeed; I only feel my life unspeakably empty. No one to
 live for anymore. (Gets up restlessly.) That was why I could not stand
 the life in my little backwater any longer. I hope it may be easier here
 to find something which will busy me and occupy my thoughts. If only I
 could have the good luck to get some regular work--office work of some
 kind--
 
 Nora. But, Christine, that is so frightfully tiring, and you look tired
 out now. You had far better go away to some watering-place.
 
 Mrs. Linde (walking to the window). I have no father to give me money
 for a journey, Nora.
 
 Nora (rising). Oh, don't be angry with me!
 
 Mrs. Linde (going up to her). It is you that must not be angry with me,
 dear. The worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so bitter.
 No one to work for, and yet obliged to be always on the lookout for
 chances. One must live, and so one becomes selfish. When you told me of
 the happy turn your fortunes have taken--you will hardly believe it--I
 was delighted not so much on your account as on my own.
 
 Nora. How do you mean?--Oh, I understand. You mean that perhaps Torvald
 could get you something to do.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, that was what I was thinking of.
 
 Nora. He must, Christine. Just leave it to me; I will broach the subject
 very cleverly--I will think of something that will please him very much.
 It will make me so happy to be of some use to you.
 
 Mrs. Linde. How kind you are, Nora, to be so anxious to help me! It is
 doubly kind in you, for you know so little of the burdens and troubles
 of life.
 
 Nora. I--? I know so little of them?
 
 Mrs. Linde (smiling). My dear! Small household cares and that sort of
 thing!--You are a child, Nora.
 
 Nora (tosses her head and crosses the stage). You ought not to be so
 superior.
 
 Mrs. Linde. No?
 
 Nora. You are just like the others. They all think that I am incapable
 of anything really serious--
 
 Mrs. Linde. Come, come--
 
 Nora.--that I have gone through nothing in this world of cares.
 
 Mrs. Linde. But, my dear Nora, you have just told me all your troubles.
 
 Nora. Pooh!--those were trifles. (Lowering her voice.) I have not told
 you the important thing.
 
 Mrs. Linde. The important thing? What do you mean?
 
 Nora. You look down upon me altogether, Christine--but you ought not to.
 You are proud, aren't you, of having worked so hard and so long for your
 mother?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Indeed, I don't look down on anyone. But it is true that I
 am both proud and glad to think that I was privileged to make the end of
 my mother's life almost free from care.
 
 Nora. And you are proud to think of what you have done for your
 brothers?
 
 Mrs. Linde. I think I have the right to be.
 
 Nora. I think so, too. But now, listen to this; I too have something to
 be proud and glad of.
 
 Mrs. Linde. I have no doubt you have. But what do you refer to?
 
 Nora. Speak low. Suppose Torvald were to hear! He mustn't on any
 account--no one in the world must know, Christine, except you.
 
 Mrs. Linde. But what is it?
 
 Nora. Come here. (Pulls her down on the sofa beside her.) Now I will
 show you that I too have something to be proud and glad of. It was I who
 saved Torvald's life.
 
 Mrs. Linde. "Saved"? How?
 
 Nora. I told you about our trip to Italy. Torvald would never have
 recovered if he had not gone there--
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, but your father gave you the necessary funds.
 
 Nora (smiling). Yes, that is what Torvald and all the others think,
 but--
 
 Mrs. Linde. But--
 
 Nora. Papa didn't give us a shilling. It was I who procured the money.
 
 Mrs. Linde. You? All that large sum?
 
 Nora. Two hundred and fifty pounds. What do you think of that?
 
 Mrs. Linde. But, Nora, how could you possibly do it? Did you win a prize
 in the Lottery?
 
 Nora (contemptuously). In the Lottery? There would have been no credit
 in that.
 
 Mrs. Linde. But where did you get it from, then? Nora (humming and
 smiling with an air of mystery). Hm, hm! Aha!
 
 Mrs. Linde. Because you couldn't have borrowed it.
 
 Nora. Couldn't I? Why not?
 
 Mrs. Linde. No, a wife cannot borrow without her husband's consent.
 
 Nora (tossing her head). Oh, if it is a wife who has any head for
 business--a wife who has the wit to be a little bit clever--
 
 Mrs. Linde. I don't understand it at all, Nora.
 
 Nora. There is no need you should. I never said I had borrowed the
 money. I may have got it some other way. (Lies back on the sofa.)
 Perhaps I got it from some other admirer. When anyone is as attractive
 as I am--
 
 Mrs. Linde. You are a mad creature.
 
 Nora. Now, you know you're full of curiosity, Christine.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Listen to me, Nora dear. Haven't you been a little bit
 imprudent?
 
 Nora (sits up straight). Is it imprudent to save your husband's life?
 
 Mrs. Linde. It seems to me imprudent, without his knowledge, to--
 
 Nora. But it was absolutely necessary that he should not know! My
 goodness, can't you understand that? It was necessary he should have no
 idea what a dangerous condition he was in. It was to me that the doctors
 came and said that his life was in danger, and that the only thing to
 save him was to live in the south. Do you suppose I didn't try, first of
 all, to get what I wanted as if it were for myself? I told him how much
 I should love to travel abroad like other young wives; I tried tears and
 entreaties with him; I told him that he ought to remember the condition
 I was in, and that he ought to be kind and indulgent to me; I even
 hinted that he might raise a loan. That nearly made him angry,
 Christine. He said I was thoughtless, and that it was his duty as my
 husband not to indulge me in my whims and caprices--as I believe he
 called them. Very well, I thought, you must be saved--and that was how I
 came to devise a way out of the difficulty--
 
 Mrs. Linde. And did your husband never get to know from your father that
 the money had not come from him?
 
 Nora. No, never. Papa died just at that time. I had meant to let him
 into the secret and beg him never to reveal it. But he was so ill
 then--alas, there never was any need to tell him.
 
 Mrs. Linde. And since then have you never told your secret to your
 husband?
 
 Nora. Good Heavens, no! How could you think so? A man who has such
 strong opinions about these things! And besides, how painful and
 humiliating it would be for Torvald, with his manly independence, to
 know that he owed me anything! It would upset our mutual relations
 altogether; our beautiful happy home would no longer be what it is now.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Do you mean never to tell him about it?
 
 Nora (meditatively, and with a half smile). Yes--someday, perhaps, after
 many years, when I am no longer as nice-looking as I am now. Don't laugh
 at me! I mean, of course, when Torvald is no longer as devoted to me as
 he is now; when my dancing and dressing-up and reciting have palled on
 him; then it may be a good thing to have something in reserve--(Breaking
 off.) What nonsense! That time will never come. Now, what do you think
 of my great secret, Christine? Do you still think I am of no use? I can
 tell you, too, that this affair has caused me a lot of worry. It has
 been by no means easy for me to meet my engagements punctually. I may
 tell you that there is something that is called, in business, quarterly
 interest, and another thing called payment in installments, and it is
 always so dreadfully difficult to manage them. I have had to save a
 little here and there, where I could, you understand. I have not been
 able to put aside much from my housekeeping money, for Torvald must have
 a good table. I couldn't let my children be shabbily dressed; I have
 felt obliged to use up all he gave me for them, the sweet little
 darlings!
 
 Mrs. Linde. So it has all had to come out of your own necessaries of
 life, poor Nora?
 
 Nora. Of course. Besides, I was the one responsible for it. Whenever
 Torvald has given me money for new dresses and such things, I have
 never spent more than half of it; I have always bought the simplest
 and cheapest things. Thank Heaven, any clothes look well on me, and
 so Torvald has never noticed it. But it was often very hard on me,
 Christine--because it is delightful to be really well dressed, isn't it?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Quite so.
 
 Nora. Well, then I have found other ways of earning money. Last winter
 I was lucky enough to get a lot of copying to do; so I locked myself up
 and sat writing every evening until quite late at night. Many a time I
 was desperately tired; but all the same it was a tremendous pleasure to
 sit there working and earning money. It was like being a man.
 
 Mrs. Linde. How much have you been able to pay off in that way?
 
 Nora. I can't tell you exactly. You see, it is very difficult to keep an
 account of a business matter of that kind. I only know that I have paid
 every penny that I could scrape together. Many a time I was at my wits'
 end. (Smiles.) Then I used to sit here and imagine that a rich old
 gentleman had fallen in love with me--
 
 Mrs. Linde. What! Who was it?
 
 Nora. Be quiet!--that he had died; and that when his will was opened
 it contained, written in big letters, the instruction: "The lovely Mrs.
 Nora Helmer is to have all I possess paid over to her at once in cash."
 
 Mrs. Linde. But, my dear Nora--who could the man be?
 
 Nora. Good gracious, can't you understand? There was no old gentleman at
 all; it was only something that I used to sit here and imagine, when I
 couldn't think of any way of procuring money. But it's all the same now;
 the tiresome old person can stay where he is, as far as I am concerned;
 I don't care about him or his will either, for I am free from care now.
 (Jumps up.) My goodness, it's delightful to think of, Christine! Free
 from care! To be able to be free from care, quite free from care; to be
 able to play and romp with the children; to be able to keep the house
 beautifully and have everything just as Torvald likes it! And, think of
 it, soon the spring will come and the big blue sky! Perhaps we shall be
 able to take a little trip--perhaps I shall see the sea again! Oh, it's
 a wonderful thing to be alive and be happy. (A bell is heard in the
 hall.)
 
 Mrs. Linde (rising). There is the bell; perhaps I had better go.
 
 Nora. No, don't go; no one will come in here; it is sure to be for
 Torvald.
 
 Servant (at the hall door). Excuse me, ma'am--there is a gentleman to
 see the master, and as the doctor is with him--
 
 Nora. Who is it?
 
 Krogstad (at the door). It is I, Mrs. Helmer. (Mrs. LINDE starts,
 trembles, and turns to the window.)
 
 Nora (takes a step towards him, and speaks in a strained, low voice).
 You? What is it? What do you want to see my husband about?
 
 Krogstad. Bank business--in a way. I have a small post in the Bank, and
 I hear your husband is to be our chief now--
 
 Nora. Then it is--
 
 Krogstad. Nothing but dry business matters, Mrs. Helmer; absolutely
 nothing else.
 
 Nora. Be so good as to go into the study, then. (She bows indifferently
 to him and shuts the door into the hall; then comes back and makes up
 the fire in the stove.)
 
 Mrs. Linde. Nora--who was that man?
 
 Nora. A lawyer, of the name of Krogstad.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Then it really was he.
 
 Nora. Do you know the man?
 
 Mrs. Linde. I used to--many years ago. At one time he was a solicitor's
 clerk in our town.
 
 Nora. Yes, he was.
 
 Mrs. Linde. He is greatly altered.
 
 Nora. He made a very unhappy marriage.
 
 Mrs. Linde. He is a widower now, isn't he?
 
 Nora. With several children. There now, it is burning up. (Shuts the
 door of the stove and moves the rocking-chair aside.)
 
 Mrs. Linde. They say he carries on various kinds of business.
 
 Nora. Really! Perhaps he does; I don't know anything about it. But don't
 let us think of business; it is so tiresome.
 
 Doctor Rank (comes out of HELMER'S study. Before he shuts the door he
 calls to him). No, my dear fellow, I won't disturb you; I would rather
 go in to your wife for a little while. (Shuts the door and sees Mrs.
 LINDE.) I beg your pardon; I am afraid I am disturbing you too.
 
 Nora. No, not at all. (Introducing him). Doctor Rank, Mrs. Linde.
 
 Rank. I have often heard Mrs. Linde's name mentioned here. I think I
 passed you on the stairs when I arrived, Mrs. Linde?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, I go up very slowly; I can't manage stairs well.
 
 Rank. Ah! some slight internal weakness?
 
 Mrs. Linde. No, the fact is I have been overworking myself.
 
 Rank. Nothing more than that? Then I suppose you have come to town to
 amuse yourself with our entertainments?
 
 Mrs. Linde. I have come to look for work.
 
 Rank. Is that a good cure for overwork?
 
 Mrs. Linde. One must live, Doctor Rank.
 
 Rank. Yes, the general opinion seems to be that it is necessary.
 
 Nora. Look here, Doctor Rank--you know you want to live.
 
 Rank. Certainly. However wretched I may feel, I want to prolong the
 agony as long as possible. All my patients are like that. And so are
 those who are morally diseased; one of them, and a bad case too, is at
 this very moment with Helmer--
 
 Mrs. Linde (sadly). Ah!
 
 Nora. Whom do you mean?
 
 Rank. A lawyer of the name of Krogstad, a fellow you don't know at all.
 He suffers from a diseased moral character, Mrs. Helmer; but even he
 began talking of its being highly important that he should live.
 
 Nora. Did he? What did he want to speak to Torvald about?
 
 Rank. I have no idea; I only heard that it was something about the Bank.
 
 Nora. I didn't know this--what's his name--Krogstad had anything to do
 with the Bank.
 
 Rank. Yes, he has some sort of appointment there. (To Mrs. LINDE.) I
 don't know whether you find also in your part of the world that there
 are certain people who go zealously snuffing about to smell out moral
 corruption, and, as soon as they have found some, put the person
 concerned into some lucrative position where they can keep their eye on
 him. Healthy natures are left out in the cold.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Still I think the sick are those who most need taking care
 of.
 
 Rank (shrugging his shoulders). Yes, there you are. That is the
 sentiment that is turning Society into a sick-house.
 
 (NORA, who has been absorbed in her thoughts, breaks out into smothered
 laughter and claps her hands.)
 
 Rank. Why do you laugh at that? Have you any notion what Society really
 is?
 
 Nora. What do I care about tiresome Society? I am laughing at something
 quite different, something extremely amusing. Tell me, Doctor Rank, are
 all the people who are employed in the Bank dependent on Torvald now?
 
 Rank. Is that what you find so extremely amusing?
 
 Nora (smiling and humming). That's my affair! (Walking about the room.)
 It's perfectly glorious to think that we have--that Torvald has so much
 power over so many people. (Takes the packet from her pocket.) Doctor
 Rank, what do you say to a macaroon?
 
 Rank. What, macaroons? I thought they were forbidden here.
 
 Nora. Yes, but these are some Christine gave me.
 
 Mrs. Linde. What! I?--
 
 Nora. Oh, well, don't be alarmed! You couldn't know that Torvald had
 forbidden them. I must tell you that he is afraid they will spoil my
 teeth. But, bah!--once in a way--That's so, isn't it, Doctor Rank? By
 your leave! (Puts a macaroon into his mouth.) You must have one too,
 Christine. And I shall have one, just a little one--or at most two.
 (Walking about.) I am tremendously happy. There is just one thing in the
 world now that I should dearly love to do.
 
 Rank. Well, what is that?
 
 Nora. It's something I should dearly love to say, if Torvald could hear
 me.
 
 Rank. Well, why can't you say it?
 
 Nora. No, I daren't; it's so shocking.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Shocking?
 
 Rank. Well, I should not advise you to say it. Still, with us you might.
 What is it you would so much like to say if Torvald could hear you?
 
 Nora. I should just love to say--Well, I'm damned!
 
 Rank. Are you mad?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Nora, dear--!
 
 Rank. Say it, here he is!
 
 Nora (hiding the packet). Hush! Hush! Hush! (HELMER comes out of his
 room, with his coat over his arm and his hat in his hand.)
 
 Nora. Well, Torvald dear, have you got rid of him?
 
 Helmer. Yes, he has just gone.
 
 Nora. Let me introduce you--this is Christine, who has come to town.
 
 Helmer. Christine--? Excuse me, but I don't know--
 
 Nora. Mrs. Linde, dear; Christine Linde.
 
 Helmer. Of course. A school friend of my wife's, I presume?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, we have known each other since then.
 
 Nora. And just think, she has taken a long journey in order to see you.
 
 Helmer. What do you mean? Mrs. Linde. No, really, I--
 
 Nora. Christine is tremendously clever at book-keeping, and she is
 frightfully anxious to work under some clever man, so as to perfect
 herself--
 
 Helmer. Very sensible, Mrs. Linde.
 
 Nora. And when she heard you had been appointed manager of the Bank--the
 news was telegraphed, you know--she travelled here as quick as
 she could. Torvald, I am sure you will be able to do something for
 Christine, for my sake, won't you?
 
 Helmer. Well, it is not altogether impossible. I presume you are a
 widow, Mrs. Linde?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes.
 
 Helmer. And have had some experience of book-keeping?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, a fair amount.
 
 Helmer. Ah! well, it's very likely I may be able to find something for
 you--
 
 Nora (clapping her hands). What did I tell you? What did I tell you?
 
 Helmer. You have just come at a fortunate moment, Mrs. Linde.
 
 Mrs. Linde. How am I to thank you?
 
 Helmer. There is no need. (Puts on his coat.) But today you must excuse
 me--
 
 Rank. Wait a minute; I will come with you. (Brings his fur coat from the
 hall and warms it at the fire.)
 
 Nora. Don't be long away, Torvald dear.
 
 Helmer. About an hour, not more.
 
 Nora. Are you going too, Christine?
 
 Mrs. Linde (putting on her cloak). Yes, I must go and look for a room.
 
 Helmer. Oh, well then, we can walk down the street together.
 
 Nora (helping her). What a pity it is we are so short of space here; I
 am afraid it is impossible for us--
 
 Mrs. Linde. Please don't think of it! Goodbye, Nora dear, and many
 thanks.
 
 Nora. Goodbye for the present. Of course you will come back this
 evening. And you too, Dr. Rank. What do you say? If you are well enough?
 Oh, you must be! Wrap yourself up well. (They go to the door all talking
 together. Children's voices are heard on the staircase.)
 
 Nora. There they are! There they are! (She runs to open the door. The
 NURSE comes in with the children.) Come in! Come in! (Stoops and kisses
 them.) Oh, you sweet blessings! Look at them, Christine! Aren't they
 darlings?
 
 Rank. Don't let us stand here in the draught.
 
 Helmer. Come along, Mrs. Linde; the place will only be bearable for a
 mother now!
 
 (RANK, HELMER, and Mrs. LINDE go downstairs. The NURSE comes forward
 with the children; NORA shuts the hall door.)
 
 Nora. How fresh and well you look! Such red cheeks like apples and
 roses. (The children all talk at once while she speaks to them.) Have
 you had great fun? That's splendid! What, you pulled both Emmy and Bob
 along on the sledge?--both at once?--that was good. You are a clever
 boy, Ivar. Let me take her for a little, Anne. My sweet little baby
 doll! (Takes the baby from the MAID and dances it up and down.) Yes,
 yes, mother will dance with Bob too. What! Have you been snowballing? I
 wish I had been there too! No, no, I will take their things off, Anne;
 please let me do it, it is such fun. Go in now, you look half frozen.
 There is some hot coffee for you on the stove.
 
 (The NURSE goes into the room on the left. NORA takes off the children's
 things and throws them about, while they all talk to her at once.)
 
 Nora. Really! Did a big dog run after you? But it didn't bite you? No,
 dogs don't bite nice little dolly children. You mustn't look at the
 parcels, Ivar. What are they? Ah, I daresay you would like to know. No,
 no--it's something nasty! Come, let us have a game! What shall we play
 at? Hide and Seek? Yes, we'll play Hide and Seek. Bob shall hide first.
 Must I hide? Very well, I'll hide first. (She and the children laugh
 and shout, and romp in and out of the room; at last NORA hides under the
 table, the children rush in and out for her, but do not see her; they
 hear her smothered laughter, run to the table, lift up the cloth
 and find her. Shouts of laughter. She crawls forward and pretends to
 frighten them. Fresh laughter. Meanwhile there has been a knock at the
 hall door, but none of them has noticed it. The door is half opened, and
 KROGSTAD appears, he waits a little; the game goes on.)
 
 Krogstad. Excuse me, Mrs. Helmer.
 
 Nora (with a stifled cry, turns round and gets up on to her knees). Ah!
 what do you want?
 
 Krogstad. Excuse me, the outer door was ajar; I suppose someone forgot
 to shut it.
 
 Nora (rising). My husband is out, Mr. Krogstad.
 
 Krogstad. I know that.
 
 Nora. What do you want here, then?
 
 Krogstad. A word with you.
 
 Nora. With me?--(To the children, gently.) Go in to nurse. What? No,
 the strange man won't do mother any harm. When he has gone we will have
 another game. (She takes the children into the room on the left, and
 shuts the door after them.) You want to speak to me?
 
 Krogstad. Yes, I do.
 
 Nora. Today? It is not the first of the month yet.
 
 Krogstad. No, it is Christmas Eve, and it will depend on yourself what
 sort of a Christmas you will spend.
 
 Nora. What do you mean? Today it is absolutely impossible for me--
 
 Krogstad. We won't talk about that until later on. This is something
 different. I presume you can give me a moment?
 
 Nora. Yes--yes, I can--although--
 
 Krogstad. Good. I was in Olsen's Restaurant and saw your husband going
 down the street--
 
 Nora. Yes?
 
 Krogstad. With a lady.
 
 Nora. What then?
 
 Krogstad. May I make so bold as to ask if it was a Mrs. Linde?
 
 Nora. It was.
 
 Krogstad. Just arrived in town?
 
 Nora. Yes, today.
 
 Krogstad. She is a great friend of yours, isn't she?
 
 Nora. She is. But I don't see--
 
 Krogstad. I knew her too, once upon a time.
 
 Nora. I am aware of that.
 
 Krogstad. Are you? So you know all about it; I thought as much. Then I
 can ask you, without beating about the bush--is Mrs. Linde to have an
 appointment in the Bank?
 
 Nora. What right have you to question me, Mr. Krogstad?--You, one of
 my husband's subordinates! But since you ask, you shall know. Yes, Mrs.
 Linde is to have an appointment. And it was I who pleaded her cause, Mr.
 Krogstad, let me tell you that.
 
 Krogstad. I was right in what I thought, then.
 
 Nora (walking up and down the stage). Sometimes one has a tiny little
 bit of influence, I should hope. Because one is a woman, it does not
 necessarily follow that--. When anyone is in a subordinate position,
 Mr. Krogstad, they should really be careful to avoid offending anyone
 who--who--
 
 Krogstad. Who has influence?
 
 Nora. Exactly.
 
 Krogstad (changing his tone). Mrs. Helmer, you will be so good as to use
 your influence on my behalf.
 
 Nora. What? What do you mean?
 
 Krogstad. You will be so kind as to see that I am allowed to keep my
 subordinate position in the Bank.
 
 Nora. What do you mean by that? Who proposes to take your post away from
 you?
 
 Krogstad. Oh, there is no necessity to keep up the pretence of
 ignorance. I can quite understand that your friend is not very anxious
 to expose herself to the chance of rubbing shoulders with me; and I
 quite understand, too, whom I have to thank for being turned off.
 
 Nora. But I assure you--
 
 Krogstad. Very likely; but, to come to the point, the time has come when
 I should advise you to use your influence to prevent that.
 
 Nora. But, Mr. Krogstad, I have no influence.
 
 Krogstad. Haven't you? I thought you said yourself just now--
 
 Nora. Naturally I did not mean you to put that construction on it. I!
 What should make you think I have any influence of that kind with my
 husband?
 
 Krogstad. Oh, I have known your husband from our student days. I don't
 suppose he is any more unassailable than other husbands.
 
 Nora. If you speak slightingly of my husband, I shall turn you out of
 the house.
 
 Krogstad. You are bold, Mrs. Helmer.
 
 Nora. I am not afraid of you any longer. As soon as the New Year comes,
 I shall in a very short time be free of the whole thing.
 
 Krogstad (controlling himself). Listen to me, Mrs. Helmer. If necessary,
 I am prepared to fight for my small post in the Bank as if I were
 fighting for my life.
 
 Nora. So it seems.
 
 Krogstad. It is not only for the sake of the money; indeed, that weighs
 least with me in the matter. There is another reason--well, I may as
 well tell you. My position is this. I daresay you know, like everybody
 else, that once, many years ago, I was guilty of an indiscretion.
 
 Nora. I think I have heard something of the kind.
 
 Krogstad. The matter never came into court; but every way seemed to be
 closed to me after that. So I took to the business that you know of. I
 had to do something; and, honestly, I don't think I've been one of the
 worst. But now I must cut myself free from all that. My sons are growing
 up; for their sake I must try and win back as much respect as I can in
 the town. This post in the Bank was like the first step up for me--and
 now your husband is going to kick me downstairs again into the mud.
 
 Nora. But you must believe me, Mr. Krogstad; it is not in my power to
 help you at all.
 
 Krogstad. Then it is because you haven't the will; but I have means to
 compel you.
 
 Nora. You don't mean that you will tell my husband that I owe you money?
 
 Krogstad. Hm!--suppose I were to tell him?
 
 Nora. It would be perfectly infamous of you. (Sobbing.) To think of his
 learning my secret, which has been my joy and pride, in such an ugly,
 clumsy way--that he should learn it from you! And it would put me in a
 horribly disagreeable position--
 
 Krogstad. Only disagreeable?
 
 Nora (impetuously). Well, do it, then!--and it will be the worse for
 you. My husband will see for himself what a blackguard you are, and you
 certainly won't keep your post then.
 
 Krogstad. I asked you if it was only a disagreeable scene at home that
 you were afraid of?
 
 Nora. If my husband does get to know of it, of course he will at once
 pay you what is still owing, and we shall have nothing more to do with
 you.
 
 Krogstad (coming a step nearer). Listen to me, Mrs. Helmer. Either you
 have a very bad memory or you know very little of business. I shall be
 obliged to remind you of a few details.
 
 Nora. What do you mean?
 
 Krogstad. When your husband was ill, you came to me to borrow two
 hundred and fifty pounds.
 
 Nora. I didn't know anyone else to go to.
 
 Krogstad. I promised to get you that amount--
 
 Nora. Yes, and you did so.
 
 Krogstad. I promised to get you that amount, on certain conditions.
 Your mind was so taken up with your husband's illness, and you were so
 anxious to get the money for your journey, that you seem to have paid
 no attention to the conditions of our bargain. Therefore it will not be
 amiss if I remind you of them. Now, I promised to get the money on the
 security of a bond which I drew up.
 
 Nora. Yes, and which I signed.
 
 Krogstad. Good. But below your signature there were a few lines
 constituting your father a surety for the money; those lines your father
 should have signed.
 
 Nora. Should? He did sign them.
 
 Krogstad. I had left the date blank; that is to say, your father should
 himself have inserted the date on which he signed the paper. Do you
 remember that?
 
 Nora. Yes, I think I remember--
 
 Krogstad. Then I gave you the bond to send by post to your father. Is
 that not so?
 
 Nora. Yes.
 
 Krogstad. And you naturally did so at once, because five or six days
 afterwards you brought me the bond with your father's signature. And
 then I gave you the money.
 
 Nora. Well, haven't I been paying it off regularly?
 
 Krogstad. Fairly so, yes. But--to come back to the matter in hand--that
 must have been a very trying time for you, Mrs. Helmer?
 
 Nora. It was, indeed.
 
 Krogstad. Your father was very ill, wasn't he?
 
 Nora. He was very near his end.
 
 Krogstad. And died soon afterwards?
 
 Nora. Yes.
 
 Krogstad. Tell me, Mrs. Helmer, can you by any chance remember what day
 your father died?--on what day of the month, I mean.
 
 Nora. Papa died on the 29th of September.
 
 Krogstad. That is correct; I have ascertained it for myself. And, as
 that is so, there is a discrepancy (taking a paper from his pocket)
 which I cannot account for.
 
 Nora. What discrepancy? I don't know--
 
 Krogstad. The discrepancy consists, Mrs. Helmer, in the fact that your
 father signed this bond three days after his death.
 
 Nora. What do you mean? I don't understand--
 
 Krogstad. Your father died on the 29th of September. But, look here;
 your father has dated his signature the 2nd of October. It is a
 discrepancy, isn't it? (NORA is silent.) Can you explain it to me? (NORA
 is still silent.) It is a remarkable thing, too, that the words "2nd
 of October," as well as the year, are not written in your father's
 handwriting but in one that I think I know. Well, of course it can be
 explained; your father may have forgotten to date his signature, and
 someone else may have dated it haphazard before they knew of his death.
 There is no harm in that. It all depends on the signature of the name;
 and that is genuine, I suppose, Mrs. Helmer? It was your father himself
 who signed his name here?
 
 Nora (after a short pause, throws her head up and looks defiantly at
 him). No, it was not. It was I that wrote papa's name.
 
 Krogstad. Are you aware that is a dangerous confession?
 
 Nora. In what way? You shall have your money soon.
 
 Krogstad. Let me ask you a question; why did you not send the paper to
 your father?
 
 Nora. It was impossible; papa was so ill. If I had asked him for his
 signature, I should have had to tell him what the money was to be
 used for; and when he was so ill himself I couldn't tell him that my
 husband's life was in danger--it was impossible.
 
 Krogstad. It would have been better for you if you had given up your
 trip abroad.
 
 Nora. No, that was impossible. That trip was to save my husband's life;
 I couldn't give that up.
 
 Krogstad. But did it never occur to you that you were committing a fraud
 on me?
 
 Nora. I couldn't take that into account; I didn't trouble myself about
 you at all. I couldn't bear you, because you put so many heartless
 difficulties in my way, although you knew what a dangerous condition my
 husband was in.
 
 Krogstad. Mrs. Helmer, you evidently do not realise clearly what it is
 that you have been guilty of. But I can assure you that my one false
 step, which lost me all my reputation, was nothing more or nothing worse
 than what you have done.
 
 Nora. You? Do you ask me to believe that you were brave enough to run a
 risk to save your wife's life?
 
 Krogstad. The law cares nothing about motives.
 
 Nora. Then it must be a very foolish law.
 
 Krogstad. Foolish or not, it is the law by which you will be judged, if
 I produce this paper in court.
 
 Nora. I don't believe it. Is a daughter not to be allowed to spare her
 dying father anxiety and care? Is a wife not to be allowed to save her
 husband's life? I don't know much about law; but I am certain that there
 must be laws permitting such things as that. Have you no knowledge of
 such laws--you who are a lawyer? You must be a very poor lawyer, Mr.
 Krogstad.
 
 Krogstad. Maybe. But matters of business--such business as you and I
 have had together--do you think I don't understand that? Very well. Do
 as you please. But let me tell you this--if I lose my position a second
 time, you shall lose yours with me. (He bows, and goes out through the
 hall.)
 
 Nora (appears buried in thought for a short time, then tosses her head).
 Nonsense! Trying to frighten me like that!--I am not so silly as he
 thinks. (Begins to busy herself putting the children's things in order.)
 And yet--? No, it's impossible! I did it for love's sake.
 
 The Children (in the doorway on the left). Mother, the stranger man has
 gone out through the gate.
 
 Nora. Yes, dears, I know. But, don't tell anyone about the stranger man.
 Do you hear? Not even papa.
 
 Children. No, mother; but will you come and play again?
 
 Nora. No, no,--not now.
 
 Children. But, mother, you promised us.
 
 Nora. Yes, but I can't now. Run away in; I have such a lot to do. Run
 away in, my sweet little darlings. (She gets them into the room by
 degrees and shuts the door on them; then sits down on the sofa, takes
 up a piece of needlework and sews a few stitches, but soon stops.) No!
 (Throws down the work, gets up, goes to the hall door and calls out.)
 Helen! bring the Tree in. (Goes to the table on the left, opens a
 drawer, and stops again.) No, no! it is quite impossible!
 
 Maid (coming in with the Tree). Where shall I put it, ma'am?
 
 Nora. Here, in the middle of the floor.
 
 Maid. Shall I get you anything else?
 
 Nora. No, thank you. I have all I want. [Exit MAID.]
 
 Nora (begins dressing the tree). A candle here-and flowers here--The
 horrible man! It's all nonsense--there's nothing wrong. The tree
 shall be splendid! I will do everything I can think of to please you,
 Torvald!--I will sing for you, dance for you--(HELMER comes in with some
 papers under his arm.) Oh! are you back already?
 
 Helmer. Yes. Has anyone been here?
 
 Nora. Here? No.
 
 Helmer. That is strange. I saw Krogstad going out of the gate.
 
 Nora. Did you? Oh yes, I forgot, Krogstad was here for a moment.
 
 Helmer. Nora, I can see from your manner that he has been here begging
 you to say a good word for him.
 
 Nora. Yes.
 
 Helmer. And you were to appear to do it of your own accord; you were to
 conceal from me the fact of his having been here; didn't he beg that of
 you too?
 
 Nora. Yes, Torvald, but--
 
 Helmer. Nora, Nora, and you would be a party to that sort of thing? To
 have any talk with a man like that, and give him any sort of promise?
 And to tell me a lie into the bargain?
 
 Nora. A lie--?
 
 Helmer. Didn't you tell me no one had been here? (Shakes his finger at
 her.) My little songbird must never do that again. A songbird must have
 a clean beak to chirp with--no false notes! (Puts his arm round her
 waist.) That is so, isn't it? Yes, I am sure it is. (Lets her go.) We
 will say no more about it. (Sits down by the stove.) How warm and snug
 it is here! (Turns over his papers.)
 
 Nora (after a short pause, during which she busies herself with the
 Christmas Tree.) Torvald!
 
 Helmer. Yes.
 
 Nora. I am looking forward tremendously to the fancy-dress ball at the
 Stenborgs' the day after tomorrow.
 
 Helmer. And I am tremendously curious to see what you are going to
 surprise me with.
 
 Nora. It was very silly of me to want to do that.
 
 Helmer. What do you mean?
 
 Nora. I can't hit upon anything that will do; everything I think of
 seems so silly and insignificant.
 
 Helmer. Does my little Nora acknowledge that at last?
 
 Nora (standing behind his chair with her arms on the back of it). Are
 you very busy, Torvald?
 
 Helmer. Well--
 
 Nora. What are all those papers?
 
 Helmer. Bank business.
 
 Nora. Already?
 
 Helmer. I have got authority from the retiring manager to undertake the
 necessary changes in the staff and in the rearrangement of the work; and
 I must make use of the Christmas week for that, so as to have everything
 in order for the new year.
 
 Nora. Then that was why this poor Krogstad--
 
 Helmer. Hm!
 
 Nora (leans against the back of his chair and strokes his hair). If you
 hadn't been so busy I should have asked you a tremendously big favour,
 Torvald.
 
 Helmer. What is that? Tell me.
 
 Nora. There is no one has such good taste as you. And I do so want to
 look nice at the fancy-dress ball. Torvald, couldn't you take me in hand
 and decide what I shall go as, and what sort of a dress I shall wear?
 
 Helmer. Aha! so my obstinate little woman is obliged to get someone to
 come to her rescue?
 
 Nora. Yes, Torvald, I can't get along a bit without your help.
 
 Helmer. Very well, I will think it over, we shall manage to hit upon
 something.
 
 Nora. That is nice of you. (Goes to the Christmas Tree. A short pause.)
 How pretty the red flowers look--. But, tell me, was it really something
 very bad that this Krogstad was guilty of?
 
 Helmer. He forged someone's name. Have you any idea what that means?
 
 Nora. Isn't it possible that he was driven to do it by necessity?
 
 Helmer. Yes; or, as in so many cases, by imprudence. I am not so
 heartless as to condemn a man altogether because of a single false step
 of that kind.
 
 Nora. No, you wouldn't, would you, Torvald?
 
 Helmer. Many a man has been able to retrieve his character, if he has
 openly confessed his fault and taken his punishment.
 
 Nora. Punishment--?
 
 Helmer. But Krogstad did nothing of that sort; he got himself out of it
 by a cunning trick, and that is why he has gone under altogether.
 
 Nora. But do you think it would--?
 
 Helmer. Just think how a guilty man like that has to lie and play the
 hypocrite with every one, how he has to wear a mask in the presence of
 those near and dear to him, even before his own wife and children. And
 about the children--that is the most terrible part of it all, Nora.
 
 Nora. How?
 
 Helmer. Because such an atmosphere of lies infects and poisons the whole
 life of a home. Each breath the children take in such a house is full of
 the germs of evil.
 
 Nora (coming nearer him). Are you sure of that?
 
 Helmer. My dear, I have often seen it in the course of my life as a
 lawyer. Almost everyone who has gone to the bad early in life has had a
 deceitful mother.
 
 Nora. Why do you only say--mother?
 
 Helmer. It seems most commonly to be the mother's influence, though
 naturally a bad father's would have the same result. Every lawyer
 is familiar with the fact. This Krogstad, now, has been persistently
 poisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation; that is why I
 say he has lost all moral character. (Holds out his hands to her.) That
 is why my sweet little Nora must promise me not to plead his cause. Give
 me your hand on it. Come, come, what is this? Give me your hand. There
 now, that's settled. I assure you it would be quite impossible for me to
 work with him; I literally feel physically ill when I am in the company
 of such people.
 
 Nora (takes her hand out of his and goes to the opposite side of the
 Christmas Tree). How hot it is in here; and I have such a lot to do.
 
 Helmer (getting up and putting his papers in order). Yes, and I must
 try and read through some of these before dinner; and I must think about
 your costume, too. And it is just possible I may have something ready
 in gold paper to hang up on the Tree. (Puts his hand on her head.) My
 precious little singing-bird! (He goes into his room and shuts the door
 after him.)
 
 Nora (after a pause, whispers). No, no--it isn't true. It's impossible;
 it must be impossible.
 
 (The NURSE opens the door on the left.)
 
 Nurse. The little ones are begging so hard to be allowed to come in to
 mamma.
 
 Nora. No, no, no! Don't let them come in to me! You stay with them,
 Anne.
 
 Nurse. Very well, ma'am. (Shuts the door.)
 
 Nora (pale with terror). Deprave my little children? Poison my home? (A
 short pause. Then she tosses her head.) It's not true. It can't possibly
 be true.
 
 
 
 
 ACT II
 
 (THE SAME SCENE.--THE Christmas Tree is in the corner by the piano,
 stripped of its ornaments and with burnt-down candle-ends on its
 dishevelled branches. NORA'S cloak and hat are lying on the sofa. She
 is alone in the room, walking about uneasily. She stops by the sofa and
 takes up her cloak.)
 
 Nora (drops her cloak). Someone is coming now! (Goes to the door and
 listens.) No--it is no one. Of course, no one will come today, Christmas
 Day--nor tomorrow either. But, perhaps--(opens the door and looks out).
 No, nothing in the letterbox; it is quite empty. (Comes forward.)
 What rubbish! of course he can't be in earnest about it. Such a thing
 couldn't happen; it is impossible--I have three little children.
 
 (Enter the NURSE from the room on the left, carrying a big cardboard
 box.)
 
 Nurse. At last I have found the box with the fancy dress.
 
 Nora. Thanks; put it on the table.
 
 Nurse (doing so). But it is very much in want of mending.
 
 Nora. I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.
 
 Nurse. What an idea! It can easily be put in order--just a little
 patience.
 
 Nora. Yes, I will go and get Mrs. Linde to come and help me with it.
 
 Nurse. What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold,
 ma'am, and make yourself ill.
 
 Nora. Well, worse than that might happen. How are the children?
 
 Nurse. The poor little souls are playing with their Christmas presents,
 but--
 
 Nora. Do they ask much for me?
 
 Nurse. You see, they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them.
 
 Nora. Yes, but, nurse, I shall not be able to be so much with them now
 as I was before.
 
 Nurse. Oh well, young children easily get accustomed to anything.
 
 Nora. Do you think so? Do you think they would forget their mother if
 she went away altogether?
 
 Nurse. Good heavens!--went away altogether?
 
 Nora. Nurse, I want you to tell me something I have often wondered
 about--how could you have the heart to put your own child out among
 strangers?
 
 Nurse. I was obliged to, if I wanted to be little Nora's nurse.
 
 Nora. Yes, but how could you be willing to do it?
 
 Nurse. What, when I was going to get such a good place by it? A poor
 girl who has got into trouble should be glad to. Besides, that wicked
 man didn't do a single thing for me.
 
 Nora. But I suppose your daughter has quite forgotten you.
 
 Nurse. No, indeed she hasn't. She wrote to me when she was confirmed,
 and when she was married.
 
 Nora (putting her arms round her neck). Dear old Anne, you were a good
 mother to me when I was little.
 
 Nurse. Little Nora, poor dear, had no other mother but me. Nora. And if
 my little ones had no other mother, I am sure you would--What nonsense
 I am talking! (Opens the box.) Go in to them. Now I must--. You will see
 tomorrow how charming I shall look.
 
 Nurse. I am sure there will be no one at the ball so charming as you,
 ma'am. (Goes into the room on the left.)
 
 Nora (begins to unpack the box, but soon pushes it away from her). If
 only I dared go out. If only no one would come. If only I could be sure
 nothing would happen here in the meantime. Stuff and nonsense! No one
 will come. Only I mustn't think about it. I will brush my muff. What
 lovely, lovely gloves! Out of my thoughts, out of my thoughts! One,
 two, three, four, five, six-- (Screams.) Ah! there is someone coming--.
 (Makes a movement towards the door, but stands irresolute.)
 
 (Enter MRS. LINDE from the hall, where she has taken off her cloak and
 hat.)
 
 Nora. Oh, it's you, Christine. There is no one else out there, is there?
 How good of you to come!
 
 Mrs. Linde. I heard you were up asking for me.
 
 Nora. Yes, I was passing by. As a matter of fact, it is something
 you could help me with. Let us sit down here on the sofa. Look here.
 Tomorrow evening there is to be a fancy-dress ball at the Stenborgs',
 who live above us; and Torvald wants me to go as a Neapolitan
 fisher-girl, and dance the Tarantella that I learned at Capri.
 
 Mrs. Linde. I see; you are going to keep up the character.
 
 Nora. Yes, Torvald wants me to. Look, here is the dress; Torvald had it
 made for me there, but now it is all so torn, and I haven't any idea--
 
 Mrs. Linde. We will easily put that right. It is only some of the
 trimming come unsewn here and there. Needle and thread? Now then, that's
 all we want.
 
 Nora. It is nice of you.
 
 Mrs. Linde (sewing). So you are going to be dressed up tomorrow Nora.
 I will tell you what--I shall come in for a moment and see you in
 your fine feathers. But I have completely forgotten to thank you for a
 delightful evening yesterday.
 
 Nora (gets up, and crosses the stage). Well, I don't think yesterday was
 as pleasant as usual. You ought to have come to town a little earlier,
 Christine. Certainly Torvald does understand how to make a house dainty
 and attractive.
 
 Mrs. Linde. And so do you, it seems to me; you are not your father's
 daughter for nothing. But tell me, is Doctor Rank always as depressed as
 he was yesterday?
 
 Nora. No; yesterday it was very noticeable. I must tell you that he
 suffers from a very dangerous disease. He has consumption of the spine,
 poor creature. His father was a horrible man who committed all sorts
 of excesses; and that is why his son was sickly from childhood, do you
 understand?
 
 Mrs. Linde (dropping her sewing). But, my dearest Nora, how do you know
 anything about such things?
 
 Nora (walking about). Pooh! When you have three children, you get visits
 now and then from--from married women, who know something of medical
 matters, and they talk about one thing and another.
 
 Mrs. Linde (goes on sewing. A short silence). Does Doctor Rank come here
 everyday?
 
 Nora. Everyday regularly. He is Torvald's most intimate friend, and a
 great friend of mine too. He is just like one of the family.
 
 Mrs. Linde. But tell me this--is he perfectly sincere? I mean, isn't he
 the kind of man that is very anxious to make himself agreeable?
 
 Nora. Not in the least. What makes you think that?
 
 Mrs. Linde. When you introduced him to me yesterday, he declared he had
 often heard my name mentioned in this house; but afterwards I noticed
 that your husband hadn't the slightest idea who I was. So how could
 Doctor Rank--?
 
 Nora. That is quite right, Christine. Torvald is so absurdly fond of me
 that he wants me absolutely to himself, as he says. At first he used
 to seem almost jealous if I mentioned any of the dear folk at home, so
 naturally I gave up doing so. But I often talk about such things with
 Doctor Rank, because he likes hearing about them.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Listen to me, Nora. You are still very like a child in many
 things, and I am older than you in many ways and have a little more
 experience. Let me tell you this--you ought to make an end of it with
 Doctor Rank.
 
 Nora. What ought I to make an end of?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Of two things, I think. Yesterday you talked some nonsense
 about a rich admirer who was to leave you money--
 
 Nora. An admirer who doesn't exist, unfortunately! But what then?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Is Doctor Rank a man of means?
 
 Nora. Yes, he is.
 
 Mrs. Linde. And has no one to provide for?
 
 Nora. No, no one; but--
 
 Mrs. Linde. And comes here everyday?
 
 Nora. Yes, I told you so.
 
 Mrs. Linde. But how can this well-bred man be so tactless?
 
 Nora. I don't understand you at all.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Don't prevaricate, Nora. Do you suppose I don't guess who
 lent you the two hundred and fifty pounds?
 
 Nora. Are you out of your senses? How can you think of such a thing! A
 friend of ours, who comes here everyday! Do you realise what a horribly
 painful position that would be?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Then it really isn't he?
 
 Nora. No, certainly not. It would never have entered into my head for
 a moment. Besides, he had no money to lend then; he came into his money
 afterwards.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Well, I think that was lucky for you, my dear Nora.
 
 Nora. No, it would never have come into my head to ask Doctor Rank.
 Although I am quite sure that if I had asked him--
 
 Mrs. Linde. But of course you won't.
 
 Nora. Of course not. I have no reason to think it could possibly be
 necessary. But I am quite sure that if I told Doctor Rank--
 
 Mrs. Linde. Behind your husband's back?
 
 Nora. I must make an end of it with the other one, and that will be
 behind his back too. I must make an end of it with him.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, that is what I told you yesterday, but--
 
 Nora (walking up and down). A man can put a thing like that straight
 much easier than a woman--
 
 Mrs. Linde. One's husband, yes.
 
 Nora. Nonsense! (Standing still.) When you pay off a debt you get your
 bond back, don't you?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, as a matter of course.
 
 Nora. And can tear it into a hundred thousand pieces, and burn it
 up--the nasty dirty paper!
 
 Mrs. Linde (looks hard at her, lays down her sewing and gets up slowly).
 Nora, you are concealing something from me.
 
 Nora. Do I look as if I were?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Something has happened to you since yesterday morning. Nora,
 what is it?
 
 Nora (going nearer to her). Christine! (Listens.) Hush! there's Torvald
 come home. Do you mind going in to the children for the present? Torvald
 can't bear to see dressmaking going on. Let Anne help you.
 
 Mrs. Linde (gathering some of the things together). Certainly--but I am
 not going away from here until we have had it out with one another. (She
 goes into the room on the left, as HELMER comes in from the hall.)
 
 Nora (going up to HELMER). I have wanted you so much, Torvald dear.
 
 Helmer. Was that the dressmaker?
 
 Nora. No, it was Christine; she is helping me to put my dress in order.
 You will see I shall look quite smart.
 
 Helmer. Wasn't that a happy thought of mine, now?
 
 Nora. Splendid! But don't you think it is nice of me, too, to do as you
 wish?
 
 Helmer. Nice?--because you do as your husband wishes? Well, well, you
 little rogue, I am sure you did not mean it in that way. But I am
 not going to disturb you; you will want to be trying on your dress, I
 expect.
 
 Nora. I suppose you are going to work.
 
 Helmer. Yes. (Shows her a bundle of papers.) Look at that. I have just
 been into the bank. (Turns to go into his room.)
 
 Nora. Torvald.
 
 Helmer. Yes.
 
 Nora. If your little squirrel were to ask you for something very, very
 prettily--?
 
 Helmer. What then?
 
 Nora. Would you do it?
 
 Helmer. I should like to hear what it is, first.
 
 Nora. Your squirrel would run about and do all her tricks if you would
 be nice, and do what she wants.
 
 Helmer. Speak plainly.
 
 Nora. Your skylark would chirp about in every room, with her song rising
 and falling--
 
 Helmer. Well, my skylark does that anyhow.
 
 Nora. I would play the fairy and dance for you in the moonlight,
 Torvald.
 
 Helmer. Nora--you surely don't mean that request you made to me this
 morning?
 
 Nora (going near him). Yes, Torvald, I beg you so earnestly--
 
 Helmer. Have you really the courage to open up that question again?
 
 Nora. Yes, dear, you must do as I ask; you must let Krogstad keep his
 post in the bank.
 
 Helmer. My dear Nora, it is his post that I have arranged Mrs. Linde
 shall have.
 
 Nora. Yes, you have been awfully kind about that; but you could just as
 well dismiss some other clerk instead of Krogstad.
 
 Helmer. This is simply incredible obstinacy! Because you chose to give
 him a thoughtless promise that you would speak for him, I am expected
 to--
 
 Nora. That isn't the reason, Torvald. It is for your own sake. This
 fellow writes in the most scurrilous newspapers; you have told me so
 yourself. He can do you an unspeakable amount of harm. I am frightened
 to death of him--
 
 Helmer. Ah, I understand; it is recollections of the past that scare
 you.
 
 Nora. What do you mean?
 
 Helmer. Naturally you are thinking of your father.
 
 Nora. Yes--yes, of course. Just recall to your mind what these malicious
 creatures wrote in the papers about papa, and how horribly they
 slandered him. I believe they would have procured his dismissal if the
 Department had not sent you over to inquire into it, and if you had not
 been so kindly disposed and helpful to him.
 
 Helmer. My little Nora, there is an important difference between your
 father and me. Your father's reputation as a public official was not
 above suspicion. Mine is, and I hope it will continue to be so, as long
 as I hold my office.
 
 Nora. You never can tell what mischief these men may contrive. We ought
 to be so well off, so snug and happy here in our peaceful home, and have
 no cares--you and I and the children, Torvald! That is why I beg you so
 earnestly--
 
 Helmer. And it is just by interceding for him that you make it
 impossible for me to keep him. It is already known at the Bank that I
 mean to dismiss Krogstad. Is it to get about now that the new manager
 has changed his mind at his wife's bidding--
 
 Nora. And what if it did?
 
 Helmer. Of course!--if only this obstinate little person can get her
 way! Do you suppose I am going to make myself ridiculous before my whole
 staff, to let people think that I am a man to be swayed by all sorts of
 outside influence? I should very soon feel the consequences of it, I can
 tell you! And besides, there is one thing that makes it quite impossible
 for me to have Krogstad in the Bank as long as I am manager.
 
 Nora. Whatever is that?
 
 Helmer. His moral failings I might perhaps have overlooked, if
 necessary--
 
 Nora. Yes, you could--couldn't you?
 
 Helmer. And I hear he is a good worker, too. But I knew him when we
 were boys. It was one of those rash friendships that so often prove an
 incubus in afterlife. I may as well tell you plainly, we were once on
 very intimate terms with one another. But this tactless fellow lays no
 restraint on himself when other people are present. On the contrary,
 he thinks it gives him the right to adopt a familiar tone with me, and
 every minute it is "I say, Helmer, old fellow!" and that sort of thing.
 I assure you it is extremely painful for me. He would make my position
 in the Bank intolerable.
 
 Nora. Torvald, I don't believe you mean that.
 
 Helmer. Don't you? Why not?
 
 Nora. Because it is such a narrow-minded way of looking at things.
 
 Helmer. What are you saying? Narrow-minded? Do you think I am
 narrow-minded?
 
 Nora. No, just the opposite, dear--and it is exactly for that reason.
 
 Helmer. It's the same thing. You say my point of view is narrow-minded,
 so I must be so too. Narrow-minded! Very well--I must put an end to
 this. (Goes to the hall door and calls.) Helen!
 
 Nora. What are you going to do?
 
 Helmer (looking among his papers). Settle it. (Enter MAID.) Look here;
 take this letter and go downstairs with it at once. Find a messenger and
 tell him to deliver it, and be quick. The address is on it, and here is
 the money.
 
 Maid. Very well, sir. (Exit with the letter.)
 
 Helmer (putting his papers together). Now then, little Miss Obstinate.
 
 Nora (breathlessly). Torvald--what was that letter?
 
 Helmer. Krogstad's dismissal.
 
 Nora. Call her back, Torvald! There is still time. Oh Torvald, call her
 back! Do it for my sake--for your own sake--for the children's sake! Do
 you hear me, Torvald? Call her back! You don't know what that letter can
 bring upon us.
 
 Helmer. It's too late.
 
 Nora. Yes, it's too late.
 
 Helmer. My dear Nora, I can forgive the anxiety you are in, although
 really it is an insult to me. It is, indeed. Isn't it an insult to think
 that I should be afraid of a starving quill-driver's vengeance? But I
 forgive you nevertheless, because it is such eloquent witness to your
 great love for me. (Takes her in his arms.) And that is as it should be,
 my own darling Nora. Come what will, you may be sure I shall have both
 courage and strength if they be needed. You will see I am man enough to
 take everything upon myself.
 
 Nora (in a horror-stricken voice). What do you mean by that?
 
 Helmer. Everything, I say--
 
 Nora (recovering herself). You will never have to do that.
 
 Helmer. That's right. Well, we will share it, Nora, as man and wife
 should. That is how it shall be. (Caressing her.) Are you content now?
 There! There!--not these frightened dove's eyes! The whole thing is only
 the wildest fancy!--Now, you must go and play through the Tarantella and
 practise with your tambourine. I shall go into the inner office and shut
 the door, and I shall hear nothing; you can make as much noise as you
 please. (Turns back at the door.) And when Rank comes, tell him where he
 will find me. (Nods to her, takes his papers and goes into his room, and
 shuts the door after him.)
 
 Nora (bewildered with anxiety, stands as if rooted to the spot, and
 whispers). He was capable of doing it. He will do it. He will do it in
 spite of everything.--No, not that! Never, never! Anything rather than
 that! Oh, for some help, some way out of it! (The door-bell rings.)
 Doctor Rank! Anything rather than that--anything, whatever it is! (She
 puts her hands over her face, pulls herself together, goes to the door
 and opens it. RANK is standing without, hanging up his coat. During the
 following dialogue it begins to grow dark.)
 
 Nora. Good day, Doctor Rank. I knew your ring. But you mustn't go in to
 Torvald now; I think he is busy with something.
 
 Rank. And you?
 
 Nora (brings him in and shuts the door after him). Oh, you know very
 well I always have time for you.
 
 Rank. Thank you. I shall make use of as much of it as I can.
 
 Nora. What do you mean by that? As much of it as you can?
 
 Rank. Well, does that alarm you?
 
 Nora. It was such a strange way of putting it. Is anything likely to
 happen?
 
 Rank. Nothing but what I have long been prepared for. But I certainly
 didn't expect it to happen so soon.
 
 Nora (gripping him by the arm). What have you found out? Doctor Rank,
 you must tell me.
 
 Rank (sitting down by the stove). It is all up with me. And it can't be
 helped.
 
 Nora (with a sigh of relief). Is it about yourself?
 
 Rank. Who else? It is no use lying to one's self. I am the most wretched
 of all my patients, Mrs. Helmer. Lately I have been taking stock of my
 internal economy. Bankrupt! Probably within a month I shall lie rotting
 in the churchyard.
 
 Nora. What an ugly thing to say!
 
 Rank. The thing itself is cursedly ugly, and the worst of it is that I
 shall have to face so much more that is ugly before that. I shall only
 make one more examination of myself; when I have done that, I shall know
 pretty certainly when it will be that the horrors of dissolution will
 begin. There is something I want to tell you. Helmer's refined nature
 gives him an unconquerable disgust at everything that is ugly; I won't
 have him in my sick-room.
 
 Nora. Oh, but, Doctor Rank--
 
 Rank. I won't have him there. Not on any account. I bar my door to him.
 As soon as I am quite certain that the worst has come, I shall send
 you my card with a black cross on it, and then you will know that the
 loathsome end has begun.
 
 Nora. You are quite absurd today. And I wanted you so much to be in a
 really good humour.
 
 Rank. With death stalking beside me?--To have to pay this penalty for
 another man's sin? Is there any justice in that? And in every single
 family, in one way or another, some such inexorable retribution is being
 exacted--
 
 Nora (putting her hands over her ears). Rubbish! Do talk of something
 cheerful.
 
 Rank. Oh, it's a mere laughing matter, the whole thing. My poor innocent
 spine has to suffer for my father's youthful amusements.
 
 Nora (sitting at the table on the left). I suppose you mean that he was
 too partial to asparagus and pate de foie gras, don't you?
 
 Rank. Yes, and to truffles.
 
 Nora. Truffles, yes. And oysters too, I suppose?
 
 Rank. Oysters, of course, that goes without saying.
 
 Nora. And heaps of port and champagne. It is sad that all these nice
 things should take their revenge on our bones.
 
 Rank. Especially that they should revenge themselves on the unlucky
 bones of those who have not had the satisfaction of enjoying them.
 
 Nora. Yes, that's the saddest part of it all.
 
 Rank (with a searching look at her). Hm!--
 
 Nora (after a short pause). Why did you smile?
 
 Rank. No, it was you that laughed.
 
 Nora. No, it was you that smiled, Doctor Rank!
 
 Rank (rising). You are a greater rascal than I thought.
 
 Nora. I am in a silly mood today.
 
 Rank. So it seems.
 
 Nora (putting her hands on his shoulders). Dear, dear Doctor Rank, death
 mustn't take you away from Torvald and me.
 
 Rank. It is a loss you would easily recover from. Those who are gone are
 soon forgotten.
 
 Nora (looking at him anxiously). Do you believe that?
 
 Rank. People form new ties, and then--
 
 Nora. Who will form new ties?
 
 Rank. Both you and Helmer, when I am gone. You yourself are already on
 the high road to it, I think. What did that Mrs. Linde want here last
 night?
 
 Nora. Oho!--you don't mean to say you are jealous of poor Christine?
 
 Rank. Yes, I am. She will be my successor in this house. When I am done
 for, this woman will--
 
 Nora. Hush! don't speak so loud. She is in that room.
 
 Rank. Today again. There, you see.
 
 Nora. She has only come to sew my dress for me. Bless my soul, how
 unreasonable you are! (Sits down on the sofa.) Be nice now, Doctor Rank,
 and tomorrow you will see how beautifully I shall dance, and you can
 imagine I am doing it all for you--and for Torvald too, of course.
 (Takes various things out of the box.) Doctor Rank, come and sit down
 here, and I will show you something.
 
 Rank (sitting down). What is it?
 
 Nora. Just look at those!
 
 Rank. Silk stockings.
 
 Nora. Flesh-coloured. Aren't they lovely? It is so dark here now, but
 tomorrow--. No, no, no! you must only look at the feet. Oh well, you may
 have leave to look at the legs too.
 
 Rank. Hm!--Nora. Why are you looking so critical? Don't you think they
 will fit me?
 
 Rank. I have no means of forming an opinion about that.
 
 Nora (looks at him for a moment). For shame! (Hits him lightly on the
 ear with the stockings.) That's to punish you. (Folds them up again.)
 
 Rank. And what other nice things am I to be allowed to see?
 
 Nora. Not a single thing more, for being so naughty. (She looks among
 the things, humming to herself.)
 
 Rank (after a short silence). When I am sitting here, talking to you as
 intimately as this, I cannot imagine for a moment what would have become
 of me if I had never come into this house.
 
 Nora (smiling). I believe you do feel thoroughly at home with us.
 
 Rank (in a lower voice, looking straight in front of him). And to be
 obliged to leave it all--
 
 Nora. Nonsense, you are not going to leave it.
 
 Rank (as before). And not be able to leave behind one the slightest
 token of one's gratitude, scarcely even a fleeting regret--nothing but
 an empty place which the first comer can fill as well as any other.
 
 Nora. And if I asked you now for a--? No!
 
 Rank. For what?
 
 Nora. For a big proof of your friendship--
 
 Rank. Yes, yes!
 
 Nora. I mean a tremendously big favour--
 
 Rank. Would you really make me so happy for once?
 
 Nora. Ah, but you don't know what it is yet.
 
 Rank. No--but tell me.
 
 Nora. I really can't, Doctor Rank. It is something out of all reason; it
 means advice, and help, and a favour--
 
 Rank. The bigger a thing it is the better. I can't conceive what it is
 you mean. Do tell me. Haven't I your confidence?
 
 Nora. More than anyone else. I know you are my truest and best friend,
 and so I will tell you what it is. Well, Doctor Rank, it is something
 you must help me to prevent. You know how devotedly, how inexpressibly
 deeply Torvald loves me; he would never for a moment hesitate to give
 his life for me.
 
 Rank (leaning towards her). Nora--do you think he is the only one--?
 
 Nora (with a slight start). The only one--?
 
 Rank. The only one who would gladly give his life for your sake.
 
 Nora (sadly). Is that it?
 
 Rank. I was determined you should know it before I went away, and there
 will never be a better opportunity than this. Now you know it, Nora. And
 now you know, too, that you can trust me as you would trust no one else.
 
 Nora (rises, deliberately and quietly). Let me pass.
 
 Rank (makes room for her to pass him, but sits still). Nora!
 
 Nora (at the hall door). Helen, bring in the lamp. (Goes over to the
 stove.) Dear Doctor Rank, that was really horrid of you.
 
 Rank. To have loved you as much as anyone else does? Was that horrid?
 
 Nora. No, but to go and tell me so. There was really no need--
 
 Rank. What do you mean? Did you know--? (MAID enters with lamp, puts it
 down on the table, and goes out.) Nora--Mrs. Helmer--tell me, had you
 any idea of this?
 
 Nora. Oh, how do I know whether I had or whether I hadn't? I really
 can't tell you--To think you could be so clumsy, Doctor Rank! We were
 getting on so nicely.
 
 Rank. Well, at all events you know now that you can command me, body and
 soul. So won't you speak out?
 
 Nora (looking at him). After what happened?
 
 Rank. I beg you to let me know what it is.
 
 Nora. I can't tell you anything now.
 
 Rank. Yes, yes. You mustn't punish me in that way. Let me have
 permission to do for you whatever a man may do.
 
 Nora. You can do nothing for me now. Besides, I really don't need any
 help at all. You will find that the whole thing is merely fancy on my
 part. It really is so--of course it is! (Sits down in the rocking-chair,
 and looks at him with a smile.) You are a nice sort of man, Doctor
 Rank!--don't you feel ashamed of yourself, now the lamp has come?
 
 Rank. Not a bit. But perhaps I had better go--for ever?
 
 Nora. No, indeed, you shall not. Of course you must come here just as
 before. You know very well Torvald can't do without you.
 
 Rank. Yes, but you?
 
 Nora. Oh, I am always tremendously pleased when you come.
 
 Rank. It is just that, that put me on the wrong track. You are a riddle
 to me. I have often thought that you would almost as soon be in my
 company as in Helmer's.
 
 Nora. Yes--you see there are some people one loves best, and others whom
 one would almost always rather have as companions.
 
 Rank. Yes, there is something in that.
 
 Nora. When I was at home, of course I loved papa best. But I always
 thought it tremendous fun if I could steal down into the maids' room,
 because they never moralised at all, and talked to each other about such
 entertaining things.
 
 Rank. I see--it is their place I have taken.
 
 Nora (jumping up and going to him). Oh, dear, nice Doctor Rank, I never
 meant that at all. But surely you can understand that being with Torvald
 is a little like being with papa--(Enter MAID from the hall.)
 
 Maid. If you please, ma'am. (Whispers and hands her a card.)
 
 Nora (glancing at the card). Oh! (Puts it in her pocket.)
 
 Rank. Is there anything wrong?
 
 Nora. No, no, not in the least. It is only something--it is my new
 dress--
 
 Rank. What? Your dress is lying there.
 
 Nora. Oh, yes, that one; but this is another. I ordered it. Torvald
 mustn't know about it--
 
 Rank. Oho! Then that was the great secret.
 
 Nora. Of course. Just go in to him; he is sitting in the inner room.
 Keep him as long as--
 
 Rank. Make your mind easy; I won't let him escape.
 
 (Goes into HELMER'S room.)
 
 Nora (to the MAID). And he is standing waiting in the kitchen?
 
 Maid. Yes; he came up the back stairs.
 
 Nora. But didn't you tell him no one was in?
 
 Maid. Yes, but it was no good.
 
 Nora. He won't go away?
 
 Maid. No; he says he won't until he has seen you, ma'am.
 
 Nora. Well, let him come in--but quietly. Helen, you mustn't say
 anything about it to anyone. It is a surprise for my husband.
 
 Maid. Yes, ma'am, I quite understand. (Exit.)
 
 Nora. This dreadful thing is going to happen! It will happen in spite of
 me! No, no, no, it can't happen--it shan't happen! (She bolts the door
 of HELMER'S room. The MAID opens the hall door for KROGSTAD and shuts it
 after him. He is wearing a fur coat, high boots and a fur cap.)
 
 Nora (advancing towards him). Speak low--my husband is at home.
 
 Krogstad. No matter about that.
 
 Nora. What do you want of me?
 
 Krogstad. An explanation of something.
 
 Nora. Make haste then. What is it?
 
 Krogstad. You know, I suppose, that I have got my dismissal.
 
 Nora. I couldn't prevent it, Mr. Krogstad. I fought as hard as I could
 on your side, but it was no good.
 
 Krogstad. Does your husband love you so little, then? He knows what I
 can expose you to, and yet he ventures--
 
 Nora. How can you suppose that he has any knowledge of the sort?
 
 Krogstad. I didn't suppose so at all. It would not be the least like our
 dear Torvald Helmer to show so much courage--
 
 Nora. Mr. Krogstad, a little respect for my husband, please.
 
 Krogstad. Certainly--all the respect he deserves. But since you have
 kept the matter so carefully to yourself, I make bold to suppose that
 you have a little clearer idea, than you had yesterday, of what it
 actually is that you have done?
 
 Nora. More than you could ever teach me.
 
 Krogstad. Yes, such a bad lawyer as I am.
 
 Nora. What is it you want of me?
 
 Krogstad. Only to see how you were, Mrs. Helmer. I have been thinking
 about you all day long. A mere cashier, a quill-driver, a--well, a man
 like me--even he has a little of what is called feeling, you know.
 
 Nora. Show it, then; think of my little children.
 
 Krogstad. Have you and your husband thought of mine? But never mind
 about that. I only wanted to tell you that you need not take this matter
 too seriously. In the first place there will be no accusation made on my
 part.
 
 Nora. No, of course not; I was sure of that.
 
 Krogstad. The whole thing can be arranged amicably; there is no reason
 why anyone should know anything about it. It will remain a secret
 between us three.
 
 Nora. My husband must never get to know anything about it.
 
 Krogstad. How will you be able to prevent it? Am I to understand that
 you can pay the balance that is owing?
 
 Nora. No, not just at present.
 
 Krogstad. Or perhaps that you have some expedient for raising the money
 soon?
 
 Nora. No expedient that I mean to make use of.
 
 Krogstad. Well, in any case, it would have been of no use to you now. If
 you stood there with ever so much money in your hand, I would never part
 with your bond.
 
 Nora. Tell me what purpose you mean to put it to.
 
 Krogstad. I shall only preserve it--keep it in my possession. No one who
 is not concerned in the matter shall have the slightest hint of it. So
 that if the thought of it has driven you to any desperate resolution--
 
 Nora. It has.
 
 Krogstad. If you had it in your mind to run away from your home--
 
 Nora. I had.
 
 Krogstad. Or even something worse--
 
 Nora. How could you know that?
 
 Krogstad. Give up the idea.
 
 Nora. How did you know I had thought of that?
 
 Krogstad. Most of us think of that at first. I did, too--but I hadn't
 the courage.
 
 Nora (faintly). No more had I.
 
 Krogstad (in a tone of relief). No, that's it, isn't it--you hadn't the
 courage either?
 
 Nora. No, I haven't--I haven't.
 
 Krogstad. Besides, it would have been a great piece of folly. Once the
 first storm at home is over--. I have a letter for your husband in my
 pocket.
 
 Nora. Telling him everything?
 
 Krogstad. In as lenient a manner as I possibly could.
 
 Nora (quickly). He mustn't get the letter. Tear it up. I will find some
 means of getting money.
 
 Krogstad. Excuse me, Mrs. Helmer, but I think I told you just now--
 
 Nora. I am not speaking of what I owe you. Tell me what sum you are
 asking my husband for, and I will get the money.
 
 Krogstad. I am not asking your husband for a penny.
 
 Nora. What do you want, then?
 
 Krogstad. I will tell you. I want to rehabilitate myself, Mrs. Helmer; I
 want to get on; and in that your husband must help me. For the last year
 and a half I have not had a hand in anything dishonourable, amid all
 that time I have been struggling in most restricted circumstances. I was
 content to work my way up step by step. Now I am turned out, and I am
 not going to be satisfied with merely being taken into favour again.
 I want to get on, I tell you. I want to get into the Bank again, in a
 higher position. Your husband must make a place for me--
 
 Nora. That he will never do!
 
 Krogstad. He will; I know him; he dare not protest. And as soon as I am
 in there again with him, then you will see! Within a year I shall be the
 manager's right hand. It will be Nils Krogstad and not Torvald Helmer
 who manages the Bank.
 
 Nora. That's a thing you will never see!
 
 Krogstad. Do you mean that you will--?
 
 Nora. I have courage enough for it now.
 
 Krogstad. Oh, you can't frighten me. A fine, spoilt lady like you--
 
 Nora. You will see, you will see.
 
 Krogstad. Under the ice, perhaps? Down into the cold, coal-black water?
 And then, in the spring, to float up to the surface, all horrible and
 unrecognisable, with your hair fallen out--
 
 Nora. You can't frighten me.
 
 Krogstad. Nor you me. People don't do such things, Mrs. Helmer. Besides,
 what use would it be? I should have him completely in my power all the
 same.
 
 Nora. Afterwards? When I am no longer--
 
 Krogstad. Have you forgotten that it is I who have the keeping of your
 reputation? (NORA stands speechlessly looking at him.) Well, now, I have
 warned you. Do not do anything foolish. When Helmer has had my letter,
 I shall expect a message from him. And be sure you remember that it is
 your husband himself who has forced me into such ways as this again. I
 will never forgive him for that. Goodbye, Mrs. Helmer. (Exit through the
 hall.)
 
 Nora (goes to the hall door, opens it slightly and listens.) He is
 going. He is not putting the letter in the box. Oh no, no! that's
 impossible! (Opens the door by degrees.) What is that? He is standing
 outside. He is not going downstairs. Is he hesitating? Can he--? (A
 letter drops into the box; then KROGSTAD'S footsteps are heard, until
 they die away as he goes downstairs. NORA utters a stifled cry, and runs
 across the room to the table by the sofa. A short pause.)
 
 Nora. In the letter-box. (Steals across to the hall door.) There it
 lies--Torvald, Torvald, there is no hope for us now!
 
 (Mrs. LINDE comes in from the room on the left, carrying the dress.)
 
 Mrs. Linde. There, I can't see anything more to mend now. Would you like
 to try it on--?
 
 Nora (in a hoarse whisper). Christine, come here.
 
 Mrs. Linde (throwing the dress down on the sofa). What is the matter
 with you? You look so agitated!
 
 Nora. Come here. Do you see that letter? There, look--you can see it
 through the glass in the letter-box.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, I see it.
 
 Nora. That letter is from Krogstad.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Nora--it was Krogstad who lent you the money!
 
 Nora. Yes, and now Torvald will know all about it.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Believe me, Nora, that's the best thing for both of you.
 
 Nora. You don't know all. I forged a name.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Good heavens--!
 
 Nora. I only want to say this to you, Christine--you must be my witness.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Your witness? What do you mean? What am I to--?
 
 Nora. If I should go out of my mind--and it might easily happen--
 
 Mrs. Linde. Nora!
 
 Nora. Or if anything else should happen to me--anything, for instance,
 that might prevent my being here--
 
 Mrs. Linde. Nora! Nora! you are quite out of your mind.
 
 Nora. And if it should happen that there were some one who wanted to
 take all the responsibility, all the blame, you understand--
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, yes--but how can you suppose--?
 
 Nora. Then you must be my witness, that it is not true, Christine. I am
 not out of my mind at all; I am in my right senses now, and I tell you
 no one else has known anything about it; I, and I alone, did the whole
 thing. Remember that.
 
 Mrs. Linde. I will, indeed. But I don't understand all this.
 
 Nora. How should you understand it? A wonderful thing is going to
 happen!
 
 Mrs. Linde. A wonderful thing?
 
 Nora. Yes, a wonderful thing!--But it is so terrible, Christine; it
 mustn't happen, not for all the world.
 
 Mrs. Linde. I will go at once and see Krogstad.
 
 Nora. Don't go to him; he will do you some harm.
 
 Mrs. Linde. There was a time when he would gladly do anything for my
 sake.
 
 Nora. He?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Where does he live?
 
 Nora. How should I know--? Yes (feeling in her pocket), here is his
 card. But the letter, the letter--!
 
 Helmer (calls from his room, knocking at the door). Nora! Nora (cries
 out anxiously). Oh, what's that? What do you want?
 
 Helmer. Don't be so frightened. We are not coming in; you have locked
 the door. Are you trying on your dress?
 
 Nora. Yes, that's it. I look so nice, Torvald.
 
 Mrs. Linde (who has read the card). I see he lives at the corner here.
 
 Nora. Yes, but it's no use. It is hopeless. The letter is lying there in
 the box.
 
 Mrs. Linde. And your husband keeps the key?
 
 Nora. Yes, always.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Krogstad must ask for his letter back unread, he must find
 some pretence--
 
 Nora. But it is just at this time that Torvald generally--
 
 Mrs. Linde. You must delay him. Go in to him in the meantime. I will
 come back as soon as I can. (She goes out hurriedly through the hall
 door.)
 
 Nora (goes to HELMER'S door, opens it and peeps in). Torvald!
 
 Helmer (from the inner room). Well? May I venture at last to come into
 my own room again? Come along, Rank, now you will see-- (Halting in the
 doorway.) But what is this?
 
 Nora. What is what, dear?
 
 Helmer. Rank led me to expect a splendid transformation.
 
 Rank (in the doorway). I understood so, but evidently I was mistaken.
 
 Nora. Yes, nobody is to have the chance of admiring me in my dress until
 tomorrow.
 
 Helmer. But, my dear Nora, you look so worn out. Have you been
 practising too much?
 
 Nora. No, I have not practised at all.
 
 Helmer. But you will need to--
 
 Nora. Yes, indeed I shall, Torvald. But I can't get on a bit without you
 to help me; I have absolutely forgotten the whole thing.
 
 Helmer. Oh, we will soon work it up again.
 
 Nora. Yes, help me, Torvald. Promise that you will! I am so nervous
 about it--all the people--. You must give yourself up to me entirely
 this evening. Not the tiniest bit of business--you mustn't even take a
 pen in your hand. Will you promise, Torvald dear?
 
 Helmer. I promise. This evening I will be wholly and absolutely at your
 service, you helpless little mortal. Ah, by the way, first of all I will
 just--(Goes towards the hall door.)
 
 Nora. What are you going to do there?
 
 Helmer. Only see if any letters have come.
 
 Nora. No, no! don't do that, Torvald!
 
 Helmer. Why not?
 
 Nora. Torvald, please don't. There is nothing there.
 
 Helmer. Well, let me look. (Turns to go to the letter-box. NORA, at
 the piano, plays the first bars of the Tarantella. HELMER stops in the
 doorway.) Aha!
 
 Nora. I can't dance tomorrow if I don't practise with you.
 
 Helmer (going up to her). Are you really so afraid of it, dear?
 
 Nora. Yes, so dreadfully afraid of it. Let me practise at once; there
 is time now, before we go to dinner. Sit down and play for me, Torvald
 dear; criticise me, and correct me as you play.
 
 Helmer. With great pleasure, if you wish me to. (Sits down at the
 piano.)
 
 Nora (takes out of the box a tambourine and a long variegated shawl. She
 hastily drapes the shawl round her. Then she springs to the front of the
 stage and calls out). Now play for me! I am going to dance!
 
 (HELMER plays and NORA dances. RANK stands by the piano behind HELMER,
 and looks on.)
 
 Helmer (as he plays). Slower, slower!
 
 Nora. I can't do it any other way.
 
 Helmer. Not so violently, Nora!
 
 Nora. This is the way.
 
 Helmer (stops playing). No, no--that is not a bit right.
 
 Nora (laughing and swinging the tambourine). Didn't I tell you so?
 
 Rank. Let me play for her.
 
 Helmer (getting up). Yes, do. I can correct her better then.
 
 (RANK sits down at the piano and plays. NORA dances more and more
 wildly. HELMER has taken up a position beside the stove, and during her
 dance gives her frequent instructions. She does not seem to hear him;
 her hair comes down and falls over her shoulders; she pays no attention
 to it, but goes on dancing. Enter Mrs. LINDE.)
 
 Mrs. Linde (standing as if spell-bound in the doorway). Oh!--
 
 Nora (as she dances). Such fun, Christine!
 
 Helmer. My dear darling Nora, you are dancing as if your life depended
 on it.
 
 Nora. So it does.
 
 Helmer. Stop, Rank; this is sheer madness. Stop, I tell you! (RANK stops
 playing, and NORA suddenly stands still. HELMER goes up to her.) I could
 never have believed it. You have forgotten everything I taught you.
 
 Nora (throwing away the tambourine). There, you see.
 
 Helmer. You will want a lot of coaching.
 
 Nora. Yes, you see how much I need it. You must coach me up to the last
 minute. Promise me that, Torvald!
 
 Helmer. You can depend on me.
 
 Nora. You must not think of anything but me, either today or tomorrow;
 you mustn't open a single letter--not even open the letter-box--
 
 Helmer. Ah, you are still afraid of that fellow--
 
 Nora. Yes, indeed I am.
 
 Helmer. Nora, I can tell from your looks that there is a letter from him
 lying there.
 
 Nora. I don't know; I think there is; but you must not read anything
 of that kind now. Nothing horrid must come between us until this is all
 over.
 
 Rank (whispers to HELMER). You mustn't contradict her.
 
 Helmer (taking her in his arms). The child shall have her way. But
 tomorrow night, after you have danced--
 
 Nora. Then you will be free. (The MAID appears in the doorway to the
 right.)
 
 Maid. Dinner is served, ma'am.
 
 Nora. We will have champagne, Helen.
 
 Maid. Very good, ma'am. [Exit.
 
 Helmer. Hullo!--are we going to have a banquet?
 
 Nora. Yes, a champagne banquet until the small hours. (Calls out.) And a
 few macaroons, Helen--lots, just for once!
 
 Helmer. Come, come, don't be so wild and nervous. Be my own little
 skylark, as you used.
 
 Nora. Yes, dear, I will. But go in now and you too, Doctor Rank.
 Christine, you must help me to do up my hair.
 
 Rank (whispers to HELMER as they go out). I suppose there is
 nothing--she is not expecting anything?
 
 Helmer. Far from it, my dear fellow; it is simply nothing more than this
 childish nervousness I was telling you of. (They go into the right-hand
 room.)
 
 Nora. Well!
 
 Mrs. Linde. Gone out of town.
 
 Nora. I could tell from your face.
 
 Mrs. Linde. He is coming home tomorrow evening. I wrote a note for him.
 
 Nora. You should have let it alone; you must prevent nothing. After all,
 it is splendid to be waiting for a wonderful thing to happen.
 
 Mrs. Linde. What is it that you are waiting for?
 
 Nora. Oh, you wouldn't understand. Go in to them, I will come in a
 moment. (Mrs. LINDE goes into the dining-room. NORA stands still for a
 little while, as if to compose herself. Then she looks at her watch.)
 Five o'clock. Seven hours until midnight; and then four-and-twenty hours
 until the next midnight. Then the Tarantella will be over. Twenty-four
 and seven? Thirty-one hours to live.
 
 Helmer (from the doorway on the right). Where's my little skylark?
 
 Nora (going to him with her arms outstretched). Here she is!
 
 
 
 
 ACT III
 
 (THE SAME SCENE.--The table has been placed in the middle of the stage,
 with chairs around it. A lamp is burning on the table. The door into the
 hall stands open. Dance music is heard in the room above. Mrs. LINDE is
 sitting at the table idly turning over the leaves of a book; she tries
 to read, but does not seem able to collect her thoughts. Every now and
 then she listens intently for a sound at the outer door.)
 
 Mrs. Linde (looking at her watch). Not yet--and the time is nearly up.
 If only he does not--. (Listens again.) Ah, there he is. (Goes into the
 hall and opens the outer door carefully. Light footsteps are heard on
 the stairs. She whispers.) Come in. There is no one here.
 
 Krogstad (in the doorway). I found a note from you at home. What does
 this mean?
 
 Mrs. Linde. It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with
 you.
 
 Krogstad. Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?
 
 Mrs. Linde. It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance
 to my rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the
 Helmers are at the dance upstairs.
 
 Krogstad (coming into the room). Are the Helmers really at a dance
 tonight?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, why not?
 
 Krogstad. Certainly--why not?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Now, Nils, let us have a talk.
 
 Krogstad. Can we two have anything to talk about?
 
 Mrs. Linde. We have a great deal to talk about.
 
 Krogstad. I shouldn't have thought so.
 
 Mrs. Linde. No, you have never properly understood me.
 
 Krogstad. Was there anything else to understand except what was obvious
 to all the world--a heartless woman jilts a man when a more lucrative
 chance turns up?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Do you believe I am as absolutely heartless as all that? And
 do you believe that I did it with a light heart?
 
 Krogstad. Didn't you?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Nils, did you really think that?
 
 Krogstad. If it were as you say, why did you write to me as you did at
 the time?
 
 Mrs. Linde. I could do nothing else. As I had to break with you, it was
 my duty also to put an end to all that you felt for me.
 
 Krogstad (wringing his hands). So that was it. And all this--only for
 the sake of money!
 
 Mrs. Linde. You must not forget that I had a helpless mother and two
 little brothers. We couldn't wait for you, Nils; your prospects seemed
 hopeless then.
 
 Krogstad. That may be so, but you had no right to throw me over for
 anyone else's sake.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Indeed I don't know. Many a time did I ask myself if I had
 the right to do it.
 
 Krogstad (more gently). When I lost you, it was as if all the solid
 ground went from under my feet. Look at me now--I am a shipwrecked man
 clinging to a bit of wreckage.
 
 Mrs. Linde. But help may be near.
 
 Krogstad. It was near; but then you came and stood in my way.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Unintentionally, Nils. It was only today that I learned it
 was your place I was going to take in the Bank.
 
 Krogstad. I believe you, if you say so. But now that you know it, are
 you not going to give it up to me?
 
 Mrs. Linde. No, because that would not benefit you in the least.
 
 Krogstad. Oh, benefit, benefit--I would have done it whether or no.
 
 Mrs. Linde. I have learned to act prudently. Life, and hard, bitter
 necessity have taught me that.
 
 Krogstad. And life has taught me not to believe in fine speeches.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Then life has taught you something very reasonable. But
 deeds you must believe in?
 
 Krogstad. What do you mean by that?
 
 Mrs. Linde. You said you were like a shipwrecked man clinging to some
 wreckage.
 
 Krogstad. I had good reason to say so.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Well, I am like a shipwrecked woman clinging to some
 wreckage--no one to mourn for, no one to care for.
 
 Krogstad. It was your own choice.
 
 Mrs. Linde. There was no other choice--then.
 
 Krogstad. Well, what now?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Nils, how would it be if we two shipwrecked people could
 join forces?
 
 Krogstad. What are you saying?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Two on the same piece of wreckage would stand a better
 chance than each on their own.
 
 Krogstad. Christine I...
 
 Mrs. Linde. What do you suppose brought me to town?
 
 Krogstad. Do you mean that you gave me a thought?
 
 Mrs. Linde. I could not endure life without work. All my life, as long
 as I can remember, I have worked, and it has been my greatest and
 only pleasure. But now I am quite alone in the world--my life is so
 dreadfully empty and I feel so forsaken. There is not the least pleasure
 in working for one's self. Nils, give me someone and something to work
 for.
 
 Krogstad. I don't trust that. It is nothing but a woman's overstrained
 sense of generosity that prompts you to make such an offer of yourself.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Have you ever noticed anything of the sort in me?
 
 Krogstad. Could you really do it? Tell me--do you know all about my past
 life?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes.
 
 Krogstad. And do you know what they think of me here?
 
 Mrs. Linde. You seemed to me to imply that with me you might have been
 quite another man.
 
 Krogstad. I am certain of it.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Is it too late now?
 
 Krogstad. Christine, are you saying this deliberately? Yes, I am sure
 you are. I see it in your face. Have you really the courage, then--?
 
 Mrs. Linde. I want to be a mother to someone, and your children need
 a mother. We two need each other. Nils, I have faith in your real
 character--I can dare anything together with you.
 
 Krogstad (grasps her hands). Thanks, thanks, Christine! Now I shall find
 a way to clear myself in the eyes of the world. Ah, but I forgot--
 
 Mrs. Linde (listening). Hush! The Tarantella! Go, go!
 
 Krogstad. Why? What is it?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Do you hear them up there? When that is over, we may expect
 them back.
 
 Krogstad. Yes, yes--I will go. But it is all no use. Of course you are
 not aware what steps I have taken in the matter of the Helmers.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, I know all about that.
 
 Krogstad. And in spite of that have you the courage to--?
 
 Mrs. Linde. I understand very well to what lengths a man like you might
 be driven by despair.
 
 Krogstad. If I could only undo what I have done!
 
 Mrs. Linde. You cannot. Your letter is lying in the letter-box now.
 
 Krogstad. Are you sure of that?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Quite sure, but--
 
 Krogstad (with a searching look at her). Is that what it all
 means?--that you want to save your friend at any cost? Tell me frankly.
 Is that it?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Nils, a woman who has once sold herself for another's sake,
 doesn't do it a second time.
 
 Krogstad. I will ask for my letter back.
 
 Mrs. Linde. No, no.
 
 Krogstad. Yes, of course I will. I will wait here until Helmer comes; I
 will tell him he must give me my letter back--that it only concerns my
 dismissal--that he is not to read it--
 
 Mrs. Linde. No, Nils, you must not recall your letter.
 
 Krogstad. But, tell me, wasn't it for that very purpose that you asked
 me to meet you here?
 
 Mrs. Linde. In my first moment of fright, it was. But twenty-four hours
 have elapsed since then, and in that time I have witnessed incredible
 things in this house. Helmer must know all about it. This unhappy secret
 must be disclosed; they must have a complete understanding between them,
 which is impossible with all this concealment and falsehood going on.
 
 Krogstad. Very well, if you will take the responsibility. But there is
 one thing I can do in any case, and I shall do it at once.
 
 Mrs. Linde (listening). You must be quick and go! The dance is over; we
 are not safe a moment longer.
 
 Krogstad. I will wait for you below.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, do. You must see me back to my door...
 
 Krogstad. I have never had such an amazing piece of good fortune in my
 life! (Goes out through the outer door. The door between the room and
 the hall remains open.)
 
 Mrs. Linde (tidying up the room and laying her hat and cloak ready).
 What a difference! what a difference! Someone to work for and live
 for--a home to bring comfort into. That I will do, indeed. I wish they
 would be quick and come--(Listens.) Ah, there they are now. I must put
 on my things. (Takes up her hat and cloak. HELMER'S and NORA'S voices
 are heard outside; a key is turned, and HELMER brings NORA almost by
 force into the hall. She is in an Italian costume with a large black
 shawl around her; he is in evening dress, and a black domino which is
 flying open.)
 
 Nora (hanging back in the doorway, and struggling with him). No, no,
 no!--don't take me in. I want to go upstairs again; I don't want to
 leave so early.
 
 Helmer. But, my dearest Nora--
 
 Nora. Please, Torvald dear--please, please--only an hour more.
 
 Helmer. Not a single minute, my sweet Nora. You know that was our
 agreement. Come along into the room; you are catching cold standing
 there. (He brings her gently into the room, in spite of her resistance.)
 
 Mrs. Linde. Good evening.
 
 Nora. Christine!
 
 Helmer. You here, so late, Mrs. Linde?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, you must excuse me; I was so anxious to see Nora in her
 dress.
 
 Nora. Have you been sitting here waiting for me?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, unfortunately I came too late, you had already gone
 upstairs; and I thought I couldn't go away again without having seen
 you.
 
 Helmer (taking off NORA'S shawl). Yes, take a good look at her. I think
 she is worth looking at. Isn't she charming, Mrs. Linde?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, indeed she is.
 
 Helmer. Doesn't she look remarkably pretty? Everyone thought so at the
 dance. But she is terribly self-willed, this sweet little person. What
 are we to do with her? You will hardly believe that I had almost to
 bring her away by force.
 
 Nora. Torvald, you will repent not having let me stay, even if it were
 only for half an hour.
 
 Helmer. Listen to her, Mrs. Linde! She had danced her Tarantella, and
 it had been a tremendous success, as it deserved--although possibly the
 performance was a trifle too realistic--a little more so, I mean, than
 was strictly compatible with the limitations of art. But never mind
 about that! The chief thing is, she had made a success--she had made
 a tremendous success. Do you think I was going to let her remain there
 after that, and spoil the effect? No, indeed! I took my charming little
 Capri maiden--my capricious little Capri maiden, I should say--on my
 arm; took one quick turn round the room; a curtsey on either side, and,
 as they say in novels, the beautiful apparition disappeared. An exit
 ought always to be effective, Mrs. Linde; but that is what I cannot make
 Nora understand. Pooh! this room is hot. (Throws his domino on a chair,
 and opens the door of his room.) Hullo! it's all dark in here. Oh, of
 course--excuse me--. (He goes in, and lights some candles.)
 
 Nora (in a hurried and breathless whisper). Well?
 
 Mrs. Linde (in a low voice). I have had a talk with him.
 
 Nora. Yes, and--
 
 Mrs. Linde. Nora, you must tell your husband all about it.
 
 Nora (in an expressionless voice). I knew it.
 
 Mrs. Linde. You have nothing to be afraid of as far as Krogstad is
 concerned; but you must tell him.
 
 Nora. I won't tell him.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Then the letter will.
 
 Nora. Thank you, Christine. Now I know what I must do. Hush--!
 
 Helmer (coming in again). Well, Mrs. Linde, have you admired her?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, and now I will say goodnight.
 
 Helmer. What, already? Is this yours, this knitting?
 
 Mrs. Linde (taking it). Yes, thank you, I had very nearly forgotten it.
 
 Helmer. So you knit?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Of course.
 
 Helmer. Do you know, you ought to embroider.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Really? Why?
 
 Helmer. Yes, it's far more becoming. Let me show you. You hold
 the embroidery thus in your left hand, and use the needle with the
 right--like this--with a long, easy sweep. Do you see?
 
 Mrs. Linde. Yes, perhaps--
 
 Helmer. But in the case of knitting--that can never be anything but
 ungraceful; look here--the arms close together, the knitting-needles
 going up and down--it has a sort of Chinese effect--. That was really
 excellent champagne they gave us.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Well,--goodnight, Nora, and don't be self-willed any more.
 
 Helmer. That's right, Mrs. Linde.
 
 Mrs. Linde. Goodnight, Mr. Helmer.
 
 Helmer (accompanying her to the door). Goodnight, goodnight. I hope you
 will get home all right. I should be very happy to--but you haven't any
 great distance to go. Goodnight, goodnight. (She goes out; he shuts the
 door after her, and comes in again.) Ah!--at last we have got rid of
 her. She is a frightful bore, that woman.
 
 Nora. Aren't you very tired, Torvald?
 
 Helmer. No, not in the least.
 
 Nora. Nor sleepy?
 
 Helmer. Not a bit. On the contrary, I feel extraordinarily lively. And
 you?--you really look both tired and sleepy.
 
 Nora. Yes, I am very tired. I want to go to sleep at once.
 
 Helmer. There, you see it was quite right of me not to let you stay
 there any longer.
 
 Nora. Everything you do is quite right, Torvald.
 
 Helmer (kissing her on the forehead). Now my little skylark is speaking
 reasonably. Did you notice what good spirits Rank was in this evening?
 
 Nora. Really? Was he? I didn't speak to him at all.
 
 Helmer. And I very little, but I have not for a long time seen him in
 such good form. (Looks for a while at her and then goes nearer to her.)
 It is delightful to be at home by ourselves again, to be all alone with
 you--you fascinating, charming little darling!
 
 Nora. Don't look at me like that, Torvald.
 
 Helmer. Why shouldn't I look at my dearest treasure?--at all the beauty
 that is mine, all my very own?
 
 Nora (going to the other side of the table). You mustn't say things like
 that to me tonight.
 
 Helmer (following her). You have still got the Tarantella in your blood,
 I see. And it makes you more captivating than ever. Listen--the guests
 are beginning to go now. (In a lower voice.) Nora--soon the whole house
 will be quiet.
 
 Nora. Yes, I hope so.
 
 Helmer. Yes, my own darling Nora. Do you know, when I am out at a party
 with you like this, why I speak so little to you, keep away from you,
 and only send a stolen glance in your direction now and then?--do you
 know why I do that? It is because I make believe to myself that we are
 secretly in love, and you are my secretly promised bride, and that no
 one suspects there is anything between us.
 
 Nora. Yes, yes--I know very well your thoughts are with me all the time.
 
 Helmer. And when we are leaving, and I am putting the shawl over your
 beautiful young shoulders--on your lovely neck--then I imagine that you
 are my young bride and that we have just come from the wedding, and I am
 bringing you for the first time into our home--to be alone with you for
 the first time--quite alone with my shy little darling! All this evening
 I have longed for nothing but you. When I watched the seductive figures
 of the Tarantella, my blood was on fire; I could endure it no longer,
 and that was why I brought you down so early--
 
 Nora. Go away, Torvald! You must let me go. I won't--
 
 Helmer. What's that? You're joking, my little Nora! You won't--you
 won't? Am I not your husband--? (A knock is heard at the outer door.)
 
 Nora (starting). Did you hear--?
 
 Helmer (going into the hall). Who is it?
 
 Rank (outside). It is I. May I come in for a moment?
 
 Helmer (in a fretful whisper). Oh, what does he want now? (Aloud.) Wait
 a minute! (Unlocks the door.) Come, that's kind of you not to pass by
 our door.
 
 Rank. I thought I heard your voice, and felt as if I should like to look
 in. (With a swift glance round.) Ah, yes!--these dear familiar rooms.
 You are very happy and cosy in here, you two.
 
 Helmer. It seems to me that you looked after yourself pretty well
 upstairs too.
 
 Rank. Excellently. Why shouldn't I? Why shouldn't one enjoy everything
 in this world?--at any rate as much as one can, and as long as one can.
 The wine was capital--
 
 Helmer. Especially the champagne.
 
 Rank. So you noticed that too? It is almost incredible how much I
 managed to put away!
 
 Nora. Torvald drank a great deal of champagne tonight too.
 
 Rank. Did he?
 
 Nora. Yes, and he is always in such good spirits afterwards.
 
 Rank. Well, why should one not enjoy a merry evening after a well-spent
 day?
 
 Helmer. Well spent? I am afraid I can't take credit for that.
 
 Rank (clapping him on the back). But I can, you know!
 
 Nora. Doctor Rank, you must have been occupied with some scientific
 investigation today.
 
 Rank. Exactly.
 
 Helmer. Just listen!--little Nora talking about scientific
 investigations!
 
 Nora. And may I congratulate you on the result?
 
 Rank. Indeed you may.
 
 Nora. Was it favourable, then?
 
 Rank. The best possible, for both doctor and patient--certainty.
 
 Nora (quickly and searchingly). Certainty?
 
 Rank. Absolute certainty. So wasn't I entitled to make a merry evening
 of it after that?
 
 Nora. Yes, you certainly were, Doctor Rank. Helmer. I think so too, so
 long as you don't have to pay for it in the morning.
 
 Rank. Oh well, one can't have anything in this life without paying for
 it.
 
 Nora. Doctor Rank--are you fond of fancy-dress balls?
 
 Rank. Yes, if there is a fine lot of pretty costumes.
 
 Nora. Tell me--what shall we two wear at the next?
 
 Helmer. Little featherbrain!--are you thinking of the next already?
 
 Rank. We two? Yes, I can tell you. You shall go as a good fairy--
 
 Helmer. Yes, but what do you suggest as an appropriate costume for that?
 
 Rank. Let your wife go dressed just as she is in everyday life.
 
 Helmer. That was really very prettily turned. But can't you tell us what
 you will be?
 
 Rank. Yes, my dear friend, I have quite made up my mind about that.
 
 Helmer. Well?
 
 Rank. At the next fancy-dress ball I shall be invisible.
 
 Helmer. That's a good joke!
 
 Rank. There is a big black hat--have you never heard of hats that make
 you invisible? If you put one on, no one can see you.
 
 Helmer (suppressing a smile). Yes, you are quite right.
 
 Rank. But I am clean forgetting what I came for. Helmer, give me a
 cigar--one of the dark Havanas.
 
 Helmer. With the greatest pleasure. (Offers him his case.)
 
 Rank (takes a cigar and cuts off the end). Thanks.
 
 Nora (striking a match). Let me give you a light.
 
 Rank. Thank you. (She holds the match for him to light his cigar.) And
 now goodbye!
 
 Helmer. Goodbye, goodbye, dear old man!
 
 Nora. Sleep well, Doctor Rank.
 
 Rank. Thank you for that wish.
 
 Nora. Wish me the same.
 
 Rank. You? Well, if you want me to sleep well! And thanks for the light.
 (He nods to them both and goes out.)
 
 Helmer (in a subdued voice). He has drunk more than he ought.
 
 Nora (absently). Maybe. (HELMER takes a bunch of keys out of his pocket
 and goes into the hall.) Torvald! what are you going to do there?
 
 Helmer. Emptying the letter-box; it is quite full; there will be no room
 to put the newspaper in tomorrow morning.
 
 Nora. Are you going to work tonight?
 
 Helmer. You know quite well I'm not. What is this? Someone has been at
 the lock.
 
 Nora. At the lock--?
 
 Helmer. Yes, someone has. What can it mean? I should never have thought
 the maid--. Here is a broken hairpin. Nora, it is one of yours.
 
 Nora (quickly). Then it must have been the children--
 
 Helmer. Then you must get them out of those ways. There, at last I have
 got it open. (Takes out the contents of the letter-box, and calls to the
 kitchen.) Helen!--Helen, put out the light over the front door. (Goes
 back into the room and shuts the door into the hall. He holds out his
 hand full of letters.) Look at that--look what a heap of them there
 are. (Turning them over.) What on earth is that?
 
 Nora (at the window). The letter--No! Torvald, no!
 
 Helmer. Two cards--of Rank's.
 
 Nora. Of Doctor Rank's?
 
 Helmer (looking at them). Doctor Rank. They were on the top. He must
 have put them in when he went out.
 
 Nora. Is there anything written on them?
 
 Helmer. There is a black cross over the name. Look there--what an
 uncomfortable idea! It looks as if he were announcing his own death.
 
 Nora. It is just what he is doing.
 
 Helmer. What? Do you know anything about it? Has he said anything to
 you?
 
 Nora. Yes. He told me that when the cards came it would be his
 leave-taking from us. He means to shut himself up and die.
 
 Helmer. My poor old friend! Certainly I knew we should not have him very
 long with us. But so soon! And so he hides himself away like a wounded
 animal.
 
 Nora. If it has to happen, it is best it should be without a word--don't
 you think so, Torvald?
 
 Helmer (walking up and down). He had so grown into our lives. I can't
 think of him as having gone out of them. He, with his sufferings and his
 loneliness, was like a cloudy background to our sunlit happiness. Well,
 perhaps it is best so. For him, anyway. (Standing still.) And perhaps
 for us too, Nora. We two are thrown quite upon each other now. (Puts his
 arms round her.) My darling wife, I don't feel as if I could hold you
 tight enough. Do you know, Nora, I have often wished that you might be
 threatened by some great danger, so that I might risk my life's blood,
 and everything, for your sake.
 
 Nora (disengages herself, and says firmly and decidedly). Now you must
 read your letters, Torvald.
 
 Helmer. No, no; not tonight. I want to be with you, my darling wife.
 
 Nora. With the thought of your friend's death--
 
 Helmer. You are right, it has affected us both. Something ugly has come
 between us--the thought of the horrors of death. We must try and rid our
 minds of that. Until then--we will each go to our own room.
 
 Nora (hanging on his neck). Goodnight, Torvald--Goodnight!
 
 Helmer (kissing her on the forehead). Goodnight, my little singing-bird.
 Sleep sound, Nora. Now I will read my letters through. (He takes his
 letters and goes into his room, shutting the door after him.)
 
 Nora (gropes distractedly about, seizes HELMER'S domino, throws it round
 her, while she says in quick, hoarse, spasmodic whispers). Never to see
 him again. Never! Never! (Puts her shawl over her head.) Never to see
 my children again either--never again. Never! Never!--Ah! the icy, black
 water--the unfathomable depths--If only it were over! He has got it
 now--now he is reading it. Goodbye, Torvald and my children! (She is
 about to rush out through the hall, when HELMER opens his door hurriedly
 and stands with an open letter in his hand.)
 
 Helmer. Nora!
 
 Nora. Ah!--
 
 Helmer. What is this? Do you know what is in this letter?
 
 Nora. Yes, I know. Let me go! Let me get out!
 
 Helmer (holding her back). Where are you going?
 
 Nora (trying to get free). You shan't save me, Torvald!
 
 Helmer (reeling). True? Is this true, that I read here? Horrible! No,
 no--it is impossible that it can be true.
 
 Nora. It is true. I have loved you above everything else in the world.
 
 Helmer. Oh, don't let us have any silly excuses.
 
 Nora (taking a step towards him). Torvald--!
 
 Helmer. Miserable creature--what have you done?
 
 Nora. Let me go. You shall not suffer for my sake. You shall not take it
 upon yourself.
 
 Helmer. No tragic airs, please. (Locks the hall door.) Here you shall
 stay and give me an explanation. Do you understand what you have done?
 Answer me! Do you understand what you have done?
 
 Nora (looks steadily at him and says with a growing look of coldness in
 her face). Yes, now I am beginning to understand thoroughly.
 
 Helmer (walking about the room). What a horrible awakening! All these
 eight years--she who was my joy and pride--a hypocrite, a liar--worse,
 worse--a criminal! The unutterable ugliness of it all!--For shame! For
 shame! (NORA is silent and looks steadily at him. He stops in front of
 her.) I ought to have suspected that something of the sort would happen.
 I ought to have foreseen it. All your father's want of principle--be
 silent!--all your father's want of principle has come out in you. No
 religion, no morality, no sense of duty--. How I am punished for having
 winked at what he did! I did it for your sake, and this is how you repay
 me.
 
 Nora. Yes, that's just it.
 
 Helmer. Now you have destroyed all my happiness. You have ruined all my
 future. It is horrible to think of! I am in the power of an unscrupulous
 man; he can do what he likes with me, ask anything he likes of me, give
 me any orders he pleases--I dare not refuse. And I must sink to such
 miserable depths because of a thoughtless woman!
 
 Nora. When I am out of the way, you will be free.
 
 Helmer. No fine speeches, please. Your father had always plenty of those
 ready, too. What good would it be to me if you were out of the way, as
 you say? Not the slightest. He can make the affair known everywhere; and
 if he does, I may be falsely suspected of having been a party to your
 criminal action. Very likely people will think I was behind it all--that
 it was I who prompted you! And I have to thank you for all this--you
 whom I have cherished during the whole of our married life. Do you
 understand now what it is you have done for me?
 
 Nora (coldly and quietly). Yes.
 
 Helmer. It is so incredible that I can't take it in. But we must come to
 some understanding. Take off that shawl. Take it off, I tell you. I must
 try and appease him some way or another. The matter must be hushed up at
 any cost. And as for you and me, it must appear as if everything between
 us were just as before--but naturally only in the eyes of the world. You
 will still remain in my house, that is a matter of course. But I shall
 not allow you to bring up the children; I dare not trust them to you.
 To think that I should be obliged to say so to one whom I have loved
 so dearly, and whom I still--. No, that is all over. From this moment
 happiness is not the question; all that concerns us is to save the
 remains, the fragments, the appearance--
 
 (A ring is heard at the front-door bell.)
 
 Helmer (with a start). What is that? So late! Can the worst--? Can he--?
 Hide yourself, Nora. Say you are ill.
 
 (NORA stands motionless. HELMER goes and unlocks the hall door.)
 
 Maid (half-dressed, comes to the door). A letter for the mistress.
 
 Helmer. Give it to me. (Takes the letter, and shuts the door.) Yes, it
 is from him. You shall not have it; I will read it myself.
 
 Nora. Yes, read it.
 
 Helmer (standing by the lamp). I scarcely have the courage to do it. It
 may mean ruin for both of us. No, I must know. (Tears open the letter,
 runs his eye over a few lines, looks at a paper enclosed, and gives a
 shout of joy.) Nora! (She looks at him questioningly.) Nora!--No, I must
 read it once again--. Yes, it is true! I am saved! Nora, I am saved!
 
 Nora. And I?
 
 Helmer. You too, of course; we are both saved, both you and I. Look, he
 sends you your bond back. He says he regrets and repents--that a happy
 change in his life--never mind what he says! We are saved, Nora! No one
 can do anything to you. Oh, Nora, Nora!--no, first I must destroy these
 hateful things. Let me see--. (Takes a look at the bond.) No, no, I
 won't look at it. The whole thing shall be nothing but a bad dream to
 me. (Tears up the bond and both letters, throws them all into the stove,
 and watches them burn.) There--now it doesn't exist any longer. He says
 that since Christmas Eve you--. These must have been three dreadful days
 for you, Nora.
 
 Nora. I have fought a hard fight these three days.
 
 Helmer. And suffered agonies, and seen no way out but--. No, we won't
 call any of the horrors to mind. We will only shout with joy, and keep
 saying, "It's all over! It's all over!" Listen to me, Nora. You don't
 seem to realise that it is all over. What is this?--such a cold, set
 face! My poor little Nora, I quite understand; you don't feel as if you
 could believe that I have forgiven you. But it is true, Nora, I swear
 it; I have forgiven you everything. I know that what you did, you did
 out of love for me.
 
 Nora. That is true.
 
 Helmer. You have loved me as a wife ought to love her husband. Only you
 had not sufficient knowledge to judge of the means you used. But do you
 suppose you are any the less dear to me, because you don't understand
 how to act on your own responsibility? No, no; only lean on me; I
 will advise you and direct you. I should not be a man if this womanly
 helplessness did not just give you a double attractiveness in my eyes.
 You must not think anymore about the hard things I said in my first
 moment of consternation, when I thought everything was going to
 overwhelm me. I have forgiven you, Nora; I swear to you I have forgiven
 you.
 
 Nora. Thank you for your forgiveness. (She goes out through the door to
 the right.)
 
 Helmer. No, don't go--. (Looks in.) What are you doing in there?
 
 Nora (from within). Taking off my fancy dress.
 
 Helmer (standing at the open door). Yes, do. Try and calm yourself,
 and make your mind easy again, my frightened little singing-bird. Be at
 rest, and feel secure; I have broad wings to shelter you under. (Walks
 up and down by the door.) How warm and cosy our home is, Nora. Here is
 shelter for you; here I will protect you like a hunted dove that I
 have saved from a hawk's claws; I will bring peace to your poor beating
 heart. It will come, little by little, Nora, believe me. Tomorrow
 morning you will look upon it all quite differently; soon everything
 will be just as it was before. Very soon you won't need me to assure you
 that I have forgiven you; you will yourself feel the certainty that I
 have done so. Can you suppose I should ever think of such a thing as
 repudiating you, or even reproaching you? You have no idea what a true
 man's heart is like, Nora. There is something so indescribably sweet
 and satisfying, to a man, in the knowledge that he has forgiven his
 wife--forgiven her freely, and with all his heart. It seems as if that
 had made her, as it were, doubly his own; he has given her a new life,
 so to speak; and she has in a way become both wife and child to him. So
 you shall be for me after this, my little scared, helpless darling. Have
 no anxiety about anything, Nora; only be frank and open with me, and I
 will serve as will and conscience both to you--. What is this? Not gone
 to bed? Have you changed your things?
 
 Nora (in everyday dress). Yes, Torvald, I have changed my things now.
 
 Helmer. But what for?--so late as this.
 
 Nora. I shall not sleep tonight.
 
 Helmer. But, my dear Nora--
 
 Nora (looking at her watch). It is not so very late. Sit down here,
 Torvald. You and I have much to say to one another. (She sits down at
 one side of the table.)
 
 Helmer. Nora--what is this?--this cold, set face?
 
 Nora. Sit down. It will take some time; I have a lot to talk over with
 you.
 
 Helmer (sits down at the opposite side of the table). You alarm me,
 Nora!--and I don't understand you.
 
 Nora. No, that is just it. You don't understand me, and I have never
 understood you either--before tonight. No, you mustn't interrupt me.
 You must simply listen to what I say. Torvald, this is a settling of
 accounts.
 
 Helmer. What do you mean by that?
 
 Nora (after a short silence). Isn't there one thing that strikes you as
 strange in our sitting here like this?
 
 Helmer. What is that?
 
 Nora. We have been married now eight years. Does it not occur to you
 that this is the first time we two, you and I, husband and wife, have
 had a serious conversation?
 
 Helmer. What do you mean by serious?
 
 Nora. In all these eight years--longer than that--from the very
 beginning of our acquaintance, we have never exchanged a word on any
 serious subject.
 
 Helmer. Was it likely that I would be continually and forever telling
 you about worries that you could not help me to bear?
 
 Nora. I am not speaking about business matters. I say that we have never
 sat down in earnest together to try and get at the bottom of anything.
 
 Helmer. But, dearest Nora, would it have been any good to you?
 
 Nora. That is just it; you have never understood me. I have been greatly
 wronged, Torvald--first by papa and then by you.
 
 Helmer. What! By us two--by us two, who have loved you better than
 anyone else in the world?
 
 Nora (shaking her head). You have never loved me. You have only thought
 it pleasant to be in love with me.
 
 Helmer. Nora, what do I hear you saying?
 
 Nora. It is perfectly true, Torvald. When I was at home with papa, he
 told me his opinion about everything, and so I had the same opinions;
 and if I differed from him I concealed the fact, because he would not
 have liked it. He called me his doll-child, and he played with me just
 as I used to play with my dolls. And when I came to live with you--
 
 Helmer. What sort of an expression is that to use about our marriage?
 
 Nora (undisturbed). I mean that I was simply transferred from papa's
 hands into yours. You arranged everything according to your own taste,
 and so I got the same tastes as your else I pretended to, I am really
 not quite sure which--I think sometimes the one and sometimes the other.
 When I look back on it, it seems to me as if I had been living here like
 a poor woman--just from hand to mouth. I have existed merely to perform
 tricks for you, Torvald. But you would have it so. You and papa have
 committed a great sin against me. It is your fault that I have made
 nothing of my life.
 
 Helmer. How unreasonable and how ungrateful you are, Nora! Have you not
 been happy here?
 
 Nora. No, I have never been happy. I thought I was, but it has never
 really been so.
 
 Helmer. Not--not happy!
 
 Nora. No, only merry. And you have always been so kind to me. But our
 home has been nothing but a playroom. I have been your doll-wife, just
 as at home I was papa's doll-child; and here the children have been
 my dolls. I thought it great fun when you played with me, just as they
 thought it great fun when I played with them. That is what our marriage
 has been, Torvald.
 
 Helmer. There is some truth in what you say--exaggerated and strained as
 your view of it is. But for the future it shall be different. Playtime
 shall be over, and lesson-time shall begin.
 
 Nora. Whose lessons? Mine, or the children's?
 
 Helmer. Both yours and the children's, my darling Nora.
 
 Nora. Alas, Torvald, you are not the man to educate me into being a
 proper wife for you.
 
 Helmer. And you can say that!
 
 Nora. And I--how am I fitted to bring up the children?
 
 Helmer. Nora!
 
 Nora. Didn't you say so yourself a little while ago--that you dare not
 trust me to bring them up?
 
 Helmer. In a moment of anger! Why do you pay any heed to that?
 
 Nora. Indeed, you were perfectly right. I am not fit for the task.
 There is another task I must undertake first. I must try and educate
 myself--you are not the man to help me in that. I must do that for
 myself. And that is why I am going to leave you now.
 
 Helmer (springing up). What do you say?
 
 Nora. I must stand quite alone, if I am to understand myself and
 everything about me. It is for that reason that I cannot remain with you
 any longer.
 
 Helmer. Nora, Nora!
 
 Nora. I am going away from here now, at once. I am sure Christine will
 take me in for the night--
 
 Helmer. You are out of your mind! I won't allow it! I forbid you!
 
 Nora. It is no use forbidding me anything any longer. I will take with
 me what belongs to myself. I will take nothing from you, either now or
 later.
 
 Helmer. What sort of madness is this!
 
 Nora. Tomorrow I shall go home--I mean, to my old home. It will be
 easiest for me to find something to do there.
 
 Helmer. You blind, foolish woman!
 
 Nora. I must try and get some sense, Torvald.
 
 Helmer. To desert your home, your husband and your children! And you
 don't consider what people will say!
 
 Nora. I cannot consider that at all. I only know that it is necessary
 for me.
 
 Helmer. It's shocking. This is how you would neglect your most sacred
 duties.
 
 Nora. What do you consider my most sacred duties?
 
 Helmer. Do I need to tell you that? Are they not your duties to your
 husband and your children?
 
 Nora. I have other duties just as sacred.
 
 Helmer. That you have not. What duties could those be?
 
 Nora. Duties to myself.
 
 Helmer. Before all else, you are a wife and a mother.
 
 Nora. I don't believe that any longer. I believe that before all else I
 am a reasonable human being, just as you are--or, at all events, that
 I must try and become one. I know quite well, Torvald, that most people
 would think you right, and that views of that kind are to be found in
 books; but I can no longer content myself with what most people say, or
 with what is found in books. I must think over things for myself and get
 to understand them.
 
 Helmer. Can you not understand your place in your own home? Have you not
 a reliable guide in such matters as that?--have you no religion?
 
 Nora. I am afraid, Torvald, I do not exactly know what religion is.
 
 Helmer. What are you saying?
 
 Nora. I know nothing but what the clergyman said, when I went to be
 confirmed. He told us that religion was this, and that, and the other.
 When I am away from all this, and am alone, I will look into that matter
 too. I will see if what the clergyman said is true, or at all events if
 it is true for me.
 
 Helmer. This is unheard of in a girl of your age! But if religion cannot
 lead you aright, let me try and awaken your conscience. I suppose you
 have some moral sense? Or--answer me--am I to think you have none?
 
 Nora. I assure you, Torvald, that is not an easy question to answer. I
 really don't know. The thing perplexes me altogether. I only know that
 you and I look at it in quite a different light. I am learning, too,
 that the law is quite another thing from what I supposed; but I find it
 impossible to convince myself that the law is right. According to it
 a woman has no right to spare her old dying father, or to save her
 husband's life. I can't believe that.
 
 Helmer. You talk like a child. You don't understand the conditions of
 the world in which you live.
 
 Nora. No, I don't. But now I am going to try. I am going to see if I can
 make out who is right, the world or I.
 
 Helmer. You are ill, Nora; you are delirious; I almost think you are out
 of your mind.
 
 Nora. I have never felt my mind so clear and certain as tonight.
 
 Helmer. And is it with a clear and certain mind that you forsake your
 husband and your children?
 
 Nora. Yes, it is.
 
 Helmer. Then there is only one possible explanation.
 
 Nora. What is that?
 
 Helmer. You do not love me anymore.
 
 Nora. No, that is just it.
 
 Helmer. Nora!--and you can say that?
 
 Nora. It gives me great pain, Torvald, for you have always been so kind
 to me, but I cannot help it. I do not love you any more.
 
 Helmer (regaining his composure). Is that a clear and certain conviction
 too?
 
 Nora. Yes, absolutely clear and certain. That is the reason why I will
 not stay here any longer.
 
 Helmer. And can you tell me what I have done to forfeit your love?
 
 Nora. Yes, indeed I can. It was tonight, when the wonderful thing did
 not happen; then I saw you were not the man I had thought you were.
 
 Helmer. Explain yourself better. I don't understand you.
 
 Nora. I have waited so patiently for eight years; for, goodness knows,
 I knew very well that wonderful things don't happen every day. Then this
 horrible misfortune came upon me; and then I felt quite certain that the
 wonderful thing was going to happen at last. When Krogstad's letter was
 lying out there, never for a moment did I imagine that you would consent
 to accept this man's conditions. I was so absolutely certain that you
 would say to him: Publish the thing to the whole world. And when that
 was done--
 
 Helmer. Yes, what then?--when I had exposed my wife to shame and
 disgrace?
 
 Nora. When that was done, I was so absolutely certain, you would come
 forward and take everything upon yourself, and say: I am the guilty one.
 
 Helmer. Nora--!
 
 Nora. You mean that I would never have accepted such a sacrifice on your
 part? No, of course not. But what would my assurances have been worth
 against yours? That was the wonderful thing which I hoped for and
 feared; and it was to prevent that, that I wanted to kill myself.
 
 Helmer. I would gladly work night and day for you, Nora--bear sorrow and
 want for your sake. But no man would sacrifice his honour for the one he
 loves.
 
 Nora. It is a thing hundreds of thousands of women have done.
 
 Helmer. Oh, you think and talk like a heedless child.
 
 Nora. Maybe. But you neither think nor talk like the man I could bind
 myself to. As soon as your fear was over--and it was not fear for what
 threatened me, but for what might happen to you--when the whole thing
 was past, as far as you were concerned it was exactly as if nothing at
 all had happened. Exactly as before, I was your little skylark, your
 doll, which you would in future treat with doubly gentle care, because
 it was so brittle and fragile. (Getting up.) Torvald--it was then
 it dawned upon me that for eight years I had been living here with a
 strange man, and had borne him three children--. Oh, I can't bear to
 think of it! I could tear myself into little bits!
 
 Helmer (sadly). I see, I see. An abyss has opened between us--there is
 no denying it. But, Nora, would it not be possible to fill it up?
 
 Nora. As I am now, I am no wife for you.
 
 Helmer. I have it in me to become a different man.
 
 Nora. Perhaps--if your doll is taken away from you.
 
 Helmer. But to part!--to part from you! No, no, Nora, I can't understand
 that idea.
 
 Nora (going out to the right). That makes it all the more certain that
 it must be done. (She comes back with her cloak and hat and a small bag
 which she puts on a chair by the table.)
 
 Helmer. Nora, Nora, not now! Wait until tomorrow.
 
 Nora (putting on her cloak). I cannot spend the night in a strange man's
 room.
 
 Helmer. But can't we live here like brother and sister--?
 
 Nora (putting on her hat). You know very well that would not last long.
 (Puts the shawl round her.) Goodbye, Torvald. I won't see the little
 ones. I know they are in better hands than mine. As I am now, I can be
 of no use to them.
 
 Helmer. But some day, Nora--some day?
 
 Nora. How can I tell? I have no idea what is going to become of me.
 
 Helmer. But you are my wife, whatever becomes of you.
 
 Nora. Listen, Torvald. I have heard that when a wife deserts her
 husband's house, as I am doing now, he is legally freed from all
 obligations towards her. In any case, I set you free from all your
 obligations. You are not to feel yourself bound in the slightest way,
 any more than I shall. There must be perfect freedom on both sides. See,
 here is your ring back. Give me mine.
 
 Helmer. That too?
 
 Nora. That too.
 
 Helmer. Here it is.
 
 Nora. That's right. Now it is all over. I have put the keys here.
 The maids know all about everything in the house--better than I do.
 Tomorrow, after I have left her, Christine will come here and pack up my
 own things that I brought with me from home. I will have them sent after
 me.
 
 Helmer. All over! All over!--Nora, shall you never think of me again?
 
 Nora. I know I shall often think of you, the children, and this house.
 
 Helmer. May I write to you, Nora?
 
 Nora. No--never. You must not do that.
 
 Helmer. But at least let me send you--
 
 Nora. Nothing--nothing--
 
 Helmer. Let me help you if you are in want.
 
 Nora. No. I can receive nothing from a stranger.
 
 Helmer. Nora--can I never be anything more than a stranger to you?
 
 Nora (taking her bag). Ah, Torvald, the most wonderful thing of all
 would have to happen.
 
 Helmer. Tell me what that would be!
 
 Nora. Both you and I would have to be so changed that--. Oh, Torvald, I
 don't believe any longer in wonderful things happening.
 
 Helmer. But I will believe in it. Tell me! So changed that--?
 
 Nora. That our life together would be a real wedlock. Goodbye. (She goes
 out through the hall.)
 
 Helmer (sinks down on a chair at the door and buries his face in his
 hands). Nora! Nora! (Looks round, and rises.) Empty. She is gone. (A
 hope flashes across his mind.) The most wonderful thing of all--?
 
 (The sound of a door shutting is heard from below.)

 THE LADY FROM THE SEA
 
 
 
 
 ACT I
 
 (SCENE.--DOCTOR WANGEL'S house, with a large verandah garden in front of
 and around the house. Under the verandah a flagstaff. In the garden
 an arbour, with table and chairs. Hedge, with small gate at the back.
 Beyond, a road along the seashore. An avenue of trees along the road.
 Between the trees are seen the fjord, high mountain ranges and peaks. A
 warm and brilliantly clear summer morning.
 
 BALLESTED, middle-aged, wearing an old velvet jacket, and a
 broad-brimmed artist's hat, stands under the flagstaff, arranging the
 ropes. The flag is lying on the ground. A little way from him is an
 easel, with an outspread canvas. By the easel on a camp-stool, brushes,
 a palette, and box of colours.
 
 BOLETTE WANGEL comes from the room opening on the verandah. She carries
 a large vase with flowers, which she puts down on the table.)
 
 Bolette. Well, Ballested, does it work smoothly?
 
 Ballested. Certainly, Miss Bolette, that's easy enough. May I ask--do
 you expect any visitors today?
 
 Bolette. Yes, we're expecting Mr. Arnholm this morning. He got to town
 in the night.
 
 Ballested. Arnholm? Wait a minute--wasn't Arnholm the man who was tutor
 here several years ago?
 
 Bolette. Yes, it is he.
 
 Ballested. Oh, really! Is he coming into these parts again?
 
 Bolette. That's why we want to have the flag up.
 
 Ballested. Well, that's reasonable enough.
 
 (BOLETTE goes into the room again. A little after LYNGSTRAND enters from
 the road and stands still, interested by the easel and painting gear. He
 is a slender youth, poorly but carefully dressed, and looks delicate.)
 
 Lyngstrand (on the other side of the hedge). Good-morning.
 
 Ballested (turning round). Hallo! Good-morning. (Hoists up flag). That's
 it! Up goes the balloon. (Fastens the ropes, and then busies himself
 about the easel.) Good-morning, my dear sir. I really don't think I've
 the pleasure of--Lyngstrand. I'm sure you're a painter.
 
 Ballested. Of course I am. Why shouldn't I be?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, I can see you are. May I take the liberty of coming in
 a moment?
 
 Ballested. Would you like to come in and see?
 
 Lyngstrand. I should like to immensely.
 
 Ballested. Oh! there's nothing much to see yet. But come in. Come a
 little closer.
 
 Lyngstrand. Many thanks. (Comes in through the garden gate.)
 
 Ballested (painting). It's the fjord there between the islands I'm
 working at.
 
 Lyngstrand. So I see.
 
 Ballested. But the figure is still wanting. There's not a model to be
 got in this town.
 
 Lyngstrand. Is there to be a figure, too?
 
 Ballested. Yes. Here by the rocks in the foreground a mermaid is to lie,
 half-dead.
 
 Lyngstrand. Why is she to be half-dead?
 
 Ballested. She has wandered hither from the sea, and can't find her way
 out again. And so, you see, she lies there dying in the brackish water.
 
 Lyngstrand. Ah, I see.
 
 Ballested. The mistress of this house put it into my head to do
 something of the kind.
 
 Lyngstrand. What shall you call the picture when it's finished?
 
 Ballested. I think of calling it "The Mermaid's End."
 
 Lyngstrand. That's capital! You're sure to make something fine of it.
 
 Ballested (looking at him). In the profession too, perhaps?
 
 Lyngstrand. Do you mean a painter?
 
 Ballested. Yes.
 
 Lyngstrand. No, I'm not that; but I'm going to be a sculptor. My name is
 Hans Lyngstrand.
 
 Ballested. So you're to be a sculptor? Yes, yes; the art of sculpture is
 a nice, pretty art in its way. I fancy I've seen you in the street once
 or twice. Have you been staying here long?
 
 Lyngstrand. No; I've only been here a fortnight. But I shall try to stop
 till the end of the summer.
 
 Ballested. For the bathing?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes; I wanted to see if I could get a little stronger.
 
 Ballested. Not delicate, surely?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, perhaps I am a little delicate; but it's nothing
 dangerous. Just a little tightness on the chest.
 
 Ballested. Tush!--a bagatelle! You should consult a good doctor.
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, I thought of speaking to Doctor Wangel one of these
 times.
 
 Ballested. You should. (Looks out to the left.) There's another steamer,
 crowded with passengers. It's really marvellous how travelling has
 increased here of late years.
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, there's a good deal of traffic here, I think.
 
 Ballested. And lots of summer visitors come here too. I often hear our
 good town will lose its individuality with all these foreign goings on.
 
 Lyngstrand. Were you born in the town?
 
 Ballested. No; but I have accla--acclimatised myself. I feel united to
 the place by the bonds of time and habit.
 
 Lyngstrand. Then you've lived here a long time?
 
 Ballested. Well--about seventeen or eighteen years. I came here with
 Skive's Dramatic Company. But then we got into difficulties, and so the
 company broke up and dispersed in all directions.
 
 Lyngstrand. But you yourself remained here?
 
 Ballested. I remained, and I've done very well. I was then working
 chiefly as decorative artist, don't you know.
 
 (BOLETTE comes out with a rocking-chair, which she places on the
 verandah.)
 
 Bolette (speaking into the room). Hilde, see if you can find the
 embroidered footstool for father.
 
 Lyngstrand (going up to the verandah, bows). Good-morning, Miss Wangel.
 
 Bolette (by the balustrade). What! Is it you, Mr. Lyngstrand?
 Good-morning. Excuse me one moment, I'm only--(Goes into room.)
 
 Ballested. Do you know the family?
 
 Lyngstrand. Not well. I've only met the young ladies now and again in
 company; and I had a chat with Mrs. Wangel the last time we had music up
 at the "View." She said I might come and see them.
 
 Ballested. Now, do you know, you ought to cultivate their acquaintance.
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes; I'd been thinking of paying a visit. Just a sort of
 call. If only I could find some excuse--
 
 Ballested. Excuse! Nonsense! (Looking out to the left.) Damn it!
 (Gathering his things.) The steamer's by the pier already. I must get
 off to the hotel. Perhaps some of the new arrivals may want me. For I'm
 a hairdresser, too, don't you know.
 
 Lyngstrand. You are certainly very many-sided, sir.
 
 Ballested. In small towns one has to try to acclam--acclimatise Oneself
 in various branches. If you should require anything in the hair line--a
 little pomatum or such like--you've only to ask for Dancing-master
 Ballested.
 
 Lyngstrand. Dancing master!
 
 Ballested. President of the "Wind Band Society," by your leave. We've a
 concert on this evening up at the "View." Goodbye, goodbye!
 
 (He goes out with his painting gear through the garden gate.
 
 HILDE comes out with the footstool. BOLETTE brings more flowers.
 LYNGSTRAND bows to HILDE from the garden below.)
 
 Hilde (by the balustrade, not returning his bow). Bolette said you had
 ventured in today.
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes; I took the liberty of coming in for a moment.
 
 Hilde. Have you been out for a morning walk?
 
 Lyngstrand. Oh, no! nothing came of the walk this morning.
 
 Hilde. Have you been bathing, then?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes; I've been in the water a little while. I saw your
 mother down there. She was going into her bathing-machine.
 
 Hilde. Who was?
 
 Lyngstrand. Your mother.
 
 Hilde. Oh! I see. (She puts the stool in front of the rocking-chair.)
 
 Bolette (interrupting). Didn't you see anything of father's boat out on
 the fjord?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes; I thought I saw a sailing-boat that was steering
 inland.
 
 Bolette. I'm sure that was father. He's been to visit patients on the
 islands. (She is arranging things on the table.)
 
 Lyngstrand (taking a step up the stairs to the verandah). Why, how
 everything's decorated here with flowers!
 
 Bolette. Yes; doesn't it look nice?
 
 Lyngstrand. It looks lovely! It looks as if it were some festival day in
 the house.
 
 Hilde. That's exactly what it is.
 
 Lyngstrand. I might have guessed it! I'm sure it's your father's
 birthday.
 
 Bolette (warningly to HILDE). Hm--hm!
 
 Hilde (taking no notice of her). No, mother's.
 
 Lyngstrand. Oh! Your mother's!
 
 Bolette (in low voice, angrily). Really, Hilde!
 
 Hilde (the same). Let me be! (To LYNGSTRAND.) I suppose you're going
 home to breakfast now?
 
 Lyngstrand (going down steps). Yes, I suppose I must go and get
 something to eat.
 
 Hilde. I'm sure you find the living very good at the hotel!
 
 Lyngstrand. I'm not staying at the hotel now. It was too expensive for
 me.
 
 Hilde. Where are you staying, then?
 
 Lyngstrand. I'm staying up at Mrs. Jensen's.
 
 Hilde. What Mrs. Jensen's?
 
 Lyngstrand. The midwife.
 
 Hilde. Excuse me, Mr. Lyngstrand, but I really have other matters to
 attend to Lyngstrand. Oh! I'm sure I ought not to have said that.
 
 Hilde. Said what?
 
 Lyngstrand. What I said.
 
 Hilde (looking contemptuously at him). I don't understand you in the
 least.
 
 Lyngstrand. No, no. But I must say goodbye for the present.
 
 Bolette (comes forward to the steps). Good-bye, good-bye, Mr.
 Lyngstrand. You must excuse us now. But another day--when you've plenty
 of time--and inclination--you really must come in and see father and the
 rest of us.
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes; thanks, very much. I shall be delighted. (Bows, and
 goes out through the garden gate. As he goes along the road he bows
 again towards the verandah.)
 
 Hilde (in low voice). Adieu, Monsieur! Please remember me to Mother
 Jensen.
 
 Bolette (in a low voice, shaking her arm). Hilde! You naughty child! Are
 you quite crazy? He might have heard you.
 
 Hilde. Pshaw! Do you think I care about that?
 
 Bolette (looking out to the right). Here's father!
 
 (WANGEL, in travelling dress and carrying a small bag, comes from the
 footpath.)
 
 Wangel. See! I'm back again, little girls! (He enters through the garden
 gate.)
 
 Bolette (going towards him at the bottom of the garden). Oh! It is
 delightful that you've come!
 
 Hilde (also going up to him). Now have you got off for the whole day,
 father?
 
 Wangel. Oh! no. I must go down to the office for a little while
 presently. I say--do you know if Arnholm has come?
 
 Bolette. Yes; he arrived in the night. We sent to the hotel to enquire.
 
 Wangel. Then you've not seen him yet?
 
 Bolette. No; but he's sure to come here this morning.
 
 Wangel. Yes; he's sure to do that.
 
 Hilde (pulling him). Father, now you must look round.
 
 Wangel (looking towards the verandah). Yes, I see well enough, child.
 It's quite festive.
 
 Bolette. Now, don't you think we've arranged it nicely?
 
 Wangel. I must say you have. Are--are we alone at home now?
 
 Hilde. Yes; she's gone to--
 
 Bolette (interrupting quickly). Mother has gone to bathe.
 
 Wangel (looks lovingly at BOLETTE, and pats her head. Then he says,
 hesitating). Look here, little ones. Do you want to keep this up all
 day? And the flag hoisted, too?
 
 Hilde. Surely you understand that, father!
 
 Wangel. Hm! Yes; but you see--
 
 Bolette (looks at him and nods). Surely you can understand we've been
 doing all this in honour of Mr. Arnholm. When such a good friend comes
 to see you for the first time--
 
 Hilde (smiling, and shaking him). Think! he who used to be Bolette's
 tutor, father!
 
 Wangel (with a half-smile). You're a pair of sly minxes. Well--good
 heavens--after all, it's but natural we should remember her who is no
 more with us. Here, Hilde (Gives her his bag), take that down to the
 office. No, children. I don't like this--the way, I mean. This habit of
 every year--well--what can one say? I suppose it can't be managed any
 other way.
 
 Hilde (about to go out of garden, and, with the bag, stops short, turns,
 and points out). Look at that gentleman coming up here. I'm sure it's
 your tutor.
 
 Bolette (looks in that direction). He? (Laughs.) That is good! Do you
 think that middle-aged fellow is Arnholm?
 
 Wangel. Wait a moment, child. Why, by Jove, I do believe it is he. Yes,
 it certainly is.
 
 Bolette (staring at him in quiet amazement). Yes; I almost think--
 
 (ARNHOLM, in elegant morning dress, with gold spectacles, and a thin
 cane, comes along the road. He looks overworked. He looks in at the
 garden, bows in friendly fashion, and enters by the garden gate.)
 
 Wangel (going to meet him). Welcome, dear Arnholm! Heartily welcome back
 to your old quarters again!
 
 Arnholm. Thanks, thanks, Doctor Wangel. A thousand thanks. (They shake
 hands and walk up the garden together.) And there are the children!
 (Holds out his hands and looks at them.) I should hardly have known
 these two again.
 
 Wangel. No, I believe you.
 
 Arnholm. And yet--perhaps Bolette--yes, I should have known Bolette
 again.
 
 Wangel. Hardly, I think. Why, it is eight--nine years since you saw her.
 Ah, yes! Many a thing has changed here meanwhile.
 
 Arnholm (looking round). I really don't see it; except that the trees
 have grown remarkably, and that you've set up that arbour.
 
 Wangel. Oh! no--outwardly.
 
 Arnholm (smiling). And then, of course, you've two grown-up daughters
 here now.
 
 Wangel. Grown up! Well, there's only one grown up.
 
 Hilde (aside). Just listen to father!
 
 Wangel. But now let's sit down up there on the verandah. It's cooler
 than here. Won't you?
 
 Arnholm. Thanks, thanks, dear doctor.
 
 (They go up. WANGEL motions him to the rocking-chair.)
 
 Wangel. That's right! Now make yourself comfortable, and rest, for you
 seem rather tired after your journey.
 
 Arnholm. Oh, that's nothing. Here, amid these surroundings Bolette (to
 WANGEL). Hadn't we better have some soda and syrup in the sitting-room?
 It's sure to be too hot out here soon.
 
 Wangel. Yes, girls. Let's have some soda and syrup, and perhaps a drop
 of Cognac, too.
 
 Bolette. Cognac, too!
 
 Wangel. Just a little, in case anyone should like some.
 
 Bolette. All right. Hilde, go down to the office with the bag.
 
 (BOLETTE goes into the room, and closes the door after her.
 
 HILDE takes the bag, and goes through the garden to the back of the
 house.)
 
 Arnholm (who has followed BOLETTE with his eyes). What a splendid--.
 They are both splendid girls, who've grown up here for you.
 
 Wangel (sitting down). Yes; you think so, too?
 
 Arnholm. Why, it's simply amazing, how Bolette!--and Hilde, too! But
 now, you yourself, dear doctor. Do you think of staying here all your
 life?
 
 Wangel. Yes; I suppose so. Why, I've been born and bred here, so to say.
 I lived here so very happily with--her who left us so early--she whom
 you knew when you were here before, Arnholm.
 
 Arnholm. Yes, yes!
 
 Wangel. And now I live here so happily with her who has taken her place.
 Ah! On the whole, fate has been very good to me.
 
 Arnholm. You have no children by your second marriage? Wangel. We had a
 little boy, two--two and a half years ago. But he didn't stay long. He
 died when he was four--five months old.
 
 Arnholm. Isn't your wife at home today?
 
 Wangel. Oh, yes. She's sure to be here soon. She's down there bathing.
 She does so every blessed day no matter what the weather.
 
 Arnholm. Is she ill, then?
 
 Wangel. Not exactly ill, although she has been extremely nervous for the
 last few years--that is to say, she is now and then. I can't make out
 what really ails her. But to plunge into the sea is her joy and delight.
 
 Arnholm. Yes; I remember that of old.
 
 Wangel (with an almost imperceptible smile). To be sure! You knew Ellida
 when you were teacher out there at Skjoldviken.
 
 Arnholm. Certainly. She used often to visit at the Parsonage. But I
 mostly met her when I went to the lighthouse to see her father.
 
 Wangel. Those times out there, you may believe me, have set deep marks
 upon her. The people in the town here can't understand her at all. They
 call her the "Lady from the Sea."
 
 Arnholm. Do they?
 
 Wangel. Yes. And so--now, you see, speak to her of the old days, dear
 Arnholm, it will do her good.
 
 Arnholm (looks at him in doubt). Have you any reason for thinking so?
 
 Wangel. Assuredly I have.
 
 Ellida (her voice is heard outside the garden). Are you there, Wangel?
 
 Wangel (rising). Yes, dear.
 
 (Mrs. ELLIDA WANGEL, in a large, light wrap, and with wet hair hanging
 loose over her shoulders, comes from between the trees of the arbour.
 ARNHOLM rises.)
 
 Wangel (smiling, and holding out his hands to her). Ah! So now we have
 our Mermaid!
 
 Ellida (goes quickly up the verandah, and seizes his hands). Thank God
 that I see you again! When did you come?
 
 Wangel. Just now; a little while since. (Pointing to ARNHOLM.) But won't
 you greet an old acquaintance?
 
 Ellida (holding out her hand to ARNHOLM). So here you are! Welcome! And
 forgive me for not being at home--
 
 Arnholm. Don't mention it--don't stand on any ceremony.
 
 Wangel. Was the water nice and fresh today?
 
 Ellida. Fresh! Oh! The water here never is fresh. It is so tepid and
 lifeless. Ugh! The water in the fjord here is sick.
 
 Arnholm. Sick?
 
 Ellida. Yes, sick. And I believe it makes one sick, too.
 
 Wangel (smiling). You're giving our bathing resort a good name!
 
 Arnholm. I should rather believe, Mrs. Wangel, that you have a peculiar
 relation to the sea, and to all that belongs to it.
 
 Ellida. Perhaps; I almost think so myself. But do you see how festively
 the girls have arranged everything in your honour?
 
 Wangel (embarrassed). Hm! (Looks at his watch.) Well, I suppose I must
 be quick and--
 
 Arnholm. Is it really for me?
 
 Ellida. Yes. You may be sure we don't decorate like this every day.
 Ugh! How suffocatingly hot it is under this roof. (Goes down into the
 garden.) Come over here. Here at least there is a little air. (Sits down
 in arbour.)
 
 Arnholm (going thither). I think the air quite fresh here.
 
 Ellida. Yes, you--who are used to the stifling air of the town! It's
 terrible there in the summer, I hear.
 
 Wangel (who has also gone into the garden). Hm, dear Ellida, you must
 just entertain our friend alone for a little while.
 
 Ellida. Are you busy?
 
 Wangel. Yes, I must go down to the office. And then I must change. But I
 won't be long.
 
 Arnholm (sitting down in arbour). Now, don't hurry, dear doctor. Your
 wife and I will manage to kill the time.
 
 Wangel (nodding). Oh, yes! I'm sure you will. Well, goodbye for the
 present. (He goes out through the garden.)
 
 Ellida (after a short pause). Don't you think it's pleasant sitting out
 here?
 
 Arnholm. I think I've a pleasant seat now.
 
 Ellida. They call this my arbour, because I had it fitted up, or rather
 Wangel did, for me.
 
 Arnholm. And you usually sit here?
 
 Ellida. Yes, I pass most of the day here.
 
 Arnholm. With the girls, I suppose?
 
 Ellida. No, the girls--usually sit on the verandah.
 
 Arnholm. And Wangel himself?
 
 Ellida. Oh! Wangel goes to and fro--now he comes to me, and then he goes
 to his children.
 
 Arnholm. And is it you who wish this?
 
 Ellida. I think all parties feel most comfortable in this way. You
 know we can talk across to one another--if we happen to find there is
 anything to say.
 
 Arnholm (after thinking awhile). When I last crossed your path--out at
 Skjoldviken, I mean--Hm! That is long ago now.
 
 Ellida. It's quite ten years since you were there with us.
 
 Arnholm. Yes, about that. But when I think of you out there in the
 lighthouse! The heathen, as the old clergyman called you, because your
 father had named you, as he said, after an old ship, and hadn't given
 you a name fit for a Christian.
 
 Ellida. Well, what then?
 
 Arnholm. The last thing I should then have believed was that I should
 see you again down here as the wife of Wangel.
 
 Ellida. No; at that time Wangel wasn't--at that time the girls' first
 mother was still living. Their real mother, so Arnholm. Of course, of
 course! But even if that had not been-even if he had been free--still, I
 could never have believed this would come about.
 
 Ellida. Nor I. Never on earth--then.
 
 Arnholm. Wangel is such a good fellow. So honourable. So thoroughly good
 and kind to all men.
 
 Ellida (warmly and heartily). Yes, he is indeed.
 
 Arnholm. But he must be so absolutely different from you, I fancy.
 
 Ellida. You are right there. So he is.
 
 Arnholm. Well, but how did it happen? How did it come about?
 
 Ellida. Ah! dear Arnholm, you mustn't ask me about that. I couldn't
 explain it to you, and even if I could, you would never be able to
 understand, in the least.
 
 Arnholm. Hm! (In lower tone.) Have you ever confided anything about me
 to your husband? Of course, I meant about the useless step--I allowed
 myself to be moved to.
 
 Ellida. No. You may be sure of that. I've not said a word to him
 about--about what you speak of.
 
 Arnholm. I am glad. I felt rather awkward at the thought that--
 
 Ellida. There was no need. I have only told him what is true--that I
 liked you very much, and that you were the truest and best friend I had
 out there.
 
 Arnholm. Thanks for that. But tell me--why did you never write to me
 after I had gone away?
 
 Ellida. I thought that perhaps it would pain you to hear from one
 who--who could not respond as you desired. It seemed like re-opening a
 painful subject.
 
 Arnholm. Hm. Yes, yes, perhaps you were right.
 
 Ellida. But why didn't you write?
 
 Arnholm (looks at her and smiles, half reproachfully). I make the first
 advance? Perhaps expose myself to the suspicion of wanting to begin all
 over again? After such a repulse as I had had?
 
 Ellida. Oh no! I understand very well. Have you never since thought of
 forming any other tie?
 
 Arnholm. Never! I have been faithful to my first memories.
 
 Ellida (half jestingly). Nonsense! Let the sad old memories alone. You'd
 better think of becoming a happy husband, I should say.
 
 Arnholm. I should have to be quick about it, then, Mrs. Wangel.
 Remember, I'm already--I'm ashamed to say--I'm past thirty-seven.
 
 Ellida. Well, all the more reason for being quick. (She is silent for
 a moment, and then says, earnestly, in a low voice.) But listen, dear
 Arnholm; now I am going to tell you something that I could not have told
 you then, to save my life.
 
 Arnholm. What is it?
 
 Ellida. When you took the--the useless step you were just speaking of--I
 could not answer you otherwise than I did.
 
 Arnholm. I know that you had nothing but friendship to give me; I know
 that well enough.
 
 Ellida. But you did not know that all my mind and soul were then given
 elsewhere.
 
 Arnholm. At that time!
 
 Ellida. Yes.
 
 Arnholm. But it is impossible. You are mistaken about the time. I hardly
 think you knew Wangel then.
 
 Ellida. It is not Wangel of whom I speak.
 
 Arnholm. Not Wangel? But at that time, out there at Skjoldviken--I can't
 remember a single person whom I can imagine the possibility of your
 caring for.
 
 Ellida. No, no, I quite believe that; for it was all such bewildering
 madness--all of it.
 
 Arnholm. But tell me more of this.
 
 Ellida. Oh! it's enough if you know I was bound then; and you know it
 now.
 
 Arnholm. And if you had not been bound?
 
 Ellida. Well?
 
 Arnholm. Would your answer to my letter have been different?
 
 Ellida. How can I tell? When Wangel came the answer was different.
 
 Arnholm. What is your object, then, in telling me that you were bound?
 
 Ellida (getting up, as if in fear and unrest). Because I must have
 someone in whom to confide. No, no; sit still.
 
 Arnholm. Then your husband knows nothing about this?
 
 Ellida. I confessed to him from the first that my thoughts had once been
 elsewhere. He never asked to know more, and we have never touched upon
 it since. Besides, at bottom it was simply madness. And then it was over
 directly--that is to a certain extent.
 
 Arnholm (rising). Only to a certain extent? Not quite?
 
 Ellida. Yes, yes, it is! Oh, good heavens! Dear Arnholm, it is not what
 you think. It is something so absolutely incomprehensible, I don't know
 how I could tell it you. You would only think I was ill, or quite mad.
 
 Arnholm. My dearest lady! Now you really must tell me all about it.
 
 Ellida. Well, then, I'll try to. How will you, as a sensible man,
 explain to yourself that--(Looks round, and breaks off.) Wait a moment.
 Here's a visitor.
 
 (LYNGSTRAND comes along the road, and enters the garden. He has a flower
 in his button-hole, and carries a large, handsome bouquet done up in
 paper and silk ribbons. He stands somewhat hesitatingly and undecidedly
 by the verandah.)
 
 Ellida (from the arbour). Have you come to see the girls, Mr.
 Lyngstrand?
 
 Lyngstrand (turning round). Ah, madam, are you there? (Bows, and
 comes nearer.) No, it's not that. It's not the young ladies. It's you
 yourself, Mrs. Wangel. You know you gave me permission to come and see
 you Ellida. Of course I did. You are always welcome here.
 
 Lyngstrand. Thanks; and as it falls out so luckily that it's a festival
 here today--
 
 Ellida. Oh! Do you know about that?
 
 Lyngstrand. Rather! And so I should like to take the liberty of
 presenting this to Mrs. Wangel. (Bows, and offers her the bouquet.)
 
 Ellida (smiling). But, my dear Mr. Lyngstrand, oughtn't you to give
 these lovely flowers to Mr. Arnholm himself? For you know it's really
 he Lyngstrand (looking uncertainly at both of them). Excuse me, but I
 don't know this gentleman. It's only--I've only come about the birthday,
 Mrs. Wangel.
 
 Ellida. Birthday? You've made a mistake, Mr. Lyngstrand. There's no
 birthday here today.
 
 Lyngstrand (smiling slyly). Oh! I know all about that! But I didn't
 think it was to be kept so dark.
 
 Ellida. What do you know?
 
 Lyngstrand. That it is Madam's birthday.
 
 Ellida. Mine?
 
 Arnholm (looks questioningly at her). Today? Surely not.
 
 Ellida (to LYNGSTRAND). Whatever made you think that?
 
 Lyngstrand. It was Miss Hilde who let it out. I just looked in here a
 little while ago, and I asked the young ladies why they were decorating
 the place like this, with flowers and flags.
 
 Ellida. Well?
 
 Lyngstrand. And so Miss Hilde said, "Why, today is mother's birthday."
 
 Ellida. Mother's!--I see.
 
 Arnholm. Aha! (He and ELLIDA exchange a meaning look.) Well, now that
 the young man knows about it--
 
 Ellida (to LYNGSTRAND). Well, now that you know--
 
 Lyngstrand (offering her the bouquet again). May I take the liberty of
 congratulating you?
 
 Ellida (taking the flowers). My best thanks. Won't you sit down a
 moment, Mr. Lyngstrand? (ELLIDA, ARNHOLM, and LYNGSTRAND sit down in
 the arbour.) This--birthday business--was to have been kept secret, Mr.
 Arnholm.
 
 Arnholm. So I see. It wasn't for us uninitiated folk!
 
 Ellida (putting down the bouquet). Just so. Not for the uninitiated.
 
 Lyngstrand. 'Pon my word, I won't tell a living soul about it.
 
 Ellida. Oh, it wasn't meant like that. But how are you getting on? I
 think you look better than you did.
 
 Lyngstrand. Oh! I think I'm getting on famously. And by next year, if I
 can go south--
 
 Ellida. And you are going south, the girls tell me.
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, for I've a benefactor and friend at Bergen, who looks
 after me, and has promised to help me next year.
 
 Ellida. How did you get such a friend?
 
 Lyngstrand. Well, it all happened so very luckily. I once went to sea in
 one of his ships.
 
 Ellida. Did you? So you wanted to go to sea?
 
 Lyngstrand. No, not at all. But when mother died, father wouldn't have
 me knocking about at home any longer, and so he sent me to sea. Then we
 were wrecked in the English Channel on our way home; and that was very
 fortunate for me.
 
 Arnholm. What do you mean?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, for it was in the shipwreck that I got this little
 weakness--of my chest. I was so long in the ice-cold water before
 they picked me up; and so I had to give up the sea. Yes, that was very
 fortunate.
 
 Arnholm. Indeed! Do you think so?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, for the weakness isn't dangerous; and now I can be
 a sculptor, as I so dearly want to be. Just think; to model in that
 delicious clay, that yields so caressingly to your fingers!
 
 Ellida. And what are you going to model? Is it to be mermen and
 mermaids? Or is it to be old Vikings?
 
 Lyngstrand. No, not that. As soon as I can set about it, I am going to
 try if I can produce a great work--a group, as they call it.
 
 Ellida. Yes; but what's the group to be?
 
 Lyngstrand. Oh! something I've experienced myself.
 
 Arnholm. Yes, yes; always stick to that.
 
 Ellida. But what's it to be?
 
 Lyngstrand. Well, I thought it should be the young wife of a sailor, who
 lies sleeping in strange unrest, and she is dreaming. I fancy I shall do
 it so that you will see she is dreaming.
 
 Arnholm. Is there anything else?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, there's to be another figure--a sort of apparition, as
 they say. It's her husband, to whom she has been faithless while he was
 away, and he is drowned at sea.
 
 Arnholm. What?
 
 Ellida. Drowned?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, he was drowned on a sea voyage. But that's the
 wonderful part of it--he comes home all the same. It is night-time. And
 he is standing by her bed looking at her. He is to stand there dripping
 wet, like one drawn from the sea.
 
 Ellida (leaning back in her chair). What an extraordinary idea!
 (Shutting her eyes.) Oh! I can see it so clearly, living before me!
 
 Arnholm. But how on earth, Mr.--Mr.--I thought you said it was to be
 something you had experienced.
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes. I did experience that--that is to say, to a certain
 extent.
 
 Arnholm. You saw a dead man?
 
 Lyngstrand. Well, I don't mean I've actually seen this--experienced it
 in the flesh. But still--
 
 Ellida (quickly, intently). Oh! tell me all you can about it! I must
 understand about all this.
 
 Arnholm (smiling). Yes, that'll be quite in your line. Something that
 has to do with sea fancies.
 
 Ellida. What was it, Mr. Lyngstrand?
 
 Lyngstrand. Well, it was like this. At the time when we were to sail
 home in the brig from a town they called Halifax, we had to leave
 the boatswain behind in the hospital. So we had to engage an American
 instead. This new boatswain Ellida. The American?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, one day he got the captain to lend him a lot of old
 newspapers and he was always reading them. For he wanted to teach
 himself Norwegian, he said.
 
 Ellida. Well, and then?
 
 Lyngstrand. It was one evening in rough weather. All hands were on
 deck--except the boatswain and myself. For he had sprained his foot and
 couldn't walk, and I was feeling rather low, and was lying in my berth.
 Well, he was sitting there in the forecastle, reading one of those old
 papers again.
 
 Ellida. Well, well!
 
 Lyngstrand. But just as he was sitting there quietly reading, I heard
 him utter a sort of yell. And when I looked at him, I saw his face was
 as white as chalk. And then he began to crush and crumple the paper, and
 to tear it into a thousand shreds. But he did it so quietly, quietly.
 
 Ellida. Didn't he say anything? Didn't he speak?
 
 Lyngstrand. Not directly; but a little after he said to himself, as it
 were: "Married--to another man. While I was away."
 
 Ellida (closes her eyes, and says, half to herself). He said that?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes. And think--he said it in perfect Norwegian. That man
 must have learnt foreign languages very easily--
 
 Ellida. And what then? What else happened?
 
 Lyngstrand. Well, now the remarkable part is coming--that I shall never
 forget as long as I live. For he added, and that quite quietly, too:
 "But she is mine, and mine she shall remain. And she shall follow me, if
 I should come home and fetch her, as a drowned man from the dark sea."
 
 Ellida (pouring herself out a glass of water. Her hand trembles). Ah!
 How close it is here today.
 
 Lyngstrand. And he said this with such strength of will that I thought
 he must be the man to do it.
 
 Ellida. Don't you know anything about--what became of the man?
 
 Lyngstrand. Oh! madam, he's certainly not living now.
 
 Ellida (quickly). Why do you think that?
 
 Lyngstrand. Why? Because we were shipwrecked afterwards in the Channel.
 I had got into the longboat with the captain and five others. The mate
 got into the stern-boat; and the American was in that too, and another
 man.
 
 Ellida. And nothing has been heard of them since?
 
 Lyngstrand. Not a word. The friend who looks after me said so quite
 recently in a letter. But it's just because of this I was so anxious to
 make it into a work of art. I see the faithless sailor-wife so life-like
 before me, and the avenger who is drowned, and who nevertheless comes
 home from the sea. I can see them both so distinctly.
 
 Ellida. I, too. (Rises.) Come; let us go in--or, rather, go down
 to Wangel. I think it is so suffocatingly hot. (She goes out of the
 arbour.)
 
 Lyngstrand (who has also risen). I, for my part, must ask you to excuse
 me. This was only to be a short visit because of the birthday.
 
 Ellida. As you wish. (Holds out her hand to him.) Goodbye, and thank you
 for the flowers.
 
 (LYNGSTRAND bows, and goes off through the garden gate.)
 
 Arnholm (rises, and goes up to ELLIDA). I see well enough that this has
 gone to your heart, Mrs. Wangel.
 
 Ellida. Yes; you may well say so. Although Arnholm. But still--after
 all, it's no more than you were bound to expect.
 
 Ellida (looks at him surprised). Expect!
 
 Arnholm. Well, so it seems to me.
 
 Ellida. Expect that anyone should come back again!--come to life again
 like that!
 
 Arnholm. But what on earth!--is it that mad sculptor's sea story, then?
 
 Ellida. Oh, dear Arnholm, perhaps it isn't so mad after all!
 
 Arnholm. Is it that nonsense about the dead man that has moved you so?
 And I who thought that--
 
 Ellida. What did you think?
 
 Arnholm. I naturally thought that was only a make-believe of yours. And
 that you were sitting here grieving because you had found out a family
 feast was being kept secret; because your husband and his children live
 a life of remembrances in which you have no part.
 
 Ellida. Oh! no, no! That may be as it may. I have no right to claim my
 husband wholly and solely for myself.
 
 Arnholm. I should say you had.
 
 Ellida. Yes. Yet, all the same, I have not. That is it. Why, I, too,
 live in something from which they are shut out.
 
 Arnholm. You! (In lower tone.) Do you mean?--you, you do not really love
 your husband!
 
 Ellida. Oh! yes, yes! I have learnt to love him with all my heart!
 And that's why it is so terrible-so inexplicable--so absolutely
 inconceivable!
 
 Arnholm. Now you must and shall confide all your troubles to me. Will
 you, Mrs. Wangel?
 
 Ellida. I cannot, dear friend. Not now, in any case. Later, perhaps.
 
 (BOLETTE comes out into the verandah, and goes down into the garden.)
 
 Bolette. Father's coming up from the office. Hadn't we better all of us
 go into the sitting-room?
 
 Ellida. Yes, let us.
 
 (WANGEL, in other clothes, comes with HILDE from behind the house.)
 
 Wangel. Now, then, here I am at your service. And now we shall enjoy a
 good glass of something cool.
 
 Ellida. Wait a moment. (She goes into the arbour and fetches the
 bouquet.)
 
 Hilde. I say! All those lovely flowers! Where did you get them?
 
 Ellida. From the sculptor, Lyngstrand, my dear Hilde.
 
 Hilde (starts). From Lyngstrand?
 
 Bolette (uneasily). Has Lyngstrand been here again?
 
 Ellida (with a half-smile). Yes. He came here with these. Because of the
 birthday, you understand.
 
 Bolette (looks at HILDE). Oh!
 
 Hilde (mutters). The idiot!
 
 Wangel (in painful confusion to ELLIDA). Hm!--yes, well you see-I must
 tell you, my dear, good, beloved Ellida--
 
 Ellida (interrupting). Come, girls! Let us go and put my flowers in the
 water together with the others. (Goes up to the verandah.)
 
 Bolette (to HILDE). Oh! After all she is good at heart.
 
 Hilde (in a low tone with angry look). Fiddlesticks! She only does it to
 take in father.
 
 Wangel (on the verandah, presses ELLIDA'S hand). Thanks-thanks! My
 heartfelt thanks for that, dear Ellida.
 
 Ellida (arranging the flowers). Nonsense! Should not I, too, be in it,
 and take part in--in mother's birthday?
 
 Arnholm. Hm!
 
 (He goes up to WANGEL, and ELLIDA, BOLETTE, and HILDE remain in the
 garden below.)
 
 
 
 
 ACT II
 
 (SCENE.--At the "View," a shrub-covered hill behind the town. A little
 in the background, a beacon and a vane. Great stones arranged as seats
 around the beacon, and in the foreground. Farther back the outer fjord
 is seen, with islands and outstanding headlands. The open sea is not
 visible. It is a summer's evening, and twilight. A golden-red shimmer is
 in the air and over the mountain-tops in the far distance. A quartette is
 faintly heard singing below in the background. Young townsfolk,
 ladies and gentlemen, come up in pairs, from the right, and, talking
 familiarly, pass out beyond the beacon. A little after, BALLESTED
 enters, as guide to a party of foreign tourists with their ladies. He is
 laden with shawls and travelling bags.)
 
 Ballested (pointing upwards with a stick). Sehen Sie, meine
 Herrschaften, dort, out there, liegt eine andere mountain, That wollen
 wir also besteigen, and so herunter. (He goes on with the conversation
 in French, and leads the party off to the left. HILDE comes quickly
 along the uphill path, stands still, and looks back. Soon after BOLETTE
 comes up the same way.)
 
 Bolette. But, dear, why should we run away from Lyngstrand?
 
 Hilde. Because I can't bear going uphill so slowly. Look--look at him
 crawling up!
 
 Bolette. Ah! But you know how delicate he is.
 
 Hilde. Do you think it's very--dangerous?
 
 Bolette. I certainly do.
 
 Hilde. He went to consult father this afternoon. I should like to know
 what father thinks about him.
 
 Bolette. Father told me it was a thickening of the lungs, or something
 of the sort. He won't live to be old, father says.
 
 Hilde. No! Did he say it? Fancy--that's exactly what I thought.
 
 Bolette. For heaven's sake don't show it!
 
 Hilde. How can you imagine such a thing? (In an undertone.) Look, here
 comes Hans crawling up. Don't you think you can see by the look of him
 that he's called Hans?
 
 Bolette (whispering). Now do behave! You'd better!
 
 (LYNGSTRAND comes in from the right, a parasol in his hand.)
 
 Lyngstrand. I must beg the young ladies to excuse me for not getting
 along as quickly as they did.
 
 Hilde. Have you got a parasol too, now?
 
 Lyngstrand. It's your mother's. She said I was to use it as a stick. I
 hadn't mine with me.
 
 Bolette. Are they down there still--father and the others?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes; your father looked in at the restaurant for a moment,
 and the others are sitting out there listening to the music. But they
 were coming up here presently, your mother said.
 
 Hilde (stands looking at him). I suppose you're thoroughly tired out
 now?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes; I almost think I'm a little tired now. I really believe
 I shall have to sit down a moment. (He sits on one of the stones in the
 foreground.)
 
 Hilde (standing in front of him). Do you know there's to be dancing down
 there on the parade?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes; I heard there was some talk about it.
 
 Hilde. I suppose you think dancing's great fun?
 
 Bolette (who begins gathering small flowers among the heather). Oh,
 Hilde! Now do let Mr. Lyngstrand get his breath.
 
 Lyngstrand (to HILDE). Yes, Miss Hilde; I should very much like to
 dance--if only I could.
 
 Hilde. Oh, I see! Haven't you ever learnt?
 
 Lyngstrand. No, I've not. But it wasn't that I meant. I meant I couldn't
 because of my chest.
 
 Hilde. Because of that weakness you said you suffered from?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes; because of that.
 
 Hilde. Aren't you very sorry you've that--weakness?
 
 Lyngstrand. Oh, no! I can't say I am (smiling), for I think it's because
 of it that everyone is so good, and friendly, and kind to me.
 
 Hilde. Yes. And then, besides, it's not dangerous.
 
 Lyngstrand. No; it's not at all dangerous. So I gathered from what your
 father said to me.
 
 Hilde. And then it will pass away as soon as ever you begin travelling.
 
 Lyngstrand. Of course it will pass away.
 
 Bolette (with flowers). Look here, Mr. Lyngstrand, you are to put this
 in your button-hole.
 
 Lyngstrand. Oh! A thousand thanks, Miss Wangel. It's really too good of
 you.
 
 Hilde (looking down the path). There they are, coming along the road.
 
 Bolette (also looking down). If only they know where to turn off. No;
 now they're going wrong.
 
 Lyngstrand (rising). I'll run down to the turning and call out to them.
 
 Hilde. You'll have to call out pretty loud.
 
 Bolette. No; it's not worth while. You'll only tire yourself again.
 
 Lyngstrand. Oh, it's so easy going downhill. (Goes off to the right.)
 
 Hilde. Down-hill--yes. (Looking after him.) Why, he's actually jumping!
 And he never remembers he'll have to come up again.
 
 Bolette. Poor fellow!
 
 Hilde. If Lyngstrand were to propose, would you accept him?
 
 Bolette. Are you quite mad?
 
 Hilde. Of course, I mean if he weren't troubled with that "weakness."
 And if he weren't to die so soon, would you have him then?
 
 Bolette. I think you'd better have him yourself!
 
 Hilde. No, that I wouldn't! Why, he hasn't a farthing. He hasn't enough
 even to keep himself.
 
 Bolette. Then why are you always going about with him?
 
 Hilde. Oh, I only do that because of the weakness.
 
 Bolette. I've never noticed that you in the least pity him for it!
 
 Hilde. No, I don't. But I think it so interesting.
 
 Bolette. What is?
 
 Hilde. To look at him and make him tell you it isn't dangerous; and that
 he's going abroad, and is to be an artist. He really believes it all,
 and is so thoroughly happy about it. And yet nothing will ever come of
 it; nothing whatever. For he won't live long enough. I feel that's so
 fascinating to think of.
 
 Bolette. Fascinating!
 
 Hilde. Yes, I think it's most fascinating. I take that liberty.
 
 Bolette. Hilde, you really are a dreadful child!
 
 Hilde. That's just what I want to be--out of spite. (Looking down.) At
 last! I shouldn't think Arnholm liked coming up-hill. (Turns round.) By
 the way, do you know what I noticed about Arnholm at dinner?
 
 Bolette. Well?
 
 Hilde. Just think--his hair's beginning to come off--right on the top of
 his head.
 
 Bolette. Nonsense! I'm sure that's not true.
 
 Hilde. It is! And then he has wrinkles round both his eyes. Good
 gracious, Bolette, how could you be so much in love with him when he
 used to read with you?
 
 Bolette (smiling). Yes. Can you believe it? I remember I once shed
 bitter tears because he thought Bolette was an ugly name.
 
 Hilde. Only to think! (Looking down.) No! I say, do just look down here!
 There's the "Mermaid" walking along and chatting with him. Not with
 father. I wonder if those two aren't making eyes at one another.
 
 Bolette. You ought to be ashamed of yourself! How can you stand there
 and say such a thing of her? Now, when everything was beginning to be so
 pleasant between us.
 
 Hilde. Of course--just try and persuade yourself of that, my child! Oh,
 no! It will never be pleasant between us and her. For she doesn't belong
 to us at all. And we don't belong to her either. Goodness knows what
 father dragged her into the house for! I shouldn't wonder if some fine
 day she went mad under our very eyes.
 
 Bolette. Mad! How can you think such a thing?
 
 Hilde. Oh! it wouldn't be so extraordinary. Her mother went mad, too.
 She died mad--I know that.
 
 Bolette. Yes, heaven only knows what you don't poke your nose into. But
 now don't go chattering about this. Do be good--for father's sake. Do
 you hear, Hilde?
 
 (WANGEL, ELLIDA, ARNHOLM and LYNGSTRAND come up from the right.)
 
 Ellida (pointing to the background). Out there it lies.
 
 Arnholm. Quite right. It must be in that direction.
 
 Ellida. Out there is the sea.
 
 Bolette (to ARNHOLM). Don't you think it is delightful up here?
 
 Arnholm. It's magnificent, I think. Glorious view!
 
 Wangel. I suppose you never used to come up here?
 
 Arnholm. No, never. In my time I think it was hardly accessible; there
 wasn't any path even.
 
 Wangel. And no grounds. All this has been done during the last few
 years.
 
 Bolette. And there, at the "Pilot's Mount," it's even grander than here.
 
 Wangel. Shall we go there, Ellida?
 
 Ellida (sitting down on one of the stones). Thanks, not I; but you
 others can. I'll sit here meanwhile.
 
 Wangel. Then I'll stay with you. The girls can show Arnholm about.
 
 Bolette. Would you like to go with us, Mr. Arnholm?
 
 Arnholm. I should like to, very much. Does a path lead up there too?
 
 Bolette. Oh yes. There's a nice broad path.
 
 Hilde. The path is so broad that two people can walk along it
 comfortably, arm in arm.
 
 Arnholm (jestingly). Is that really so, little Missie? (To BOLETTE.)
 Shall we two see if she is right?
 
 Bolette (suppressing a smile). Very well, let's go. (They go out to the
 left, arm in arm.)
 
 Hilde (to LYNGSTRAND). Shall we go too?
 
 Lyngstrand. Arm in arm?
 
 Hilde. Oh, why not? For aught I care!
 
 Lyngstrand (taking her arm, laughing contentedly). This is a jolly lark.
 
 Hilde. Lark?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes; because it looks exactly as if we were engaged.
 
 Hilde. I'm sure you've never walked out arm in arm with a lady before,
 Mr. Lyngstrand. (They go off.)
 
 Wangel (who is standing beside the beacon). Dear Ellida, now we have a
 moment to ourselves.
 
 Ellida. Yes; come and sit down here, by me.
 
 Wangel (sitting down). It is so free and quiet. Now we can have a little
 talk together.
 
 Ellida. What about?
 
 Wangel. About yourself, and then about us both. Ellida, I see very well
 that it can't go on like this.
 
 Ellida. What do you propose instead?
 
 Wangel. Perfect confidence, dear. A true life together--as before.
 
 Ellida. Oh, if that could be! But it is so absolutely impossible!
 
 Wangel. I think I understand you, from certain things you have let fall
 now and again.
 
 Ellida (passionately). Oh, you do not! Don't say you understand!
 
 Wangel. Yes. Yours is an honest nature, Ellida--yours is a faithful
 mind.
 
 Ellida. It is.
 
 Wangel. Any position in which you could feel safe and happy must be a
 completely true and real one.
 
 Ellida (looking eagerly at him). Well, and then?
 
 Wangel. You are not suited to be a man's second wife.
 
 Ellida. What makes you think that?
 
 Wangel. It has often flashed across me like a foreboding. Today it was
 clear to me. The children's memorial feast--you saw in me a kind of
 accomplice. Well, yes; a man's memories, after all, cannot be wiped
 out--not so mine, anyhow. It isn't in me.
 
 Ellida. I know that. Oh! I know that so well.
 
 Wangel. But you are mistaken all the same. To you it is almost as if the
 children's mother were still living--as if she were still here invisible
 amongst us. You think my heart is equally divided between you and her.
 It is this thought that shocks you. You see something immoral in our
 relation, and that is why you no longer can or will live with me as my
 wife.
 
 Ellida (rising). Have you seen all that, Wangel--seen into all this?
 
 Wangel. Yes; today I have at last seen to the very heart of it--to its
 utmost depths.
 
 Ellida. To its very heart, you say? Oh, do not think that!
 
 Wangel (rising). I see very well that there is more than this, dear
 Ellida.
 
 Ellida (anxiously). You know there is more?
 
 Wangel. Yes. You cannot bear your surroundings here. The mountains crush
 you, and weigh upon your heart. Nothing is open enough for you here.
 The heavens above you are not spacious enough. The air is not strong and
 bracing enough.
 
 Ellida. You are right. Night and day, winter and summer, it weighs upon
 me--this irresistible home-sickness for the sea.
 
 Wangel. I know it well, dear Ellida (laying his hands upon her head).
 And that is why the poor sick child shall go home to her own again.
 
 Ellida. What do you mean?
 
 Wangel. Something quite simple. We are going away.
 
 Ellida. Going away?
 
 Wangel. Yes. Somewhere by the open sea--a place where you can find a
 true home, after your own heart.
 
 Ellida. Oh, dear, do not think of that! That is quite impossible. You
 can live happily nowhere on earth but here!
 
 Wangel. That must be as it may. And, besides, do you think I can live
 happily here--without you?
 
 Ellida. But I am here. And I will stay here. You have me.
 
 Wangel. Have I, Ellida?
 
 Ellida. Oh! don't speak of all this. Why, here you have all that you
 love and strive for. All your life's work lies here.
 
 Wangel. That must be as it may, I tell you. We are going away from
 here--are going somewhere--out there. That is quite settled now, dear
 Ellida.
 
 Ellida. What do you think we should gain by that?
 
 Wangel. You would regain your health and peace of mind.
 
 Ellida. Hardly. And then you, yourself! Think of yourself, too! What of
 you?
 
 Wangel. I would win you back again, my dearest.
 
 Ellida. But you cannot do that! No, no, you can't do that, Wangel! That
 is the terrible part of it--heart-breaking to think of.
 
 Wangel. That remains to be proved. If you are harbouring such thoughts,
 truly there is no other salvation for you than to go hence. And the
 sooner the better. Now this is irrevocably settled, do you hear?
 
 Ellida. No! Then in heaven's name I had better tell you everything
 straight out. Everything just as it is.
 
 Wangel. Yes, yes! Do.
 
 Ellida. For you shall not ruin your happiness for my sake, especially as
 it can't help us in any way.
 
 Wangel. I have your word now that you will tell me everything just as it
 is.
 
 Ellida. I'll tell you everything as well as I can, and as far as I
 understand it. Come here and sit by me. (They sit down on the stones.)
 
 Wangel. Well, Ellida, so--
 
 Ellida. That day when you came out there and asked me if I would
 be yours, you spoke so frankly and honestly to me about your first
 marriage. It had been so happy, you said.
 
 Wangel. And so it was.
 
 Ellida. Yes, yes! I am sure of that, dear! It is not for that I am
 referring to it now. I only want to remind you that I, on my side, was
 frank with you. I told you quite openly that once in my life I had cared
 for another. That there had been a--a kind of engagement between us.
 
 Wangel. A kind of--
 
 Ellida. Yes, something of the sort. Well, it only lasted such a very
 short time. He went away; and after that I put an end to it. I told you
 all that.
 
 Wangel. Why rake up all this now? It really didn't concern me; nor have
 I once asked you who he was!
 
 Ellida. No, you have not. You are always so thoughtful for me.
 
 Wangel (smiling). Oh, in this case I could guess the name well enough
 for myself.
 
 Ellida. The name?
 
 Wangel. Out in Skjoldviken and thereabouts there weren't many to choose
 from; or, rather, there was only a single one.
 
 Ellida. You believe it was Arnholm!
 
 Wangel. Well, wasn't it?
 
 Ellida. No!
 
 Wangel. Not he? Then I don't in the least understand.
 
 Ellida. Can you remember that late in the autumn a large American ship
 once put into Skjoldviken for repairs?
 
 Wangel. Yes, I remember it very well. It was on board that ship that the
 captain was found one morning in his cabin--murdered. I myself went out
 to make the post-mortem.
 
 Ellida. Yes, it was you.
 
 Wangel. It was the second mate who had murdered him.
 
 Ellida. No one can say that. For it was never proved.
 
 Wangel. There was enough against him anyhow, or why should he have
 drowned himself as he did?
 
 Ellida. He did not drown himself. He sailed in a ship to the north.
 
 Wangel (startled). How do you know?
 
 Ellida (with an effort). Well, Wangel--it was this second mate to whom I
 was--betrothed.
 
 Wangel (springing up). What! Is it possible!
 
 Ellida. Yes, it is so. It was to him!
 
 Wangel. But how on earth, Ellida! How did you come to betroth yourself
 to such a man? To an absolute stranger! What is his name?
 
 Ellida. At that time he called himself Friman. Later, in his letters he
 signed himself Alfred Johnston.
 
 Wangel. And where did he come from?
 
 Ellida. From Finmark, he said. For the rest, he was born in Finland, had
 come to Norway there as a child with his father, I think.
 
 Wangel. A Finlander, then?
 
 Ellida. Yes, so he called himself.
 
 Wangel. What else do you know about him?
 
 Ellida. Only that he went to sea very young. And that he had been on
 long voyages.
 
 Wangel. Nothing more?
 
 Ellida. No. We never spoke of such things.
 
 Wangel. Of what did you speak, then?
 
 Ellida. We spoke mostly about the sea.
 
 Wangel. Ah! About the sea--
 
 Ellida. About storms and calm. Of dark nights at sea. And of the sea
 in the glittering sunshiny days we spoke also. But we spoke most of the
 whales, and the dolphins, and the seals who lie out there on the rocks
 in the midday sun. And then we spoke of the gulls, and the eagles, and
 all the other sea birds. I think--isn't it wonderful?--when we talked of
 such things it seemed to me as if both the sea beasts and sea birds were
 one with him.
 
 Wangel. And with you?
 
 Ellida. Yes; I almost thought I belonged to them all, too.
 
 Wangel. Well, well! And so it was that you betrothed yourself to him?
 
 Ellida. Yes. He said I must.
 
 Wangel. You must? Had you no will of your own, then?
 
 Ellida. Not when he was near. Ah! afterwards I thought it all so
 inexplicable.
 
 Wangel. Were you often together?
 
 Ellida. No; not very often. One day he came out to our place, and looked
 over the lighthouse. After that I got to know him, and we met now and
 again. But then that happened about the captain, and so he had to go
 away.
 
 Wangel. Yes, yes. Tell me more about that.
 
 Ellida. It was just daybreak when I had a note from him. He said in it
 I was to go out to him at the Bratthammer. You know the headland there
 between the lighthouse and Skjoldviken?
 
 Wangel. I know, I know!
 
 Ellida. I was to go out there at once, he wrote, because he wanted to
 speak to me.
 
 Wangel. And you went?
 
 Ellida. Yes. I could not do otherwise. Well, then he told me he had
 stabbed the captain in the night.
 
 Wangel. He said that himself! Actually said so!
 
 Ellida. Yes. But he had only acted rightly and justly, he said.
 
 Wangel. Rightly and justly! Why did he stab him then?
 
 Ellida. He wouldn't speak out about that. He said it was not fit for me
 to hear.
 
 Wangel. And you believed his naked, bare word?
 
 Ellida. Yes. It never occurred to me to do otherwise. Well, anyhow, he
 had to go away. But now, when he was to bid me farewell--. No; you never
 could imagine what he thought of--
 
 Wangel. Well? Tell me.
 
 Ellida. He took from his pocket a key-ring--and drew a ring that he
 always wore from his finger, and he took a small ring I had. These two
 he put on the key-ring. And then he said we should wed ourselves to the
 sea.
 
 Wangel. Wed?
 
 Ellida. Yes, so he said. And with that he threw the key-ring, and our
 rings, with all his might, as far as he could into the deep.
 
 Wangel. And you, Ellida, you did all this?
 
 Ellida. Yes--only think--it then seemed to me as if it must be so. But,
 thank God I--he went away.
 
 Wangel. And when he was gone?
 
 Ellida. Oh! You can surely understand that I soon came to my senses
 again--that I saw how absolutely mad and meaningless it had all been.
 
 Wangel. But you spoke just now of letters. So you have heard from him
 since?
 
 Ellida. Yes, I have heard from him. First I had a few short lines from
 Archangel. He only wrote he was going to America. And then he told me
 where to send an answer.
 
 Wangel. And did you?
 
 Ellida. At once. I wrote him, of course, that all must be at an end
 between us; and that he must no longer think of me, just as I should no
 longer think of him.
 
 Wangel. But did he write again?
 
 Ellida. Yes, he wrote again.
 
 Wangel. And what was his answer to your communication?
 
 Ellida. He took no notice of it. It was exactly as if I had never broken
 with him. He wrote quite composedly and calmly that I must wait for him.
 When he could have me he would let me know, and then I was to go to him
 at once.
 
 Wangel. So he would not release you?
 
 Ellida. No. Then I wrote again, almost word for word as I had before; or
 perhaps more firmly.
 
 Wangel. And he gave in?
 
 Ellida. Oh, no! Don't think that! He wrote quietly, as before--not a
 word of my having broken with him. Then I knew it was useless, and so I
 never wrote to him again.
 
 Wangel. And you never heard from him?
 
 Ellida. Oh, yes! I have had three letters since then. Once he wrote to
 me from California, and a second time from China. The last letter I had
 from him was from Australia. He wrote he was going to the gold-mines;
 but since then he has made no sign.
 
 Wangel. This man has had a strange power over you, Ellida.
 
 Ellida. Yes, yes! The terrible man!
 
 Wangel. But you mustn't think of that any more. Never again--never!
 Promise me that, my dear, beloved Ellida. Now we must try another
 treatment for you. Fresher air than here within the fjords. The salt,
 fresh air of the sea! Dear, what say you to that?
 
 Ellida. Oh! don't speak of it! Don't think of it! There is no help in
 this for me. I feel that so well. I can't shake it off--not even there.
 
 Wangel. What, dear?--What do you really mean?
 
 Ellida. I mean the horror of it, this incomprehensible power over the
 mind.
 
 Wangel. But you have shaken it off--long since--when you broke with him.
 Why, all this is long past now.
 
 Ellida (springing up). No; that it is not--it is not!
 
 Wangel. Not past?
 
 Ellida. No, Wangel, it is not past; and I fear it never will be--never,
 in all our life.
 
 Wangel (in a pained voice). Do you mean to say that in your innermost
 heart you have never been able to forget this strange man?
 
 Ellida. I had forgotten him; but then it was as if he had suddenly come
 back again.
 
 Wangel. How long ago is that?
 
 Ellida. It's about three years ago, now, or a little longer. It was just
 when I expected the child.
 
 Wangel. Ah! at that time? Yes, Ellida--now I begin to understand many
 things.
 
 Ellida. You are mistaken, dear. What has come to me? Oh! I believe
 nothing on earth will ever make it clear.
 
 Wangel (looking sadly at her). Only to think that all these three years
 you have cared for another man. Cared for another. Not for me--but for
 another!
 
 Ellida. Oh! you are so utterly mistaken! I care for no one but you.
 
 Wangel (in a subdued voice). Why, then, in all this time have you not
 lived with me as my wife?
 
 Ellida. Because of the horror that comes from the strange man.
 
 Wangel. The horror?
 
 Ellida. Yes, the horror. A horror so terrible--such as only the sea
 could hold. For now you shall hear, Wangel.
 
 (The young townsfolk come back, bow, and pass out to the right. Together
 with them come ARNHOLM, BOLETTE, HILDE, and LYNGSTRAND.)
 
 Bolette (as she passes by). Well, are you still walking about up here?
 
 Ellida. Yes, it is so cool and pleasant up here on the heights.
 
 Arnholm. We, for our part, are going down for a dance.
 
 Wangel. All right. We'll soon come down--we also.
 
 Hilde. Goodbye, for the present!
 
 Ellida. Mr. Lyngstrand, will you wait one moment? (LYNGSTRAND Stops.
 ARNHOLM, BOLETTE and HILDE go out. To LYNGSTRAND.) Are you going to
 dance too?
 
 Lyngstrand. No, Mrs. Wangel. I don't think I dare.
 
 Ellida. No, you should be careful, you know--your chest. You're not
 quite well yet, you see.
 
 Lyngstrand. Not quite.
 
 Ellida (with some hesitation). How long may it be now since you went on
 that voyage?
 
 Lyngstrand. That time when I contracted this weakness?
 
 Ellida. Yes, that voyage you told me about this morning?
 
 Lyngstrand. Oh! it's about--wait a moment--yes, it's a good three years
 now.
 
 Ellida. Three years, then.
 
 Lyngstrand. Perhaps a little more. We left America in February, and we
 were wrecked in March. It was the equinoctial gales we came in for.
 
 Ellida (looking at WANGEL). So it was at that time--
 
 Wangel. But, dear Ellida--
 
 Ellida. Well, don't let me detain you, Mr. Lyngstrand. Now go down, but
 don't dance.
 
 Lyngstrand. No, I'll only look on. (He goes out.)
 
 Ellida. Johnston was on board too, I am quite certain of it.
 
 Wangel. What makes you think so?
 
 Ellida (without answering). He learnt on board that I had married
 another while he was away. And so that very hour this came over me.
 
 Wangel. The horror?
 
 Ellida. Yes, all of a sudden I see him alive right in front of me; or,
 rather a little in profile. He never looks at me, only he is there.
 
 Wangel. How do you think he looks?
 
 Ellida. Exactly as when I saw him last.
 
 Wangel. Ten years ago?
 
 Ellida. Yes; out there at Bratthammeren. Most distinctly of all I see
 his breastpin, with a large bluish-white pearl in it. The pearl is like
 a dead fish's eye, and it seems to glare at me.
 
 Wangel. Good God! You are more ill than I thought. More ill than you
 yourself know, Ellida.
 
 Ellida. Yes, yes! Help me if you can, for I feel how it is drawing
 closer and more close.
 
 Wangel. And you have gone about in this state three whole years, bearing
 for yourself this secret suffering, without confiding in me.
 
 Ellida. But I could not; not till it became necessary for your own sake.
 If I had confided in you I should also have had to confide to you the
 unutterable.
 
 Wangel. Unutterable?
 
 Ellida. No, no, no! Do not ask. Only one thing, nothing more. Wangel,
 when shall we understand that mystery of the boy's eyes?
 
 Wangel. My dear love, Ellida, I assure you it was only your own fancy.
 The child had exactly the same eyes as other normal children have.
 
 Ellida. No, he had not. And you could not see it! The child's eyes
 changed colour with the sea. When the fjord lay bathed in sunshine, so
 were his eyes. And so in storm. Oh, I saw it, if you did not!
 
 Wangel (humouring her). Maybe. But even if it were true, what then?
 
 Ellida (in lower voice, and coming nearer). I have seen such eyes
 before.
 
 Wangel. Well? Where?
 
 Ellida. Out at Bratthammeren, ten years ago.
 
 Wangel (stepping back). What does it mean?
 
 Ellida (whispers, trembling). The child had the strange man's eyes.
 
 Wangel (cries out reluctantly). Ellida!
 
 Ellida (clasps her hands despairingly about her head). Now you
 understand why I would not, why I dared not, live with you as your wife.
 (She turns suddenly and rushes off over the heights.)
 
 Wangel (hurrying after her and calling). Ellida, Ellida! My poor unhappy
 Ellida!
 
 
 
 
 ACT III
 
 (SCENE.--A more remote part of DOCTOR WANGEL'S garden. It is boggy and
 overshadowed by large old trees. To the right is seen the margin of a
 dank pond. A low, open fence separates the garden from the footpath, and
 the fjord in the background. Beyond is the range of mountains, with its
 peaks. It is afternoon, almost evening. BOLETTE sits on a stone seat,
 and on the seat lie some books and a work-basket. HILDE and LYNGSTRAND,
 both with fishing-tackle, walk along the bank of the pond.)
 
 Hilde (making a sign to LYNGSTRAND). I can see a large one.
 
 Lyngstrand (looking). Where?
 
 Hilde (pointing). Can't you see? He's down there. Good gracious! There's
 another! (Looks through the trees.) Out there. Now he's coming to
 frighten him away!
 
 Bolette (looking up). Who's coming?
 
 Hilde. Your tutor, Miss!
 
 Bolette. Mine?
 
 Hilde. Yes. Goodness knows he never was mine.
 
 (ARNHOLM enters from between the trees.)
 
 Arnholm. Are there fish in the pond now?
 
 Hilde. There are some very ancient carp.
 
 Arnholm. No! Are the old carp still alive?
 
 Hilde. Yes; they're pretty tough. But now we're going to try and get rid
 of some of them.
 
 Arnholm. You'd better try out there at the fjord.
 
 Lyngstrand. No; the pond is--well--so to say--more mysterious.
 
 Hilde. Yes; it's fascinating here. Have you been in the sea?
 
 Arnholm. Yes; I've come straight from the baths.
 
 Hilde. I suppose you kept in the enclosure?
 
 Arnholm. Yes; I'm not much of a swimmer.
 
 Hilde. Can you swim on your back?
 
 Arnholm. No.
 
 Hilde. I can. (To LYNGSTRAND.) Let's try out there on the other side.
 (They go off along the pond.)
 
 Arnholm (coming closer to BOLETTE). Are you sitting all alone here,
 Bolette?
 
 Bolette. Yes; I generally do.
 
 Arnholm. Isn't your mother down here in the garden?
 
 Bolette. No--she's sure to be out with father.
 
 Arnholm. How is she this afternoon?
 
 Bolette. I don't quite know. I forgot to ask.
 
 Arnholm. What books have you there?
 
 Bolette. The one's something about botany. And the other's a geography.
 
 Arnholm. Do you care about such things?
 
 Bolette. Yes, if only I had time for it. But, first of all, I've to look
 after the housekeeping.
 
 Arnholm. Doesn't your mother help you--your stepmother--doesn't she help
 with that?
 
 Bolette. No, that's my business. Why, I saw to that during the two years
 father was alone. And so it has been since.
 
 Arnholm. But you're as fond as ever of reading.
 
 Bolette. Yes, I read all the useful books I can get hold of. One wants
 to know something about the world. For here we live so completely
 outside of all that's going on--or almost.
 
 Arnholm. Now don't say that, dear Bolette.
 
 Bolette. Yes! I think we live very much as the carp down there in the
 pond. They have the fjord so near them, where the shoals of wild fishes
 pass in and out. But the poor, tame house-fishes know nothing, and they
 can take no part in that.
 
 Arnholm. I don't think it would fare very well with them if they could
 get out there.
 
 Bolette. Oh! it would be much the same, I expect.
 
 Arnholm. Moreover, you can't say that one is so completely out of the
 world here--not in the summer anyhow. Why, nowadays this is quite a
 rendezvous for the busy world--almost a terminus for the time being.
 
 Bolette. Ah, yes! you who yourself are only here for the time being--it
 is easy for you to make fun of us.
 
 Arnholm. I make fun? How can you think that?
 
 Bolette. Well, all that about this being a rendezvous, and a terminus
 for the busy world--that's something you've heard the townsfolk here
 saying. Yes--they're in the habit of saying that sort of thing.
 
 Arnholm. Well, frankly, I've noticed that, too.
 
 Bolette. But really there's not an atom of truth in it. Not for us who
 always live here. What good is it to us that the great strange world
 comes hither for a time on its way North to see the midnight sun? We
 ourselves have no part in that; we see nothing of the midnight sun. No!
 We've got to be good, and live our lives here in our carp pond.
 
 Arnholm (sitting down by her). Now tell me, dear Bolette, isn't there
 something or other--something definite you are longing for?
 
 Bolette. Perhaps.
 
 Arnholm. What is it, really? What is it you are longing for?
 
 Bolette. Chiefly to get away.
 
 Arnholm. That above all, then?
 
 Bolette. Yes; and then to learn more. To really know something about
 everything.
 
 Arnholm. When I used to teach you, your father often said he would let
 you go to college.
 
 Bolette. Yes, poor father! He says so many things. But when it comes to
 the point he--there's no real stamina in father.
 
 Arnholm. No, unfortunately you're right there. He has not exactly
 stamina. But have you ever spoken to him about it--spoken really
 earnestly and seriously?
 
 Bolette. No, I've not quite done that.
 
 Arnholm. But really you ought to. Before it is too late, Bolette, why
 don't you?
 
 Bolette. Oh! I suppose it's because there's no real stamina in me
 either. I certainly take after father in that.
 
 Arnholm. Hm--don't you think you're unjust to yourself there?
 
 Bolette. No, unfortunately. Besides, father has so little time for
 thinking of me and my future, and not much desire to either. He prefers
 to put such things away from him whenever he can. He is so completely
 taken up with Ellida.
 
 Arnholm. With whom? What?
 
 Bolette. I mean that he and my stepmother--(breaks off). Father and
 mother suffice one another, as you see.
 
 Arnholm. Well, so much the better if you were to get away from here.
 
 Bolette. Yes; but I don't think I've a right to; not to forsake father.
 
 Arnholm. But, dear Bolette, you'll have to do that sometime, anyhow. So
 it seems to me the sooner the better.
 
 Bolette. I suppose there is nothing else for it. After all, I must think
 of myself, too. I must try and get occupation of some sort. When once
 father's gone, I have no one to hold to. But, poor father! I dread
 leaving him.
 
 Arnholm. Dread?
 
 Bolette. Yes, for father's sake.
 
 Arnholm. But, good heavens! Your stepmother? She is left to him.
 
 Bolette. That's true. But she's not in the least fit to do all that
 mother did so well. There is so much she doesn't see, or that she won't
 see, or that she doesn't care about. I don't know which it is.
 
 Arnholm. Um, I think I understand what you mean.
 
 Bolette. Poor father! He is weak in some things. Perhaps you've noticed
 that yourself? He hasn't enough occupation, either, to fill up his time.
 And then she is so thoroughly incapable of helping him; however, that's
 to some extent his own fault.
 
 Arnholm. In what way?
 
 Bolette. Oh! father always likes to see happy faces about him. There
 must be sunshine and joy in the house, he says. And so I'm afraid he
 often gives her medicine which will do her little good in the long run.
 
 Arnholm. Do you really think that?
 
 Bolette. Yes; I can't get rid of the thought. She is so odd at times.
 (Passionately.) But isn't it unjust that I should have to stay at home
 here? Really it's not of any earthly use to father. Besides, I have a
 duty towards myself, too, I think.
 
 Arnholm. Do you know what, Bolette? We two must talk these matters over
 more carefully.
 
 Bolette. Oh! That won't be much use. I suppose I was created to stay
 here in the carp pond.
 
 Arnholm. Not a bit of it. It depends entirely upon yourself.
 
 Bolette (quickly). Do you think so?
 
 Arnholm. Yes, believe me, it lies wholly and solely in your own hands.
 
 Bolette. If only that were true! Will you perhaps put in a good word for
 me with father?
 
 Arnholm. Certainly. But first of all I must speak frankly and freely
 with you yourself, dear.
 
 Bolette (looks out to the left). Hush! don't let them notice anything.
 We'll speak of this later.
 
 (ELLIDA enters from the left. She has no hat on, but a large shawl is
 thrown over her head and shoulders.)
 
 Ellida (with restless animation). How pleasant it is here! How
 delightful it is here!
 
 Arnholm (rising). Have you been for a walk?
 
 Ellida. Yes, a long, long lovely walk up there with Wangel. And now
 we're going for a sail.
 
 Bolette. Won't you sit down?
 
 Ellida. No, thanks; I won't sit down.
 
 Bolette (making room on seat). Here's a pleasant seat.
 
 Ellida (walking about). No, no, no! I'll not sit down--not sit down!
 
 Arnholm. I'm sure your walk has done you good. You look quite refreshed.
 
 Ellida. Oh, I feel so thoroughly well--I feel so unspeakably happy. So
 safe, so safe! (Looking out to the left.) What great steamer is that
 coming along there?
 
 Bolette (rising, and also looking out). It must be the large English
 ship.
 
 Arnholm. It's passing the buoy. Does it usually stop here?
 
 Bolette. Only for half an hour. It goes farther up the fjord.
 
 Ellida. And then sails away again tomorrow--away over the great open
 sea--right over the sea. Only think! to be with them. If one could. If
 only one could!
 
 Arnholm. Have you never been any long sea voyage, Mrs. Wangel?
 
 Ellida. Never; only those little trips in the fjord here.
 
 Bolette (with a sigh). Ah, no! I suppose we must put up with the dry
 land.
 
 Arnholm. Well, after all, that really is our home.
 
 Ellida. No; I don't think it is.
 
 Arnholm. Not the land?
 
 Ellida. No; I don't believe so. I think that if only men had from
 the beginning accustomed themselves to live on the sea, or in the sea
 perhaps, we should be more perfect than we are--both better and happier.
 
 Arnholm. You really think that?
 
 Ellida. Yes. I should like to know if we should not. I've often spoken
 to Wangel about it.
 
 Arnholm. Well, and he?
 
 Ellida. He thinks it might be so.
 
 Arnholm (jestingly). Well, perhaps! But it can't be helped. We've once
 for all entered upon the wrong path, and have become land beasts instead
 of sea beasts. Anyhow, I suppose it's too late to make good the mistake
 now.
 
 Ellida. Yes, you've spoken a sad truth. And I think men instinctively
 feel something of this themselves. And they bear it about with them as a
 secret regret and sorrow. Believe me--herein lies the deepest cause for
 the sadness of men. Yes, believe me, in this.
 
 Arnholm. But, my dearest Mrs. Wangel, I have not observed that men are
 so extremely sad. It seems to me, on the contrary, that most of them
 take life easily and pleasantly--and with a great, quiet, unconscious
 joy.
 
 Ellida. Oh! no, it is not so. The joy is, I suppose, something like our
 joy at the long pleasant summer days--it has the presentiment of the
 dark days coming. And it is this presentiment that casts its shadows
 over the joy of men, just as the driving clouds cast their shadow over
 the fjords. It lies there so bright and blue--and of a sudden.
 
 Arnholm. You shouldn't give way to such sad thoughts. Just now you were
 so glad and so bright.
 
 Ellida. Yes, yes, so I was. Oh, this--this is so stupid of me. (Looking
 about her uneasily.) If only Wangel would come! He promised me so
 faithfully he would. And yet he does not come. Dear Mr. Arnholm, won't
 you try and find him for me?
 
 Arnholm. Gladly!
 
 Ellida. Tell him he must come here directly now. For now I can't see
 him.
 
 Arnholm. Not see him?
 
 Ellida. Oh! you don't understand. When he is not by me I often can't
 remember how he looks. And then it is as if I had quite lost him. That
 is so terribly painful. But do go, please. (She paces round the pond.)
 
 Bolette (to ARNHOLM). I will go with you--you don't know the way.
 
 Arnholm. Nonsense, I shall be all right.
 
 Bolette (aside). No, no, no. I am anxious. I'm afraid he is on board the
 steamer.
 
 Arnholm. Afraid?
 
 Bolette. Yes. He usually goes to see if there are any acquaintances of
 his. And there's a restaurant on board.
 
 Arnholm. Ah! Come then.
 
 (He and BOLETTE go off. ELLIDA stands still awhile, staring down at the
 pond. Now and again she speaks to herself in a low voice, and breaks
 off. Along the footpath beyond the garden fence a STRANGER in travelling
 dress comes from the left. His hair and beard are bushy and red. He has
 a Scotch cap on, and a travelling bag with strap across his shoulders.)
 
 The Stranger (goes slowly along by the fence and peeps into the garden.
 When he catches sight of ELLIDA he stands still, looks at her fixedly
 and searchingly, and speaks in a low voice). Good-evening, Ellida!
 
 Ellida (turns round with a cry). Oh dear! have you come at last!
 
 The Stranger. Yes, at last.
 
 Ellida (looking at him astonished and frightened). Who are you? Do you
 seek anyone here?
 
 The Stranger. You surely know that well enough, Ellida.
 
 Ellida (starting). What is this! How do you address me? Whom are you
 looking for?
 
 The Stranger. Well, I suppose I'm looking for you.
 
 Ellida (shuddering). Oh! (She stares at him, totters back, uttering a
 half-suffocating cry.) The eyes!--the eyes!
 
 The Stranger. Are you beginning to recognise me at last? I knew you at
 once, Ellida.
 
 Ellida. The eyes! Don't look at me like that! I shall cry for help!
 
 The Stranger. Hush, hush! Do not fear. I shan't hurt you.
 
 Ellida (covering her eyes with her hands). Do not look at me like that,
 I say!
 
 The Stranger (leaning with his arms on the garden fence). I came with
 the English steamer.
 
 Ellida (stealing a frightened look at him). What do you want with me?
 
 The Stranger. I promised you to come as soon as I could--
 
 Ellida. Go--go away! Never, never come here again! I wrote to you that
 everything must be over between us--everything! Oh! you know that!
 
 The Stranger (imperturbably, and not answering her). I would gladly have
 come to you sooner; but I could not. Now, at last I am able to, and I am
 here, Ellida.
 
 Ellida. What is it you want with me? What do you mean? Why have you come
 here?
 
 The Stranger. Surely you know I've come to fetch you.
 
 Ellida (recoils in terror). To fetch me! Is that what you mean?
 
 The Stranger. Of course.
 
 Ellida. But surely you know that I am married?
 
 The Stranger. Yes, I know.
 
 Ellida. And yet--and yet you have come to--to fetch me!
 
 The Stranger. Certainly I have.
 
 Ellida (seizing her head with both her hands). Oh! this misery--this
 horror! This horror!
 
 The Stranger. Perhaps you don't want to come?
 
 Ellida (bewildered). Don't look at me like that.
 
 The Stranger. I was asking you if you didn't want to come.
 
 Ellida. No, no, no! Never in all eternity! I will not, I tell you. I
 neither can nor will. (In lower tone.) I dare not.
 
 The Stranger (climbs over the fence, and comes into the garden). Well,
 Ellida, let me tell you one thing before I go.
 
 Ellida (wishes to fly, but cannot. She stands as one paralysed with
 terror, and leans for support against the trunk of a tree by the pond).
 Don't touch me! Don't come near me! No nearer! Don't touch me, I say!
 
 The Stranger (cautiously coming a few steps nearer). You need not be so
 afraid of me, Ellida.
 
 Ellida (covering her eyes with her hands). Don't look at me like that.
 
 The Stranger. Do not be afraid--not afraid.
 
 (WANGEL comes through the garden, from the left.)
 
 Wangel (still half-way between the trees). Well, you've had to wait for
 me a long while.
 
 Ellida (rushes towards him, clings fast to his arm, and cries out). Oh!
 Wangel! Save me! You save me--if you can!
 
 Wangel. Ellida! What in heaven's name!
 
 Ellida. Save me, Wangel! Don't you see him there? Why, he is standing
 there!
 
 Wangel (looking thither). That man? (Coming nearer.) May I ask you who
 you are, and what you have come into this garden for?
 
 The Stranger (motions with a nod towards ELLIDA). I want to talk to her.
 
 Wangel. Oh! indeed. So I suppose it was you. (To ELLIDA.) I hear a
 stranger has been to the house and asked for you?
 
 The Stranger. Yes, it was I.
 
 Wangel. And what do you want with my wife? (Turning round.) Do you know
 him, Ellida?
 
 Ellida (in a low voice and wringing her hands). Do I know him! Yes, yes,
 yes!
 
 Wangel (quickly). Well!
 
 Ellida. Why, it is he, Wangel!--he himself! He who you know!
 
 Wangel. What! What is it you say? (Turning.) Are you the Johnston who
 once...
 
 The Stranger. You may call me Johnston for aught I care! However, that's
 not my name.
 
 Wangel. It is not?
 
 The Stranger. It is--no longer. No!
 
 Wangel. And what may you want with my wife? For I suppose you know the
 lighthouse-keeper's daughter has been married this long time, and whom
 she married, you of course also know.
 
 The Stranger. I've known it over three years.
 
 Ellida (eagerly). How did you come to know it?
 
 The Stranger. I was on my way home to you, Ellida. I came across an old
 newspaper. It was a paper from these parts, and in it there was that
 about the marriage.
 
 Ellida (looking straight in front of her). The marriage! So it was that!
 
 The Stranger. It seemed so wonderful to me. For the rings--why that,
 too, was a marriage, Ellida.
 
 Ellida (covering her face with her hands). Oh!--Wangel. How dare you?
 
 The Stranger. Have you forgotten that?
 
 Ellida (feeling his look, suddenly cries out). Don't stand there and
 look at me like that!
 
 Wangel (goes up to him). You must deal with me, and not with her. In
 short--now that you know the circumstances--what is it you really want
 here? Why do you seek my wife?
 
 The Stranger. I promised Ellida to come to her as soon as I could.
 
 Wangel. Ellida, again--!
 
 The Stranger. And Ellida promised faithfully she would wait for me until
 I came.
 
 Wangel. I notice you call my wife by her first name. This kind of
 familiarity is not customary with us here.
 
 The Stranger. I know that perfectly. But as she first, and above all,
 belongs to me--
 
 Wangel. To you, still--
 
 Ellida (draws back behind WANGEL). Oh! he will never release me!
 
 Wangel. To you? You say she belongs to you?
 
 The Stranger. Has she told you anything about the two rings--my ring and
 Ellida's?
 
 Wangel. Certainly. And what then? She put an end to that long ago. You
 have had her letters, so you know this yourself.
 
 The Stranger. Both Ellida and I agreed that what we did should have all
 the strength and authority of a real and full marriage.
 
 Ellida. But you hear, I will not! Never on earth do I wish to know
 anything more of you. Do not look at me like that. I will not, I tell
 you!
 
 Wangel. You must be mad to think you can come here, and base any claim
 upon such childish nonsense.
 
 The Stranger. That's true. A claim, in your sense, I certainly have not.
 
 Wangel. What do you mean to do, then? You surely do not imagine you can
 take her from me by force, against her own will?
 
 The Stranger. No. What would be the good of that? If Ellida wishes to be
 with me she must come freely.
 
 Ellida (starts, crying out). Freely!
 
 Wangel. And you actually believe that--
 
 Ellida (to herself). Freely!
 
 Wangel. You must have taken leave of your senses! Go your ways. We have
 nothing more to do with you.
 
 The Stranger (looking at his watch). It is almost time for me to go on
 board again. (Coming nearer.) Yes, yes, Ellida, now I have done my duty.
 (Coming still nearer.) I have kept the word I gave you.
 
 Ellida (beseechingly drawing away). Oh! don't touch me!
 
 The Stranger. And so now you must think it over till tomorrow night--
 
 Wangel. There is nothing to think over here. See that you get away.
 
 The Stranger (still to ELLIDA). Now I'm going with the steamer up the
 fjord. Tomorrow night I will come again, and then I shall look for you
 here. You must wait for me here in the garden, for I prefer settling the
 matter with you alone; you understand?
 
 Ellida (in low, trembling tone). Do you hear that, Wangel?
 
 Wangel. Only keep calm. We shall know how to prevent this visit.
 
 The Stranger. Goodbye for the present, Ellida. So tomorrow night--
 
 Ellida (imploringly). Oh! no, no! Do not come tomorrow night! Never come
 here again!
 
 The Stranger. And should you then have a mind to follow me over the
 seas--
 
 Ellida. Oh, don't look at me like that!
 
 The Stranger. I only mean that you must then be ready to set out.
 
 Wangel. Go up to the house, Ellida.
 
 Ellida. I cannot! Oh, help me! Save me, Wangel!
 
 The Stranger. For you must remember that if you do not go with me
 tomorrow, all is at an end.
 
 Ellida (looks tremblingly at him). Then all is at an end? Forever?
 
 The Stranger (nodding). Nothing can change it then, Ellida. I shall
 never again come to this land. You will never see me again, nor hear
 from me either. Then I shall be as one dead and gone from you forever.
 
 Ellida (breathing with difficulty). Oh!
 
 The Stranger. So think carefully what you do. Goodbye! (He goes to the
 fence and climbs over it, stands still, and says.) Yes, Ellida; be ready
 for the journey tomorrow night. For then I shall come and fetch you. (He
 goes slowly and calmly down the footpath to the right.)
 
 Ellida (looking after him for a time). Freely, he said; think--he said
 that I must go with him freely!
 
 Wangel. Only keep calm. Why, he's gone now, and you'll never see him
 again.
 
 Ellida. Oh! how can you say that? He's coming again tomorrow night!
 
 Wangel. Let him come. He shall not meet you again in any case.
 
 Ellida (shaking her head). Ah, Wangel! Do not believe you can prevent
 him.
 
 Wangel. I can, dearest; only trust me.
 
 Ellida (pondering, and not listening to him). Now when he's been here
 tomorrow night--and then when he has gone over seas in the steamer--
 
 Wangel. Yes; what then?
 
 Ellida. I should like to know if he will never, never come back again.
 
 Wangel. No, dear Ellida. You may be quite sure of that. What should he
 do here after this? Now that he has learnt from your own lips that you
 will have nothing more to do with him. With that the whole thing is
 over.
 
 Ellida (to herself). Tomorrow, then, or never!
 
 Wangel. And should it ever occur to him to come here again--
 
 Ellida. Well?
 
 Wangel. Why, then, it is in our power to make him harmless.
 
 Ellida. Oh! do not think that!
 
 Wangel. It is in our power, I tell you. If you can get rid of him in no
 other way, he must expiate the murder of the captain.
 
 Ellida (passionately). No, no, no! Never that! We know nothing about the
 murder of the captain! Nothing whatever!
 
 Wangel. Know nothing? Why, he himself confessed it to you!
 
 Ellida. No, nothing of that. If you say anything of it I shall deny it.
 He shall not be imprisoned. He belongs out there--to the open sea. He
 belongs out there!
 
 Wangel (looks at her and says slowly). Ah! Ellida--Ellida!
 
 Ellida (clinging passionately to him). Oh! dear, faithful one--save me
 from this man!
 
 Wangel (disengaging himself gently). Come, come with me! (LYNGSTRAND
 and HILDE, both with fishing tackle, come in from the right, along the
 pond.)
 
 Lyngstrand (going quickly up to ELLIDA). Now, Mrs. Wangel, you must hear
 something wonderful.
 
 Wangel. What is it?
 
 Lyngstrand. Fancy! We've seen the American!
 
 Wangel. The American?
 
 Hilde. Yes, I saw him, too.
 
 Lyngstrand. He was going round the back of the garden, and thence on
 board the great English steamer.
 
 Wangel. How do you know the man?
 
 Lyngstrand. Why, I went to sea with him once. I felt so certain he'd
 been drowned--and now he's very much alive!
 
 Wangel. Do you know anything more about him?
 
 Lyngstrand. No. But I'm sure he's come to revenge himself upon his
 faithless sailor-wife.
 
 Wangel. What do you mean?
 
 Hilde. Lyngstrand's going to use him for a work of art.
 
 Wangel. I don't understand one word.
 
 Ellida. You shall hear afterwards.
 
 (ARNHOLM and BOLETTE come from the left along the footpath outside the
 garden.)
 
 Bolette (to those in the garden). Do come and see! The great English
 steamer's just going up the fjord.
 
 (A large steamer glides slowly past in the distance.)
 
 Lyngstrand (to HILDE behind the garden fence). Tonight he's sure to come
 to her.
 
 Hilde (nods). To the faithless sailor-wife--yes.
 
 Lyngstrand. Fancy, at midnight!
 
 Hilde. That must be so fascinating.
 
 Ellida (looking after the ship). Tomorrow, then!
 
 Wangel. And then never again.
 
 Ellida (in a low, imploring tone). Oh! Wangel, save me from myself!
 
 Wangel (looks anxiously at her). Ellida--I feel there is something
 behind this--
 
 Ellida. There is--the temptation!
 
 Wangel. Temptation?
 
 Ellida. The man is like the sea!
 
 (She goes slowly and thoughtfully through the garden, and out to the
 left. WANGEL walks uneasily by her side, watching her closely.)
 
 
 
 
 ACT IV
 
 (SCENE.--DOCTOR WANGEL'S garden-room. Doors right and left. In the
 background, between the windows, an open glass door leading out on to
 the verandah. Below this, a portion of the garden is visible. A sofa
 and table down left. To the right a piano, and farther back a large
 flower-stand. In the middle of the room a round table, with chairs. On
 the table is a rose-tree in bloom, and other plants around it. Morning.
 
 In the room, by the table, BOLETTE is sitting on the sofa, busy with
 some embroidery. LYNGSTRAND is seated on a chair at the upper end of
 the table. In the garden below BALLESTED sits painting. HILDE stands by
 watching him.)
 
 Lyngstrand (with his arms on the table, sits silent awhile, looking at
 BOLETTE'S work). It must be awfully difficult to do a border like that,
 Miss Wangel?
 
 Bolette. Oh, no! It's not very difficult, if only you take care to count
 right.
 
 Lyngstrand. To count? Must you count, too?
 
 Bolette. Yes, the stitches. See!
 
 Lyngstrand. So you do! Just fancy! Why, it's almost a kind of art. Can
 you design, too?
 
 Bolette. Oh, yes! When I've a copy.
 
 Lyngstrand. Not unless?
 
 Bolette. No.
 
 Lyngstrand. Well, then, after all, it's not a real art?
 
 Bolette. No; it is rather only a sort of--handicraft.
 
 Lyngstrand. But still, I think that perhaps you could learn art.
 
 Bolette. If I haven't any talent?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes; if you could always be with a real true artist--
 
 Bolette. Do you think, then, I could learn it from him?
 
 Lyngstrand. Not exactly learn in the ordinary sense; but I think it
 would grow upon you little by little--by a kind of miracle as it were,
 Miss Wangel.
 
 Bolette. That would be wonderful.
 
 Lyngstrand (after a pause). Have you ever thought about--I mean, have
 you ever thought deeply and earnestly about marriage, Miss Wangel?
 
 Bolette (looking quickly at him). About--no!
 
 Lyngstrand. I have.
 
 Bolette. Really? Have you?
 
 Lyngstrand. Oh yes! I often think about things of that sort, especially
 about marriage; and, besides, I've read several books about it. I
 think marriage must be counted a sort of miracle--that a woman should
 gradually change until she is like her husband.
 
 Bolette. You mean has like interests?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, that's it.
 
 Bolette. Well, but his abilities--his talents--and his skill?
 
 Lyngstrand. Hm--well--I should like to know if all that too--
 
 Bolette. Then, perhaps, you also believe that everything a man has read
 for himself, and thought out for himself, that this, too, can grow upon
 his wife?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, I think it can. Little by little; as by a sort of
 miracle. But, of course, I know such things can only happen in a
 marriage that is faithful, and loving, and really happy.
 
 Bolette. Has it never occurred to you that a man, too, might, perhaps,
 be thus drawn over to his wife? Grow like her, I mean.
 
 Lyngstrand. A man? No, I never thought of that.
 
 Bolette. But why not one as well as the other?
 
 Lyngstrand. No; for a man has a calling that he lives for; and that's
 what makes a man so strong and firm, Miss Wangel. He has a calling in
 life.
 
 Bolette. Has every man?
 
 Lyngstrand. Oh no! I am thinking more especially of artists.
 
 Bolette. Do you think it right of an artist to get married?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, I think so. If he can find one he can heartily love,
 I--
 
 Bolette. Still, I think he should rather live for his art alone.
 
 Lyngstrand. Of course he must; but he can do that just as well, even if
 he marries.
 
 Bolette. But how about her?
 
 Lyngstrand. Her? Who?
 
 Bolette. She whom he marries. What is she to live for?
 
 Lyngstrand. She, too, is to live for his art. It seems to me a woman
 must feel so thoroughly happy in that.
 
 Bolette. Hm, I don't exactly know--
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, Miss Wangel, you may be sure of that. It is not merely
 all the honour and respect she enjoys through him; for that seems almost
 the least important to me. But it is this--that she can help him to
 create, that she can lighten his work for him, be about him and see to
 his comfort, and tend him well, and make his life thoroughly pleasant. I
 should think that must be perfectly delightful to a woman.
 
 Bolette. Ah! You don't yourself know how selfish you are!
 
 Lyngstrand. I, selfish! Good heavens! Oh, if only you knew me a little
 better than you do! (Bending closer to her.) Miss Wangel, when once I am
 gone--and that will be very soon now--
 
 Bolette (looks pityingly at him). Oh, don't think of anything so sad!
 
 Lyngstrand. But, really, I don't think it is so very sad.
 
 Bolette. What do you mean?
 
 Lyngstrand. Well, you know that I set out in a month. First from here,
 and then, of course, I'm going south.
 
 Bolette. Oh, I see! Of course.
 
 Lyngstrand. Will you think of me sometimes, then, Miss Wangel?
 
 Bolette. Yes, gladly.
 
 Lyngstrand (pleased). No, promise!
 
 Bolette. I promise.
 
 Lyngstrand. By all that is sacred, Miss Bolette?
 
 Bolette. By all that is sacred. (In a changed manner.) Oh, but what can
 come of it all? Nothing on earth can come of it!
 
 Lyngstrand. How can you say that! It would be so delightful for me to
 know you were at home here thinking of me!
 
 Bolette. Well, and what else?
 
 Lyngstrand. I don't exactly know of anything else.
 
 Bolette. Nor I either. There are so many things in the way. Everything
 stands in the way, I think.
 
 Lyngstrand. Oh, another miracle might come about. Some happy
 dispensation of fortune, or something of the sort; for I really believe
 I shall be lucky now.
 
 Bolette (eagerly). Really? You do believe that?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, I believe it thoroughly. And so--after a few
 years--when I come home again as a celebrated sculptor, and well off,
 and in perfect health!
 
 Bolette. Yes, yes! Of course, we will hope so.
 
 Lyngstrand. You may be perfectly certain about it. Only think faithfully
 and kindly of me when I am down there in the south; and now I have your
 word that you will.
 
 Bolette. You have (shaking her head). But, all the same, nothing will
 surely come of it.
 
 Lyngstrand. Oh! yes, Miss Bolette. At least this will come of it. I
 shall get on so much more easily and quickly with my art work.
 
 Bolette. Do you believe that, too?
 
 Lyngstrand. I have an inner conviction of it. And I fancy it will be so
 cheering for you, too--here in this out-of-the-way place-to know within
 yourself that you are, so to say, helping me to create.
 
 Bolette (looking at him). Well; but you on your side?
 
 Lyngstrand. I?
 
 Bolette (looking out into the garden). Hush! Let us speak of something
 else. Here's Mr. Arnholm.
 
 (ARNHOLM is seen in the garden below. He stops and talks to HILDE and
 BALLESTED.)
 
 Lyngstrand. Are you fond of your old teacher, Miss Bolette?
 
 Bolette. Fond of him?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes; I mean do you care for him?
 
 Bolette. Yes, indeed I do, for he is a true friend--and adviser,
 too--and then he is always so ready to help when he can.
 
 Lyngstrand. Isn't it extraordinary that he hasn't married!
 
 Bolette. Do you think it is extraordinary?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, for you say he's well-to-do.
 
 Bolette. He is certainly said to be so. But probably it wasn't so easy
 to find anyone who'd have him.
 
 Lyngstrand. Why?
 
 Bolette. Oh! He's been the teacher of nearly all the young girls that he
 knows. He says that himself.
 
 Lyngstrand. But what does that matter?
 
 Bolette. Why, good heavens! One doesn't marry a man who's been your
 teacher!
 
 Lyngstrand. Don't you think a young girl might love her teacher?
 
 Bolette. Not after she's really grown up.
 
 Lyngstrand. No--fancy that!
 
 Bolette (cautioning him). Sh! sh!
 
 (Meanwhile BALLESTED has been gathering together his things, and carries
 them out from the garden to the right. HILDE helps him. ARNHOLM goes up
 the verandah, and comes into the room.)
 
 Arnholm. Good-morning, my dear Bolette. Good-morning, Mr.--Mr.--hm--(He
 looks displeased, and nods coldly to LYNGSTRAND, who rises.)
 
 Bolette (rising up and going up to ARNHOLM). Good-morning, Mr. Arnholm.
 
 Arnholm. Everything all right here today?
 
 Bolette. Yes, thanks, quite.
 
 Arnholm. Has your stepmother gone to bathe again today?
 
 Bolette. No. She is upstairs in her room.
 
 Arnholm. Not very bright?
 
 Bolette. I don't know, for she has locked herself in.
 
 Arnholm. Hm--has she?
 
 Lyngstrand. I suppose Mrs. Wangel was very much frightened about that
 American yesterday?
 
 Arnholm. What do you know about that?
 
 Lyngstrand. I told Mrs. Wangel that I had seen him in the flesh behind
 the garden.
 
 Arnholm. Oh! I see.
 
 Bolette (to ARNHOLM). No doubt you and father sat up very late last
 night, talking?
 
 Arnholm. Yes, rather late. We were talking over serious matters.
 
 Bolette. Did you put in a word for me, and my affairs, too?
 
 Arnholm. No, dear Bolette, I couldn't manage it. He was so completely
 taken up with something else.
 
 Bolette (sighs). Ah! yes; he always is.
 
 Arnholm (looks at her meaningly). But later on today we'll talk more
 fully about--the matter. Where's your father now? Not at home?
 
 Bolette. Yes, he is. He must be down in the office. I'll fetch him.
 
 Arnholm. No, thanks. Don't do that. I'd rather go down to him.
 
 Bolette (listening). Wait one moment, Mr. Arnholm; I believe that's
 father on the stairs. Yes, I suppose he's been up to look after her.
 
 (WANGEL comes in from the door on the left.)
 
 Wangel (shaking ARNHOLM'S hand). What, dear friend, are you here
 already? It was good of you to come so early, for I should like to talk
 a little further with you.
 
 Bolette (to LYNGSTRAND). Hadn't we better go down to Hilde in the
 garden?
 
 Lyngstrand. I shall be delighted, Miss Wangel.
 
 (He and BOLETTE go down into the garden, and pass out between the trees
 in the background.)
 
 Arnholm (following them with his eyes, turns to WANGEL). Do you know
 anything about that young man?
 
 Wangel. No, nothing at all.
 
 Arnholm. But do you think it right he should knock about so much with
 the girls?
 
 Wangel. Does he? I really hadn't noticed it.
 
 Arnholm. You ought to see to it, I think.
 
 Wangel. Yes, I suppose you're right. But, good Lord! What's a man to
 do? The girls are so accustomed to look after themselves now. They won't
 listen to me, nor to Ellida.
 
 Arnholm. Not to her either?
 
 Wangel. No; and besides I really cannot expect Ellida to trouble about
 such things. She's not fit for that (breaking off). But it wasn't that
 which we were to talk of. Now tell me, have you thought the matter
 over--thought over all I told you of?
 
 Arnholm. I have thought of nothing else ever since we parted last night.
 
 Wangel. And what do you think should be done?
 
 Arnholm. Dear Wangel, I think you, as a doctor, must know that better
 than I.
 
 Wangel. Oh! if you only knew how difficult it is for a doctor to judge
 rightly about a patient who is so dear to him! Besides, this is no
 ordinary illness. No ordinary doctor and no ordinary medicines can help
 her.
 
 Arnholm. How is she today?
 
 Wangel. I was upstairs with her just now, and then she seemed to me
 quite calm; but behind all her moods something lies hidden which it
 is impossible for me to fathom; and then she is so changeable, so
 capricious--she varies so suddenly.
 
 Arnholm. No doubt that is the result of her morbid state of mind.
 
 Wangel. Not altogether. When you go down to the bedrock, it was born in
 her. Ellida belongs to the sea-folk. That is the matter.
 
 Arnholm. What do you really mean, my dear doctor?
 
 Wangel. Haven't you noticed that the people from out there by the open
 sea are, in a way, a people apart? It is almost as if they themselves
 lived the life of the sea. There is the rush of waves, and ebb and flow
 too, both in their thoughts and in their feelings, and so they can never
 bear transplanting. Oh! I ought to have remembered that. It was a sin
 against Ellida to take her away from there, and bring her here.
 
 Arnholm. You have come to that opinion?
 
 Wangel. Yes, more and more. But I ought to have told myself this
 beforehand. Oh! I knew it well enough at bottom! But I put it from me.
 For, you see, I loved her so! Therefore, I thought of myself first of
 all. I was inexcusably selfish at that time!
 
 Arnholm. Hm. I suppose every man is a little selfish under such
 circumstances. Moreover, I've never noticed that vice in you, Doctor
 Wangel.
 
 Wangel (walks uneasily about the room). Oh, yes! And I have been since
 then, too. Why, I am so much, much older than she is. I ought to have
 been at once as a father to her and a guide. I ought to have done my
 best to develop and enlighten her mind. Unfortunately nothing ever came
 of that. You see, I hadn't stamina enough, for I preferred her just as
 she was. So things went worse and worse with her, and then I didn't
 know what to do. (In a lower voice.) That was why I wrote to you in my
 trouble, and asked you to come here.
 
 Arnholm (looks at him in astonishment). What, was it for this you wrote?
 
 Wangel. Yes; but don't let anyone notice anything.
 
 Arnholm. How on earth, dear doctor--what good did you expect me to be? I
 don't understand it.
 
 Wangel. No, naturally. For I was on an altogether false track. I thought
 Ellida's heart had at one time gone out to you, and that she still
 secretly cared for you a little--that perhaps it would do her good to
 see you again, and talk of her home and the old days.
 
 Arnholm. So it was your wife you meant when you wrote that she expected
 me, and--and perhaps longed for me.
 
 Wangel. Yes, who else?
 
 Arnholm (hurriedly). No, no. You're right. But I didn't understand.
 
 Wangel. Naturally, as I said, for I was on an absolutely wrong track.
 
 Arnholm. And you call yourself selfish!
 
 Wangel. Ah! but I had such a great sin to atone for. I felt I dared not
 neglect any means that might give the slightest relief to her mind.
 
 Arnholm. How do you really explain the power this stranger exercises
 over her?
 
 Wangel. Hm--dear friend--there may be sides to the matter that cannot be
 explained.
 
 Arnholm. Do you mean anything inexplicable in itself--absolutely
 inexplicable?
 
 Wangel. In any case not explicable as far as we know.
 
 Arnholm. Do you believe there is something in it, then?
 
 Wangel. I neither believe nor deny; I simply don't know. That's why I
 leave it alone.
 
 Arnholm. Yes. But just one thing: her extraordinary, weird assertion
 about the child's eyes--
 
 Wangel (eagerly). I don't believe a word about the eyes. I will not
 believe such a thing. It must be purely fancy on her part, nothing else.
 
 Arnholm. Did you notice the man's eyes when you saw him yesterday?
 
 Wangel. Of course I did.
 
 Arnholm. And you saw no sort of resemblance?
 
 Wangel (evasively). Hm--good heavens! What shall I say? It wasn't quite
 light when I saw him; and, besides, Ellida had been saying so much about
 this resemblance, I really don't know if I was capable of observing
 quite impartially.
 
 Arnholm. Well, well, may be. But that other matter? All this terror and
 unrest coming upon her at the very time, as it seems, this strange man
 was on his way home.
 
 Wangel. That--oh! that's something she must have persuaded and dreamed
 herself into since it happened. She was not seized with this so
 suddenly--all at once--as she now maintains. But since she heard from
 young Lyngstrand that Johnston--or Friman, or whatever his name is--was
 on his way hither, three years ago, in the month of March, she now
 evidently believes her unrest of mind came upon her at that very time.
 
 Arnholm. It was not so, then?
 
 Wangel. By no means. There were signs and symptoms of it before this
 time, though it did happen, by chance, that in that month of March,
 three years ago, she had a rather severe attack.
 
 Arnholm. After all, then--?
 
 Wangel. Yes, but that is easily accounted for by the circumstances--the
 condition she happened to be in at the time.
 
 Arnholm. So, symptom for symptom, then.
 
 Wangel (wringing his hands). And not to be able to help her! Not to know
 how to counsel her! To see no way!
 
 Arnholm. Now if you could make up your mind to leave this place, to go
 somewhere else, so that she could live amid surroundings that would seem
 more homelike to her?
 
 Wangel. Ah, dear friend! Do you think I haven't offered her that, too? I
 suggested moving out to Skjoldviken, but she will not.
 
 Arnholm. Not that either?
 
 Wangel. No, for she doesn't think it would be any good; and perhaps
 she's right.
 
 Arnholm. Hm. Do you say that?
 
 Wangel. Moreover, when I think it all over carefully, I really don't
 know how I could manage it. I don't think I should be justified, for the
 sake of the girls, in going away to such a desolate place. After
 all, they must live where there is at least a prospect of their being
 provided for someday.
 
 Arnholm. Provided for! Are you thinking about that already?
 
 Wangel. Heaven knows, I must think of that too! But then, on the other
 hand, again, my poor sick Ellida! Oh, dear Arnholm! in many respects I
 seem to be standing between fire and water!
 
 Arnholm. Perhaps you've no need to worry on Bolette's account. (Breaking
 off.) I should like to know where she--where they have gone. (Goes up to
 the open door and looks out.)
 
 Wangel. Oh, I would so gladly make any sacrifice for all three of them,
 if only I knew what!
 
 (ELLIDA enters from the door on the left.)
 
 Ellida (quickly to WANGEL). Be sure you don't go out this morning.
 
 Wangel. No, no! of course not. I will stay at home with you. (Pointing
 to ARNHOLM, who is coming towards them.) But won't you speak to our
 friend?
 
 Ellida (turning). Oh, are you here, Mr. Arnholm? (Holding out her hand
 to him.) Good-morning.
 
 Arnholm. Good-morning, Mrs. Wangel. So you've not been bathing as usual
 today?
 
 Ellida. No, no, no! That is out of the question today. But won't you sit
 down a moment?
 
 Arnholm. No, thanks, not now. (Looks at WANGEL.) I promised the girls to
 go down to them in the garden.
 
 Ellida. Goodness knows if you'll find them there. I never know where
 they may be rambling.
 
 Wangel. They're sure to be down by the pond.
 
 Arnholm. Oh! I shall find them right enough. (Nods, and goes out across
 the verandah into the garden.)
 
 Ellida. What time is it, Wangel?
 
 Wangel (looking at his watch). A little past eleven.
 
 Ellida. A little past. And at eleven o'clock, or half-past eleven
 tonight, the steamer is coming. If only that were over!
 
 Wangel (going nearer to her). Dear Ellida, there is one thing I should
 like to ask you.
 
 Ellida. What is it?
 
 Wangel. The evening before last--up at the "View"--you said that during
 the last three years you had so often seen him bodily before you.
 
 Ellida. And so I have. You may believe that.
 
 Wangel. But, how did you see him?
 
 Ellida. How did I see him?
 
 Wangel. I mean, how did he look when you thought you saw him?
 
 Ellida. But, dear Wangel, why, you now know yourself how he looks.
 
 Wangel. Did he look exactly like that in your imagination?
 
 Ellida. He did.
 
 Wangel. Exactly the same as you saw him in reality yesterday evening?
 
 Ellida. Yes, exactly.
 
 Wangel. Then how was it you did not at once recognise him?
 
 Ellida. Did I not?
 
 Wangel. No; you said yourself afterwards that at first you did not at
 all know who the strange man was.
 
 Ellida (perplexed). I really believe you are right. Don't you think that
 strange, Wangel? Fancy my not knowing him at once!
 
 Wangel. It was only the eyes, you said.
 
 Ellida. Oh, yes! The eyes--the eyes.
 
 Wangel. Well, but at the "View" you said that he always appeared to you
 exactly as he was when you parted out there--ten years ago.
 
 Ellida. Did I?
 
 Wangel. Yes.
 
 Ellida. Then, I suppose he did look much as he does now.
 
 Wangel. No. On our way home, the day before yesterday, you gave quite
 another description of him. Ten years ago he had no beard, you said.
 His dress, too, was quite different. And that breast-pin with the pearl?
 That man yesterday wore nothing of the sort.
 
 Ellida. No, he did not.
 
 Wangel (looks searchingly at her). Now just think a little, dear Ellida.
 Or perhaps you can't quite remember how he looked when he stood by you
 at Bratthammer?
 
 Ellida (thoughtfully closing her eyes for a moment). Not quite
 distinctly. No, today I can't. Is it not strange?
 
 Wangel. Not so very strange after all. You have now been confronted by a
 new and real image, and that overshadows the old one, so that you can no
 longer see it.
 
 Ellida. Do you believe that, Wangel?
 
 Wangel. Yes. And it overshadows your sick imaginings, too. That is why
 it is good a reality has come.
 
 Ellida. Good? Do you think it good?
 
 Wangel. Yes. That it has come. It may restore you to health.
 
 Ellida (sitting down on sofa). Wangel, come and sit down by me. I must
 tell you all my thoughts.
 
 Wangel. Yes, do, dear Ellida.
 
 (He sits down on a chair on the other side of the table.)
 
 Ellida. It was really a great misfortune--for us both--that we two of
 all people should have come together.
 
 Wangel (amazed). What are you saying?
 
 Ellida. Oh, yes, it was. And it's so natural. It could bring nothing but
 unhappiness, after the way in which we came together.
 
 Wangel. What was there in that way?
 
 Ellida. Listen, Wangel; it's no use going on, lying to ourselves and to
 one another.
 
 Wangel. Are we doing so? Lying, you say?
 
 Ellida. Yes, we are; or, at least, we suppress the truth. For the
 truth--the pure and simple truth is--that you came out there and bought
 me.
 
 Wangel. Bought--you say bought!
 
 Ellida. Oh! I wasn't a bit better than you. I accepted the bargain. Sold
 myself to you!
 
 Wangel (looks at her full of pain). Ellida, have you really the heart to
 call it that?
 
 Ellida. But is there any other name for it? You could no longer bear the
 emptiness of your house. You were on the look-out for a new wife.
 
 Wangel. And a new mother for the children, Ellida.
 
 Ellida. That too, perhaps, by the way; although you didn't in the least
 know if I were fit for the position. Why, you had only seen me and
 spoken to me a few times. Then you wanted me, and so--
 
 Wangel. Yes, you may call it as you will.
 
 Ellida. And I, on my side--why, I was so helpless and bewildered, and
 so absolutely alone. Oh! it was so natural I should accept the bargain,
 when you came and proposed to provide for me all my life.
 
 Wangel. Assuredly it did not seem to me a providing for you, dear
 Ellida. I asked you honestly if you would share with me and the children
 the little I could call my own.
 
 Ellida. Yes, you did; but all the same, I should never have accepted!
 Never have accepted that at any price! Not sold myself! Better the
 meanest work--better the poorest life--after one's own choice.
 
 Wangel (rising). Then have the five--six years that we have lived
 together been so utterly worthless to you?
 
 Ellida. Oh! Don't think that, Wangel. I have been as well cared for here
 as human being could desire. But I did not enter your house freely. That
 is the thing.
 
 Wangel (looking at her). Not freely!
 
 Ellida. No. It was not freely that I went with you.
 
 Wangel (in subdued tone). Ah! I remember your words of yesterday.
 
 Ellida. It all lies in those words. They have enlightened me; and so I
 see it all now.
 
 Wangel. What do you see?
 
 Ellida. I see that the life we two live together--is really no marriage.
 
 Wangel (bitterly). You have spoken truly there. The life we now live is
 not a marriage.
 
 Ellida. Nor was it formerly. Never--not from the very first (looks
 straight in front of her). The first--that might have been a complete
 and real marriage.
 
 Wangel. The first--what do you mean?
 
 Ellida. Mine--with him.
 
 Wangel (looks at her in astonishment). I do not in the least understand
 you.
 
 Ellida. Ah! dear Wangel, let us not lie to one another, nor to
 ourselves.
 
 Wangel. Well--what more?
 
 Ellida. You see--we can never get away from that one thing--that a
 freely given promise is fully as binding as a marriage.
 
 Wangel. But what on earth--
 
 Ellida (rising impetuously). Set me free, Wangel!
 
 Wangel. Ellida! Ellida!
 
 Ellida. Yes, yes! Oh! grant me that! Believe me, it will come to that
 all the same--after the way we two came together.
 
 Wangel (conquering his pain). It has come to this, then?
 
 Ellida. It has come to this. It could not be otherwise.
 
 Wangel (looking gloomily at her). So I have not won you by our living
 together. Never, never possessed you quite.
 
 Ellida. Ah! Wangel--if only I could love you, how gladly I would--as
 dearly as you deserve. But I feel it so well--that will never be.
 
 Wangel. Divorce, then? It is a divorce, a complete, legal divorce that
 you want?
 
 Ellida. Dear, you understand me so little! I care nothing for such
 formalities. Such outer things matter nothing, I think. What I want is
 that we should, of our own free will, release each other.
 
 Wangel (bitterly, nods slowly). To cry off the bargain again--yes.
 
 Ellida (quickly). Exactly. To cry off the bargain.
 
 Wangel. And then, Ellida? Afterwards? Have you reflected what life would
 be to both of us? What life would be to both you and me?
 
 Ellida. No matter. Things must turn out afterwards as they may. What I
 beg and implore of you, Wangel, is the most important. Only set me free!
 Give me back my complete freedom!
 
 Wangel. Ellida, it is a fearful thing you ask of me. At least give me
 time to collect myself before I come to a decision. Let us talk it over
 more carefully. And you yourself--take time to consider what you are
 doing.
 
 Ellida. But we have no time to lose with such matters. I must have my
 freedom again today.
 
 Wangel. Why today?
 
 Ellida. Because he is coming tonight.
 
 Wangel (starts). Coming! He! What has this stranger to do with it?
 
 Ellida. I want to face him in perfect freedom.
 
 Wangel. And what--what else do you intend to do?
 
 Ellida. I will not hide behind the fact that I am the wife of another
 man; nor make the excuse that I have no choice, for then it would be no
 decision.
 
 Wangel, You speak of a choice. Choice, Ellida! A choice in such a
 matter!
 
 Ellida. Yes, I must be free to choose--to choose for either side. I must
 be able to let him go away--alone, or to go with him.
 
 Wangel. Do you know what you are saying? Go with him--give your whole
 life into his hands!
 
 Ellida. Didn't I give my life into your hands, and without any ado?
 
 Wangel. Maybe. But he! He! an absolute stranger! A man of whom you know
 so little!
 
 Ellida. Ah! but after all I knew you even less; and yet I went with you.
 
 Wangel. Then you knew to some extent what life lay before you. But now?
 Think! What do you know? You know absolutely nothing. Not even who or
 what he is.
 
 Ellida (looking in front of her). That is true; but that is the terror.
 
 Wangel. Yes, indeed, it is terrible!
 
 Ellida. That is why I feel I must plunge into it.
 
 Wangel (looking at her). Because it seems terrible?
 
 Ellida. Yes; because of that.
 
 Wangel (coming closer). Listen, Ellida. What do you really mean by
 terrible?
 
 Ellida (reflectively). The terrible is that which repels and attracts.
 
 Wangel. Attracts, you say?
 
 Ellida. Attracts most of all, I think.
 
 Wangel (slowly). You are one with the sea.
 
 Ellida. That, too, is a terror.
 
 Wangel. And that terror is in you. You both repel and attract.
 
 Ellida. Do you think so, Wangel?
 
 Wangel. After all, I have never really known you--never really. Now I am
 beginning to understand.
 
 Ellida. And that is why you must set me free! Free me from every bond to
 you--and yours. I am not what you took me for. Now you see it yourself.
 Now we can part as friends--and freely.
 
 Wangel (sadly). Perhaps it would be better for us both if we parted--And
 yet, I cannot! You are the terror to me, Ellida; the attraction is what
 is strongest in you.
 
 Ellida. Do you say that?
 
 Wangel. Let us try and live through this day wisely--in perfect quiet
 of mind. I dare not set you free, and release you today. I have no right
 to. No right for your own sake, Ellida. I exercise my right and my duty
 to protect you.
 
 Ellida. Protect? What is there to protect me from? I am not threatened
 by any outward power. The terror lies deeper, Wangel. The terror is--the
 attraction in my own mind. And what can you do against that?
 
 Wangel. I can strengthen and urge you to fight against it.
 
 Ellida. Yes; if I wished to fight against it.
 
 Wangel. Then you do not wish to?
 
 Ellida. Oh! I don't know myself.
 
 Wangel. Tonight all will be decided, dear Ellida--Ellida (bursting out).
 Yes, think! The decision so near--the decision for one's whole life!
 
 Wangel. And then tomorrow--Ellida. Tomorrow! Perhaps my real future will
 have been ruined.
 
 Wangel. Your real--Ellida. The whole, full life of freedom lost--lost
 for me, and perhaps for him also.
 
 Wangel (in a lower tone, seizing her wrist). Ellida, do you love this
 stranger?
 
 Ellida. Do I? Oh, how can I tell! I only know that to me he is a terror,
 and that--
 
 Wangel. And that--
 
 Ellida (tearing herself away). And that it is to him I think I belong.
 
 Wangel (bowing his head). I begin to understand better.
 
 Ellida. And what remedy have you for that? What advice to give me?
 
 Wangel (looking sadly at her). Tomorrow he will be gone, then the
 misfortune will be averted from your head; and then I will consent to
 set you free. We will cry off the bargain tomorrow, Ellida.
 
 Ellida. Ah, Wangel, tomorrow! That is too late.
 
 Wangel (looking towards garden). The children--the children! Let us
 spare them, at least for the present.
 
 (ARNHOLM, BOLETTE, HILDE, and LYNGSTRAND come into the garden.
 LYNGSTRAND says goodbye in the garden, and goes out. The rest come into
 the room.)
 
 Arnholm. You must know we have been making plans.
 
 Hilde. We're going out to the fjord tonight and--
 
 Bolette. No; you mustn't tell.
 
 Wangel. We two, also, have been making plans.
 
 Arnholm. Ah!--really?
 
 Wangel. Tomorrow Ellida is going away to Skjoldviken for a time.
 
 Bolette. Going away?
 
 Arnholm. Now, look here, that's very sensible, Mrs. Wangel.
 
 Wangel. Ellida wants to go home again--home to the sea.
 
 Hilde (springing towards ELLIDA). You are going away--away from us?
 
 Ellida (frightened). Hilde! What is the matter?
 
 Hilde (controlling herself). Oh, it's nothing. (In a low voice, turning
 from her.) Are only you going?
 
 Bolette (anxiously). Father--I see it--you, too, are going--to
 Skjoldviken!
 
 Wangel. No, no! Perhaps I shall run out there every now and again.
 
 Bolette. And come here to us?
 
 Wangel. I will--Bolette. Every now and again!
 
 Wangel. Dear child, it must be. (He crosses the room.)
 
 Arnholm (whispers). We will talk it over later, Bolette. (He crosses to
 WANGEL. They speak in low tones up stage by the door.)
 
 Ellida (aside to BOLETTE). What was the matter with Hilde? She looked
 quite scared.
 
 Bolette. Have you never noticed what Hilde goes about here, day in, day
 out, hungering for?
 
 Ellida. Hungering for?
 
 Bolette. Ever since you came into the house?
 
 Ellida. No, no. What is it?
 
 Bolette. One loving word from you.
 
 Ellida. Oh! If there should be something for me to do here!
 
 (She clasps her hands together over her head, and looks fixedly in
 front of her, as if torn by contending thoughts and emotions. WANGEL and
 ARNHOLM come across the room whispering. BOLETTE goes to the side room,
 and looks in. Then she throws open the door.)
 
 Bolette. Father, dear--the table is laid--if you--
 
 Wangel (with forced composure). Is it, child? That's well. Come,
 Arnholm! We'll go in and drink a farewell cup--with the "Lady from the
 Sea." (They go out through the right.)
 
 
 
 
 ACT V
 
 (SCENE.--The distant part of DOCTOR WANGEL'S garden, and the carp pond.
 The summer night gradually darkens.
 
 ARNHOLM, BOLETTE, LYNGSTRAND and HILDE are in a boat, punting along the
 shore to the left.)
 
 Hilde. See! We can jump ashore easily here.
 
 Arnholm. No, no; don't!
 
 Lyngstrand. I can't jump, Miss Hilde.
 
 Hilde. Can't you jump either, Arnholm?
 
 Arnholm. I'd rather not try.
 
 Bolette. Then let's land down there, by the bathing steps.
 
 (They push off. At the same moment BALLESTED comes along the footpath,
 carrying music-books and a French horn. He bows to those in the boat,
 turns and speaks to them. The answers are heard farther and farther
 away.)
 
 Ballested. What do you say? Yes, of course it's on account of the
 English steamer; for this is her last visit here this year. But if
 you want to enjoy the pleasures of melody, you mustn't wait too long.
 (Calling out.) What? (Shaking his head.) Can't hear what you say!
 
 (ELLIDA, with a shawl over her head, enters, followed by DOCTOR WANGEL.)
 
 Wangel. But, dear Ellida, I assure you there's plenty of time.
 
 Ellida. No, no, there is not! He may come any moment.
 
 Ballested (outside the fence). Hallo! Good-evening, doctor.
 Good-evening, Mrs. Wangel.
 
 Wangel (noticing him). Oh! is it you? Is there to be music tonight?
 
 Ballested. Yes; the Wind Band Society thought of making themselves
 heard. We've no dearth of festive occasions nowadays. Tonight it's in
 honour of the English ship.
 
 Ellida. The English ship! Is she in sight already?
 
 Ballested. Not yet. But you know she comes from between the islands. You
 can't see anything of her, and then she's alongside of you.
 
 Ellida. Yes, that is so.
 
 Wangel (half to ELLIDA). Tonight is the last voyage, then she will not
 come again.
 
 Ballested. A sad thought, doctor, and that's why we're going to give
 them an ovation, as the saying is. Ah! Yes--ah! yes. The glad summertime
 will soon be over now. Soon all ways will be barred, as they say in the
 tragedy.
 
 Ellida. All ways barred--yes!
 
 Ballested. It's sad to think of. We have been the joyous children of
 summer for weeks and months now. It's hard to reconcile yourself to
 the dark days--just at first, I mean. For men can accli--a--acclimatise
 themselves, Mrs. Wangel. Ay, indeed they can. (Bows, and goes off to the
 left.)
 
 Ellida (looking out at the fjord). Oh, this terrible suspense! This
 torturing last half-hour before the decision!
 
 Wangel. You are determined, then, to speak to him yourself?
 
 Ellida. I must speak to him myself; for it is freely that I must make my
 choice.
 
 Wangel. You have no choice, Ellida. You have no right to choose--no
 right without my permission.
 
 Ellida. You can never prevent the choice, neither you nor anyone. You
 can forbid me to go away with him--to follow him--in case I should
 choose to do that. You can keep me here by force--against my will. That
 you can do. But that I should choose, choose from my very soul--choose
 him, and not you--in case I would and did choose thus--this you cannot
 prevent.
 
 Wangel. No; you are right. I cannot prevent that.
 
 Ellida. And so I have nothing to help me to resist. Here, at home, there
 is no single thing that attracts me and binds me. I am so absolutely
 rootless in your house, Wangel. The children are not mine--their hearts,
 I mean--never have been. When I go, if I do go, either with him tonight,
 or to Skjoldviken tomorrow, I haven't a key to give up, an order to give
 about anything whatsoever. I am absolutely rootless in your house--I
 have been absolutely outside everything from the very first.
 
 Wangel. You yourself wished it.
 
 Ellida. No, no, I did not. I neither wished nor did not wish it. I
 simply left things just as I found them the day I came here. It is you,
 and no one else, who wished it.
 
 Wangel. I thought to do all for the best for you.
 
 Ellida. Yes, Wangel, I know it so well! But there is retribution in
 that, a something that avenges itself. For now I find no binding power
 here-nothing to strengthen me--nothing to help me--nothing to draw me
 towards what should have been the strongest possession of us both.
 
 Wangel. I see it, Ellida. And that is why from t-morrow you shall have
 back your freedom. Henceforth, you shall live your own life.
 
 Ellida. And you call that my own life! No! My own true life lost its
 bearings when I agreed to live with you. (Clenches her hand in fear
 and unrest.) And now--tonight--in half an hour, he whom I forsook is
 coming--he to whom I should have cleaved forever, even as he has cleaved
 to me! Now he is coming to offer me--for the last and only time--the
 chance of living my life over again, of living my own true life--the
 life that terrifies and attracts--and I can not forgo that--not freely.
 
 Wangel. That is why it is necessary your husband--and your
 doctor--should take the power of acting from you, and act on your
 behalf.
 
 Ellida. Yes, Wangel, I quite understand. Believe me, there are times
 when I think it would be peace and deliverance if with all my soul
 I could be bound to you--and try to brave all that terrifies--and
 attracts. But I cannot! No, no, I cannot do that!
 
 Wangel. Come, Ellida, let us walk up and down together for awhile.
 
 Ellida. I would gladly--but I dare not. For he said I was to wait for
 him here.
 
 Wangel. Come! There is time enough.
 
 Ellida. Do you think so?
 
 Wangel. Plenty of time, I tell you.
 
 Ellida. Then let us go, for a little while.
 
 (They pass out in the foreground. At the same time ARNHOLM and BOLETTE
 appear by the upper bank of the pond.)
 
 Bolette (noticing the two as they go out). See there--
 
 Arnholm (in low voice). Hush! Let them go. Bolette. Can you understand
 what has been going on between them these last few days?
 
 Arnholm. Have you noticed anything?
 
 Bolette. Have I not!
 
 Arnholm. Anything peculiar?
 
 Bolette. Yes, one thing and another. Haven't you?
 
 Arnholm. Well--I don't exactly know.
 
 Bolette. Yes, you have; only you won't speak out about it.
 
 Arnholm. I think it will do your stepmother good to go on this little
 journey.
 
 Bolette. Do you think so?
 
 Arnholm. I should say it would be well for all parties that she should
 get away every now and then.
 
 Bolette. If she does go home to Skjoldviken tomorrow, she will never
 come back here again!
 
 Arnholm. My dear Bolette, whatever makes you think that?
 
 Bolette. I am quite convinced of it. Just you wait; you'll see that
 she'll not come back again; not anyhow as long as I and Hilde are in the
 house here.
 
 Arnholm. Hilde, too?
 
 Bolette. Well, it might perhaps be all right with Hilde. For she is
 scarcely more than a child. And I believe that at bottom she worships
 Ellida. But, you see, it's different with me--a stepmother who isn't so
 very much older than oneself!
 
 Arnholm. Dear Bolette, perhaps it might, after all, not be so very long
 before you left.
 
 Bolette (eagerly). Really! Have you spoken to father about it?
 
 Arnholm. Yes, I have.
 
 Bolette. Well, what does he say?
 
 Arnholm. Hm! Well, your father's so thoroughly taken up with other
 matters just now--
 
 Bolette. Yes, yes! that's how I knew it would be.
 
 Arnholm. But I got this much out of him. You mustn't reckon upon any
 help from him.
 
 Bolette. No?
 
 Arnholm. He explained his circumstances to me clearly; he thought that
 such a thing was absolutely out of the question, impossible for him.
 
 Bolette (reproachfully). And you had the heart to come and mock me?
 
 Arnholm. I've certainly not done that, dear Bolette. It depends wholly
 and solely upon yourself whether you go away or not.
 
 Bolette. What depends upon me?
 
 Arnholm. Whether you are to go out into the world--learn all you most
 care for--take part in all you are hungering after here at home--live
 your life under brighter conditions, Bolette.
 
 Bolette (clasping her hands together). Good God! But it's impossible! If
 father neither can nor will--and I have no one else on earth to whom I
 could turn--Arnholm. Couldn't you make up your mind to accept a little
 help from your old--from your former teacher?
 
 Bolette. From you, Mr. Arnholm! Would you be willing to--
 
 Arnholm. Stand by you! Yes--with all my heart. Both with word and in
 deed. You may count upon it. Then you accept? Well? Do you agree?
 
 Bolette. Do I agree! To get away--to see the world--to learn something
 thoroughly! All that seemed to be a great, beautiful impossibility!
 
 Arnholm. All that may now become a reality to you, if only you yourself
 wish it.
 
 Bolette. And to all this unspeakable happiness you will help me! Oh, no!
 Tell me, can I accept such an offer from a stranger?
 
 Arnholm. You can from me, Bolette. From me you can accept anything.
 
 Bolette (seizing his hands). Yes, I almost think I can! I don't know how
 it is, but--(bursting out) Oh! I could both laugh and cry for joy, for
 happiness! Then I should know life really after all. I began to be so
 afraid life would pass me by.
 
 Arnholm. You need not fear that, Bolette. But now you must tell me quite
 frankly--if there is anything--anything you are bound to here.
 
 Bolette. Bound to? Nothing.
 
 Arnholm. Nothing whatever?
 
 Bolette. No, nothing at all. That is--I am bound to father to some
 extent. And to Hilde, too. But--
 
 Arnholm. Well, you'll have to leave your father sooner or later.
 And some time Hilde also will go her own way in life. That is only a
 question of time. Nothing more. And so there is nothing else that binds
 you, Bolette? Not any kind of connection?
 
 Bolette. Nothing whatever. As far as that goes, I could leave at any
 moment.
 
 Arnholm. Well, if that is so, dear Bolette, you shall go away with me!
 
 Bolette (clapping her hands). Oh God! What joy to think of it!
 
 Arnholm. For I hope you trust me fully?
 
 Bolette. Indeed, I do!
 
 Arnholm. And you dare to trust yourself and your future fully and
 confidently into my hands, Bolette? Is that true? You will dare to do
 this?
 
 Bolette. Of course; how could I not do so? Could you believe anything
 else? You, who have been my old teacher--my teacher in the old days, I
 mean.
 
 Arnholm. Not because of that. I will not consider that side of the
 matter; but--well, so you are free, Bolette! There is nothing that binds
 you, and so I ask you, if you could--if you could--bind yourself to me
 for life?
 
 Bolette (steps back frightened). What are you saying?
 
 Arnholm. For all your life, Bolette. Will you be my wife?
 
 Bolette (half to herself). No, no, no! That is impossible, utterly
 impossible!
 
 Arnholm. It is really so absolutely impossible for you to--
 
 Bolette. But, surely, you cannot mean what you are saying, Mr. Arnholm!
 (Looking at him.) Or--yet--was that what you meant when you offered to
 do so much for me?
 
 Arnholm. You must listen to me one moment, Bolette. I suppose I have
 greatly surprised you!
 
 Bolette. Oh! how could such a thing from you--how could it but--but
 surprise me!
 
 Arnholm. Perhaps you are right. Of course, you didn't--you could not
 know it was for your sake I made this journey.
 
 Bolette. Did you come here for--for my sake?
 
 Arnholm. I did, Bolette. In the spring I received a letter from your
 father, and in it there was a passage that made me think--hm--that you
 held your former teacher in--in a little more than friendly remembrance.
 
 Bolette. How could father write such a thing?
 
 Arnholm. He did not mean it so. But I worked myself into the belief
 that here was a young girl longing for me to come again--No, you mustn't
 interrupt me, dear Bolette! And--you see, when a man like myself, who
 is no longer quite young, has such a belief--or fancy, it makes an
 overwhelming impression. There grew within me a living, a grateful
 affection for you; I thought I must come to you, see you again, and tell
 you I shared the feelings that I fancied you had for me.
 
 Bolette. And now you know it is not so!--that it was a mistake!
 
 Arnholm. It can't be helped, Bolette. Your image, as I bear it within
 myself, will always be coloured and stamped with the impression that
 this mistake gave me. Perhaps you cannot understand this; but still it
 is so.
 
 Bolette. I never thought such a thing possible.
 
 Arnholm. But now you have seen that it is possible, what do you say now,
 Bolette? Couldn't you make up your mind to be--yes--to be my wife?
 
 Bolette. Oh! it seems so utterly impossible, Mr. Arnholm. You, who have
 been my teacher! I can't imagine ever standing in any other relation
 towards you.
 
 Arnholm. Well, well, if you think you really cannot--Then our old
 relations remain unchanged, dear Bolette.
 
 Bolette. What do you mean?
 
 Arnholm. Of course, to keep my promise all the same. I will take care
 you get out into the world and see something of it. Learn some things
 you really want to know; live safe and independent. Your future I
 shall provide for also, Bolette. For in me you will always have a good,
 faithful, trustworthy friend. Be sure of that.
 
 Bolette. Good heavens! Mr. Arnholm, all that is so utterly impossible
 now.
 
 Arnholm. Is that impossible too?
 
 Bolette. Surely you can see that! After what you have just said to me,
 and after my answer--Oh! you yourself must see that it is impossible
 for me now to accept so very much from you. I can accept nothing from
 you--nothing after this.
 
 Arnholm. So you would rather stay at home here, and let life pass you
 by?
 
 Bolette. Oh! it is such dreadful misery to think of that.
 
 Arnholm. Will you renounce knowing something of the outer world?
 Renounce bearing your part in all that you yourself say you are
 hungering for? To know there is so infinitely much, and yet never really
 to understand anything of it? Think carefully, Bolette.
 
 Bolette. Yes, yes! You are right, Mr. Arnholm.
 
 Arnholm. And then, when one day your father is no longer here, then
 perhaps to be left helpless and alone in the world; or live to give
 yourself to another man--whom you, perhaps, will also feel no affection
 for--
 
 Bolette. Oh, yes! I see how true all you say is. But still--and yet
 perhaps--
 
 Arnholm (quickly). Well?
 
 Bolette (looking at him hesitatingly). Perhaps it might not be so
 impossible after all.
 
 Arnholm. What, Bolette?
 
 Bolette. Perhaps it might be possible--to accept--what you proposed to
 me.
 
 Arnholm. Do you mean that, after all, you might be willing to--that at
 all events you could give me the happiness of helping you as a steadfast
 friend?
 
 Bolette. No, no, no! Never that, for that would be utterly impossible
 now. No--Mr. Arnholm--rather take me.
 
 Arnholm. Bolette! You will?
 
 Bolette. Yes, I believe I will.
 
 Arnholm. And after all you will be my wife?
 
 Bolette. Yes; if you still think that--that you will have me.
 
 Arnholm. Think! (Seizing her hand.) Oh, thanks, thanks, Bolette. All
 else that you said--your former doubts--these do not frighten me. If I
 do not yet possess your whole heart, I shall know how to conquer it. Oh,
 Bolette, I will wait upon you hand and foot!
 
 Bolette. And then I shall see something of the world? Shall live! You
 have promised me that?
 
 Arnholm. And will keep my promise.
 
 Bolette. And I may learn everything I want to?
 
 Arnholm. I, myself, will be your teacher as formerly, Bolette. Do you
 remember the last school year?
 
 Bolette (quietly and absently). To think--to know--one's self free, and
 to get out into the strange world, and then, not to need to be anxious
 for the future--not to be harassed about one's stupid livelihood!
 
 Arnholm. No, you will never need to waste a thought upon such matters.
 And that's a good thing, too, in its way, dear Bolette, isn't it? Eh?
 
 Bolette. Indeed it is. That is certain.
 
 Arnholm (putting his arms about her). Oh, you will see how comfortably
 and easily we shall settle down together! And how well and safely and
 trustfully we two shall get on with one another, Bolette.
 
 Bolette. Yes. I also begin to--I believe really--it will answer. (Looks
 out to the right, and hurriedly frees herself.) Oh, don't say anything
 about this.
 
 Arnholm. What is it, dear?
 
 Bolette. Oh! it's that poor (pointing}--see out there.
 
 Arnholm. Is it your father?
 
 Bolette. No. It's the young sculptor. He's down there with Hilde.
 
 Arnholm. Oh, Lyngstrand! What's really the matter with him?
 
 Bolette. Why, you know how weak and delicate he is.
 
 Arnholm. Yes. Unless it's simply imaginary.
 
 Bolette. No, it's real enough! He'll not last long. But perhaps that's
 best for him.
 
 Arnholm. Dear, why should that be best?
 
 Bolette. Because--because--nothing would come of his art anyhow. Let's
 go before they come.
 
 Arnholm. Gladly, my dear Bolette.
 
 (HILDE and LYNGSTRAND appear by the pond.)
 
 Hilde. Hi, hi! Won't your honours wait for us?
 
 Arnholm. Bolette and I would rather go on a little in advance. (He and
 BOLETTE go out to the Left.)
 
 Lyngstrand (laughs quietly). It's very delightful here now. Everybody
 goes about in pairs--always two and two together.
 
 Hilde (looking after them). I could almost swear he's proposing to her.
 
 Lyngstrand. Really? Have you noticed anything?
 
 Hilde. Yes. It's not very difficult--if you keep your eyes open.
 
 Lyngstrand. But Miss Bolette won't have him. I'm certain of that.
 
 Hilde. No. For she thinks he's got so dreadfully old-looking, and she
 thinks he'll soon get bald.
 
 Lyngstrand. It's not only because of that. She'd not have him anyhow.
 
 Hilde. How can you know?
 
 Lyngstrand. Well, because there's someone else she's promised to think
 of.
 
 Hilde. Only to think of?
 
 Lyngstrand. While he is away, yes.
 
 Hilde. Oh! then I suppose it's you she's to think of.
 
 Lyngstrand. Perhaps it might be.
 
 Hilde. She promised you that?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes--think--she promised me that! But mind you don't tell
 her you know.
 
 Hilde. Oh! I'll be mum! I'm as secret as the grave.
 
 Lyngstrand. I think it's awfully kind of her.
 
 Hilde. And when you come home again--are you going to be engaged to her,
 and then marry her?
 
 Lyngstrand. No, that wouldn't very well do. For I daren't think of such
 a thing during the first years. And when I shall be able to, she'll be
 rather too old for me, I fancy.
 
 Hilde. And yet you wish her to think of you?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes; that's so useful to me. You see, I'm an artist. And she
 can very well do it, because she herself has no real calling. But all
 the same, it's kind of her.
 
 Hilde. Do you think you'll be able to get on more quickly with your work
 if you know that Bolette is here thinking of you?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, I fancy so. To know there is a spot on earth where a
 young, gentle, reserved woman is quietly dreaming about you--I fancy it
 must be so--so-well, I really don't exactly know what to call it.
 
 Hilde. Perhaps you mean--fascinating?
 
 Lyngstrand. Fascinating! Oh, yes! Fascinating was what I meant, or
 something like it. (Looks at her for a moment.) You are so clever, Miss
 Hilde. Really you are very clever. When I come home again you'll be
 about the same age as your sister is now. Perhaps, too, you'll look like
 your sister looks now. And perhaps, too, you'll be of the same mind she
 is now. Then, perhaps, you'll be both yourself and your sister--in one
 form, so to say.
 
 Hilde. Would you like that?
 
 Lyngstrand. I hardly know. Yes; I almost think I should. But now, for
 this summer, I would rather you were like yourself alone, and exactly as
 you are.
 
 Hilde. Do you like me best as I am?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, I like you immensely as you are.
 
 Hilde. Hm. Tell me, you who are an artist, do you think I'm right always
 to wear bright-coloured summer dresses?
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes; I think you're quite right!
 
 Hilde. You think bright colours suit me, then?
 
 Lyngstrand. They suit you charmingly--to my taste.
 
 Hilde. But tell me, as an artist, how do you think I should look in
 black?
 
 Lyngstrand. In black, Miss Hilde?
 
 Hilde. Yes, all in black. Do you think I should look well?
 
 Lyngstrand. Black's hardly suitable for the summer. However, you'd
 probably look remarkably well in black, especially with your appearance.
 
 Hilde (looking straight in front of her). All in black, up to the
 throat; black frilling round that, black gloves, and a long black veil
 hanging down behind.
 
 Lyngstrand. If you were dressed so, Miss Hilde, I should wish I were a
 painter, and I'd paint you as a young, beautiful, sorrowing widow!
 
 Hilde. Or as a young, sorrowing, betrothed girl!
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes, that would be better still. But you can't wish to be
 dressed like that?
 
 Hilde. I hardly know; but I think it's fascinating.
 
 Lyngstrand. Fascinating?
 
 Hilde. Fascinating to think of, yes. (Suddenly pointing to the left.)
 Oh, just look there!
 
 Lyngstrand (looking). The great English steamer; and right by the pier!
 
 (WANGEL and ELLIDA come in past the pond.)
 
 Wangel. No; I assure you, dear Ellida, you are mistaken. (Seeing the
 others.) What, are you two here? It's not in sight yet; is it, Mr.
 Lyngstrand?
 
 Lyngstrand. The great English ship?
 
 Wangel. Yes.
 
 Lyngstrand (pointing). There she is already, doctor.
 
 Ellida. I knew it.
 
 Wangel. Come!
 
 Lyngstrand. Come like a thief in the night, as one might say, so quietly
 and noiselessly.
 
 Wangel. You must go to the pier with Hilde. Be quick! I'm sure she wants
 to hear the music.
 
 Lyngstrand. Yes; we were just going there, doctor.
 
 Wangel. Perhaps we'll follow you. We'll come directly.
 
 Hilde (whispering to LYNGSTRAND). They're hunting in couples, too!
 
 (HILDE and LYNGSTRAND go out through the garden. Music is heard in the
 distance out at the fiord during the following.)
 
 Ellida. Come! He is here! Yes, yes--I feel it.
 
 Wangel. You'd better go in, Ellida. Let me talk with him alone.
 
 Ellida. Oh! that's impossible--impossible, I say. (With a cry.) Ah! do
 you see him, Wangel?
 
 (The STRANGER enters from the left, and remains on the pathway outside
 the fence.)
 
 The Stranger (bowing). Good-evening. You see I am here again, Ellida.
 
 Ellida. Yes, yes. The time has come now.
 
 The Stranger. And are you ready to start, or not?
 
 Wangel. You can see for yourself that she is not.
 
 The Stranger. I'm not asking about a travelling dress, or anything of
 that kind, nor about packed trunks. All that is needed for a journey I
 have with me on board. I've also secured a cabin for her. (To ELLIDA.)
 So I ask you if you are ready to go with me, to go with me--freely?
 
 Ellida. Oh! do not ask me! Do not tempt me!
 
 (A ship's bell is heard in the distance.)
 
 The Stranger. That is the first bell for going on board. Now you must
 say "Yes" or "No."
 
 Ellida (wringing her hands). To decide--decide for one's whole life!
 Never to be able to undo it again!
 
 The Stranger. Never. In half an hour it will be too late.
 
 Ellida (looking shyly and searchingly at him). Why is it you hold to me
 so resolutely?
 
 The Stranger. Don't you feel, as I do, that we two belong together?
 
 Ellida. Do you mean because of the vow?
 
 The Stranger. Vows bind no one, neither man nor woman. If I hold so
 steadfastly to you, it is because I cannot do otherwise.
 
 Ellida (in a low, trembling voice). Why didn't you come before?
 
 Wangel. Ellida!
 
 Ellida (bursting out). Ah! All that attracts, and tempts, and lures into
 the unknown! All the strength of the sea concentrated in this one thing!
 
 (The STRANGER climbs over the fence.)
 
 Ellida (stepping back to WANGEL). What is it? What do you want?
 
 The Stranger. I see it and I hear it in you, Ellida. After all, you will
 choose me in the end.
 
 Wangel (going towards him). My wife has no choice here, I am here both
 to choose for her and to defend her. Yes, defend! If you do not go away
 from here--away from this land--and never come back again--Do you know
 to what you are exposing yourself?
 
 Ellida. No, no, Wangel, not that!
 
 The Stranger. What will you do to me?
 
 Wangel. I will have you arrested as a criminal, at once, before you go
 on board; for I know all about the murder at Skjoldviken.
 
 Ellida. Ah! Wangel, how can you?
 
 The Stranger. I was prepared for that, and so--(takes a revolver from
 his breast pocket)--I provided myself with this.
 
 Ellida (throwing herself in front of him). No, no; do not kill him!
 Better kill me!
 
 The Stranger. Neither you nor him, don't fear that. This is for myself,
 for I will live and die a free man.
 
 Ellida (with growing excitement). Wangel, let me tell you this--tell it
 you so that he may hear it. You can indeed keep me here! You have the
 means and the power to do it. And you intend to do it. But my mind--all
 my thoughts, all the longings and desires of my soul--these you cannot
 bind! These will rush and press out into the unknown that I was created
 for, and that you have kept from me!
 
 Wangel (in quiet sorrow). I see it, Ellida. Step by step you are
 slipping from me. The craving for the boundless, the infinite, the
 unattainable will drive your soul into the darkness of night at last.
 
 Ellida. Yes! I feel it hovering over me like black noiseless wings.
 
 Wangel. It shall not come to that. No other deliverance is possible for
 you. I at least can see no other. And so--so I cry off our bargain at
 once. Now you can choose your own path in perfect--perfect freedom.
 
 Ellida (stares at him a while as if stricken dumb). Is it true--true
 what you say? Do you mean that--mean it with all your heart?
 
 Wangel. Yes--with all my sorrowing heart--I mean it.
 
 Ellida. And can you do it? Can you let it be so?
 
 Wangel. Yes, I can. Because I love you so dearly.
 
 Ellida (in a low, trembling voice). And have I come so near--so close to
 you?
 
 Wangel. The years and the living together have done that.
 
 Ellida (clasping her hands together). And I--who so little understood
 this!
 
 Wangel. Your thoughts went elsewhere. And now--now you are completely
 free of me and mine--and--and mine. Now your own true life may resume
 its real bent again, for now you can choose in freedom, and on your own
 responsibility, Ellida.
 
 Ellida (clasps her head with her hands, and stares at WANGEL). In
 freedom, and on my own responsibility! Responsibility, too? That changes
 everything.
 
 (The ship bell rings again.)
 
 The Stranger. Do you hear, Ellida? It has rung now for the last time.
 Come.
 
 Ellida (turns towards him, looks firmly at him, and speaks in a resolute
 voice). I shall never go with you after this!
 
 The Stranger. You will not!
 
 Ellida (clinging to WANGEL). I shall never go away from you after this.
 
 The Stranger. So it is over?
 
 Ellida. Yes. Over for all time.
 
 The Stranger. I see. There is something here stronger than my will.
 
 Ellida. Your will has not a shadow of power over me any longer. To me
 you are as one dead--who has come home from the sea, and who returns to
 it again. I no longer dread you. And I am no longer drawn to you.
 
 The Stranger. Goodbye, Mrs. Wangel! (He swings himself over the fence.)
 Henceforth, you are nothing but a shipwreck in my life that I have tided
 over. (He goes out.)
 
 Wangel (looks at her for a while). Ellida, your mind is like the sea--it
 has ebb and flow. Whence came the change?
 
 Ellida. Ah! don't you understand that the change came--was bound to come
 when I could choose in freedom?
 
 Wangel. And the unknown?--It no longer lures you?
 
 Ellida. Neither lures nor frightens me. I could have seen it--gone out
 into it, if only I myself had willed it. I could have chosen it. And
 that is why I could also renounce it.
 
 Wangel. I begin to understand little by little. You think and conceive
 in pictures--in visible figures. Your longing and aching for the sea,
 your attraction towards this strange man, these were the expression of
 an awakening and growing desire for freedom; nothing else.
 
 Ellida. I don't know about that. But you have been a good physician for
 me. You found, and you dared to use the right remedy--the only one that
 could help me.
 
 Wangel. Yes, in utmost need and danger we doctors dare much. And now you
 are coming back to me again, Ellida?
 
 Ellida. Yes, dear, faithful Wangel--now I am coming back to you again.
 Now I can. For now I come to you freely, and on my own responsibility.
 
 Wangel (looks lovingly at her). Ellida! Ellida! To think that now we can
 live wholly for one another--
 
 Ellida. And with common memories. Yours, as well as mine.
 
 Wangel. Yes, indeed, dear.
 
 Ellida. And for our children, Wangel?
 
 Wangel. You call them ours!
 
 Ellida. They who are not mine yet, but whom I shall win.
 
 Wangel. Ours! (Gladly and quickly kisses her hands.) I cannot speak my
 thanks for those words!
 
 (HILDE, BALLESTED, LYNGSTRAND, ARNHOLM, and BOLETTE come into the
 garden. At the same time a number of young townspeople and visitors pass
 along the footpath.)
 
 Hilde (aside to LYNGSTRAND). See! Why, she and father look exactly as if
 they were a betrothed couple!
 
 Ballested (who has overheard). It is summertime, little Missie.
 
 Arnholm (looking at WANGEL and ELLIDA). The English steamer is putting
 off.
 
 Bolette (going to the fence). You can see her best from here.
 
 Lyngstrand. The last voyage this year.
 
 Ballested. Soon all the sea-highways will be closed, as the poet says.
 It is sad, Mrs. Wangel. And now we're to lose you also for a time.
 Tomorrow you're off to Skjoldviken, I hear.
 
 Wangel. No; nothing will come of that. We two have changed our
 mind--tonight.
 
 Arnholm (looking from one to the other). Oh!--really!
 
 Bolette (coming forward). Father, is that true?
 
 Hilde (going towards ELLIDA). Are you going to stay with us after all?
 
 Ellida. Yes, dear Hilde, if you'll have me.
 
 Hilde (struggling between tears and laughter). Fancy! Have you!
 
 Arnholm (to ELLIDA). But this is quite a surprise--!
 
 Ellida (smiling earnestly). Well, you see, Mr. Arnholm--Do you remember
 we talked about it yesterday? When you have once become a land-creature
 you can no longer find your way back again to the sea, nor to the
 sea-life either.
 
 Ballested. Why, that's exactly the case with my mermaid.
 
 Ellida. Something like--yes.
 
 Ballested. Only with this difference--that the mermaid dies of it, it,
 while human beings can acclam--acclimatise themselves. Yes yes. I assure
 you, Mrs. Wangel, they can ac-climatise themselves.
 
 Ellida. In freedom they can, Mr. Ballested.
 
 Wangel. And when they act on their own responsibility, dear Ellida.
 
 Ellida (quickly holding out her hand to him). Exactly. (The great
 steamer glides noiselessly out beyond the fjord. The music is heard
 nearer land.)

 THE MASTER BUILDER
 
 
 By Henrik Ibsen
 
 
 Translated by Edmund Gosse and William Archer
 
 
 Introduction by William Archer
 
 
 
 
 INTRODUCTION.
 
 
 With _The Master Builder_--or _Master Builder Solness_, as the title
 runs in the original--we enter upon the final stage in Ibsen's career.
 "You are essentially right," the poet wrote to Count Prozor in March
 1900, "when you say that the series which closes with the Epilogue
 (_When We Dead Awaken_) began with _Master Builder Solness_."
 
 "Ibsen," says Dr. Brahm, "wrote in Christiania all the four works which
 he thus seems to bracket together--_Solness_, _Eyolf_, _Borkman_, and
 _When We Dead Awaken_. He returned to Norway in July 1891, for a stay of
 indefinite length; but the restless wanderer over Europe was destined
 to leave his home no more.... He had not returned, however, to throw
 himself, as of old, into the battle of the passing day. Polemics are
 entirely absent from the poetry of his old age. He leaves the State and
 Society at peace. He who had departed as the creator of Falk [in _Love's
 Comedy_] now, on his return, gazes into the secret places of human
 nature and the wonder of his own soul."
 
 Dr. Brahm, however, seems to be mistaken in thinking that Ibsen returned
 to Norway with no definite intention of settling down. Dr. Julius Elias
 (an excellent authority) reports that shortly before Ibsen left Munich
 in 1891, he remarked one day, "I must get back to the North!" "Is that
 a sudden impulse?" asked Elias. "Oh no," was the reply; "I want to be
 a good head of a household and have my affairs in order. To that end I
 must consolidate may property, lay it down in good securities, and
 get it under control--and that one can best do where one has rights of
 citizenship." Some critics will no doubt be shocked to find the poet
 whom they have written down an "anarchist" confessing such bourgeois
 motives.
 
 After his return to Norway, Ibsen's correspondence became very scant,
 and we have no letters dating from the period when he was at work on
 _The Master Builder_. On the other hand, we possess a curious lyrical
 prelude to the play, which he put on paper on March 16, 1892. It is
 said to have been his habit, before setting to work on a play, to
 "crystallise in a poem the mood which then possessed him;" but the
 following is the only one of these keynote poems which has been
 published. I give it in the original language, with a literal
 translation:
 
 
 DE SAD DER, DE TO--
 
      De sad der, de to, i saa lunt et hus
      ved host og i venterdage,
      Saa braendte huset.  Alt ligger i grus.
      De to faar i asken rage.
 
      For nede id en er et smykke gemt,--
      et smykke, som aldrig kan braende.
      Og leder de trofast, haender det nemt
      at det findes af ham eller hende.
 
      Men finder de end, brandlidte to,
      det dyre, ildfaste smykke,--
      aldrig han finder sin braendte tro,
      han aldrig sin braendte lykke.
 
 
 THEY SAT THERE, THE TWO--
 
   They sat there, the two, in so cosy a house, through autumn
   and winter days.  Then the house burned down.  Everything
   lies in ruins.  The two must grope among the ashes.
 
   For among them is hidden a jewel--a jewel that never can burn.
   And if they search faithfully, it may easily happen that he
   or she may find it.
 
   But even should they find it, the burnt-out two--find this
   precious unburnable jewel--never will she find her burnt faith,
   he never his burnt happiness.
 
 
 This is the latest piece of Ibsen's verse that has been given to the
 world; but one of his earliest poems--first printed in 1858--was also,
 in some sort, a prelude to _The Master Builder_. Of this a literal
 translation may suffice. It is called,
 
 
 BUILDING-PLANS
 
   I remember as clearly as if it had been to-day the evening
   when, in the paper, I saw my first poem in print.  There I
   sat in my den, and, with long-drawn puffs, I smoked and I
   dreamed in blissful self-complacency.
 
   "I will build a cloud-castle.  It shall shine all over the
   North.  It shall have two wings: one little and one great.
   The great wing shall shelter a deathless poet; the little
   wing shall serve as a young girl's bower."
 
   The plan seemed to me nobly harmonious; but as time went on
   it fell into confusion.  When the master grew reasonable, the
   castle turned utterly crazy; the great wing became too little,
   the little wing fell to ruin.
 
 
 Thus we see that, thirty-five years before the date of _The Master
 Builder_, Ibsen's imagination was preoccupied with a symbol of a master
 building a castle in the air, and a young girl in one of its towers.
 
 There has been some competition among the poet's young lady friends for
 the honour of having served as his model for Hilda. Several, no doubt,
 are entitled to some share in it. One is not surprised to learn that
 among the papers he left behind were sheaves upon sheaves of letters
 from women. "All these ladies," says Dr. Julius Elias, "demanded
 something of him--some cure for their agonies of soul, or for the
 incomprehension from which they suffered; some solution of the riddle of
 their nature. Almost every one of them regarded herself as a problem
 to which Ibsen could not but have the time and the interest to apply
 himself. They all thought they had a claim on the creator of Nora....
 Of this chapter of his experience, Fru Ibsen spoke with ironic
 humour. 'Ibsen (I have often said to him), Ibsen, keep these swarms of
 over-strained womenfolk at arm's length.' 'Oh no (he would reply), let
 them alone. I want to observe them more closely.' His observations would
 take a longer or shorter time as the case might be, and would always
 contribute to some work of art."
 
 The principal model for Hilda was doubtless Fraulein Emilie Bardach,
 of Vienna, whom he met at Gossensass in the autumn of 1889. He was then
 sixty-one years of age; she is said to have been seventeen. As the lady
 herself handed his letters to Dr. Brandes for publication, there can be
 no indiscretion in speaking of them freely. Some passages from them I
 have quoted in the introduction to _Hedda Gabler_--passages which show
 that at first the poet deliberately put aside his Gossensass impressions
 for use when he should stand at a greater distance from them, and
 meanwhile devoted himself to work in a totally different key. On October
 15, 1889, he writes, in his second letter to Fraulein Bardach: "I
 cannot repress my summer memories, nor do I want to. I live through my
 experiences again and again. To transmute it all into a poem I find, in
 the meantime, impossible. In the meantime? Shall I succeed in doing
 so some time in the future? And do I really wish to succeed? In the
 meantime, at any rate, I do not.... And yet it must come in time." The
 letters number twelve in all, and are couched in a tone of sentimental
 regret for the brief, bright summer days of their acquaintanceship. The
 keynote is struck in the inscription on the back of a photograph
 which he gave her before they parted: _An die Maisonne eines
 Septemberlebens--in Tirol_,(1) 27/9/89. In her album he had written the
 words:
 
 
      Hohes, schmerzliches Gluck--
      um das Unerreichbare zu ringen!(2)
 
 
 in which we may, if we like, see a foreshadowing of the Solness frame
 of mind. In the fifth letter of the series he refers to her as "an
 enigmatic Princess"; in the sixth he twice calls her "my dear Princess";
 but this is the only point at which the letters quite definitely and
 unmistakably point forward to _The Master Builder_. In the ninth letter
 (February 6, 1890) he says: "I feel it a matter of conscience to end,
 or at any rate, to restrict, our correspondence." The tenth letter,
 six months later, is one of kindly condolence on the death of the young
 lady's father. In the eleventh (very short) note, dated December 30,
 1890, he acknowledges some small gift, but says: "Please, for the
 present, do not write me again.... I will soon send you my new play
 [_Hedda Gabler_]. Receive it in friendship, but in silence!" This
 injunction she apparently obeyed. When _The Master Builder_ appeared, it
 would seem that Ibsen did not even send her a copy of the play; and we
 gather that he was rather annoyed when she sent him a photograph
 signed "Princess of Orangia." On his seventieth birthday, however, she
 telegraphed her congratulations, to which he returned a very cordial
 reply. And here their relations ended.
 
 That she was right, however, in regarding herself as his principal model
 for Hilda appears from an anecdote related by Dr. Elias.(3) It is not
 an altogether pleasing anecdote, but Dr. Elias is an unexceptionable
 witness, and it can by no means be omitted from an examination into the
 origins of _The Master Builder_. Ibsen had come to Berlin in February
 1891 for the first performance of _Hedda Gabler_. Such experiences were
 always a trial to him, and he felt greatly relieved when they were over.
 Packing, too, he detested; and Elias having helped him through this
 terrible ordeal, the two sat down to lunch together, while awaiting the
 train. An expansive mood descended upon Ibsen, and chuckling over his
 champagne glass, he said: "Do you know, my next play is already hovering
 before me--of course in vague outline. But of one thing I have got
 firm hold. An experience: a woman's figure. Very interesting, very
 interesting indeed. Again a spice of the devilry in it." Then he
 related how he had met in the Tyrol a Viennese girl of very remarkable
 character. She had at once made him her confidant. The gist of her
 confessions was that she did not care a bit about one day marrying
 a well brought-up young man--most likely she would never marry. What
 tempted and charmed and delighted her was to lure other women's husbands
 away from them. She was a little daemonic wrecker; she often appeared to
 him like a little bird of prey, that would fain have made him, too, her
 booty. He had studied her very, very closely. For the rest, she had had
 no great success with him. "She did not get hold of me, but I got
 hold of her--for my play. Then I fancy" (here he chuckled again) "she
 consoled herself with some one else." Love seemed to mean for her only
 a sort of morbid imagination. This, however, was only one side of her
 nature. His little model had had a great deal of heart and of womanly
 understanding; and thanks to the spontaneous power she could gain over
 him, every woman might, if she wished it, guide some man towards the
 good. "Thus Ibsen spoke," says Elias, "calmly and coolly, gazing as it
 were into the far distance, like an artist taking an objective view of
 some experience--like Lubek speaking of his soul-thefts. He had stolen
 a soul, and put it to a double employment. Thea Elvsted and Hilda Wangel
 are intimately related--are, indeed only different expressions of the
 same nature." If Ibsen actually declared Thea and Hilda to be drawn from
 one model, we must of course take his word for it; but the relationship
 is hard to discern.
 
 There can be no reasonable doubt, then, that the Gossensass episode gave
 the primary impulse to _The Master Builder_. But it seems pretty well
 established, too, that another lady, whom he met in Christiania after
 his return in 1891, also contributed largely to the character of
 Hilda. This may have been the reason why he resented Fraulein Bardach's
 appropriating to herself the title of "Princess of Orangia."
 
 The play was published in the middle of December 1892. It was acted both
 in Germany and England before it was seen in the Scandinavian capitals.
 Its first performance took place at the Lessing Theatre, Berlin, January
 19, 1893, with Emanuel Reicher as Solness and Frl. Reisenhofer as Hilda.
 In London it was first performed at the Trafalgar Square Theatre (now
 the Duke of York's) on February 20, 1893, under the direction of Mr.
 Herbert Waring and Miss Elizabeth Robins, who played Solness and Hilda.
 This was one of the most brilliant and successful of English Ibsen
 productions. Miss Robins was almost an ideal Hilda, and Mr. Waring's
 Solness was exceedingly able. Some thirty performances were give in all,
 and the play was reproduced at the Opera Comique later in the season,
 with Mr. Lewis Waller as Solness. In the following year Miss Robins
 acted Hilda in Manchester. In Christiania and Copenhagen the play was
 produced on the same evening, March 8, 1893; the Copenhagen Solness
 and Hilda were Emil Poulsen and Fru Hennings. A Swedish production,
 by Lindberg, soon followed, both in Stockholm and Gothenburg. In Paris
 _Solness le constructeur_ was not seen until April 3, 1894, when it
 was produced by "L'OEuvre" with M. Lugne-Poe as Solness. The company,
 sometimes with Mme. Suzanne Despres and sometimes with Mme. Berthe
 Bady as Hilda, in 1894 and 1895 presented the play in London, Brussels,
 Amsterdam, Milan, and other cities. In October 1894 they visited
 Christiania, where Ibsen was present at one of their performances, and
 is reported by Herman Bang to have been so enraptured with it that he
 exclaimed, "This is the resurrection of my play!" On this occasion Mme.
 Bady was the Hilda. The first performance of the play in America took
 place at the Carnegie Lyceum, New York, on January 16, 1900, with
 Mr. William H. Pascoe as Solness and Miss Florence Kahn as Hilda.
 The performance was repeated in the course of the same month, both at
 Washington and Boston.
 
 In England, and probably elsewhere as well, _The Master Builder_
 produced a curious double effect. It alienated many of the poet's
 staunchest admirers, and it powerfully attracted many people who had
 hitherto been hostile to him. Looking back, it is easy to see why this
 should have been so; for here was certainly a new thing in drama, which
 could not but set up many novel reactions. A greater contrast could
 scarcely be imagined than that between the hard, cold, precise outlines
 of _Hedda Gabler_ and the vague mysterious atmosphere of _The Master
 Builder_, in which, though the dialogue is sternly restrained within
 the limits of prose, the art of drama seems for ever on the point of
 floating away to blend with the art of music. Substantially, the play
 is one long dialogue between Solness and Hilda; and it would be quite
 possible to analyse this dialogue in terms of music, noting (for
 example) the announcement first of this theme and then of that, the
 resumption and reinforcement of a theme which seemed to have been
 dropped, the contrapuntal interweaving of two or more motives, a scherzo
 here, a fugal passage there. Leaving this exercise to some one more
 skilled in music (or less unskilled) than myself, I may note that in
 _The Master Builder_ Ibsen resumes his favourite retrospective method,
 from which in _Hedda Gabler_ he had in great measure departed. But the
 retrospect with which we are here concerned is purely psychological. The
 external events involved in it are few and simple in comparison with
 the external events which are successively unveiled in retrospective
 passages of _The Wild Duck_ or _Rosmersholm_. The matter of the play
 is the soul-history of Halvard Solness, recounted to an impassioned
 listener--so impassioned, indeed, that the soul-changes it begets in her
 form an absorbing and thrilling drama. The graduations, retardations,
 accelerations of Solness's self-revealment are managed with the subtlest
 art, so as to keep the interest of the spectator ever on the stretch.
 The technical method was not new; it was simply that which Ibsen had
 been perfecting from _Pillars of Society_ onward; but it was applied to
 a subject of a nature not only new to him, but new to literature.
 
 That the play is full of symbolism it would be futile to deny; and the
 symbolism is mainly autobiographic. The churches which Solness sets out
 building doubtless represent Ibsen's early romantic plays, the "homes
 for human beings" his social drama; while the houses with high towers,
 merging into "castles in the air," stand for those spiritual dramas,
 with a wide outlook over the metaphysical environment of humanity, on
 which he was henceforth to be engaged. Perhaps it is not altogether
 fanciful to read a personal reference into Solness's refusal to call
 himself an architect, on the ground that his training has not been
 systematic--that he is a self-taught man. Ibsen too was in all
 essentials self-taught; his philosophy was entirely unsystematic; and,
 like Solness, he was no student of books. There may be an introspective
 note also in that dread of the younger generation to which Solness
 confesses. It is certain that the old Master-Builder was not lavish
 of his certificates of competence to young aspirants, though there is
 nothing to show that his reticence ever depressed or quenched any rising
 genius.
 
 On the whole, then, it cannot be doubted that several symbolic motives
 are inwoven into the iridescent fabric of the play. But it is a
 great mistake to regard it as essentially and inseparably a piece of
 symbolism. Essentially it is a history of a sickly conscience, worked
 out in terms of pure psychology. Or rather, it is a study of a
 sickly and a robust conscience side by side. "The conscience is very
 conservative," Ibsen has somewhere said; and here Solness's conservatism
 is contrasted with Hilda's radicalism--or rather would-be radicalism,
 for we are led to suspect, towards the close, that the radical too is a
 conservative in spite or herself. The fact that Solness cannot climb as
 high as he builds implies, I take it, that he cannot act as freely as
 he thinks, or as Hilda would goad him into thinking. At such an altitude
 his conscience would turn dizzy, and life would become impossible to
 him. But here I am straying back to the interpretation of symbols. My
 present purpose is to insist that there is nothing in the play which has
 no meaning on the natural-psychological plane, and absolutely requires
 a symbolic interpretation to make it comprehensible. The symbols are
 harmonic undertones; the psychological melody is clear and consistent
 without any reference to them.(4) It is true that, in order to accept
 the action on what we may call the realistic level, we must suppose
 Solness to possess and to exercise, sometimes unconsciously, a
 considerable measure of hypnotic power. But time is surely past when
 we could reckon hypnotism among "supernatural" phenomena. Whether the
 particular forms of hypnotic influence attributed to Solness do actually
 exist is a question we need not determine. The poet does not demand our
 absolute credence, as though he were giving evidence in the witness-box.
 What he requires is our imaginative acceptance of certain incidents
 which he purposely leaves hovering on the border between the natural and
 the preternatural, the explained and the unexplained. In this play, as
 in _The Lady from the Sea_ and _Little Eyolf_, he shows a delicacy of
 art in his dalliance with the occult which irresistibly recalls the
 exquisite genius of Nathaniel Hawthorne.(5)
 
 The critics who insist on finding nothing but symbolism in the play have
 fastened on Mrs. Solness's "nine lovely dolls," and provided the most
 amazing interpretations for them. A letter which I contributed in 1893
 to the _Westminster Gazette_ records an incident which throws a curious
 light on the subject and may be worth preserving. "At a recent first
 night," I wrote, "I happened to be seated just behind a well-known
 critic. He turned round to me and said, 'I want you to tell me what is
 YOUR theory of those "nine lovely dolls." Of course one can see that
 they are entirely symbolical.' 'I am not so sure of that,' I replied,
 remembering a Norwegian cousin of my own who treasured a favourite doll
 until she was nearer thirty than twenty. 'They of course symbolise the
 unsatisfied passion of motherhood in Mrs. Solness's heart, but I have
 very little doubt that Ibsen makes use of this "symbol" because he has
 observed a similar case, or cases, in real life.' 'What!' cried the
 critic. 'He has seen a grown-up, a middle-aged woman continuing to "live
 with" her dolls!' I was about to say that it did not seem to me so very
 improbable, when a lady who was seated next me, a total stranger to both
 of us, leant forward and said, 'Excuse my interrupting you, but it
 may perhaps interest you to know that I HAVE THREE DOLLS TO WHICH I AM
 DEEPLY ATTACHED!' I will not be so rude as to conjecture this lady's
 age, but we may be sure that a very young woman would not have had the
 courage to make such an avowal. Does it not seem that Ibsen knows a
 thing or two about human nature--English as well as Norwegian--which
 we dramatic critics, though bound by our calling to be subtle
 psychologists, have not yet fathomed?" In the course of the
 correspondence which followed, one very apposite anecdote was quoted
 from an American paper, the _Argonaut_: "An old Virginia lady said to
 a friend, on finding a treasured old cup cracked by a careless maid,
 'I know of nothing to compare with the affliction of losing a handsome
 piece of old china.' 'Surely,' said the friend, 'it is not so bad as
 losing one's children.' 'Yes, it is,' replied the old lady, 'for when
 your children die, you do have the consolations of religion, you know.'"
 
 It would be a paradox to call _The Master Builder_ Ibsen's greatest
 work, but one of his three or four greatest it assuredly is. Of all his
 writings, it is probably the most original, the most individual, the
 most unlike any other drama by any other writer. The form of _Brand_ and
 _Peer Gynt_ was doubtless suggested by other dramatic poems--notably by
 _Faust_. In _The Wild Duck_, in _Rosmersholm_, in _Hedda Gabler_, even
 in _Little Eyolf_ and _John Gabriel Borkman_, there remain faint traces
 of the French leaven which is so strong in the earlier plays. But _The
 Master Builder_ had no model and has no parallel. It shows no slightest
 vestige of outside influence. It is Ibsen, and nothing but Ibsen.

 ACT FIRST.
 
   A plainly-furnished work-room in the house of HALVARD SOLNESS.
   Folding doors on the left lead out to the hall.  On the right
   is the door leading to the inner rooms of the house.  At the
   back is an open door into the draughtsmen's office.  In front,
   on the left, a desk with books, papers and writing materials.
   Further back than the folding door, a stove.  In the right-
   hand corner, a sofa, a table, and one or two chairs.  On the
   table a water-bottle and glass.  A smaller table, with a
   rocking-chair and arm-chair, in front on the right.  Lighted
   lamps, with shades, on the table in the draughtmen's office,
   on the table in the corner, and on the desk.
 
   In the draughtsmen's office sit KNUT BROVIK and his son RAGNAR,
   occupied with plans and calculations.  At the desk in the outer

   is a spare old man with white hair and beard.  He wears a
   rather threadbare but well-brushed black coat, with spectacles,
   and a somewhat discoloured white neckcloth.  RAGNAR BROVIK is
   a well-dressed, light-haired man in his thirties, with a
   slight stoop.  KAIA FOSLI is a slightly built girl, a little
   over twenty, carefully dressed, and delicate-looking.  She has
   a green shade over her eyes.--All three go on working for some
   time in silence.
 
 
 KNUT BROVIK.
 
 [Rises suddenly, as if in distress, from the table; breathes heavily and
 laboriously as he comes forward into the doorway.] No, I can't bear it
 much longer!
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Going up to him.] You are feeling very ill this evening, are you not,
 Uncle?
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 Oh, I seem to get worse every day.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [Has risen and advances.] You ought to go home, father. Try to get a
 little sleep--
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 [Impatiently.] Go to bed, I suppose? Would you have me stifled outright?
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 Then take a little walk.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Yes, do. I will come with you.
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 [With warmth.] I will not go till he comes! I and determined to have
 it out this evening with--[in a tone of suppressed bitterness]--with
 him--with the chief.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Anxiously.] Oh no, uncle,--do wait awhile before doing that!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Yes, better wait, father!
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 [Draws is breath laboriously.] Ha--ha--! _I_ haven't much time for
 waiting.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Listening.] Hush! I hear him on the stairs.
 
      [All three go back to their work.  A short silence.
 
 
   HALVARD SOLNESS comes in through the hall door.  He is a man no
   longer young, but healthy and vigorous, with close-cut curly
   hair, dark moustache and dark thick eyebrows.  He wears a
   greyish-green buttoned jacket with an upstanding collar and
   broad lapels.  On his head he wears a soft grey felt hat,
   and he has one or two light portfolios under his arm.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Near the door, points towards the draughtsmen's office, and asks in a
 whisper:] Are they gone?
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Softly, shaking her] No.
 
      [She takes the shade off her eyes.  SOLNESS crosses the room,
        throws his hat on a chair, places the portfolios on the table
        by the sofa, and approaches the desk again.  KAIA goes on
        writing without intermission, but seems nervous and uneasy.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Aloud.] What is that you are entering, Miss Fosli?
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Starts.] Oh, it is only something that--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Let me look at it, Miss Fosli. [Bends over her, pretends to be looking
 into the ledger, and whispers:] Kaia!
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Softly, still writing.] Well?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Why do you always take that shade off when I come?
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [As before.] I look so ugly with it on.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Smiling.] Then you don't like to look ugly, Kaia?
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Half glancing up at him.] Not for all the world. Not in your eyes.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Strokes her hair gently.] Poor, poor little Kaia--
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Bending her head.] Hush--they can hear you!
 
      [SOLNESS strolls across the room to the right, turns and pauses
        at the door of the draughtsmen's office.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Has any one been here for me?
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [Rising.] Yes, the young couple who want a villa built, out at
 Lovstrand.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Growling.] Oh, those two! They must wait. I am not quite clear about
 the plans yet.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [Advancing, with some hesitation.] They were very anxious to have the
 drawings at once.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [As before.] Yes, of course--so they all are.
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 [Looks up.] They say they are longing so to get into a house of their
 own.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, yes--we know all that! And so they are content to take whatever
 is offered them. They get a--a roof over their heads--an address--but
 nothing to call a home. No thank you! In that case, let them apply to
 somebody else. Tell them that, the next time they call.
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 [Pushes his glasses up on to his forehead and looks in astonishment at
 him.] To somebody else? Are you prepared to give up the commission?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Impatiently.] Yes, yes, yes, devil take it! If that is to be the way of
 it--. Rather that, than build away at random. [Vehemently.] Besides, I
 know very little about these people as yet.
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 The people are safe enough. Ragnar knows them. He is a friend of the
 family.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, safe--safe enough! That is not at all what I mean. Good lord--don't
 you understand me either? [Angrily.] I won't have anything to do with
 these strangers. They may apply to whom they please, so far as I am
 concerned.
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 [Rising.] Do you really mean that?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Sulkily.] Yes I do.--For once in a way. [He comes forward.
 
      [BROVIK exchanges a glance with RAGNAR, who makes a warning
        gesture.  Then BROVIK comes into the front room.
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 May I have a few words with you?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Certainly.
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 [To KAIA.] Just go in there for moment, Kaia.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Uneasily.] Oh, but uncle--
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 Do as I say, child. And shut the door after you.
 
      [KAIA goes reluctantly into the draughtsmen's office, glances
        anxiously and imploringly at SOLNESS, and shuts the door.
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 [Lowering his voice a little.] I don't want the poor children to know
 how I am.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, you have been looking very poorly of late.
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 It will soon be all over with me. My strength is ebbing--from day to
 day.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Won't you sit down?
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 Thanks--may I?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Placing the arm-chair more conveniently.] Here--take this chair.--And
 now?
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 [Has seated himself with difficulty.] Well, you see, it's about Ragnar.
 That is what weighs most upon me. What is to become of him?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Of course your son will stay with me as long as ever he likes.
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 But that is just what he does not like. He feels that he cannot stay
 here any longer.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Why, I should say he was very well off here. But if he wants more money,
 I should not mind--
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 No, no! It is not that. [Impatiently.] But sooner or later he, too, must
 have a chance of doing something on his own account.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Without looking at him.] Do you think that Ragnar has quite talent
 enough to stand alone?
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 No, that is just the heartbreaking part of it--I have begun to have
 my doubts about the boy. For you have never said so much as--as one
 encouraging word about him. And yet I cannot but think there must be
 something in him--he can't be without talent.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Well, but he has learnt nothing--nothing thoroughly, I mean. Except, of
 course, to draw.
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 [Looks at him with covert hatred, and says hoarsely.] You had learned
 little enough of the business when you were in my employment. But
 that did not prevent you from setting to work--[breathing with
 difficulty]--and pushing your way up, and taking the wind out of my
 sails--mine, and so may other people's.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, you see--circumstances favoured me.
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 You are right there. Everything favoured you. But then how can you have
 the heart to let me go to my grave--without having seen what Ragnar is
 fit for? And of course I am anxious to see them married, too--before I
 go.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Sharply.] Is it she who wishes it?
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 Not Kaia so much as Ragnar--he talks about it every day. [Appealingly.]
 You must help him to get some independent work now! I must see something
 that the lad has done. Do you hear?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Peevishly.] Hang it, man, you can't expect me to drag commissions down
 from the moon for him!
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 He has the chance of a capital commission at this very moment. A big bit
 of work.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Uneasily, startled.] Has he?
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 I you would give your consent.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 What sort of work do you mean?
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 [With some hesitation.] He can have the building of that villa out at
 Lovstrand.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 That! Why I am going to build that myself.
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 Oh you don't much care about doing it.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Flaring up.] Don't care! Who dares to say that?
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 You said so yourself just now.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, never mind what I say.--Would they give Ragnar the building of that
 villa?
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 Yes. You see, he knows the family. And then--just for the fun of the
 thing--he has made drawings and estimates and so forth--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Are they pleased with the drawings? The people who will have to live in
 the house?
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 Yes. If you would only look through them and approve of them--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Then they would let Ragnar build their home for them?
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 They were immensely pleased with his idea. They thought it exceedingly
 original, they said.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oho! Original! Not the old-fashioned stuff that _I_ am in the habit of
 turning out!
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 It seemed to them different.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [With suppressed irritation.] So it was to see Ragnar that they came
 here--whilst I was out!
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 They came to call upon you--and at the same time to ask whether you
 would mind retiring--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Angrily.] Retire? I?
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 In case you thought that Ragnar's drawings--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I! Retire in favour of your son!
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 Retire from the agreement, they meant.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, it comes to the same thing. [Laughs angrily.] So that is it, is it?
 Halvard Solness is to see about retiring now! To make room for younger
 men! For the very youngest, perhaps! He must make room! Room! Room!
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 Why, good heavens! there is surely room for more than one single man--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, there's not so very much room to spare either. But, be that as it
 may--I will never retire! I will never give way to anybody! Never of my
 own free will. Never in this world will I do that!
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 [Rise with difficulty.] Then I am to pass out of life without any
 certainty? Without a gleam of happiness? Without any faith or trust in
 Ragnar? Without having seen a single piece of work of his doing? Is that
 to be the way of it?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Turns half aside, and mutters.] H'm--don't ask more just now.
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 I must have an answer to this one question. Am I to pass out of life in
 such utter poverty?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Seems to struggle with himself; finally he says, in a low but firm
 voice:] You must pass out of life as best you can.
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 Then be it so. [He goes up the room.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Following him, half is desperation.] Don't you understand that I cannot
 help it? I am what I am, and I cannot change my nature!
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 No; I suppose that you can't. [Reels and supports himself against the
 sofa-table.] May I have a glass of water?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 By all means. [Fills a glass and hands it to him.
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 Thanks. [Drinks and puts the glass down again.
 
      [SOLNESS goes up and opens the door of the draughtsmen's office.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Ragnar--you must come and take your father home.
 
 
   Ragnar rises quickly.  He and KAIA come into the work-room.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 What is the matter, father?
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 Give me your arm. Now let us go.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Very well. You had better put your things on, too, Kaia.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Miss Fosli must stay--just for a moment. There is a letter I want
 written.
 
 
 BROVIK.
 
 [Looks at SOLNESS.] Good night. Sleep well--if you can.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Good night.
 
      [BROVIK and RAGNAR go out by the hall-door.  KAIA goes to the
        desk.  SOLNESS stands with bent head, to the right, by the
        arm-chair.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Dubiously.] Is there any letter?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Curtly.] No, of course not. [Looks sternly at her.] Kaia!
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Anxiously, in a low voice.] Yes!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Points imperatively to a spot on the floor.] Come here! At once!
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Hesitatingly.] Yes.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [As before.] Nearer!
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Obeying.] What do you want with me?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks at her for a while.] Is it you I have to thank for all this?
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 No, no, don't think that!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 But confess now--you want to get married!
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Softly.] Ragnar and I have been engaged for four or five years, and
 so--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 And so you think it time there were an end of it. Is not that so?
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 Ragnar and Uncle say I must. So I suppose I shall have to give in.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [More gently.] Kaia, don't you really care a little bit for Ragnar, too?
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 I cared very much for Ragnar once--before I came here to you.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 But you don't now? Not in the least?
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Passionately, clasping hands and holding them out towards him.] Oh, you
 know very well there is only one person I care for now! I shall never
 care for any one else.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, you say that. And yet you go away from me--leave me alone here with
 everything on my hands.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 But could I not stay with you, even if Ragnar--?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Repudiating the idea.] No, no, that is quite impossible. If Ragnar
 leaves me and starts work on his own account, then of course he will
 need you himself.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Wringing her hands.] Oh, I feel as if I could not be separated from
 you! It's quite, quite impossible!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Then be sure you get those foolish notions out of Ragnar's head. Marry
 him as much as you please--[Alters his tone.] I mean--don't let him
 throw up his good situation with me. For then I can keep you too, my
 dear Kaia.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 Oh yes, how lovely that would be, if it could only be managed!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Clasps her head with his two hands and whispers.] For I cannot get on
 without you, you see. I must have you with me every single day.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [In nervous exaltation.] My God! My God!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Kisses her hair.] Kaia--Kaia!
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Sinks down before him.] Oh, how good you are to me! How unspeakably
 good you are!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Vehemently.] Get up! For goodness' sake get up! I think I hear some
 one.
 
      [He helps her to rise.  She staggers over to the desk.
 
 
   MRS. SOLNESS enters by the door on the right.  She looks thin
   and wasted with grief, but shows traces of bygone beauty.
   Blonde ringlets.  Dressed with good taste, wholly in black.
   Speaks some-what slowly and in a plaintive voice.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [In the doorway.] Halvard!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Turns.] Oh, are you there, my dear--?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [With a glance at KAIA.] I am afraid I am disturbing you.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Not in the least. Miss Fosli has only a short letter to write.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, so I see.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 What do you want with me, Aline?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 I merely wanted to tell you that Dr. Herdal is in the drawing-room.
 Won't you come and see him, Halvard?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks suspiciously at her.]. H'm--is the doctor so very anxious to see
 me?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Well, not exactly anxious. He really came to see me; but he would like
 to say how-do-you-do to you at the same time.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Laughs to himself.] Yes, I daresay. Well, you must ask him to wait a
 little.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Then you will come in presently?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Perhaps I will. Presently, presently, dear. In a little while.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Glancing again at KAIA.] Well now, don't forget, Halvard.
 
      [Withdraws and closes the door behind her.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Softly.] Oh dear, oh dear--I am sure Mrs. Solness thinks ill of me in
 some way!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, not in the least. Not more than usual at any rate. But all the same,
 you had better go now, Kaia.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 Yes, yes, now I must go.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Severely.] And mind you get that matter settled for me. Do you hear?
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 Oh, if it only depended on me--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I will have it settled, I say! And to-morrow too--not a day later!
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Terrified.] If there's nothing else for it, I am quite willing to break
 off the engagement.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Angrily.] Break it off. Are you mad? Would you think of breaking it
 off?
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Distracted.] Yes, if necessary. For I must--I must stay here with you!
 I can't leave you! That is utterly--utterly impossible!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [With a sudden outburst.] But deuce take it--how about Ragnar then! It's
 Ragnar that I--
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Looks at him with terrified eyes.] It is chiefly on Ragnar's account,
 that--that you--?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Collecting himself.] No, no, of course not! You don't understand me
 either. [Gently and softly.] Of course it is you I want to keep.--you
 above everything, Kaia. But for that very reason, you must prevent
 Ragnar, too, from throwing up his situation. There, there,--now go home.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 Yes, yes--good-night, then.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Good night. [As she is going.] Oh, stop a moment! Are Ragnar's drawings
 in there?
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 I did not see him take them with him.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Then just go and find them for me. I might perhaps glance over them,
 after all.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Happy.] Oh yes, please do!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 For your sake, Kaia dear. Now, let me have them at once, please.
 
      [KAIA hurries into the draughtsmen's office, searches anxiously
        in the table-drawer, finds a portfolio and brings it with her.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 Here are all the drawings.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Good. Put them down there on the table.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Putting down the portfolio.] Good night, then. [Beseechingly.] And
 please, please think kindly of me.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, that I always do. Good-night, my dear little Kaia. [Glances to the
 right.] Go, go now!
 
 
   MRS. SOLNESS and DR. HERDAL enter by the door on the right.
   He is a stoutish, elderly man, with a round, good-humoured
   face, clean shaven, with thin, light hair, and gold spectacles.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Still in the doorway.] Halvard, I cannot keep the doctor any longer.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Well then, come in here.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [To KAIA, who is turning down the desk-lamp.] Have you finished the
 letter already, Miss Fosli?
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [In confusion.] The letter--?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, it was quite a short one.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 It must have been very short.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 You may go now, Miss Fosli. And please come in good time to-morrow
 morning.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 I will be sure to. Good-night, Mrs. Solness.
 
      [She goes out by the hall door.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Are you in a hurry, doctor?
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 No, not at all.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 May I have a little chat with you?
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 With the greatest of pleasure.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Then let us sit down. [He motions the doctor to take the rocking-chair,
 and sits down himself in the arm-chair. Looks searchingly at him.] Tell
 me--did you notice anything odd about Aline?
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Do you mean just now, when she was here?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, in her manner to me. Did you notice anything?
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [Smiling.] Well, I admit--one couldn't well avoid noticing that your
 wife--h'm--
 
 
 DR. HERDAL. --that your wife is not particularly fond of this Miss
 Fosli.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Is that all? I have noticed that myself.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 And I must say I am scarcely surprised at it.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 At what?
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 That she should not exactly approve of your seeing so much of another
 woman, all day and every day.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, no, I suppose you are right there--and Aline too. But it's
 impossible to make any change.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Could you not engage a clerk?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 The first man that came to hand? No, thank you--that would never do for
 me.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 But now, if your wife--? Suppose, with her delicate health, all this
 tries her too much?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Even then--I might almost say--it can make no difference. I must keep
 Kaia Fosli. No one else could fill her place.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 No one else?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Curtly.] No, no one.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [Drawing his chair closer.] Now listen to me, my dear Mr. Solness. May I
 ask you a question, quite between ourselves?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 By all means.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Women, you see--in certain matters, they have a deucedly keen
 intuition--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 They have, indeed. There is not the least doubt of that. But--?
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Well, tell me now--if your wife can't endure this Kaia Fosli--?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Well, what then?
 
 
 DR. HERDAL. --may she not have just--just the least little bit of reason
 for this instinctive dislike?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks at him and rises.] Oho!
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Now don't be offended--but hasn't she?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [With curt decision.] No.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 No reason of any sort?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No other than her own suspicious nature.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 I know you have known a good many women in your time.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, I have.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 And have been a good deal taken with some of them, too.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh yes, I don't deny it.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 But as regards Miss Fosli, then? There is nothing of that sort in this
 case?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No; nothing at all--on my side.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 But on her side?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I don't think you have any right to ask that question, doctor.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Well, you know, we were discussing your wife's intuition.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 So we were. And for that matter--[lowers his voice]--Aline's intuition,
 as you call it--in a certain sense, it has not been so far astray.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Aha! there we have it!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Sits down.] Doctor Herdal--I am going to tell you a strange story--if
 you care to listen to it.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 I like listening to strange stories.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Very well then. I daresay you recollect that I took Knut Brovik and his
 son into my employment--after the old man's business had gone to the
 dogs.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Yes, so I have understood.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 You see, they really are clever fellows, these two. Each of them has
 talent in his own way. But then the son took it into his head to get
 engaged; and the next thing, of course, was that he wanted to get
 married--and begin to build on his own account. That is the way with all
 these young people.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [Laughing.] Yes, they have a bad habit of wanting to marry.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Just so. But of course that did not suit my plans; for I needed Ragnar
 myself--and the old man too. He is exceedingly good at calculating
 bearing strains and cubic contents--and all that sort of devilry, you
 know.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Oh yes, no doubt that's indispensable.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, it is. But Ragnar was absolutely bent on setting to work for
 himself. He would hear of nothing else.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 But he has stayed with you all the same.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, I'll tell you how that came about. One day this girl, Kaia Fosli,
 came to see them on some errand or other. She had never been here
 before. And when I saw how utterly infatuated they were with each other,
 the thought occurred to me: if I cold only get her into the office here,
 then perhaps Ragnar too would stay where he is.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 That was not at all a bad idea.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, but at the time I did not breathe a word of what was in my mind.
 I merely stood and looked at her--and kept on wishing intently that
 I could have her here. Then I talked to her a little, in a friendly
 way--about one thing and another. And then she went away.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Well?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Well then, next day, pretty late in the evening, when old Brovik and
 Ragnar had gone home, she came here again, and behaved as if I had made
 an arrangement with her.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 An arrangement? What about?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 About the very thing my mind had been fixed on. But I hadn't said one
 single word about it.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 That was most extraordinary.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, was it not? And now she wanted to know what she was to do
 here--whether she could begin the very next morning, and so forth.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Don't you think she did it in order to be with her sweetheart?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 That was what occurred to me at first. But no, that was not it. She
 seemed to drift quite away from him--when once she had come here to me.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 She drifted over to you, then?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, entirely. If I happen to look at her when her back is turned, I can
 tell that she feels it. She quivers and trembles the moment I come near
 her. What do you think of that?
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 H'm--that's not very hard to explain.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Well, but what about the other thing? That she believed I had said to
 her what I had only wished and willed--silently--inwardly--to myself?
 What do you say to that? Can you explain that, Dr. Herdal?
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 No, I won't undertake to do that.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I felt sure you would not; and so I have never cared to talk about
 it till now.--But it's a cursed nuisance to me in the long run, you
 understand. Here have I got to go on day after day, pretending--. And
 it's a shame to treat her so, too, poor girl. [Vehemently.] But I cannot
 do anything else. For if she runs away from me--then Ragnar will be off
 too.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 And you have not told your wife the rights of the story?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 The why on earth don't you?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks fixedly at him, and says in a low voice:] Because I seem to
 find a sort of--of salutary self-torture in allowing Aline to do me an
 injustice.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [Shakes his head.] I don't in the least understand what you mean.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Well, you see--it is like paying off a little bit of a huge,
 immeasurable debt--
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 To your wife?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes; and that always helps to relieve one's mind a little. One can
 breathe more freely for a while, you understand.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 No, goodness knows, I don't understand at all--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Breaking off, rises again.] Well, well, well--then we won't talk any
 more about it. [He saunters across the room, returns, and stops beside
 the table. Looks at the doctor with a sly smile.] I suppose you think
 you have drawn me out nicely now, doctor?
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [With some irritation.] Drawn you out? Again I have not the faintest
 notion of what you mean, Mr. Solness.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh come, out with it; I have seen it quite clearly, you know.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 What have you seen?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [In a low voice, slowly.] That you have been quietly keeping an eye upon
 me.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 That _I_ have! And why in all the world should I do that?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Because you think that I----  [Passionately.]  Well devil take it--you
 think the same of me as Aline does.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 And what does she think about you?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Having recovered his self-control.] She has begun to think that I
 am--that I am--ill.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Ill! You! She has never hinted such a thing to me. Why, what can she
 think is the matter with you?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Leans over the back of the chair and whispers.] Aline has made up her
 mind that I am mad. That is what she thinks.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [Rising.] Why, my dear fellow--!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, on my soul she does! I tell you it is so. And she has got you to
 think the same! Oh, I can assure you, doctor, I see it in your face as
 clearly as possible. You don't take me in so easily, I can tell you.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [Looks at him in amazement.] Never, Mr. Solness--never has such a
 thought entered my mind.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [With and incredulous smile.] Really? Has it not?
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 No, never! Nor your wife's mind either, I am convinced. I could almost
 swear to that.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Well, I wouldn't advise you to. For, in a certain sense, you see,
 perhaps--perhaps she is not so far wrong in thinking something of the
 kind.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Come now, I really must say--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Interrupting, with a sweep of his hand.] Well, well, my dear
 doctor--don't let us discuss this any further. We had better agree
 to differ. [Changes to a tone of quiet amusement.] But look here now,
 doctor--h'm--
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Well?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Since you don't believe that I am--ill--and crazy--and mad, and so
 forth--
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 What then?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Then I daresay you fancy that I am an extremely happy man.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Is that mere fancy?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Laughs.] No, no--of course not! Heaven forbid! Only think--to be
 Solness the master builder! Halvard Solness! What could be more
 delightful?
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Yes, I must say it seems to me you have had the luck on your side to an
 astounding degree.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Suppresses a gloomy smile.] So I have. I can't complain on that score.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 First of all that grim old robbers' castle was burnt down for you. And
 that was certainly a great piece of luck.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Seriously.] It was the home of Aline's family. Remember that.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Yes, it must have been a great grief to her.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 She has not got over it to this day--not in all these twelve or thirteen
 years.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 But you--yourself--you rose upon the ruins. You began as a poor boy from
 a country village--and now you are at the head of your profession. Ah,
 yes, Mr. Solness, you have undoubtedly had the luck on your side.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Looking at him with embarrassment.] Yes, but that is just what makes me
 so horribly afraid.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Afraid? Because you have the luck on your side!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 It terrifies me--terrifies me every hour of the day. For sooner or later
 the luck must turn, you see.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Oh nonsense! What should make the luck turn?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [With firm assurance.] The younger generation!
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Pooh! The younger generation! You are not laid on the shelf yet, I
 should hope. Oh no--your position here is probably firmer now than it
 has ever been.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 The luck will turn. I know it--I feel the day approaching. Some one or
 other will take it into his head to say: Give me a chance! And then all
 the rest will come clamouring after him, and shake their fists at me and
 shout: Make room--make room--! Yes, just you see, doctor--presently the
 younger generation will come knocking at my door--
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [Laughing.] Well, and what if they do?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 What if they do? Then there's an end of Halvard Solness.
 
      [There is a knock at the door on the left.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Starts.] What's that? Did you not hear something?
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Some one is knocking at the door.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Loudly.] Come in.
 
 
   HILDA WANGEL enters by the hall door.  She is of middle height,
   supple, and delicately built.  Somewhat sunburnt.  Dressed in
   a tourist costume, with skirt caught up for walking, a sailor's
   collar open at the throat, and a small sailor hat on her head.
   Knapsack on back, plaid in strap, and alpenstock.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Goes straight up to SOLNESS, her eyes sparkling with happiness.] Good
 evening!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks doubtfully at her.] Good evening--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Laughs.] I almost believe you don't recognise me!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No--I must admit that--just for the moment--
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [Approaching.] But _I_ recognise you, my dear young lady--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Pleased.] Oh, is it you that--
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Of course it is. [To SOLNESS.] We met at one of the mountain stations
 this summer. [To HILDA.] What became of the other ladies?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh, they went westward.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 They didn't much like all the fun we used to have in the evenings.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 No, I believe they didn't.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [Holds up his finger at her.] And I am afraid it can't be denied that
 you flirted a little with us.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Well, that was better fun than to sit there knitting stockings with all
 those old women.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [Laughs.] There I entirely agree with you!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Have you come to town this evening?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, I have just arrived.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Quite alone, Miss Wangel?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh yes!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Wangel? Is your name Wangel?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks in amused surprise at him.] Yes, of course it is.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Then you must be a daughter of the district doctor up at Lysanger?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [As before.] Yes, who else's daughter should I be?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, then I suppose we met up there, that summer when I was building a
 tower on the old church.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [More seriously.] Yes, of course it was then we met.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Well, that is a long time ago.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks hard at him.] It is exactly ten years.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 You must have been a mere child then, I should think.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Carelessly.] Well, I was twelve or thirteen.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Is this the first time you have ever been up to town, Miss Wangel?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, it is indeed.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 And don't you know any one here?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Nobody but you. And of course, your wife.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 So you know her, too?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Only a little. We spent a few days together at the sanatorium.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Ah, up there?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 She said I might come and pay her a visit if ever I came up to town.
 [Smiles.] Not that that was necessary.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Odd that she should never have mentioned it.
 
      [HILDA puts her stick down by the stove, takes off the knapsack
        and lays it and the plaid on the sofa.  DR. HERDAL offers to
        help her.  SOLNESS stands and gazes at her.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Going towards him.] Well, now I must ask you to let me stay the night
 here.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I am sure there will be no difficulty about that.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 For I have no other clothes than those I stand in, except a change of
 linen in my knapsack. And that has to go to the wash, for it's very
 dirty.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh yes, that can be managed. Now I'll just let my wife know--
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Meanwhile I will go and see my patient.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, do; and come again later on.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [Playfully, with a glance at HILDA.] Oh that I will, you may be very
 certain! [Laughs.] So your prediction has come true, Mr. Solness!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 How so?
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 The younger generation did come knocking at your door.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Cheerfully.] Yes, but in a very different way from what I meant.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Very different, yes. That's undeniable.
 
      [He goes out by the hall-door.  SOLNESS opens the door on the
        right and speaks into the side room.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Aline! Will you come in here, please. Here is a friend of yours--Miss
 Wangel.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Appears in the doorway.] Who do you say it is? [Sees HILDA.]. Oh, is it
 you, Miss Wangel?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Miss Wangel has this moment arrived; and she would like to stay the
 night here.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Here with us? Oh yes, certainly.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Till she can get her things a little in order, you know.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 I will do the best I can for you. It's no more than my duty. I suppose
 your trunk is coming on later?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I have no trunk.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Well, it will be all right, I daresay. In the meantime, you must excuse
 my leaving you here with my husband, until I can get a room made a
 little more comfortable for you.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Can we not give her one of the nurseries? They are all ready as it is.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh yes. There we have room and to spare. [To HILDA.] Sit down now, and
 rest a little. [She goes out to the right.
 
      [HILDA, with her hands behind her back, strolls about the room
        and looks at various objects.  SOLNESS stands in front, beside
        the table, also with his hands behind his back, and follows
        her with his eyes.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Stops and looks at him.] Have you several nurseries?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 There are three nurseries in the house.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 That's a lot. Then I suppose you have a great many children?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No. We have no child. But now you can be the child here, for the time
 being.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 For to-night, yes. I shall not cry. I mean to sleep as sound as a stone.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, you must be very tired, I should think.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh no! But all the same--. It's so delicious to lie and dream.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Do you dream much of nights?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh yes! Almost always.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 What do you dream about most?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I sha'n't tell you to-night. Another time perhaps.
 
      [She again strolls about the room, stops at the desk and turns
        over the books and papers a little.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Approaching.] Are you searching for anything?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 No, I am merely looking at all these things. [Turns.] Perhaps I mustn't?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, by all means.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Is it you that writes in this great ledger?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, it's my book-keeper.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Is it a woman?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Smiles.] Yes.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 One you employ here, in your office?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Is she married?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, she is single.
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh, indeed!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 But I believe she is soon going to be married.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 That's a good thing for her.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 But not such a good thing for me. For then I shall have nobody to help
 me.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Can't you get hold of some one else who will do just as well?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Perhaps you would stay here and--and write in the ledger?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Measures him with a glance.] Yes, I daresay! No, thank you--nothing of
 that sort for me.
 
      [She again strolls across the room, and sits down on the
        rocking-chair.  SOLNESS too goes to the table.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Continuing.] For there must surely be plenty of other thing to be done
 here. [Looks smilingly at him.] Don't you think so, too?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Of course. First of all, I suppose, you want to make a round of the
 shops, and get yourself up in the height of fashion.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Amused.] No, I think I shall let that alone!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Indeed?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 For you must know I have run through all my money.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Laughs.] Neither trunk nor money, then?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Neither one nor the other. But never mind--it doesn't matter now.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Come now, I like you for that.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Only for that?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 For that among other things. [Sits in the arm-chair.] Is your father
 alive still?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, father's alive.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Perhaps you are thinking of studying here?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 No, that hadn't occurred to me.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 But I suppose you will be staying for some time?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 That must depend upon circumstances.
 
      [She sits awhile rocking herself and looking at him, half
        seriously, half with a suppressed smile.  Then she takes
        off her hat and puts it on the table in front of her.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Mr. Solness!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Well?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Have you a very bad memory?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 A bad memory? No, not that I am aware of.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Then have you nothing to say to me about what happened up there?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [In momentary surprise.] Up at Lysanger? [Indifferently.] Why, it was
 nothing much to talk about it seems to me.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks reproachfully at him.] How can you sit there and say such things?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Well, then, you talk to me about it.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 When the tower was finished, we had grand doings in the town.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, I shall not easily forget that day.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Smiles.] Will you not? That comes well from you.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Comes well?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 There was music in the churchyard--and many, many hundreds of people. We
 school-girls were dressed in white; and we all carried flags.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Ah yes, those flags--I can tell you I remember them!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Then you climbed right up the scaffolding, straight to the very top; and
 you had a great wreath with you; and you hung that wreath right away up
 on the weather-vane.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Curtly interrupting.] I always did that in those days. It is an old
 custom.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 It was so wonderfully thrilling to stand below and look up at you.
 Fancy, if he should fall over! He--the master builder himself!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [As if to divert her from the subject.] Yes, yes, yes, that might
 very will have happened, too. For one of those white-frocked little
 devils,--she went on in such a way, and screamed up at me so--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Sparkling with pleasure.] "Hurrah for Master Builder Solness!" Yes!
 
 
 SOLNESS. --and waved and flourished with her flag, so that I--so that it
 almost made me giddy to look at it.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [In a lower voice, seriously.] That little devil--that was _I_.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Fixes his eyes steadily upon her.] I am sure of that now. It must have
 been you.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Lively again.] Oh, it was so gloriously thrilling! I could not have
 believed there was a builder in the whole world that could build such a
 tremendously high tower. And then, that you yourself should stand at the
 very top of it, as large as life! And that you should not be the least
 bit dizzy! It was that above everything that made one--made one dizzy to
 think of.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 How could you be so certain that I was not?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Scouting the idea.] No indeed! Oh no! I knew that instinctively. For if
 you had been, you could never have stood up there and sung.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks at her in astonishment.] Sung? Did _I_ sing?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, I should think you did.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 
 [Shakes his head.] I have never sung a note in my life.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, indeed, you sang then. It sounded like harps in the air.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Thoughtfully.] This is very strange--all this.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Is silent awhile, looks at him and says in a low voice:] But then,--it
 was after that--that the real thing happened.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 The real thing?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Sparking with vivacity.] Yes, I surely don't need to remind you of
 that?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh yes do remind me a little of that, too.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Don't you remember that a great dinner was given in your honour at the
 Club?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, to be sure. It must have been the same afternoon, for I left the
 place next morning.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 And from the Club you were invited to come round to our house to supper.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Quite right, Miss Wangel. It is wonderful how all these trifles have
 impressed themselves on your mind.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Trifles! I like that! Perhaps it was a trifle, too, that I was alone in
 the room when you came in?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Were you alone?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Without answering him.] You didn't call me a little devil then?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, I suppose I did not.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 You said I was lovely in my white dress, and that I looked like a little
 princess.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I have no doubt you did, Miss Wangel.--And besides--I was feeling so
 buoyant and free that day--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 And then you said that when I grew up I should be your princess.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Laughing a little.] Dear, dear--did I say that too?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, you did. And when I asked how long I should have to wait, you
 said that you would come again in ten years--like a troll--and carry me
 off--to Spain or some such place. And you promised you would buy me a
 kingdom there.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [As before.] Yes, after a good dinner one doesn't haggle about the
 halfpence. But did I really say all that?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Laughs to herself.] Yes. And you told me, too, what the kingdom was to
 be called.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Well, what was it?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 It was to be called the kingdom of Orangia,* you said.
 
   *In the original "Appelsinia," "appelsin" meaning "orange."
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Well, that was an appetising name.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 No, I didn't like it a bit; for it seemed as though you wanted to make
 game of me.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I am sure that cannot have been my intention.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 No, I should hope not--considering what you did next--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 What in the world did I do next?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Well, that's the finishing touch, if you have forgotten that too. I
 should have thought no one could help remembering such a thing as that.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, yes, just give me a hint, and then perhaps---- Well?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks fixedly at him.] You came and kissed me, Mr. Solness.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Open-mouthed.] _I_ did!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, indeed you did. You took me in both your arms, and bent my head
 back, and kissed me--many times.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Now really, my dear Miss Wangel--!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Rises.] You surely cannot mean to deny it?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, I do. I deny it altogether!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks scornfully at him.] Oh, indeed!
 
        [She turns and goes slowly up to the stove, where she remains
        standing motionless, her face averted from him, her hands
        behind her back.  Short pause.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Goes cautiously up behind her.] Miss Wangel--!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Is silent and does not move.]
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Don't stand there like a statue. You must have dreamt all this. [Lays
 his hand on her arm.] Now just listen--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Makes an impatient movement with her arm.]
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [As a thought flashes upon him.] Or--! Wait a moment! There is something
 under all this, you may depend!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Does not move.]
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [In a low voice, but with emphasis.] I must have thought all that. I
 must have wished it--have willed it--have longed to do it. And then--.
 May not that be the explanation.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Is still silent.]
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Impatiently.] Oh very well, deuce take it all--then I did do it, I
 suppose.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Turns her head a little, but without looking at him.] Then you admit it
 now?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes--whatever you like.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 You came and put your arms round me?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh yes!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 And bent my head back?
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Very far back.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 And kissed me?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, I did.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Many times?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 As many as ever you like.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Turns quickly toward him and has once more the sparkling expression of
 gladness in her eyes.] Well, you see, I got it out of you at last!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [With a slight smile.] Yes--just think of my forgetting such a thing as
 that.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Again a little sulky, retreats from him.] Oh, you have kissed so many
 people in your time, I suppose.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, you mustn't think that of me. [HILDA seats herself in the arm-chair.
 SOLNESS stands and leans against the rocking-chair. Looks observantly at
 her.] Miss Wangel!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 How was it now? What came of all this--between us two.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Why, nothing more came of it. You know that quite well. For then the
 other guests came in, and then--bah!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Quite so! The others came in. To think of my forgetting that too!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh, you haven't really forgotten anything: you are only a little ashamed
 of it all. I am sure one doesn't forget things of that kind.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, one would suppose not.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Lively again, looks at him.] Perhaps you have even forgotten what day
 it was?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 What day--?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, on what day did you hang the wreath on the tower? Well? Tell me at
 once!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 H'm--I confess I have forgotten the particular day. I only know it was
 ten years ago. Some time in autumn.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Nods her head slowly several times.] It was ten years ago--on the 19th
 of September.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, it must have been about that time. Fancy your remembering that too!
 [Stops.] But wait a moment--! Yes--it's the 19th of September today.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, it is; and the ten years are gone. And you didn't come--as you had
 promised me.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Promised you? Threatened, I suppose you mean?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I don't think there was any sort of threat in that.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Well then, a little bit of fun.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Was that all you wanted? To make fun of me?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Well, or to have a little joke with you. Upon my soul, I don't
 recollect. But it must have been something of that kind; for you were a
 mere child then.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh, perhaps I wasn't quite such a child either. Not such a mere chit as
 you imagine.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks searchingly at her.] Did you really and seriously expect me to
 come again?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Conceals a half-teasing smile.] Yes, indeed! I did expect that of you.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 That I should come back to your home, and take you away with me?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Just like a troll--yes.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 And make a princess of you?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 That's what you promised.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 And give you a kingdom as well?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks up at the ceiling.] Why not? Of course it need not have been an
 actual, every-day sort of a kingdom.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 But something else just as good?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, at least as good. [Looks at him a moment.] I thought, if you could
 build the highest church-towers in the world, you could surely manage to
 raise a kingdom of one sort or another as well.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Shakes his head.] I can't quite make you out, Miss Wangel.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Can you not? To me it seems all so simple.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, I can't make up my mind whether you mean all you say, or are simply
 having a joke with me.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Smiles.] Making fun of you, perhaps? I, too?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, exactly. Making fun--of both of us. [Looks at her.] Is it long
 since you found out that I was married?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I have know it all along. Why do you ask me that?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Lightly.] Oh, well, it just occurred to me. [Looks earnestly at her,
 and says in a low voice.] What have you come for?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I want my kingdom. The time is up.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Laughs involuntarily.] What a girl you are!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Gaily.] Out with my kingdom, Mr. Solness! [Raps with her fingers.] The
 kingdom on the table!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Pushing the rocking-chair nearer and sitting down.] Now, seriously
 speaking--what have you come for? What do you really want to do here?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh, first of all, I want to go round and look at all the things that you
 have built.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 That will give you plenty of exercise.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, I know you have built a tremendous lot.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I have indeed--especially of late years.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Many church-towers among the rest? Immensely high ones?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No. I build no more church-towers now. Nor churches either.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 What do you build then?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Homes for human beings.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Reflectively.] Couldn't you build a little--a little bit of a
 church-tower over these homes as well?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Starting.] What do you mean by that?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I mean--something that points--points up into the free air. With the
 vane at a dizzy height.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Pondering a little.] Strange that you should say that--for that is just
 what I am most anxious to do.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Impatiently.] Why don't you do it, then?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Shakes his head.] No, the people will not have it.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Fancy their not wanting it!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [More lightly.] But now I am building a new home for myself--just
 opposite here.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 For yourself?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes. It is almost finished. And on that there is a tower.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 A high tower?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Very high?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No doubt people will say it is too high--too high for a dwelling-house.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I'll go out to look at that tower first thing to-morrow morning.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Sits resting his cheek on his hand, and gazes at her.] Tell me, Miss
 Wangel--what is your name? Your Christian name, I mean.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Why, Hilda, of course.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [As before.] Hilda? Indeed?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Don't you remember that? You called me Hilda yourself--that day when you
 misbehaved.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Did I really.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 But then you said "little Hilda"; and I didn't like that.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, you didn't like that, Miss Hilda?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 No, not at such a time as that. But--"Princess Hilda"--that will sound
 very well, I think.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Very well indeed. Princess Hilda of--of--what was to be the name of the
 kingdom?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Pooh! I won't have anything to do with that stupid kingdom. I have set
 my heart upon quite a different one!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Has leaned back in the chair, still gazing at her.] Isn't it strange--?
 The more I think of it now, the more it seems to me as though I had gone
 about all these years torturing myself with--h'm--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 With what?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 With the effort to recover something--some experience, which I seemed to
 have forgotten. But I never had the least inkling of what it could be.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 You should have tied a knot in your pocket-handkerchief, Mr. Solness.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 In that case, I should simply have had to go racking my brains to
 discover what the knot could mean.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh yes, I suppose there are trolls of that kind in the world, too.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Rises slowly.] What a good thing it is that you have come to me now.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks deeply into his eyes.] Is it a good thing!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 For I have been so lonely here. I have been gazing so helplessly at it
 all. [In a lower voice.] I must tell you--I have begun to be afraid of
 the younger generation.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [With a little snort of contempt.] Pooh--is the younger generation
 something to be afraid of?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 It is indeed. And that is why I have locked and barred myself in.
 [Mysteriously.] I tell you the younger generation will one day come and
 thunder at my door! They will break in upon me!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Then I should say you ought to go out and open the door to the younger
 generation.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Open the door?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes. Let them come in to you on friendly terms, as it were.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, no, no! The younger generation--it means retribution, you see. It
 comes, as if under a new banner, heralding the turn of fortune.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Rises, looks at him, and says with a quivering twitch of her lips.] Can
 _I_ be of any use to you, Mr. Solness?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, you can indeed! For you, too, come--under a new banner it seems to
 me. You marshalled against youth--!
 
 
   DR. HERDAL comes in by the hall-door.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 What--you and Miss Wangel here still?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes. We have had no end of things to talk about.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Both old and new.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Have you really?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh, it has been the greatest fun. For Mr. Solness--he has such a
 miraculous memory. All the least little details he remembers instantly.
 
 
   MRS. SOLNESS enters by the door on the right.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Well, Miss Wangel, your room is quite ready for you now.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh, how kind you are to me!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [To MRS. SOLNESS.] The nursery?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, the middle one. But first let us go in to supper.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Nods to HILDA.] Hilda shall sleep in the nursery, she shall.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks at him.] Hilda?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, Miss Wangel's name is Hilda. I knew her when she was a child.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Did you really, Halvard? Well, shall we go?
 
      [She takes DR. HERDAL's arm and goes out with him to the
        right.  HILDA has meanwhile been collecting her travelling
        things.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Softly and rapidly to SOLNESS.] Is it true, what you said? Can I be of
 use to you?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Takes the things from her.] You are the very being I have needed most.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks at him with happy, wondering eyes and clasps her hands.] But
 then, great heavens--!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Eagerly.] What--?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Then I have my kingdom!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Involuntarily.] Hilda--!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Again with the quivering twitch of her lips.] Almost--I was going to
 say.
 
      [She goes out to the right, SOLNESS follows her.
 
 
 
 
 ACT SECOND.
 
   A prettily furnished small drawing-room in SOLNESS'S house.
   In the back, a glass-door leading out to the verandah and
   garden.  The right-hand corner is cut off transversely by
   a large bay-window, in which are flower-stands.  The left-
   hand corner is similarly cut off by a transverse wall, in
   which is a small door papered like the wall.  On each side,
   an ordinary door.  In front, on the right, a console table
   with a large mirror over it.  Well-filled stands of plants
   and flowers.  In front, on the left, a sofa with a table
   and chairs.  Further back, a bookcase.  Well forward in the
   room, before the bay window, a small table and some chairs.
   It is early in the day.
 
   SOLNESS sits by the little table with RAGNAR BROVIK'S
   portfolio open in front of him.  He is turning the drawings
   over and closely examining some of them.  MRS. SOLNESS moves
   about noiselessly with a small watering-pot, attending to her
   flowers.  She is dressed in black as before.  Her hat, cloak
   and parasol lie on a chair near the mirror.  Unobserved by her,
   SOLNESS now and again follows her with his eyes.  Neither of
   them speaks.
 
   KAIA FOSLI enters quietly by the door on the left.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Turns his head, and says in an off-hand tone of indifference:] Well, is
 that you?
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 I merely wished to let you know that I have come.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, yes, that's all right. Hasn't Ragnar come too?
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 No, not yet. He had to wait a little while to see the doctor. But he is
 coming presently to hear--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 How is the old man to-day?
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 Not well. He begs you to excuse him; he is obliged to keep his bed
 to-day.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Why, of course; by all means let him rest. But now, get to your work.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 Yes. [Pauses at the door.] Do you wish to speak to Ragnar when he comes?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No--I don't know that I have anything particular to say to him.
 
      [KAIA goes out again to the left.  SOLNESS remains seated,
        turning over the drawings.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Over beside the plants.] I wonder if he isn't going to die now, as
 well?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks up at her.] As well as who?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Without answering.] Yes, yes--depend upon it, Halvard, old Brovik is
 going to die too. You'll see that he will.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 My dear Aline, ought you not to go out for a little walk?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, I suppose I ought to.
 
      [She continues to attend the flowers.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Bending over the drawings.] Is she still asleep?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Looking at him.] Is it Miss Wangel you are sitting there thinking
 about?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Indifferently.] I just happened to recollect her.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Miss Wangle was up long ago.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, was she?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 When I went in to see her, she was busy putting her things in order.
 
      [She goes in front of the mirror and slowly begins to put on
        her hat.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [After a short pause.] So we have found a use for one our nurseries
 after all, Aline.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, we have.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 That seems to me better than to have them all standing empty.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 That emptiness is dreadful; you are right there.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Closes the portfolio, rises and approaches her.] You will find that
 we shall get on far better after this, Aline. Things will be more
 comfortable. Life will be easier--especially for you.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks at him.] After this?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, believe me, Aline--
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Do you mean--because she has come here?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Checking himself.] I mean, of course--when once we have moved into the
 new home.
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Takes her cloak.] Ah, do you think so, Halvard? Will it be better then?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I can't think otherwise. And surely you think so too?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 I think nothing at all about the new house.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Cast down.] It's hard for me to hear you say that; for you know it is
 mainly for your sake that I have built it.
 
      [He offers to help her on with her cloak.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Evades him.] The fact is, you do far too much for my sake.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [With a certain vehemence.] No, no, you really mustn't say that, Aline!
 I cannot bear to hear you say such things!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Very well, then I won't say it, Halvard.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 But I stick to what _I_ said. You'll see that things will be easier for
 you in the new place.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, heavens--easier for me--!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Eagerly.] Yes, indeed they will! You may be quite sure of that! For you
 see--there will be so very, very much there that will remind you of your
 own home--
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 The home that used to be father's and mother's--and that was burnt to
 the ground--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [In a low voice.] Yes, yes, my poor Aline. That was a terrible blow for
 you.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Breaking out in lamentation.] You may build as much as ever you like,
 Halvard--you can never build up again a real home for me!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Crosses the room.] Well, in Heaven's name, let us talk no more about it
 then.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 We are not in the habit of talking about it. For you always put the
 thought away from you--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Stops suddenly and looks at her.] Do I? And why should I do that? Put
 the thought away from me?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh yes, Halvard, I understand you very well. You are so anxious to spare
 me--and to find excuses for me too--as much as ever you can.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [With astonishment in his eyes.] You! Is it you--yourself, that your are
 talking about, Aline?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, who else should it be but myself?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Involuntarily to himself.] That too!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 As for the old house, I wouldn't mind so much about that. When once
 misfortune was in the air--why--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Ah, you are right there. Misfortune will have its way--as the saying
 goes.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 But it's what came of the fire--the dreadful thing that followed--! That
 is the thing! That, that, that!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Vehemently.] Don't think about that, Aline!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Ah, that is exactly what I cannot help thinking about. And now, at last,
 I must speak about it, too; for I don't seem to be able to bear it any
 longer. And then never to be able to forgive myself--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Exclaiming.] Yourself--!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, for I had duties on both sides--both towards you and towards the
 little ones. I ought to have hardened myself--not to have let the
 horror take such hold upon me--nor the grief for the burning of my home.
 [Wrings her hands.] Oh, Halvard, if I had only had the strength!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Softly, much moved, comes closer.] Aline--you must promise me never to
 think these thoughts any more.--Promise me that, dear!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, promise, promise! One can promise anything.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Clenches his hands and crosses the room.] Oh, but this is hopeless,
 hopeless! Never a ray of sunlight! Not so much as a gleam of brightness
 to light up our home!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 This is no home, Halvard.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh no, you may well say that. [Gloomily.] And God knows whether you are
 not right in saying that it will be no better for us in the new house,
 either.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 It will never be any better. Just as empty--just as desolate--there as
 here.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Vehemently.] Why in all the world have we built it then? Can you tell
 me that?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 No; you must answer that question for yourself.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Glances suspiciously at her.] What do you mean by that, Aline?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 What do I mean?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, in the devil's name! You said it so strangely--as if you had some
 hidden meaning in it.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 No, indeed, I assure you--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Comes closer.] Oh, come now--I know what I know. I have both my eyes
 and my ears about me, Aline--you may depend upon that!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Why, what are you talking about? What is it?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Places himself in front of her.] Do you mean to say you don't find a
 kind of lurking, hidden meaning in the most innocent word I happen to
 say?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 _I_ do you say? _I_ do that?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Laughs.] Ho-ho-ho! It's natural enough, Aline! When you have a sick man
 on your hands--
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Anxiously.] Sick? Are you ill, Halvard?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Violently.] A half-mad man then! A crazy man! Call me what you will.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Feels blindly for a chair and sits down.] Halvard--for God's sake--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 But you are wrong, both you and the doctor. I am not in the state that
 you imagine.
 
      [He walks up and down the room.  MRS. SOLNESS follows him
        anxiously with her eyes.  Finally he goes up to her.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Calmly.] In reality there is nothing whatever the matter with me.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 No, there isn't, is there? But then what is it that troubles you so?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Why this, that I often feel ready to sink under this terrible burden of
 debt--
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Debt, do you say? But you owe no one anything, Halvard!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Softly, with emotion.] I owe a boundless debt to you--to you--to you,
 Aline.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Rises slowly.] What is behind all this? You may just as well tell me at
 once.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 But there is nothing behind it! I have never done you any wrong--not
 wittingly and willfully, at any rate. And yet--and yet it seems as
 though a crushing debt rested upon me and weighed me down.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 A debt to me?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Chiefly to you.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Then you are--ill after all, Halvard.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Gloomily.] I suppose I must be--or not far from it. [Looks towards the
 door to the right, which is opened at this moment.] Ah! now it grows
 light.
 
 
   HILDA WANGEL comes in.  She has made some alteration in her
   dress, and let down her skirt.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Good morning, Mr. Solness!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Nods.] Slept well?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Quite deliciously! Like a child in a cradle. Oh--I lay and stretched
 myself like--like a princess!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Smiles a little.] You were thoroughly comfortable then?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I should think so.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 And no doubt you dreamed, too.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, I did. But that was horrid.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Was it?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, for I dreamed I was falling over a frightfully high, sheer
 precipice. Do you never have that kind of dream?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh yes--now and then--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 It's tremendously thrilling--when you fall and fall--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 It seems to make one's blood run cold.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Do you draw your legs up under you while you are falling?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, as high as ever I can.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 So do I.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Takes her parasol.] I must go into town now, Halvard. [To HILDA.] And
 I'll try to get one or two things that you may require.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Making a motion to throw her arms round her neck.] Oh, you dear, Mrs.
 Solness! You are really much too kind to me! Frightfully kind--
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Deprecatingly, freeing herself.] Oh, not at all. It's only my duty, so
 I am very glad to do it.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Offended, pouts.] But really, I think I am quite fit to be seen in the
 streets--now that I've put my dress to rights. Or do you think I am not?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 To tell you the truth, I think people would stare at you a little.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Contemptuously.] Pooh! Is that all? That only amuses me.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [With suppressed ill-humour.] Yes, but people might take it into their
 heads that you were mad too, you see.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Mad? Are there so many mad people here in town, then?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Points to his own forehead.] Here you see one at all events.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 You--Mr. Solness!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Have you not noticed that yet?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 No, I certainly have not. [Reflects and laughs a little.] And
 yet--perhaps in one single thing.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Ah, do you hear that, Aline?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 What is that one single thing, Miss Wangel?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 No, I won't say.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh yes, do!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 No thank you--I am not so mad as that.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 When you and Miss Wangel are alone, I daresay she will tell you,
 Halvard.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Ah--you think she will?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh yes, certainly. For you have known her so well in the past. Ever
 since she was a child--you tell me.
 
      [She goes out by the door on the left.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [After a little while.] Does your wife dislike me very much?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Did you think you noticed anything of the kind?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Did you notice it yourself?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Evasively.] Aline has become exceedingly shy with strangers of late
 years.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Has she really?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 But if only you could get to know her thoroughly--! Ah, she is so
 good--so kind--so excellent a creature--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Impatiently.] But if she is all that--what made her say that about her
 duty?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Her duty?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 She said that she would go out and buy something for me, because it was
 her duty. Oh, I can't bear that ugly, horrid word!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Why not?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 It sounds so could and sharp, and stinging. Duty--duty--duty. Don't you
 think so, too? Doesn't it seem to sting you?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 H'm--haven't thought much about it.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, it does. And if she is so good--as you say she is--why should she
 talk in that way?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 But, good Lord, what would you have had her say, then?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 She might have said she would do it because she had taken a tremendous
 fancy to me. She might have said something like that--something really
 warm and cordial, you understand.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks at her.] Is that how you would like to have it?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, precisely. [She wanders about the room, stops at the bookcase and
 looks at the books.] What a lot of books you have.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, I have got together a good many.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Do you read them all, too?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I used to try to. Do you read much?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 No, never! I have given it up. For it all seems so irrelevant.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 That is just my feeling.
 
      [HILDA wanders about a little, stops at the small table, opens
        the portfolio and turns over the contents.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Are all these your drawings yours?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, they are drawn by a young man whom I employ to help me.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Some one you have taught?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh yes, no doubt he has learnt something from me, too.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Sits down.] Then I suppose he is very clever. [Looks at a drawing.]
 Isn't he?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, he might be worse. For my purpose--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh yes--I'm sure he is frightfully clever.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Do you think you can see that in the drawings?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Pooh--these scrawlings! But if he has been learning from you--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, so far as that goes--there are plenty of people here that have
 learnt from me, and have come to little enough for all that.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks at him and shakes her head.] No, I can't for the life of me
 understand how you can be so stupid.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Stupid? Do you think I am so very stupid?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, I do indeed. If you are content to go about here teaching all these
 people--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [With a slight start.] Well, and why not?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Rises, half serious, half laughing.] No indeed, Mr. Solness! What can
 be the good of that? No one but you should be allowed to build. You
 should stand quite alone--do it all yourself. Now you know it.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Involuntarily.] Hilda--!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Well!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 How in the world did that come into your head?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Do you think I am so very far wrong then?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, that's not what I mean. But now I'll tell you something.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Well?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I keep on--incessantly--in silence and alone--brooding on that very
 thought.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, that seems to me perfectly natural.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks somewhat searchingly at her.] Perhaps you have noticed it
 already?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 No, indeed I haven't.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 But just now--when you said you thought I was--off my balance? In one
 thing, you said--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh, I was thinking of something quite different.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 What was it?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I am not going to tell you.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Crosses the room.] Well, well--as you please. [Stops at the
 bow-window.] Come here, and I will show you something.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Approaching.] What is it?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Do you see over here in the garden--?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Points.] Right above the great quarry--?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 That new house, you mean?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 The one that is being built, yes. Almost finished.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 It seems to have a very high tower.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 The scaffolding is still up.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Is that your new house?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 The house you are soon going to move into?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks at him.] Are there nurseries in that house, too?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Three, as there are here.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 And no child.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 And there never will be one.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [With a half-smile.] Well, isn't it just as I said--?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 That--?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 That you are a little--a little mad after all.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Was that what you were thinking of?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, of all the empty nurseries I slept in.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Lowers his voice.] We have had children--Aline and I.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks eagerly at him.] Have you--?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Two little boys. They were of the same age.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Twins, then.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, twins. It's eleven or twelve years ago now.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Cautiously.] And so both of them--? You have lost both the twins, then?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [With quiet emotion.] We kept them only about three weeks. Or scarcely
 so much. [Bursts forth.] Oh, Hilda, I can't tell you what a good thing
 it is for me that you have come! For now at last I have some one to talk
 to!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Can you not talk to--her, too?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Not about this. Not as I want to talk and must talk. [Gloomily.] And not
 about so many other things, either.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [In a subdued voice.] Was that all you meant when you said you need me?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 That was mainly what I meant--at all events, yesterday. For to-day I am
 not so sure--[Breaking off.] Come here and let us sit down, Hilda. Sit
 there on the sofa--so that you can look into the garden. [HILDA seats
 herself in the corner of the sofa. SOLNESS brings a chair closer.]
 Should you like to hear about it?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, I shall love to sit and listen to you.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Sits down.] Then I will tell you all about it.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Now I can see both the garden and you, Mr. Solness. So now, tell away!
 Begin!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Points towards the bow-window.] Out there on the rising ground--where
 you see the new house--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Aline and I lived there in the first years of our married life. There
 was an old house up there that had belonged to her mother; and we
 inherited it, and the whole of the great garden with it.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Was there a tower on that house, too?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, nothing of the kind. From the outside it looked like a great, dark,
 ugly wooden box; but all the same, it was snug and comfortable enough
 inside.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Then did you pull down the ramshackle old place?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, it was burnt down.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 The whole of it?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Was that a great misfortune for you?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 That depends on how you look at it. As a builder, the fire was the
 making of me--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Well, but--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 It was just after the birth of the two little boys--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 The poor little twins, yes.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 They came healthy and bonny into the world. And they were growing
 too--you could see the difference day to day.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Little children do grow quickly at first.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 It was the prettiest sight in the world to see Aline lying with the two
 of them in her arms.--But then came the night of the fire--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Excitedly.] What happened? Do tell me! Was any one burnt?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, not that. Every one got safe and sound out of the house--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Well, and what then--?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 The fright had shaken Aline terribly. The alarm--the escape--the
 break-neck hurry--and then the ice-cold night air--for they had to be
 carried out just as they lay--both she and the little ones.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Was it too much for them?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh no, they stood it well enough. But Aline fell into a fever, and it
 affected her milk. She would insist on nursing them herself; because it
 was her duty, she said. And both our little boys, they--[Clenching his
 hands.]--they--oh!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 They did not get over that?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, that they did not get over. That was how we lost them.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 It must have been terribly hard for you.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Hard enough for me; but ten time harder for Aline. [Clenching his hands
 in suppressed fury.] Oh, that such things should be allowed to happen
 here the world! [Shortly and firmly.] From the day I lost them, I had no
 heart for building churches.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Did you not like building the church-tower in our town?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I didn't like it. I know how free and happy I felt when that tower was
 finished.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 _I_ know that, too.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 And now I shall never--never build anything of that sort again! Neither
 churches nor church-towers.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Nods slowly.] Nothing but houses for people to live in.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Homes for human beings, Hilda.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 But homes with high towers and pinnacles upon them.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 If possible. [Adopts a lighter tone.] But, as I said before, that fire
 was the making of me--as a builder, I mean.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Why don't you call yourself an architect, like the others?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I have not been systematically enough taught for that. Most of what I
 know I have found out for myself.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 But you succeeded all the same.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, thanks to the fire. I laid out almost the whole of the garden in
 villa lots; and there I was able to build after my own heart. So I came
 to the front with a rush.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks keenly at him.] You must surely be a very happy man, as matters
 stand with you.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Gloomily.] Happy? Do you say that, too--like all the rest of them?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, I should say you must be. If you could only cease thing about the
 two little children--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Slowly.] The two little children--they are not so easy to forget,
 Hilda.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Somewhat uncertainly.] Do you still feel their loss so much--after all
 these years?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks fixedly at her, without replying.] A happy man you said--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Well, now, are you not happy--in other respects?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Continues to look at her.] When I told you all this about the
 fire--h'm--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Well?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Was there not one special thought that you--that you seized upon?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Reflects in vain.] No. What thought should that be?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [With subdued emphasis.] It was simply and solely by that fire that I
 was enabled to build homes for human beings. Cosy, comfortable, bright
 homes, where father and mother and the whole troop of children can live
 in safety and gladness, feeling what a happy thing it is to be alive in
 the world--and most of all to belong to each other--in great things and
 in small.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Ardently.] Well, and is it not a great happiness for you to be able to
 build such beautiful homes?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 The price, Hilda! The terrible price I had to pay for the opportunity!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 But can you never get over that?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No. That I might build homes for others, I had to forego--to forego
 for all time--the home that might have been my own. I mean a home for a
 troop of children--and for father and mother, too.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Cautiously.] But need you have done that? For all time, you say?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Nods slowly.] That was the price of this happiness that people talk
 about. [Breathes heavily.] This happiness--h'm--this happiness was not
 to be bought any cheaper, Hilda.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [As before.] But may it not come right even yet?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Never in this world--never. That is another consequence of the fire--and
 of Aline's illness afterwards.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks at him with an indefinable expression.] And yet you build all
 these nurseries.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Seriously.] Have you never noticed, Hilda, how the impossible--how it
 seems to beckon and cry aloud to one?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Reflecting.] The impossible? [With animation.] Yes, indeed! Is that how
 you feel too?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, I do.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Then there must be--a little of the troll in you too.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Why of the troll?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 What would you call it, then?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Rises.] Well, well, perhaps you are right. [Vehemently.] But how can
 I help turning into a troll, when this is how it always goes with me in
 everything--in everything!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 How do you mean?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Speaking low, with inward emotion.] Mark what I say to you, Hilda.
 All that I have succeeded in doing, building, creating--all the beauty,
 security, cheerful comfort--ay, and magnificence too--[Clenches his
 hands.] Oh, is it not terrible even to think of--?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 What is so terrible?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 That all this I have to make up for, to pay for--not in money, but in
 human happiness. And not with my own happiness only, but with other
 people's too. Yes, yes, do you see that, Hilda? That is the price which
 my position as an artist has cost me--and others. And every single day
 I have to look on while the price is paid for me anew. Over again, and
 over again--and over again for ever!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Rises and looks steadily at him.] Now I can see that you are thinking
 of--of her.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, mainly of Aline. For Aline--she, too, had her vocation in life,
 just as much as I had mine. [His voice quivers.] But her vocation has
 had to be stunted, and crushed, and shattered--in order that mine might
 force its way to--to a sort of great victory. For you must know that
 Aline--she, too, had a talent for building.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 She! For building?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Shakes his head.] Not houses and towers, and spires--not such things as
 I work away at--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Well, but what then?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Softly, with emotion.] For building up the souls of little children,
 Hilda. For building up children's souls in perfect balance, and in
 noble and beautiful forms. For enabling them to soar up into erect and
 full-grown human souls. That was Aline's talent. And there it all
 lies now--unused and unusable for ever--of no earthly service to any
 one--just like the ruins left by a fire.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, but even if this were so--?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 It is so! It is so! I know it!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Well, but in any case it is not your fault.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Fixes his eyes on her, and nods slowly.] Ah, that is the great, the
 terrible question. That is the doubt that is gnawing me--night and day.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 That?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes. Suppose the fault was mine--in a certain sense.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Your fault! The fire!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 All of it; the whole thing. And yet, perhaps--I may not have had
 anything to do with it.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks at him with a troubled expression.] Oh, Mr. Solness--if you can
 talk like that, I am afraid you must be--ill after all.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 H'm--I don't think I shall ever be of quite sound mind on that point.
 
 
   RAGNAR BROVIK cautiously opens the little door in the left-
   hand corner.  HILDA comes forward.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [When he sees Hilda.] Oh. I beg pardon, Mr. Solness---- [He makes a
 movement to withdraw.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, no, don't go. Let us get it over.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Oh, yes--if only we could.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I hear your father is no better?
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Father is fast growing weaker--and therefore I beg and implore you to
 write a few kind words for me on one of the plans! Something for father
 to read before he--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Vehemently.] I won't hear anything more about those drawings of yours!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Have you looked at them?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes--I have.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 And they are good for nothing? And _I_ am good for nothing, too?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Evasively.] Stay here with me, Ragnar. You shall have everything your
 own way. And then you can marry Kaia, and live at your ease--and happily
 too, who knows? Only don't think of building on your own account.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Well, well, then I must go home and tell father what you say--I promised
 I would.--Is this what I am to tell father--before he dies?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [With a groan.] Oh tell him--tell him what you will, for me. Best to say
 nothing at all to him! [With a sudden outburst.] I cannot do anything
 else, Ragnar!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 May I have the drawings to take with me?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, take them--take them by all means! They are lying there on the
 table.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [Goes to the table.] Thanks.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Puts her hand on the portfolio.] No, no; leave them here.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Why?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Because I want to look at them, too.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 But you have been---- [To RAGNAR.] Well, leave them here, then.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Very well.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 And go home at once to your father.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Yes, I suppose I must.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [As if in desperation.] Ragnar--you must not ask me to do what is beyond
 my power! Do you hear, Ragnar? You must not!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 No, no. I beg you pardon--
 
      [He bows, and goes out by the corner door.  HILDA goes over and
        sits down on a chair near the mirror.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks angrily at SOLNESS.] That was a very ugly thing to do.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Do you think so, too?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, it was horribly ugly--and hard and bad and cruel as well.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, you don't understand my position.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 No matter--. I say you ought not to be like that.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 You said yourself, only just now, that no one but _I_ ought to be
 allowed to build.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 _I_ may say such things--but you must not.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I most of all, surely, who have paid so dear for my position.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh yes--with what you call domestic comfort--and that sort of thing.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 And with my peace of soul into the bargain.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Rising.] Peace of soul! [With feeling.] Yes, yes, you are right in
 that! Poor Mr. Solness--you fancy that--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [With a quiet, chuckling laugh.] Just sit down again, Hilda, and I'll
 tell you something funny.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Sits down; with intent interest.] Well?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 It sounds such a ludicrous little thing; for, you see, the whole story
 turns upon nothing but a crack in the chimney.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 No more than that?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, not to begin with.
 
      [He moves a chair nearer to HILDA and sits down.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Impatiently, taps on her knee.] Well, now for the crack in the chimney!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I had noticed the split in the flue long, long before the fire. Every
 time I went up into the attic, I looked to see if it was still there.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 And it was?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes; for no one else knew about it.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 And you said nothing?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Nothing.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 And did not think of repairing the flue either?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh yes, I thought about it--but never got any further. Every time I
 intended to set to work, it seemed just as if a hand held me back. Not
 to-day, I thought--to-morrow; and nothing ever came of it.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 But why did you keep putting it off like that?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Because I was revolving something in my mind. [Slowly, and in a low
 voice.] Through that little black crack in the chimney, I might,
 perhaps, force my way upwards--as a builder.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looking straight in front of her.] That must have been thrilling.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Almost irresistible--quite irresistible. For at that time it appeared
 to me a perfectly simple and straightforward matter. I would have had
 it happen in the winter-time--a little before midday. I was to be out
 driving Aline in the sleigh. The servants at home would have made huge
 fires in the stoves.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 For, of course, it was to be bitterly cold that day?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Rather biting, yes--and they would want Aline to find it thoroughly snug
 and warm when she came home.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I suppose she is very chilly by nature?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 She is. And as we drove home, we were to see the smoke.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Only the smoke?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 The smoke first. But when we came up to the garden gate, the whole of
 the old timber-box was to be a rolling mass of flames.--That is how I
 wanted it to be, you see.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh, why, why could it not have happened so!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 You may well say that, Hilda.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Well, but now listen, Mr. Solness. Are you perfectly certain that the
 fire was caused by that little crack in the chimney!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, on the contrary--I am perfectly certain that the crack in the
 chimney had nothing whatever to do with the fire.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 What!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 It has been clearly ascertained that the fire broke out in a
 clothes-cupboard--in a totally different part of the house.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Then what is all this nonsense you are talking about the crack in the
 chimney!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 May I go on talking to you a little, Hilda?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, if you'll only talk sensibly--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I will try to. [He moves his chair nearer.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Out with it, then, Mr. Solness.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Confidentially.] Don't you agree with me, Hilda, that there exist
 special, chosen people who have been endowed with the power and
 faculty if desiring a thing, craving for a thing, willing a thing--so
 persistently and so--so inexorably--that at last it has to happen? Don't
 you believe that?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [With an indefinable expression in her eyes.] If that is so, we shall
 see, one of these days, whether _I_ am one of the chosen.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 It is not one's self alone that can do such great things. Oh, no--the
 helpers and the servers--they must do their part too, if it is to be of
 any good. But they never come of themselves. One has to call upon them
 very persistently--inwardly, you understand.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 What are these helpers and servers?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, we can talk about that some other time. For the present, let us keep
 to this business of the fire.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Don't you think that fire would have happened all the same--even without
 your wishing for it?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 If the house had been old Knut Brovik's, it would never have burnt down
 so conveniently for him. I am sure of that; for he does not know how
 to call for the helpers--no, nor for the servers, either. [Rises in
 unrest.] So you see, Hilda--it is my fault, after all, that the lives of
 the two little boys had to be sacrificed. And do you think it is not
 my fault, too, that Aline has never been the woman she should and might
 have been--and that she most longed to be?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, but if it is all the work of these helpers and servers--?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Who called for the helpers and servers? It was I! And they came and
 obeyed my will. [In increasing excitement.] That is what people call
 having the luck on your side; but I must tell you what this sort of luck
 feels like! It feels like a great raw place here on my breast. And the
 helpers and servers keep on flaying pieces of skin off other people in
 order to close my sore!--But still the sore is not healed--never, never!
 Oh, if you knew how it can sometimes gnaw and burn!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks attentively at him.] You are ill, Mr. Solness. Very ill, I almost
 think.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Say mad; for that is what you mean.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 No, I don't think there is much amiss with your intellect.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 With what then? Out with it!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I wonder whether you were not sent into the world with a sickly
 conscience.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 A sickly conscience? What devilry is that?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I mean that your conscience is feeble--too delicately built, as it
 were--hasn't strength to take a grip of things--to lift and bear what is
 heavy.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Growls.] H'm! May I ask, then, what sort of a conscience one ought to
 have?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I should like your conscience to be--to be thoroughly robust.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Indeed? Robust, eh? Is your own conscience robust, may I ask?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, I think it is. I have never noticed that it wasn't.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 It has not been put very severely to the test, I should think.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [With a quivering of the lips.] Oh, it was no such simple matter to
 leave father--I am so awfully fond of him.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Dear me! for a month or two--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I think I shall never go home again.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Never? Then why did you leave him?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Half-seriously, half-banteringly.] Have you forgotten again that the
 ten year are up?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh nonsense. Was anything wrong at home? Eh?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Quite seriously.] It was this impulse within me that urged and goaded
 me to come--and lured and drew me on, as well.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Eagerly.] There we have it! There we have it, Hilda! There is the troll
 in you too, as in me. For it's the troll in one, you see--it is that
 that calls to the powers outside us. And then you must give in--whether
 you will or no.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I almost think you are right, Mr. Solness.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Walks about the room.] Oh, there are devils innumerable abroad in the
 world, Hilda, that one never sees.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Devils, too?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Stops.] Good devils and bad devils; light-haired devils and
 black-haired devils. If only you could always tell whether it is the
 light or dark ones that have got hold of you! [Paces about.] Ho-ho! Then
 it would be simple enough!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Follows him with her eyes.] Or if one had a really vigorous, radiantly
 healthy conscience--so that one dared to do what one would.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Stops beside the console table.] I believe, now, that most people are
 just as puny creatures as I am in that respect.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I shouldn't wonder.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Leaning against the table.] In the sagas--. Have you read any of the
 old sagas?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh yes! When I used to read books, I--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 In the sagas you read about vikings, who sailed to foreign lands, and
 plundered and burned and killed men--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 And carried off women--
 
 
 SOLNESS. --and kept them in captivity--
 
 
 HILDA. --took them home in their ships--
 
 
 SOLNESS. --and behaved to them like--like the very worst of trolls.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks straight before her, with a half-veiled look.] I think that must
 have been thrilling.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [With a short, deep laugh.] To carry off women, eh?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 To be carried off.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks at her a moment.] Oh, indeed.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [As if breaking the thread of the conversation.] But what made you speak
 of these vikings, Mr. Solness?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Why, those fellows must have had robust consciences, if you like!
 When they got home again, they could eat and drink, and be as happy as
 children. And the women, too! They often would not leave them on any
 account. Can you understand that, Hilda?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Those women I can understand exceedingly well.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oho! Perhaps you could do the same yourself?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Why not?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Live--of your own free will--with a ruffian like that?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 If it was a ruffian I had come to love--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Could you come to love a man like that?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Good heavens, you know very well one can't choose whom one is going to
 love.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks meditatively at her.] Oh no, I suppose it is the troll within one
 that's responsible for that.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Half-laughing.] And all those blessed devils, that you know so
 well--both the light-haired and the dark-haired ones.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Quietly and warmly.] Then I hope with all my heart that the devils will
 choose carefully for you, Hilda.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 For me they have chosen already--once and for all.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks earnestly at her.] Hilda--you are like a wild bird of the woods.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Far from it. I don't hide myself away under the bushes.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, no. There is rather something of the bird of prey in you.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 That is nearer it--perhaps. [Very vehemently.] And why not a bird of
 prey? Why should not _I_ go a-hunting--I, as well as the rest? Carry off
 the prey I want--if only I can get my claws into it, and do with it as I
 will.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Hilda--do you know what you are?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, I suppose I am a strange sort of bird.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No. You are like a dawning day. When I look at you--I seem to be looking
 towards the sunrise.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Tell me, Mr. Solness--are you certain that you have never called me to
 you? Inwardly, you know?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Softly and slowly.] I almost think I must have.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 What did you want with me?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 You are the younger generation, Hilda.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Smiles.] That younger generation that you are so afraid of?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Nods slowly.] And which, in my heart, I yearn towards so deeply.
 
      [HILDA rises, goes to the little table, and fetches RAGNAR
        BROVIK'S portfolio.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Holds out the portfolio to him.] We were talking of these drawings--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Shortly, waving them away.] Put those things away! I have seen enough
 of them.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, but you have to write your approval on them.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Write my approval on them? Never!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 But the poor old man is lying at death's door! Can't you give him and
 his son this pleasure before they are parted? And perhaps he might get
 the commission to carry them out, too.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, that is just what he would get. He has made sure of that--has my
 fine gentleman!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Then, good heavens--if that is so--can't you tell the least little bit
 of a lie for once in a way?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 A lie? [Raging.] Hilda--take those devil's drawings out of my sight!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Draws the portfolio a little nearer to herself.] Well, well,
 well--don't bite me.--You talk of trolls--but I think you go on like a
 troll yourself. [Looks round.] Where do you keep your pen and ink?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 There is nothing of the sort in here.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Goes towards the door.] But in the office where that young lady is--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Stay where you are, Hilda!--I ought to tell a lie, you say. Oh yes, for
 the sake of his old father I might well do that--for in my time I have
 crushed him, trodden him under foot--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Him, too?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I needed room for myself. But this Ragnar--he must on no account be
 allowed to come to the front.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Poor fellow, there is surely no fear of that. If he has nothing in him--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Comes closer, looks at her, and whispers.] If Ragnar Brovik gets his
 chance, he will strike me to the earth. Crush me--as I crushed his
 father.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Crush you? Has he the ability for that?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, you may depend upon it he has the ability! He is the younger
 generation that stands ready to knock at my door--to make an end of
 Halvard Solness.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks at him with quiet reproach.] And yet you would bar him out. Fie,
 Mr. Solness!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 The fight I have been fighting has cost heart's blood enough.--And I am
 afraid, too, that the helpers and servers will not obey me any longer.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Then you must go ahead without them. There is nothing else for it.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 It is hopeless, Hilda. The luck is bound to turn. A little sooner or a
 little later. Retribution is inexorable.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [In distress, putting her hands over her ears.] Don't talk like that! Do
 you want to kill me? To take from me what is more than my life?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 And what is that?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 The longing to see you great. To see you, with a wreath in your hand,
 high, high up upon a church-tower. [Calm again.] Come, out with your
 pencil now. You must have a pencil about you?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Takes out his pocket-book.] I have one here.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Lays the portfolio on the sofa-table.] Very well. Now let us two sit
 down here, Mr. Solness. [SOLNESS seats himself at the table. HILDA
 stands behind him, leaning over the back of the chair.] And now we
 well write on the drawings. We must write very, very nicely and
 cordially--for this horrid Ruar--or whatever his name is.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Writes a few words, turns his head and looks at her.] Tell me one
 thing, Hilda.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 If you have been waiting for me all these ten years--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 What then?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Why have you never written to me? Then I could have answered you.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Hastily.] No, no, no! That was just what I did not want.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Why not?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I was afraid the whole thing might fall to pieces.--But we were going to
 write on the drawings, Mr. Solness.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 So we were.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Bends forward and looks over his shoulder while he writes.] Mind now,
 kindly and cordially! Oh how I hate--how I hate this Ruald--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Writing.] Have you never really cared for any one, Hilda?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 For any one else, I suppose you mean?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks up at her.] For any one else, yes. Have you never? In all these
 ten years? Never?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh yes, now and then. When I was perfectly furious with you for not
 coming.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Then you did take an interest in other people, too?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 A little bit--for a week or so. Good heavens, Mr. Solness, you surely
 know how such things come about.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Hilda--what is it you have come for?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Don't waste time talking. The poor old man might go and die in the
 meantime.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Answer me, Hilda. What do you want of me?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I want my kingdom.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 H'm--
 
 
   He gives a rapid glance toward the door on the left, and
   then goes on writing on the drawings.  At the same moment
   MRS. SOLNESS enters.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Here are a few things I have got for you, Miss Wangel. The large parcels
 will be sent later on.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh, how very, very kind of you!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Only my simple duty. Nothing more than that.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Reading over what he has written.] Aline!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Yes?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Did you notice whether the--the book-keeper was out there?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, of course, she was there.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Puts the drawings in the portfolio.] H'm--
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 She was standing at the desk, as she always is--when _I_ go through the
 room.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Rises.] Then I'll give this to her and tell her that--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Takes the portfolio from him.] Oh, no, let me have the pleasure of
 doing that! [Goes to the door, but turns.] What is her name?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Her name is Miss Fosli.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Pooh, that sounds so cold! Her Christian name, I mean?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Kaia--I believe.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Opens the door and calls out.] Kaia, come in here! Make haste! Mr.
 Solness wants to speak to you.
 
 
   KAIA FOSLI appears at the door.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Looking at him in alarm.] Here I am--?
 
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Handing her the portfolio.] See her, Kaia! You can take this home; Mr.
 Solness was written on them now.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 Oh, at last!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Give them to the old man as soon as you can.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 I will go straight home with them.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, do. Now Ragnar will have a chance of building for himself.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 Oh, may he come and thank you for all--?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Harshly.] I won't have any thanks! Tell him that from me.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 Yes, I will--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 And tell him at the same time that henceforward I do not require his
 services--nor yours either.
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [Softly and quiveringly.] Not mine either?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 You will have other things to think of now, and to attend to; and that
 is a very good thing for you. Well, go home with the drawings now, Miss
 Fosli. At once! Do you hear?
 
 
 KAIA.
 
 [As before.] Yes, Mr. Solness. [She goes out.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Heavens! what deceitful eyes she has.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 She? That poor little creature?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh--I can see what I can see, Halvard.----Are you really dismissing
 them?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Her as well?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Was not that what you wished?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 But how can you get on without her--? Oh well, no doubt you have some
 one else in reserve, Halvard.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Playfully.] Well, _I_ for one am not the person to stand at a desk.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Never mind, never mind--it will be all right, Aline. Now all you have to
 do is think about moving into our new home--as quickly as you can. This
 evening we will hang up the wreath--[Turns to HILDA.] What do you say to
 that, Miss Hilda?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks at him with sparkling eyes.] It will be splendid to see you so
 high up once more.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Me!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 For Heaven's sake, Miss Wangel, don't imagine such a thing! My
 husband!--when he always gets so dizzy!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 He get dizzy! No, I know quite well he does not!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh yes, indeed he does.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 But I have seen him with my own eyes right up at the top of a high
 church-tower!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, I hear people talk of that; but it is utterly impossible--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Vehemently.] Impossible--impossible, yes! But there I stood all the
 same!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 O, how can you say so, Halvard? Why, you can't even bear to go out on
 the second-storey balcony here. You have always been like that.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 You may perhaps see something different this evening.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [In alarm.] No, no, no! Please God I shall never see that. I will write
 at once to the doctor--and I am sure he won't let you do it.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Why, Aline--!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, you know you're ill, Halvard. This proves it! Oh God--Oh God!
 
      [She goes hastily out to the right.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks intently at him.] Is it so, or is it not?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 That I turn dizzy?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 That my master builder dares not--cannot--climb as high as he builds?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Is that the way you look at it?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I believe there is scarcely a corner in me that is safe from you.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks towards the bow-window.] Up there, then. Right up there--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Approaches her.] You might have the topmost room in the tower,
 Hilda--there you might live like a princess.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Indefinably, between earnest and jest.] Yes, that is what you promised
 me.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Did I really?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Fie, Mr. Solness! You said I should be a princess, and that you would
 give me a kingdom. And then you went and--Well!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Cautiously.] Are you quite certain that this is not a dream--a fancy,
 that has fixed itself in your mind?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Sharply.] Do you mean that you did not do it?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I scarcely know myself. [More softly.] But now I know so much for
 certain, that I--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 That you--? Say it at once!
 
 
 SOLNESS. --that I ought to have done it.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Exclaims with animation.] Don't tell me you can ever be dizzy!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 This evening, then, we will hang up the wreath--Princess Hilda.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [With a bitter curve of the lips.] Over your new home, yes.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Over the new house, which will never be a home for me.
 
      [He goes out through the garden door.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks straight in front of her with a far-away expression, and whispers
 to herself. The only words audible are:]--frightfully thrilling--
 
 
 
 
 ACT THIRD.
 
   The large broad verandah of SOLNESS'S dwelling-house.  Part
   of the house, with outer door leading to the verandah, is
   seen to the left.  A railing along the verandah to the right.
   At the back, from the end of the verandah, a flight of steps
   leads down to the garden below.  Tall old trees in the
   garden spread their branches over the verandah and towards
   the house.  Far to the right, in among the trees, a glimpse
   is caught of the lower part of the new villa, with scaffolding
   round so much as is seen of the tower.  In the background
   the garden is bounded by an old wooden fence.  Outside the
   fence, a street with low, tumble-down cottages.
 
   Evening sky with sun-lit clouds.
 
   On the verandah, a garden bench stands along the wall of the
   house, and in front of the bench a long table.  On the other
   side of the table, an arm-chair and some stools.  All the
   furniture is of wicker-work.
 
   MRS. SOLNESS, wrapped in a large white crepe shawl, sits
   resting in the arm-chair and gazes over to the right.
   Shortly after, HILDA WANGEL comes up the flight of steps
   from the garden.  She is dressed as in the last act, and
   wears her hat.  She has in her bodice a little nosegay of
   small common flowers.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Turning her head a little.] Have you been round the garden, Miss
 Wangel?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, I have been taking a look at it.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 And found some flowers too, I see.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, indeed! There are such heaps of them in among the bushes.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Are there, really? Still? You see I scarcely ever go there.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Closer.] What! Don't you take a run down into the garden every day,
 then?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [With a faint smile.] I don't "run" anywhere, nowadays.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Well, but do you not go down now and then to look at all the lovely
 things there?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 It has all become so strange to me. I am almost afraid to see it again.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Your own garden!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 I don't feel that it is mine any longer.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 What do you mean--?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 No, no, it is not--not as it was in my mother's and father's time. They
 have taken away so much--so much of the garden, Miss Wangel. Fancy--they
 have parcelled it out--and built houses for strangers--people that I
 don't know. And they can sit and look in upon me from their windows.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [With a bright expression.] Mrs. Solness!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Yes?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 May I stay here with you a little?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, by all means, if you care to.
 
      [HILDA moves a stool close to the arm-chair and sits down.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Ah--here one can sit and sun oneself like a cat.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Lays her hand softly on HILDA'S neck.] It is nice of you to be willing
 to sit with me. I thought you wanted to go in to my husband.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 What should I want with him?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 To help him, I thought.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 No, thank you. And besides, he is not in. He is over there with his
 workmen. But he looked so fierce that I did not dare to talk to him.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 He is so kind and gentle in reality.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 He!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 You do not really know him yet, Miss Wangel.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks affectionately at her.] Are you pleased at the thought of moving
 over to the new house?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 I ought to be pleased; for it is what Halvard wants--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh, not just on that account, surely?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, yes, Miss Wangel; for it is only my duty to submit myself to
 him. But very often it is dreadfully difficult to force one's mind to
 obedience.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, that must be difficult indeed.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 I can tell you it is--when one has so many faults as I have--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 When one has gone through so much trouble as you have--
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 How do you know about that?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Your husband told me.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 To me he very seldom mentions these things.--Yes, I can tell you I have
 gone through more than enough trouble in my life, Miss Wangel.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks sympathetically at her and nods slowly.] Poor Mrs. Solness. First
 of all there was the fire--
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [With a sigh.] Yes, everything that was mine was burnt.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 And then came what was worse.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Looking inquiringly at her.] Worse?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 The worst of all.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 What do you mean?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Softly.] You lost the two little boys.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, yes, the boys. But, you see, that was a thing apart. That was a
 dispensation of Providence; and in such things one can only bow in
 submission--yes, and be thankful, too.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Then you are so?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Not always, I am sorry to say. I know well enough that it is my
 duty--but all the same I cannot.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 No, no, I think that is only natural.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 And often and often I have to remind myself that it was a righteous
 punishment for me--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Why?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Because I had not fortitude enough in misfortune.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 But I don't see that--
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, no, no, Miss Wangel--do not talk to me any more about the two little
 boys. We ought to feel nothing but joy in thinking of them; for they are
 so happy--so happy now. No, it is the small losses in life that cut
 one to the heart--the loss of all that other people look upon as almost
 nothing.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Lays her arms on MRS. SOLNESS'S knees, and looks up at her
 affectionately.] Dear Mrs. Solness--tell me what things you mean!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 As I say, only little things. All the old portraits were burnt on the
 walls. And all the old silk dresses were burnt, what had belonged to
 the family for generations and generations. And all mother's and
 grandmother's lace--that was burnt, too. And only think--the jewels,
 too! [Sadly.] And then all the dolls.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 The dolls?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Choking with tears.] I had nine lovely dolls.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 And they were burnt too?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 All of them. Oh, it was hard--so hard for me.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Had you put by all these dolls, then? Ever since you were little?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 I had not put them by. The dolls and I had gone on living together.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 After you were grown up?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, long after that.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 After you were married, too?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh yes, indeed. So long as he did not see it--. But they were all burnt
 up, poor things. No one thought of saving them. Oh, it is so miserable
 to think of. You mustn't laugh at me, Miss Wangel.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I am not laughing in the least.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 For you see, in a certain sense, there was life in them, too. I carried
 them under my heart--like little unborn children.
 
 
   DR. HERDAL, with his hat in his hand, comes out through the
   door, and observes MRS. SOLNESS. and HILDA.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Well, Mrs. Solness, so you are sitting out here catching cold?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 I find it so pleasant and warm here to-day.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Yes, yes. But is there anything going on here? I got a note from you.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Rises.] Yes, there is something I must talk to you about.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Very well; then perhaps we better go in. [To HILDA.] Still in your
 mountaineering dress, Miss Wangel?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Gaily, rising.] Yes--in full uniform! But to-day I am not going
 climbing and breaking my neck. We two will stop quietly below and look
 on, doctor.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 What are we to look on at?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Softly, in alarm, to HILDA.] Hush, hush--for God's sake! He is coming!
 Try to get that idea out of his head. And let us be friends, Miss
 Wangel. Don't you think we can?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Throws her arms impetuously round MRS. SOLNESS'S neck.] Oh, if we only
 could!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Gently disengages herself.] There, there, there! There he comes,
 doctor. Let me have a word with you.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Is it about him?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, to be sure it's about him. Do come in.
 
 
   She and the doctor enter the house.  Next moment SOLNESS
   comes up from the garden by the flight of steps.  A serious
   look comes over HILDA'S face.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Glances at the house-door, which is closed cautiously from within.]
 Have you noticed, Hilda, that as soon as I come, she goes?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I have noticed that as soon as you come, you make her go.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Perhaps so. But I cannot help it. [Looks observantly at her.] Are you
 cold, Hilda? I think you look cold.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I have just come up out of a tomb.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 What do you mean by that?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 That I have got chilled through and through, Mr. Solness.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Slowly.] I believe I understand--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 What brings you up here just now?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I caught sight of you from over there.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 But then you must have seen her too?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I knew she would go at once if I came.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Is it very painful for you that she should avoid you in this way?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 In one sense, it's a relief as well.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Not to have her before your eyes?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Not to be always seeing how heavily the loss of the little boys weighs
 upon her?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes. Chiefly that.
 
      [HILDA drifts across the verandah with her hands behind her
        back, stops at the railing and looks out over the garden.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [After a short pause.] Did you have a long talk with her?
 
      [HILDA stands motionless and does not answer.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Had you a long talk, I asked? [HILDA is silent as before.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 What was she talking about, Hilda? [HILDA continues silent.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Poor Aline! I suppose it was about the little boys.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 
 
      [A nervous shudder runs through her; then she nods hurriedly
        once or twice.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 She will never get over it--never in this world. [Approaches her.]
 Now you are standing there again like a statue; just as you stood last
 night.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Turns and looks at him, with great serious eyes.] I am going away.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Sharply.] Going away!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 But I won't allow you to!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 What am I to do here now?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Simply to be here, Hilda!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Measures him with a look.] Oh, thank you. You know it wouldn't end
 there.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Heedlessly.] So much the better!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Vehemently.] I cannot do any harm to one whom I know! I can't take away
 anything that belongs to her.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Who wants you to do that?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Continuing.] A stranger, yes! for that is quite a different thing! A
 person I have never set eyes on. But one that I have come into close
 contact with--! Oh no! Oh no! Ugh!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, but I never proposed you should.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh, Mr. Solness, you know quite well what the end of it would be. And
 that is why I am going away.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 And what is to become of me when you are gone? What shall I have to live
 for then?--After that?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [With the indefinable look in her eyes.] It is surely not so hard for
 you. You have your duties to her. Live for those duties.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Too late. These powers--these--these--
 
 
 HILDA. --devils--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, these devils! And the troll within me as well--they have drawn all
 the life-blood out of her. [Laughs in desperation.] They did it for my
 happiness! Yes, yes! [Sadly.] And now she is dead--for my sake. And I
 am chained alive to a dead woman. [In wild anguish.] _I_--_I_ who cannot
 live without joy in life!
 
      [HILDA moves round the table and seats herself on the bench,
        with her elbows on the table, and her head supported by her
        hands.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Sits and looks at him awhile.] What will you build next?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Shakes his head.] I don't believe I shall build much more.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Not those cosy, happy homes for mother and father, and for the troop of
 children?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I wonder whether there will be any use for such homes in the coming
 time.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Poor Mr. Solness! And you have gone all these ten years--and staked your
 whole life--on that alone.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, you may well say so, Hilda.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [With an outburst.] Oh, it all seems to me so foolish--so foolish!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 All what?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Not to be able to grasp at your own happiness--at your own life! Merely
 because some one you know happens to stand in the way!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 One whom you have no right to set aside.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I wonder whether one really has not the right! And yet, and yet--. Oh!
 if one could only sleep the whole thing away!
 
      [She lays her arms flat don on the table, rests the left side of
        her head on her hands, and shuts her eyes.
 
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Turns the arm-chair and sits down at the table.] Had you a cosy, happy
 home--up there with your father, Hilda?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Without stirring, answers as if half asleep.] I had only a cage.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 And you are determined not to go back to it?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [As before.] The wild bird never wants to go back to the cage.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Rather range through the free air--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Still as before.] The bird of prey loves to range--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Lets his eyes rest on her.] If only one had the viking-spirit in life--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [In her usual voice; opens her eyes but does not move.] And the other
 thing? Say what that was!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 A robust conscience.
 
      [HILDA sits erect on the bench, with animation.  Her eyes have
        once more the sparkling expression of gladness.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Nods to him.] _I_ know what you are going to build next!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Then you know more than I do, Hilda.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, builders are such stupid people.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 What is it to be then?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Nods again.] The castle.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 What castle?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 My castle, of course.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Do you want a castle now?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Don't you owe me a kingdom, I should like to know?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 You say I do.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Well--you admit you owe me this kingdom. And you can't have a kingdom
 without a royal castle, I should think.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [More and more animated.] Yes, they usually go together.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Good! Then build it for me! This moment!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Laughing.] Must you have that on the instant, too?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, to be sure! For the ten years are up now, and I am not going to
 wait any longer. So--out with the castle, Mr. Solness!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 It's no light matter to owe you anything, Hilda.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 You should have thought of that before. It is too late now. So--[tapping
 the table]--the castle on the table! It is my castle! I will have it at
 once!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [More seriously, leans over towards her, with his arms on the table.]
 What sort of castle have you imagined, Hilda?
 
      [Her expression becomes more and more veiled.  She seems gazing
        inwards at herself.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Slowly.] My castle shall stand on a height--on a very great
 height--with a clear outlook on all sides, so that I can see far--far
 around.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 And no doubt it is to have a high tower!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 A tremendously high tower. And at the very top of the tower there shall
 be a balcony. And I will stand out upon it--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Involuntarily clutches at his forehead.] How can you like to stand at
 such a dizzy height--?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, I will! Right up there will I stand and look down on the other
 people--on those that are building churches, and homes for mother and
 father and the troop of children. And you may come up and look on at it,
 too.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [In a low tone.] Is the builder to be allowed to come up beside the
 princess?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 If the builder will.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [More softly.] Then I think the builder will come.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Nods.] The builder--he will come.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 But he will never be able to build any more. Poor builder!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Animated.] Oh, yes, he will! We two will set to work together. And then
 we will build the loveliest--the very loveliest--thing in all the world.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Intently.] Hilda--tell me what that is!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks smilingly at him, shakes her head a little, pouts, and speaks as
 if to a child.] Builders--they are such very--very stupid people.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, no doubt they are stupid. But now tell me what it is--the loveliest
 thing in the world--that we two are to build together?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Is silent a little while, then says with an indefinable expression in
 her eyes.] Castles in the air.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Castles in the air?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Nods.] Castles in the air, yes! Do you know what sort of thing a castle
 in the air is?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 It is the loveliest thing in the world, you say.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Rises with vehemence, and makes a gesture of repulsion with her hand.]
 Yes, to be sure it is! Castles in the air--they are so easy to build,
 too--[looks scornfully at him]--especially for the builders who have
 a--a dizzy conscience.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Rises.] After this day we two will build together, Hilda.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [With a half-dubious smile.] A real castle in the air?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes. One with a firm foundation under it.
 
 
   RAGNAR BROVIK comes out from the house.  He is carrying a
   large green wreath with flowers and silk ribbons.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [With an outburst of pleasure.] The wreath! Oh, that will be glorious!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [In surprise.] Have you brought the wreath Ragnar?
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 I promised the foreman I would.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Relieved.] Ah, then I suppose you father is better?
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 No.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Was he not cheered by what I wrote?
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 It came too late.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Too late!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 When she came with it he was unconscious. He had had a stroke.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Why, then, you must go home to him! You must attend to your father!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 He does not need me any more.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 But surely you ought to be with him.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 She is sitting by his bed.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Rather uncertainly.] Kaia?
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [Looking darkly at him.] Yes--Kaia.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Go home, Ragnar--both to him and to her. Give me the wreath.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [Suppresses a mocking smile.] You don't mean that you yourself--?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I will take it down to them myself [Takes the wreath from him.] And now
 you go home; we don't require you to-day.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 I know you do not require me any more; but to-day I shall remain.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Well, remain then, since you are bent upon it.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [At the railing.] Mr. Solness, I will stand here and look on at you.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 At me!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 It will be fearfully thrilling.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [In a low tone.] We will talk about that presently, Hilda.
 
      [He goes down the flight of steps with the wreath, and away
        through the garden.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks after him, then turns to RAGNAR.] I think you might at least have
 thanked him
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Thanked him? Ought I to have thanked him?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, of course you ought!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 I think it is rather you I ought to thank.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 How can you say such a thing?
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [Without answering her.] But I advise you to take care, Miss Wangel! For
 you don't know him rightly yet.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Ardently.] Oh, no one knows him as I do!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [Laughs in exasperation.] Thank him, when he has held me down year
 after year! When he made father disbelieve in me--made me disbelieve in
 myself! And all merely that he might--!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [As if divining something.] That he might--? Tell me at once!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 That he might keep her with him.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [With a start towards him.] The girl at the desk.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Threateningly, clenching her hands.] That is not true! You are telling
 falsehoods about him!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 I would not believe it either until to-day--when she said so herself.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [As if beside herself.] What did she say? I will know! At once! at once!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 She said that he had taken possession of her mind--her whole
 mind--centred all her thoughts upon himself alone. She says that she can
 never leave him--that she will remain here, where he is--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [With flashing eyes.] She will not be allowed to!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [As if feeling his way.] Who will not allow her?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Rapidly.] He will not either!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Oh no--I understand the whole thing now. After this, she would merely
 be--in the way.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 You understand nothing--since you can talk like that! No, _I_ will tell
 you why he kept hold of her.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Well then, why?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 In order to keep hold of you.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Has he told you so?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 No, but it is so. It must be so! [Wildly.] I will--I will have it so!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 And at the very moment when you came--he let her go.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 It was you--you that he let go! What do you suppose he cares about
 strange women like her?
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [Reflects.] Is it possible that all this time he has been afraid of me?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 He afraid! I would not be so conceited if I were you.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Oh, he must have seen long ago that I had something in me, too.
 Besides--cowardly--that is just what he is, you see.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 He! Oh yes, I am likely to believe that!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 In a certain sense he is cowardly--he, the great master builder. He is
 not afraid of robbing others of their happiness--as he has done both
 for my father and me. But when it comes to climbing up a paltry bit of
 scaffolding--he will do anything rather than that.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh, you should just have seen him high, high up--at the dizzy height
 where I once saw him.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Did you see that?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, indeed I did. How free and great he looked as he stood and fastened
 the wreath to the church vane!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 I know that he ventured that, once in his life--one solitary time. It is
 a legend among us younger men. But no power on earth would induce him to
 do it again.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 To-day he will do it again!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [Scornfully.] Yes, I daresay!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 We shall see it!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 That neither you nor I will see.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [With uncontrollable vehemence.] I will se it! I will and I must see it!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 But he will not do it. He simply dare not do it. For you see he cannot
 get over this infirmity--master builder though he be.
 
 
   MRS. SOLNESS comes from the house on to the verandah.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks around.] Is he not here? Where has he gone to?
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Mr. Solness is down with the men.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 He took the wreath with him.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Terrified.] Took the wreath with him! Oh God! oh God! Brovik--you must
 go down to him! Get him to come back here!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Shall I say you want to speak to him, Mrs. Solness?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh yes, do!--No, no--don't say that _I_ want anything! You can say that
 somebody is here, and that he must come at once.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Good. I will do so, Mrs. Solness.
 
      [He goes down the flight of steps and away through the garden.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, Miss Wangel, you can't think how anxious I feel about him.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Is there anything in this to be terribly frightened about?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh yes; surely you can understand. Just think, if he were really to do
 it! If he should take it into his head to climb up the scaffolding!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Eagerly.] Do you think he will?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, one can never tell what he might take into his head. I am afraid
 there is nothing he mightn't think of doing.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Aha! Perhaps you too think he is--well--?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, I don't know what to think about him now. The doctor has been
 telling me all sorts of things; and putting it all together with several
 things I have heard him say--
 
 
   DR. HERDAL looks out, at the door.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Is he not coming soon?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, I think so. I have sent for him at any rate.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [Advancing.] I am afraid you will have to go in, my dear lady--
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh no! Oh no! I shall stay out here and wait for Halvard.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 But some ladies have just come to call on you--
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Good heavens, that too! And just at this moment!
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 They say they positively must see the ceremony.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Well, well, I suppose I must go to them after all. It is my duty.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Can't you ask the ladies to go away?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 No, that would never do. Now that they are here, it is my duty to see
 them. But do you stay out here in the meantime--and receive him when he
 comes.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 And try to occupy his attention as long as possible--
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, do, dear Miss Wangel. Keep as firm hold of him as ever you can.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Would it not be best for you to do that?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Yes; God knows that is my duty. But when one has duties in so many
 directions--
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [Looks towards the garden.] There he is coming.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 And I have to go in!
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [To HILDA.] Don't say anything about my being here.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh no! I daresay I shall find something else to talk to Mr. Solness
 about.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 And be sure you keep firm hold of him. I believe you can do it best.
 
      [MRS. SOLNESS and DR. HERDAL go into the house.  HILDA remains
        standing on the verandah.  SOLNESS comes from the garden, up
        the flight of steps.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Somebody wants me, I hear.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes; it is I, Mr. Solness.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, is it you, Hilda? I was afraid it might be Aline or the Doctor.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 You are very easily frightened, it seems!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Do you think so?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes; people say that you are afraid to climb about--on the scaffoldings,
 you know.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Well, that is quite a special thing.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Then it is true that you are afraid to do it?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, I am.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Afraid of falling down and killing yourself?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 No, not of that.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Of what, then?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I am afraid of retribution, Hilda.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Of retribution? [Shakes her head.] I don't understand that.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Sit down, and I will tell you something.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, do! At once!
 
      [She sits on a stool by the railing, and looks expectantly
        at him.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Throws his hat on the table.] You know that I began by building
 churches.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Nods.] I know that well.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 For, you see, I came as a boy from a pious home in the country; and so
 it seemed to me that this church-building was the noblest task I could
 set myself.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, yes.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 And I venture to say that I built those poor little churches with such
 honest and warm and heartfelt devotion that--that--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 That--? Well?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Well, that I think that he ought to have been pleased with me.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 He? What he?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 He who was to have the churches, of course! He to whose honour and glory
 they were dedicated.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh, indeed! But are you certain, then, that--that he was not--pleased
 with you?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Scornfully.] He pleased with me! How can you talk so, Hilda? He who
 gave the troll in me leave to lord it just as it pleased. He who bade
 them be at hand to serve me, both day and might--all these--all these--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Devils--
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, of both kinds. Oh no, he made me feel clearly enough that he was not
 pleased with me. [Mysteriously.] You see, that was really the reason why
 he made the old house burn down.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Was that why?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, don't you understand? He wanted to give me the chance of becoming
 an accomplished master in my own sphere--so that I might build all the
 more glorious churches for him. At first I did not understand what he
 was driving at; but all of a sudden it flashed upon me.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 When was that?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 It was when I was building the church-tower up at Lysanger.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I thought so.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 For you see, Hilda--up there, amidst those new surroundings, I used to
 go about musing and pondering within myself. Then I saw plainly why he
 had taken my little children from me. It was that I should have nothing
 else to attach myself to. No such thing as love and happiness, you
 understand. I was to be only a master builder--nothing else, and all my
 life long I was to go on building for him. [Laughs.] But I can tell you
 nothing came of that!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 What did you do then?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 First of all, I searched and tried my own heart--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 And then?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 The I did the impossible--I, no less than he.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 The impossible?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I had never before been able to climb up to a great, free height. But
 that day I did it.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Leaping up.] Yes, yes, you did!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 And when I stood there, high over everything, and was hanging the wreath
 over the vane, I said to him: Hear me now, thou Mighty One! From this
 day forward I will be a free builder--I too, in my sphere--just as thou
 in thine. I will never more build churches for thee--only homes for
 human beings.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [With great sparkling eyes.] That was the song that I heard through the
 air!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 But afterwards his turn came.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 What do you mean by that?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks despondently at her.] Building homes for human beings--is not
 worth a rap, Hilda.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Do you say that now?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, for now I see it. Men have no use for these homes of theirs--to be
 happy in. And I should not have had any use for such a home, if I had
 had one. [With a quiet, bitter laugh.] See, that is the upshot of
 the whole affair, however far back I look. Nothing really built; nor
 anything sacrificed for the chance of building. Nothing, nothing! the
 whole is nothing!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Then you will never build anything more?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [With animation.] On the contrary, I am just going to begin!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 What, then? What will you build? Tell me at once!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I believe there is only one possible dwelling-place for human
 happiness--and that is what I am going to build now.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Looks fixedly at him.] Mr. Solness--you mean our castles in the air.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 The castles in the air--yes.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 I am afraid you would turn dizzy before we got half-way up.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Not if I can mount hand in hand with you, Hilda.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [With an expression of suppressed resentment.] Only with me? Will there
 be no others of the party?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Who else should there be?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh--that girl--that Kaia at the desk. Poor thing--don't you want to take
 her with you too?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Oho! Was it about her that Aline was talking to you?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Is it so--or is it not?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Vehemently.] I will not answer such a question. You must believe in me,
 wholly and entirely!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 All these ten years I have believed in you so utterly--so utterly.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 You must go on believing in me!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Then let me see you stand free and high up!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Sadly.] Oh Hilda--it is not every day that I can do that.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Passionately.] I will have you do it! I will have it! [Imploringly.]
 Just once more, Mr. Solness! Do the impossible once again!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Stands and looks deep into her eyes.] If I try it, Hilda, I will stand
 up there and talk to him as I did that time before.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [In rising excitement.] What will you say to him?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 I will say to him: Hear me, Mighty Lord--thou may'st judge me as seems
 best to thee. But hereafter I will build nothing but the loveliest thing
 in the world--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Carried away.] Yes--yes--yes!
 
 
 SOLNESS. --build it together with a princess, whom I love--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, tell him that! Tell him that!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Yes. And then I will say to him: Now I shall go down and throw my arms
 round her and kiss her--
 
 
 HILDA. --many times! Say that!
 
 
 SOLNESS. --many, many times, I will say it!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 And then--?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 Then I will wave my hat--and come down to the earth--and do as I said to
 him.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [With outstretched arms.] Now I see you again as I did when there was
 song in the air!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Looks at here with his head bowed.] How have you become what you are,
 Hilda?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 How have you made me what I am?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Shortly and firmly.] The princess shall have her castle.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Jubilant, clapping her hands.] Oh, Mr. Solness--! My lovely, lovely
 castle. Our castle in the air!
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 On a firm foundation.
 
      [In the street a crowd of people has assembled, vaguely seen
        through the trees.  Music of wind-instruments is heard far
        away behind the new house.
 
 
   MRS. SOLNESS, with a fur collar round her neck, DOCTOR HERDAL
   with her white shawl on his arm, and some ladies, come out
   on the verandah.  RAGNAR BROVIK comes at the same time up
   from the garden.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [To RAGNAR.] Are we to have music, too?
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 Yes. It's the band of the Mason's Union. [To SOLNESS.] The foreman asked
 me to tell you that he is ready now to go up with the wreath.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Takes his hat.] Good. I will go down to him myself.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Anxiously.] What have you to do down there, Halvard?
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 [Curtly.] I must be down below with the men.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Yes, down below--only down below.
 
 
 SOLNESS.
 
 That is where I always stand--on everyday occasions.
 
      [He goes down the flight of steps and away through the garden.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Calls after him over the railing.] But do beg the man to be careful
 when he goes up! Promise me that, Halvard!
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [To MRS. SOLNESS.] Don't you see that I was right? He has given up all
 thought of that folly.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, what a relief! Twice workmen have fallen, and each time they were
 killed on the spot. [Turns to HILDA.] Thank you, Miss Wangel, for having
 kept such a firm hold upon him. I should never have been able to manage
 him.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [Playfully.] Yes, yes, Miss Wangel, you know how to keep firm hold on a
 man, when you give your mind to it.
 
      [MRS. SOLNESS and DR. HERDAL go up to the ladies, who are
        standing nearer to the steps and looking over the garden.
        HILDA remains standing beside the railing in the foreground.
        RAGNAR goes up to her.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [With suppressed laughter, half whispering.] Miss Wangel--do you see all
 those young fellows down in the street?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 They are my fellow students, come to look at the master.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 What do they want to look at him for?
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 They want to see how he daren't climb to the top of his own house.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Oh, that is what those boys want, is it?
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [Spitefully and scornfully.] He has kept us down so long--now we are
 going to see him keep quietly down below himself.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 You will not see that--not this time.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [Smiles.] Indeed! Then where shall we see him?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 High--high up by the vane! That is where you will see him!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [Laughs.] Him! Oh yes, I daresay!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 His will is to reach the top--so at the top you shall see him.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 His will, yes; that I can easily believe. But he simply cannot do it.
 His head would swim round, long, long before he got half-way. He would
 have to crawl down again on his hands and knees.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [Points across.] Look! There goes the foreman up the ladders.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 And of course he has the wreath to carry too. Oh, I do hope he will be
 careful!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [Stares incredulously and shouts.] Why, but it's--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Breaking out in jubilation.] It is the master builder himself?
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Screams with terror.] Yes, it is Halvard! Oh my great God--! Halvard!
 Halvard!
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Hush! Don't shout to him!
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 [Half beside herself.] I must go to him! I must get him to come down
 again!
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 [Holds her.] Don't move, any of you! Not a sound!
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Immovable, follows SOLNESS with her eyes.] He climbs and climbs. Higher
 and higher! Higher and higher! Look! Just look!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [Breathless.] He must turn now. He can't possibly help it.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 He climbs and climbs. He will soon be at the top now.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS.
 
 Oh, I shall die of terror. I cannot bear to see it.
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Then don't look up at him.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 There he is standing on the topmost planks! Right at the top!
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Nobody must move! Do you dear?
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Exulting, with quiet intensity.] At last! At last! Now I see him great
 and free again!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [Almost voiceless.] But this is im--
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 So I have seen him all through these ten years. How secure he stands!
 Frightfully thrilling all the same. Look at him! Now he is hanging the
 wreath round the vane!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 I feel as if I were looking at something utterly impossible.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, it is the impossible that he is doing now! [With the indefinable
 expression in her eyes.] Can you see any one else up there with him?
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 There is no one else.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Yes, there is one he is striving with.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 You are mistaken.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 Then do you hear no song in the air, either?
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 It must be the wind in the tree-tops.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 _I_ hear a song--a mighty song! [Shouts in wild jubilation and glee.]
 Look, look! Now he is waving his hat! He is waving it to us down here!
 Oh, wave, wave back to him! For now it is finished! [Snatches the white
 shawl from the Doctor, waves it, and shouts up to SOLNESS.] Hurrah for
 Master Builder Solness!
 
 
 DR. HERDAL.
 
 Stop! Stop! For God's sake--!
 
      [The ladies on the verandah wave their pocket-handkerchiefs, and
        the shouts of "Hurrah" are taken up in the street.  Then they
        are suddenly silenced, and the crowd bursts out into a shriek
        of horror.  A human body, with planks and fragments of wood,
        is vaguely perceived crashing down behind the trees.
 
 
 MRS. SOLNESS AND THE LADIES.
 
 [At the same time.] He is falling! He is falling!
 
      [MRS. SOLNESS totters, falls backwards, swooning, and is caught,
        amid cries and confusion, by the ladies.  The crowd in the
        street breaks down the fence and storms into the garden.  At
        the same time DR. HERDAL, too, rushes down thither.  A short
        pause.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Stares fixedly upwards and says, as if petrified.] My Master Builder.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [Supports himself, trembling, against the railing.] He must be dashed to
 pieces--killed on the spot.
 
 
 ONE OF THE LADIES.
 
 [Whilst MRS. SOLNESS is carried into the house.] Run down for the
 doctor--
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 I can't stir a root--
 
 
 ANOTHER LADY.
 
 Then call to some one!
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 [Tries to call out.] How is it? Is he alive?
 
 
 A VOICE.
 
 [Below, in the garden.] Mr. Solness is dead!
 
 
 OTHER VOICES.
 
 [Nearer.] The head is all crushed.--he fell right into the quarry.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [Turns to RAGNAR, and says quietly.] I can't see him up there now.
 
 
 RAGNAR.
 
 This is terrible. So, after all, he could not do it.
 
 
 HILDA.
 
 [As if in quiet spell-bound triumph.] But he mounted right to the top.
 And I heard harps in the air. [Waves her shawl in the air, and shrieks
 with wild intensity.] My--my Master Builder!

 HEDDA GABLER
 
 By Henrik Ibsen
 
 
 Translated by Edmund Gosse and William Archer
 
 
 Introduction by William Archer
 
 
 
 
 
 INTRODUCTION.
 
 
 From Munich, on June 29, 1890, Ibsen wrote to the Swedish poet, Count
 Carl Soilsky: "Our intention has all along been to spend the summer in
 the Tyrol again. But circumstances are against our doing so. I am at
 present engaged upon a new dramatic work, which for several reasons has
 made very slow progress, and I do not leave Munich until I can take with
 me the completed first draft. There is little or no prospect of my being
 able to complete it in July." Ibsen did not leave Munich at all that
 season. On October 30 he wrote: "At present I am utterly engrossed in
 a new play. Not one leisure hour have I had for several months." Three
 weeks later (November 20) he wrote to his French translator, Count
 Prozor: "My new play is finished; the manuscript went off to Copenhagen
 the day before yesterday.... It produces a curious feeling of emptiness
 to be thus suddenly separated from a work which has occupied one's time
 and thoughts for several months, to the exclusion of all else. But it is
 a good thing, too, to have done with it. The constant intercourse with
 the fictitious personages was beginning to make me quite nervous." To
 the same correspondent he wrote on December 4: "The title of the play is
 _Hedda Gabler_. My intention in giving it this name was to indicate
 that Hedda, as a personality, is to be regarded rather as her father's
 daughter than as her husband's wife. It was not my desire to deal in
 this play with so-called problems. What I principally wanted to do was
 to depict human beings, human emotions, and human destinies, upon a
 groundwork of certain of the social conditions and principles of the
 present day."
 
 So far we read the history of the play in the official
 "Correspondence."(1) Some interesting glimpses into the poet's moods
 during the period between the completion of _The Lady from the Sea_
 and the publication of _Hedda Gabler_ are to be found in the series of
 letters to Fraulein Emilie Bardach, of Vienna, published by Dr. George
 Brandes.(2) This young lady Ibsen met at Gossensass in the Tyrol in
 the autumn of 1889. The record of their brief friendship belongs to the
 history of _The Master Builder_ rather than to that of _Hedda Gabler_,
 but the allusions to his work in his letters to her during the winter of
 1889 demand some examination.
 
 So early as October 7, 1889, he writes to her: "A new poem begins to
 dawn in me. I will execute it this winter, and try to transfer to it
 the bright atmosphere of the summer. But I feel that it will end in
 sadness--such is my nature." Was this "dawning" poem _Hedda Gabler_? Or
 was it rather _The Master Builder_ that was germinating in his mind? Who
 shall say? The latter hypothesis seems the more probable, for it is hard
 to believe that at any stage in the incubation of _Hedda Gabler_ he can
 have conceived it as even beginning in gaiety. A week later, however,
 he appears to have made up his mind that the time had not come for the
 poetic utilisation of his recent experiences. He writes on October 15:
 "Here I sit as usual at my writing-table. Now I would fain work, but
 am unable to. My fancy, indeed, is very active. But it always wanders
 away ours. I cannot repress my summer memories--nor do I wish to. I live
 through my experience again and again and yet again. To transmute it
 all into a poem, I find, in the meantime, impossible." Clearly, then,
 he felt that his imagination ought to have been engaged on some theme
 having no relation to his summer experiences--the theme, no doubt, of
 _Hedda Gabler_. In his next letter, dated October 29, he writes: "Do not
 be troubled because I cannot, in the meantime, create (_dichten_). In
 reality I am for ever creating, or, at any rate, dreaming of something
 which, when in the fulness of time it ripens, will reveal itself as
 a creation (_Dichtung_)." On November 19 he says: "I am very busily
 occupied with preparations for my new poem. I sit almost the whole day
 at my writing-table. Go out only in the evening for a little while." The
 five following letters contain no allusion to the play; but on September
 18, 1890, he wrote: "My wife and son are at present at Riva, on the Lake
 of Garda, and will probably remain there until the middle of October,
 or even longer. Thus I am quite alone here, and cannot get away. The new
 play on which I am at present engaged will probably not be ready until
 November, though I sit at my writing-table daily, and almost the whole
 day long."
 
 Here ends the history of _Hedda Gabler_, so far as the poet's
 letters carry us. Its hard clear outlines, and perhaps somewhat bleak
 atmosphere, seem to have resulted from a sort of reaction against the
 sentimental "dreamery" begotten of his Gossensass experiences. He
 sought refuge in the chill materialism of Hedda from the ardent
 transcendentalism of Hilda, whom he already heard knocking at the door.
 He was not yet in the mood to deal with her on the plane of poetry.(3)
 
 _Hedda Gabler_ was published in Copenhagen on December 16, 1890. This
 was the first of Ibsen's plays to be translated from proof-sheets and
 published in England and America almost simultaneously with its first
 appearance in Scandinavia. The earliest theatrical performance took
 place at the Residenz Theater, Munich, on the last day of January 1891,
 in the presence of the poet, Frau Conrad-Ramlo playing the title-part.
 The Lessing Theater, Berlin, followed suit on February 10. Not till
 February 25 was the play seen in Copenhagen, with Fru Hennings as Hedda.
 On the following night it was given for the first time in Christiania,
 the Norwegian Hedda being Froken Constance Bruun. It was this production
 which the poet saw when he visited the Christiania Theater for the first
 time after his return to Norway, August 28, 1891. It would take pages
 to give even the baldest list of the productions and revivals of _Hedda
 Gabler_ in Scandinavia and Germany, where it has always ranked among
 Ibsen's most popular works. The admirable production of the play by Miss
 Elizabeth Robins and Miss Marion Lea, at the Vaudeville Theatre,
 London, April 20, 1891, may rank as the second great step towards
 the popularisation of Ibsen in England, the first being the
 Charrington-Achurch production of _A Doll's House_ in 1889. Miss Robins
 afterwards repeated her fine performance of Hedda many times, in London,
 in the English provinces, and in New York. The character has also been
 acted in London by Eleonora Duse, and as I write (March, 5, 1907) by
 Mrs. Patrick Campbell, at the Court Theatre. In Australia and America,
 Hedda has frequently been acted by Miss Nance O'Neill and other
 actresses--quite recently by a Russian actress, Madame Alla Nazimova,
 who (playing in English) seems to have made a notable success both in
 this part and in Nora. The first French Hedda Gabler was Mlle. Marthe
 Brandes, who played the part at the Vaudeville Theatre, Paris, on
 December 17, 1891, the performance being introduced by a lecture by M.
 Jules Lemaitre. In Holland, in Italy, in Russia, the play has been acted
 times without number. In short (as might easily have been foretold) it
 has rivalled _A Doll's House_ in world-wide popularity.
 
 It has been suggested,(4) I think without sufficient ground, that Ibsen
 deliberately conceived _Hedda Gabler_ as an "international" play, and
 that the scene is really the "west end" of any European city. To me
 it seems quite clear that Ibsen had Christiania in mind, and the
 Christiania of a somewhat earlier period than the 'nineties. The
 electric cars, telephones, and other conspicuous factors in the life of
 a modern capital are notably absent from the play. There is no electric
 light in Secretary Falk's villa. It is still the habit for ladies to
 return on foot from evening parties, with gallant swains escorting them.
 This "suburbanism," which so distressed the London critics of 1891,
 was characteristic of the Christiania Ibsen himself had known in the
 'sixties--the Christiania of _Love's Comedy_--rather than of the
 greatly extended and modernised city of the end of the century. Moreover
 Lovborg's allusions to the fiord, and the suggested picture of Sheriff
 Elvsted, his family and his avocations are all distinctively Norwegian.
 The truth seems to be very simple--the environment and the subsidiary
 personages are all thoroughly national, but Hedda herself is an
 "international" type, a product of civilisation by no means peculiar to
 Norway.
 
 We cannot point to any individual model or models who "sat to" Ibsen for
 the character of Hedda.(5) The late Grant Allen declared that Hedda was
 "nothing more nor less than the girl we take down to dinner in London
 nineteen times out of twenty"; in which case Ibsen must have suffered
 from a superfluidity of models, rather than from any difficulty in
 finding one. But the fact is that in this, as in all other instances,
 the word "model" must be taken in a very different sense from that in
 which it is commonly used in painting. Ibsen undoubtedly used models for
 this trait and that, but never for a whole figure. If his characters can
 be called portraits at all, they are composite portraits. Even when it
 seems pretty clear that the initial impulse towards the creation of a
 particular character came from some individual, the original figure is
 entirely transmuted in the process of harmonisation with the dramatic
 scheme. We need not, therefore, look for a definite prototype of Hedda;
 but Dr. Brandes shows that two of that lady's exploits were probably
 suggested by the anecdotic history of the day.
 
 Ibsen had no doubt heard how the wife of a well-known Norwegian
 composer, in a fit of raging jealousy excited by her husband's prolonged
 absence from home, burnt the manuscript of a symphony which he had just
 finished. The circumstances under which Hedda burns Lovborg's manuscript
 are, of course, entirely different and infinitely more dramatic;
 but here we have merely another instance of the dramatisation or
 "poetisation" of the raw material of life. Again, a still more painful
 incident probably came to his knowledge about the same time. A beautiful
 and very intellectual woman was married to a well-known man who had been
 addicted to drink, but had entirely conquered the vice. One day a mad
 whim seized her to put his self-mastery and her power over him to the
 test. As it happened to be his birthday, she rolled into his study a
 small keg of brandy, and then withdrew. She returned some time after
 wards to find that he had broached the keg, and lay insensible on the
 floor. In this anecdote we cannot but recognise the germ, not only of
 Hedda's temptation of Lovborg, but of a large part of her character.
 
 "Thus," says Dr. Brandes, "out of small and scattered traits of reality
 Ibsen fashioned his close-knit and profoundly thought-out works of art."
 
 For the character of Eilert Lovborg, again, Ibsen seem unquestionably
 to have borrowed several traits from a definite original. A young Danish
 man of letters, whom Dr. Brandes calls Holm, was an enthusiastic admirer
 of Ibsen, and came to be on very friendly terms with him. One day Ibsen
 was astonished to receive, in Munich, a parcel addressed from Berlin by
 this young man, containing, without a word of explanation, a packet of
 his (Ibsen's) letters, and a photograph which he had presented to Holm.
 Ibsen brooded and brooded over the incident, and at last came to the
 conclusion that the young man had intended to return her letters and
 photograph to a young lady to whom he was known to be attached, and had
 in a fit of aberration mixed up the two objects of his worship. Some
 time after, Holm appeared at Ibsen's rooms. He talked quite rationally,
 but professed to have no knowledge whatever of the letter-incident,
 though he admitted the truth of Ibsen's conjecture that the "belle dame
 sans merci" had demanded the return of her letters and portrait. Ibsen
 was determined to get at the root of the mystery; and a little inquiry
 into his young friend's habits revealed the fact that he broke his fast
 on a bottle of port wine, consumed a bottle of Rhine wine at lunch, of
 Burgundy at dinner, and finished off the evening with one or two more
 bottles of port. Then he heard, too, how, in the course of a night's
 carouse, Holm had lost the manuscript of a book; and in these traits he
 saw the outline of the figure of Eilert Lovborg.
 
 Some time elapsed, and again Ibsen received a postal packet from Holm.
 This one contained his will, in which Ibsen figured as his residuary
 legatee. But many other legatees were mentioned in the instrument--all
 of them ladies, such as Fraulein Alma Rothbart, of Bremen, and Fraulein
 Elise Kraushaar, of Berlin. The bequests to these meritorious spinsters
 were so generous that their sum considerably exceeded the amount of
 the testator's property. Ibsen gently but firmly declined the proffered
 inheritance; but Holm's will no doubt suggested to him the figure of
 that red-haired "Mademoiselle Diana," who is heard of but not seen
 in _Hedda Gabler_, and enabled him to add some further traits to the
 portraiture of Lovborg. When the play appeared, Holm recognised
 himself with glee in the character of the bibulous man of letters,
 and thereafter adopted "Eilert Lovborg" as his pseudonym. I do not,
 therefore, see why Dr. Brandes should suppress his real name; but I
 willingly imitate him in erring on the side of discretion. The poor
 fellow died several years ago.
 
 Some critics have been greatly troubled as to the precise meaning of
 Hedda's fantastic vision of Lovborg "with vine-leaves in his hair."
 Surely this is a very obvious image or symbol of the beautiful, the
 ideal, aspect of bacchic elation and revelry. Antique art, or I am much
 mistaken, shows us many figures of Dionysus himself and his followers
 with vine-leaves entwined their hair. To Ibsen's mind, at any rate, the
 image had long been familiar. In _Peer Gynt_ (Act iv. sc. 8), when Peer,
 having carried off Anitra, finds himself in a particularly festive mood,
 he cries: "Were there vine-leaves around, I would garland my brow."
 Again, in _Emperor and Galilean_ (Pt. ii. Act 1) where Julian, in the
 procession of Dionysus, impersonates the god himself, it is directed
 that he shall wear a wreath of vine-leaves. Professor Dietrichson
 relates that among the young artists whose society Ibsen frequented
 during his first years in Rome, it was customary, at their little
 festivals, for the revellers to deck themselves in this fashion. But the
 image is so obvious that there is no need to trace it to any personal
 experience. The attempt to place Hedda's vine-leaves among Ibsen's
 obscurities is an example of the firm resolution not to understand which
 animated the criticism of the 'nineties.
 
 Dr. Brandes has dealt very severely with the character of Eilert
 Lovborg, alleging that we cannot believe in the genius attributed to
 him. But where is he described as a genius? The poet represents him as a
 very able student of sociology; but that is quite a different thing from
 attributing to him such genius as must necessarily shine forth in every
 word he utters. Dr. Brandes, indeed, declines to believe even in his
 ability as a sociologist, on the ground that it is idle to write about
 the social development of the future. "To our prosaic minds," he says,
 "it may seem as if the most sensible utterance on the subject is that of
 the fool of the play: 'The future! Good heavens, we know nothing of the
 future.'" The best retort to this criticism is that which Eilert himself
 makes: "There's a thing or two to be said about it all the same." The
 intelligent forecasting of the future (as Mr. H. G. Wells has shown)
 is not only clearly distinguishable from fantastic Utopianism, but is
 indispensable to any large statesmanship or enlightened social activity.
 With very real and very great respect for Dr. Brandes, I cannot think
 that he has been fortunate in his treatment of Lovborg's character.
 It has been represented as an absurdity that he would think of reading
 abstracts from his new book to a man like Tesman, whom he despises. But
 though Tesman is a ninny, he is, as Hedda says, a "specialist"--he is a
 competent, plodding student of his subject. Lovborg may quite naturally
 wish to see how his new method, or his excursion into a new field,
 strikes the average scholar of the Tesman type. He is, in fact, "trying
 it on the dog"--neither an unreasonable nor an unusual proceeding. There
 is, no doubt, a certain improbability in the way in which Lovborg is
 represented as carrying his manuscript around, and especially in Mrs.
 Elvsted's production of his rough draft from her pocket; but these are
 mechanical trifles, on which only a niggling criticism would dream of
 laying stress.
 
 Of all Ibsen's works, _Hedda Gabler_ is the most detached, the most
 objective--a character-study pure and simple. It is impossible--or so
 it seems to me--to extract any sort of general idea from it. One cannot
 even call it a satire, unless one is prepared to apply that term to the
 record of a "case" in a work of criminology. Reverting to Dumas's dictum
 that a play should contain "a painting, a judgment, an ideal," we may
 say the _Hedda Gabler_ fulfils only the first of these requirements. The
 poet does not even pass judgment on his heroine: he simply paints her
 full-length portrait with scientific impassivity. But what a portrait!
 How searching in insight, how brilliant in colouring, how rich in
 detail! Grant Allen's remark, above quoted, was, of course, a whimsical
 exaggeration; the Hedda type is not so common as all that, else the
 world would quickly come to an end. But particular traits and tendencies
 of the Hedda type are very common in modern life, and not only among
 women. Hyperaesthesia lies at the root of her tragedy. With a keenly
 critical, relentlessly solvent intelligence, she combines a morbid
 shrinking from all the gross and prosaic detail of the sensual life.
 She has nothing to take her out of herself--not a single intellectual
 interest or moral enthusiasm. She cherishes, in a languid way, a petty
 social ambition; and even that she finds obstructed and baffled. At the
 same time she learns that another woman has had the courage to love and
 venture all, where she, in her cowardice, only hankered and refrained.
 Her malign egoism rises up uncontrolled, and calls to its aid her quick
 and subtle intellect. She ruins the other woman's happiness, but in
 doing so incurs a danger from which her sense of personal dignity
 revolts. Life has no such charm for her that she cares to purchase it at
 the cost of squalid humiliation and self-contempt. The good and the bad
 in her alike impel her to have done with it all; and a pistol-shot
 ends what is surely one of the most poignant character-tragedies in
 literature. Ibsen's brain never worked at higher pressure than in the
 conception and adjustment of those "crowded hours" in which Hedda,
 tangled in the web of Will and Circumstance, struggles on till she is
 too weary to struggle any more.
 
 It may not be superfluous to note that the "a" in "Gabler" should be
 sounded long and full, like the "a" in "Garden"--NOT like the "a" in
 "gable" or in "gabble."

 ACT FIRST.
 
 
   A spacious, handsome, and tastefully furnished drawing room,
   decorated in dark colours.  In the back, a wide doorway with
   curtains drawn back, leading into a smaller room decorated
   in the same style as the drawing-room.  In the right-hand
   wall of the front room, a folding door leading out to the
   hall.  In the opposite wall, on the left, a glass door, also
   with curtains drawn back.  Through the panes can be seen
   part of a verandah outside, and trees covered with autumn
   foliage.  An oval table, with a cover on it, and surrounded
   by chairs, stands well forward.  In front, by the wall on
   the right, a wide stove of dark porcelain, a high-backed
   arm-chair, a cushioned foot-rest, and two footstools.  A
   settee, with a small round table in front of it, fills the
   upper right-hand corner.  In front, on the left, a little
   way from the wall, a sofa.  Further back than the glass
   door, a piano.  On either side of the doorway at the back
   a whatnot with terra-cotta and majolica ornaments.--
   Against the back wall of the inner room a sofa, with a
   table, and one or two chairs.  Over the sofa hangs the
   portrait of a handsome elderly man in a General's uniform.
   Over the table a hanging lamp, with an opal glass shade.--A
   number of bouquets are arranged about the drawing-room, in
   vases and glasses.  Others lie upon the tables.  The floors
   in both rooms are covered with thick carpets.--Morning light.
   The sun shines in through the glass door.
 
   MISS JULIANA TESMAN, with her bonnet on a carrying a parasol,
   comes in from the hall, followed by BERTA, who carries a
   bouquet wrapped in paper.  MISS TESMAN is a comely and pleasant-
   looking lady of about sixty-five.  She is nicely but simply
   dressed in a grey walking-costume.  BERTA is a middle-aged
   woman of plain and rather countrified appearance.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 [Stops close to the door, listens, and says softly:] Upon my word, I
 don't believe they are stirring yet!
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 [Also softly.] I told you so, Miss. Remember how late the steamboat got
 in last night. And then, when they got home!--good Lord, what a lot the
 young mistress had to unpack before she could get to bed.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Well well--let them have their sleep out. But let us see that they get a
 good breath of the fresh morning air when they do appear.
 
      [She goes to the glass door and throws it open.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 [Beside the table, at a loss what to do with the bouquet in her hand.]
 I declare there isn't a bit of room left. I think I'll put it down here,
 Miss. [She places it on the piano.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 So you've got a new mistress now, my dear Berta. Heaven knows it was a
 wrench to me to part with you.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 [On the point of weeping.] And do you think it wasn't hard for me, too,
 Miss? After all the blessed years I've been with you and Miss Rina.(1)
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 We must make the best of it, Berta. There was nothing else to be done.
 George can't do without you, you see-he absolutely can't. He has had you
 to look after him ever since he was a little boy.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 Ah but, Miss Julia, I can't help thinking of Miss Rina lying helpless
 at home there, poor thing. And with only that new girl too! She'll never
 learn to take proper care of an invalid.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Oh, I shall manage to train her. And of course, you know, I shall take
 most of it upon myself. You needn't be uneasy about my poor sister, my
 dear Berta.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 Well, but there's another thing, Miss. I'm so mortally afraid I shan't
 be able to suit the young mistress.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Oh well--just at first there may be one or two things--
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 Most like she'll be terrible grand in her ways.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Well, you can't wonder at that--General Gabler's daughter! Think of
 the sort of life she was accustomed to in her father's time. Don't you
 remember how we used to see her riding down the road along with the
 General? In that long black habit--and with feathers in her hat?
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 Yes, indeed--I remember well enough!--But, good Lord, I should never
 have dreamt in those days that she and Master George would make a match
 of it.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Nor I.--But by-the-bye, Berta--while I think of it: in future you
 mustn't say Master George. You must say Dr. Tesman.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 Yes, the young mistress spoke of that too--last night--the moment they
 set foot in the house. Is it true then, Miss?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Yes, indeed it is. Only think, Berta--some foreign university has made
 him a doctor--while he has been abroad, you understand. I hadn't heard a
 word about it, until he told me himself upon the pier.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 Well well, he's clever enough for anything, he is. But I didn't think
 he'd have gone in for doctoring people.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 No no, it's not that sort of doctor he is. [Nods significantly.] But
 let me tell you, we may have to call him something still grander before
 long.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 You don't say so! What can that be, Miss?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 [Smiling.] H'm--wouldn't you like to know! [With emotion.] Ah, dear
 dear--if my poor brother could only look up from his grave now, and
 see what his little boy has grown into! [Looks around.] But bless me,
 Berta--why have you done this? Taken the chintz covers off all the
 furniture.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 The mistress told me to. She can't abide covers on the chairs, she says.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Are they going to make this their everyday sitting-room then?
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 Yes, that's what I understood--from the mistress. Master George--the
 doctor--he said nothing.
 
 
   GEORGE TESMAN comes from the right into the inner room,
   humming to himself, and carrying an unstrapped empty
   portmanteau.  He is a middle-sized, young-looking man of
   thirty-three, rather stout, with a round, open, cheerful
   face, fair hair and beard.  He wears spectacles, and is
   somewhat carelessly dressed in comfortable indoor clothes.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Good morning, good morning, George.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [In the doorway between the rooms.] Aunt Julia! Dear Aunt Julia! [Goes
 up to her and shakes hands warmly.] Come all this way--so early! Eh?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Why, of course I had to come and see how you were getting on.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 In spite of your having had no proper night's rest?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Oh, that makes no difference to me.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well, I suppose you got home all right from the pier? Eh?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Yes, quite safely, thank goodness. Judge Brack was good enough to see me
 right to my door.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 We were so sorry we couldn't give you a seat in the carriage. But you
 saw what a pile of boxes Hedda had to bring with her.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Yes, she had certainly plenty of boxes.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 [To TESMAN.] Shall I go in and see if there's anything I can do for the
 mistress?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No thank you, Berta--you needn't. She said she would ring if she wanted
 anything.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 [Going towards the right.] Very well.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 But look here--take this portmanteau with you.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 [Taking it.] I'll put it in the attic.
 
      [She goes out by the hall door.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Fancy, Auntie--I had the whole of that portmanteau chock full of copies
 of the documents. You wouldn't believe how much I have picked up from
 all the archives I have been examining--curious old details that no one
 has had any idea of--
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Yes, you don't seem to have wasted your time on your wedding trip,
 George.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No, that I haven't. But do take off your bonnet, Auntie. Look here! Let
 me untie the strings--eh?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 [While he does so.] Well well--this is just as if you were still at home
 with us.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [With the bonnet in his hand, looks at it from all sides.] Why, what a
 gorgeous bonnet you've been investing in!
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 I bought it on Hedda's account.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 On Hedda's account? Eh?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Yes, so that Hedda needn't be ashamed of me if we happened to go out
 together.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Patting her cheek.] You always think of everything, Aunt Julia. [Lays
 the bonnet on a chair beside the table.] And now, look here--suppose we
 sit comfortably on the sofa and have a little chat, till Hedda comes.
 
      [They seat themselves.  She places her parasol in the corner
        of the sofa.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 [Takes both his hands and looks at him.] What a delight it is to have
 you again, as large as life, before my very eyes, George! My George--my
 poor brother's own boy!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 And it's a delight for me, too, to see you again, Aunt Julia! You, who
 have been father and mother in one to me.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Oh yes, I know you will always keep a place in your heart for your old
 aunts.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 And what about Aunt Rina? No improvement--eh?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Oh, no--we can scarcely look for any improvement in her case, poor
 thing. There she lies, helpless, as she has lain for all these years.
 But heaven grant I may not lose her yet awhile! For if I did, I don't
 know what I should make of my life, George--especially now that I
 haven't you to look after any more.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Patting her back.] There there there--!
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 [Suddenly changing her tone.] And to think that here are you a married
 man, George!--And that you should be the one to carry off Hedda Gabler
 --the beautiful Hedda Gabler! Only think of it--she, that was so beset
 with admirers!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Hums a little and smiles complacently.] Yes, I fancy I have several
 good friends about town who would like to stand in my shoes--eh?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 And then this fine long wedding-tour you have had! More than five--
 nearly six months--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well, for me it has been a sort of tour of research as well. I have had
 to do so much grubbing among old records--and to read no end of books
 too, Auntie.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Oh yes, I suppose so. [More confidentially, and lowering her voice a
 little.] But listen now, George,--have you nothing--nothing special to
 tell me?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 As to our journey?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No, I don't know of anything except what I have told you in my letters.
 I had a doctor's degree conferred on me--but that I told you yesterday.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Yes, yes, you did. But what I mean is--haven't you any--any--
 expectations--?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Expectations?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Why you know, George--I'm your old auntie!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Why, of course I have expectations.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Ah!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 I have every expectation of being a professor one of these days.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Oh yes, a professor--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Indeed, I may say I am certain of it. But my dear Auntie--you know all
 about that already!
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 [Laughing to herself.] Yes, of course I do. You are quite right there.
 [Changing the subject.] But we were talking about your journey. It must
 have cost a great deal of money, George?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well, you see--my handsome travelling-scholarship went a good way.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 But I can't understand how you can have made it go far enough for two.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No, that's not easy to understand--eh?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 And especially travelling with a lady--they tell me that makes it ever
 so much more expensive.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, of course--it makes it a little more expensive. But Hedda had to
 have this trip, Auntie! She really had to. Nothing else would have done.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 No no, I suppose not. A wedding-tour seems to be quite indispensable
 nowadays.--But tell me now--have you gone thoroughly over the house yet?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, you may be sure I have. I have been afoot ever since daylight.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 And what do you think of it all?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 I'm delighted! Quite delighted! Only I can't think what we are to do
 with the two empty rooms between this inner parlour and Hedda's bedroom.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 [Laughing.] Oh my dear George, I daresay you may find some use for
 them--in the course of time.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Why of course you are quite right, Aunt Julia! You mean as my library
 increases--eh?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Yes, quite so, my dear boy. It was your library I was thinking of.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 I am specially pleased on Hedda's account. Often and often, before we
 were engaged, she said that she would never care to live anywhere but in
 Secretary Falk's villa.(2)
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Yes, it was lucky that this very house should come into the market, just
 after you had started.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, Aunt Julia, the luck was on our side, wasn't it--eh?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 But the expense, my dear George! You will find it very expensive, all
 this.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Looks at her, a little cast down.] Yes, I suppose I shall, Aunt!
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Oh, frightfully!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 How much do you think? In round numbers?--Eh?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Oh, I can't even guess until all the accounts come in.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well, fortunately, Judge Brack has secured the most favourable terms for
 me, so he said in a letter to Hedda.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Yes, don't be uneasy, my dear boy.--Besides, I have given security for
 the furniture and all the carpets.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Security? You? My dear Aunt Julia--what sort of security could you give?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 I have given a mortgage on our annuity.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Jumps up.] What! On your--and Aunt Rina's annuity!
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Yes, I knew of no other plan, you see.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Placing himself before her.] Have you gone out of your senses, Auntie?
 Your annuity--it's all that you and Aunt Rina have to live upon.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Well well--don't get so excited about it. It's only a matter of form you
 know--Judge Brack assured me of that. It was he that was kind enough to
 arrange the whole affair for me. A mere matter of form, he said.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, that may be all very well. But nevertheless--
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 You will have your own salary to depend upon now. And, good heavens,
 even if we did have to pay up a little--! To eke things out a bit at
 the start--! Why, it would be nothing but a pleasure to us.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh Auntie--will you never be tired of making sacrifices for me!
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 [Rises and lays her hand on his shoulders.] Have I any other happiness
 in this world except to smooth your way for you, my dear boy. You, who
 have had neither father nor mother to depend on. And now we have reached
 the goal, George! Things have looked black enough for us, sometimes;
 but, thank heaven, now you have nothing to fear.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, it is really marvellous how every thing has turned out for the
 best.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 And the people who opposed you--who wanted to bar the way for you--
 now you have them at your feet. They have fallen, George. Your most
 dangerous rival--his fall was the worst.--And now he has to lie on the
 bed he has made for himself--poor misguided creature.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Have you heard anything of Eilert? Since I went away, I mean.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Only that he is said to have published a new book.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 What! Eilert Lovborg! Recently--eh?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Yes, so they say. Heaven knows whether it can be worth anything! Ah,
 when your new book appears--that will be another story, George! What is
 it to be about?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 It will deal with the domestic industries of Brabant during the Middle
 Ages.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Fancy--to be able to write on such a subject as that!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 However, it may be some time before the book is ready. I have all these
 collections to arrange first, you see.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Yes, collecting and arranging--no one can beat you at that. There you
 are my poor brother's own son.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 I am looking forward eagerly to setting to work at it; especially now
 that I have my own delightful home to work in.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 And, most of all, now that you have got the wife of your heart, my dear
 George.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Embracing her.] Oh yes, yes, Aunt Julia! Hedda--she is the best part of
 it all! I believe I hear her coming--eh?
 
 
   HEDDA enters from the left through the inner room.  Her face
   and figure show refinement and distinction.  Her complexion
   is pale and opaque.  Her steel-grey eyes express a cold,
   unruffled repose.  Her hair is of an agreeable brown, but
   not particularly abundant.  She is dressed in a tasteful,
   somewhat loose-fitting morning gown.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 [Going to meet HEDDA.] Good morning, my dear Hedda! Good morning, and a
 hearty welcome!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Holds out her hand.] Good morning, dear Miss Tesman! So early a call!
 That is kind of you.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 [With some embarrassment.] Well--has the bride slept well in her new
 home?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh yes, thanks. Passably.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Laughing.] Passably! Come, that's good, Hedda! You were sleeping like a
 stone when I got up.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Fortunately. Of course one has always to accustom one's self to new
 surroundings, Miss Tesman--little by little. [Looking towards the left.]
 Oh, there the servant has gone and opened the veranda door, and let in a
 whole flood of sunshine.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 [Going towards the door.] Well, then we will shut it.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No no, not that! Tesman, please draw the curtains. That will give a
 softer light.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [At the door.] All right--all right.--There now, Hedda, now you have
 both shade and fresh air.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, fresh air we certainly must have, with all these stacks of
 flowers--. But--won't you sit down, Miss Tesman?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 No, thank you. Now that I have seen that everything is all right
 here--thank heaven!--I must be getting home again. My sister is lying
 longing for me, poor thing.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Give her my very best love, Auntie; and say I shall look in and see her
 later in the day.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Yes, yes, I'll be sure to tell her. But by-the-bye, George--[Feeling
 in her dress pocket]--I had almost forgotten--I have something for you
 here.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 What is it, Auntie? Eh?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 [Produces a flat parcel wrapped in newspaper and hands it to him.] Look
 here, my dear boy.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Opening the parcel.] Well, I declare!--Have you really saved
 them for me, Aunt Julia! Hedda! isn't this touching--eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Beside the whatnot on the right.] Well, what is it?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 My old morning-shoes! My slippers.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Indeed. I remember you often spoke of them while we were abroad.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, I missed them terribly. [Goes up to her.] Now you shall see them,
 Hedda!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Going towards the stove.] Thanks, I really don't care about it.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Following her.] Only think--ill as she was, Aunt Rina embroidered these
 for me. Oh you can't think how many associations cling to them.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [At the table.] Scarcely for me.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Of course not for Hedda, George.
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well, but now that she belongs to the family, I thought--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Interrupting.] We shall never get on with this servant, Tesman.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Not get on with Berta?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Why, dear, what puts that in your head? Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Pointing.] Look there! She has left her old bonnet lying about on a
 chair.
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [In consternation, drops the slippers on the floor.] Why, Hedda--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Just fancy, if any one should come in and see it!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 But Hedda--that's Aunt Julia's bonnet.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Is it!
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 [Taking up the bonnet.] Yes, indeed it's mine. And, what's more, it's
 not old, Madam Hedda.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I really did not look closely at it, Miss Tesman.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 [Trying on the bonnet.] Let me tell you it's the first time I have worn
 it--the very first time.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 And a very nice bonnet it is too--quite a beauty!
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Oh, it's no such great things, George. [Looks around her.] My
 parasol--? Ah, here. [Takes it.] For this is mine too-- [mutters] --not
 Berta's.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 A new bonnet and a new parasol! Only think, Hedda.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Very handsome indeed.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, isn't it? Eh? But Auntie, take a good look at Hedda before you go!
 See how handsome she is!
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Oh, my dear boy, there's nothing new in that. Hedda was always lovely.
 
      [She nods and goes toward the right.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Following.] Yes, but have you noticed what splendid condition she is
 in? How she has filled out on the journey?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Crossing the room.] Oh, do be quiet--!
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 [Who has stopped and turned.] Filled out?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Of course you don't notice it so much now that she has that dress on.
 But I, who can see--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [At the glass door, impatiently.] Oh, you can't see anything.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 It must be the mountain air in the Tyrol--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Curtly, interrupting.] I am exactly as I was when I started.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 So you insist; but I'm quite certain you are not. Don't you agree with
 me, Auntie?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 [Who has been gazing at her with folded hands.] Hedda is lovely--
 lovely--lovely. [Goes up to her, takes her head between both hands,
 draws it downwards, and kisses her hair.] God bless and preserve Hedda
 Tesman--for George's sake.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Gently freeing herself.] Oh--! Let me go.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 [In quiet emotion.] I shall not let a day pass without coming to see
 you.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No you won't, will you, Auntie? Eh?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Good-bye--good-bye!
 
      [She goes out by the hall door.  TESMAN accompanies her.  The
        door remains half open.  TESMAN can be heard repeating his
        message to Aunt Rina and his thanks for the slippers.
 
      [In the meantime, HEDDA walks about the room, raising her arms
        and clenching her hands as if in desperation.  Then she flings
        back the curtains from the glass door, and stands there looking
        out.
 
      [Presently, TESMAN returns and closes the door behind him.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Picks up the slippers from the floor.] What are you looking at, Hedda?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Once more calm and mistress of herself.] I am only looking at the
 leaves. They are so yellow--so withered.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Wraps up the slippers and lays them on the table.] Well, you see, we
 are well into September now.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Again restless.] Yes, to think of it!--already in--in September.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Don't you think Aunt Julia's manner was strange, dear? Almost solemn?
 Can you imagine what was the matter with her? Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I scarcely know her, you see. Is she not often like that?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No, not as she was to-day.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Leaving the glass door.] Do you think she was annoyed about the bonnet?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh, scarcely at all. Perhaps a little, just at the moment--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 But what an idea, to pitch her bonnet about in the drawing-room! No one
 does that sort of thing.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well you may be sure Aunt Julia won't do it again.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 In any case, I shall manage to make my peace with her.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, my dear, good Hedda, if you only would.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 When you call this afternoon, you might invite her to spend the evening
 here.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, that I will. And there's one thing more you could do that would
 delight her heart.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 What is it?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 If you could only prevail on yourself to say _du_(3) to her. For my
 sake, Hedda? Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, no, Tesman--you really mustn't ask that of me. I have told you so
 already. I shall try to call her "Aunt"; and you must be satisfied with
 that.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well well. Only I think now that you belong to the family, you--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 H'm--I can't in the least see why--
 
      [She goes up towards the middle doorway.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [After a pause.] Is there anything the matter with you, Hedda? Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I'm only looking at my old piano. It doesn't go at all well with all the
 other things.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 The first time I draw my salary, we'll see about exchanging it.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, no--no exchanging. I don't want to part with it. Suppose we put it
 there in the inner room, and then get another here in its place. When
 it's convenient, I mean.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [A little taken aback.] Yes--of course we could do that.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Takes up the bouquet from the piano.] These flowers were not here last
 night when we arrived.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Aunt Julia must have brought them for you.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Examining the bouquet.] A visiting-card. [Takes it out and reads:]
 "Shall return later in the day." Can you guess whose card it is?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No. Whose? Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 The name is "Mrs. Elvsted."
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Is it really? Sheriff Elvsted's wife? Miss Rysing that was.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Exactly. The girl with the irritating hair, that she was always showing
 off. An old flame of yours I've been told.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Laughing.] Oh, that didn't last long; and it was before I met you,
 Hedda. But fancy her being in town!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 It's odd that she should call upon us. I have scarcely seen her since we
 left school.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 I haven't see her either for--heaven knows how long. I wonder how she
 can endure to live in such an out-of-the way hole--eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [After a moment's thought, says suddenly.] Tell me, Tesman--isn't it
 somewhere near there that he--that--Eilert Lovborg is living?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, he is somewhere in that part of the country.
 
 
   BERTA enters by the hall door.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 That lady, ma'am, that brought some flowers a little while ago, is here
 again. [Pointing.] The flowers you have in your hand, ma'am.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Ah, is she? Well, please show her in.
 
 
   BERTA opens the door for MRS. ELVSTED, and goes out herself.
   --MRS. ELVSTED is a woman of fragile figure, with pretty,
   soft features.  Her eyes are light blue, large, round, and
   somewhat prominent, with a startled, inquiring expression.
   Her hair is remarkably light, almost flaxen, and unusually
   abundant and wavy.  She is a couple of years younger than
   HEDDA.  She wears a dark visiting dress, tasteful, but not
   quite in the latest fashion.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Receives her warmly.] How do you do, my dear Mrs. Elvsted? It's
 delightful to see you again.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Nervously, struggling for self-control.] Yes, it's a very long time
 since we met.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Gives her his hand.] And we too--eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Thanks for your lovely flowers--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, not at all--. I would have come straight here yesterday afternoon;
 but I heard that you were away--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Have you just come to town? Eh?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 I arrived yesterday, about midday. Oh, I was quite in despair when I
 heard that you were not at home.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 In despair! How so?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Why, my dear Mrs. Rysing--I mean Mrs. Elvsted--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I hope that you are not in any trouble?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, I am. And I don't know another living creature here that I can turn
 to.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Laying the bouquet on the table.] Come--let us sit here on the sofa--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, I am too restless to sit down.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh no, you're not. Come here.
 
      [She draws MRS. ELVSTED down upon the sofa and sits at her side.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well? What is it, Mrs. Elvsted--?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Has anything particular happened to you at home?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes--and no. Oh--I am so anxious you should not misunderstand me--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Then your best plan is to tell us the whole story, Mrs. Elvsted.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 I suppose that's what you have come for--eh?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, yes--of course it is. Well then, I must tell you--if you don't
 already know--that Eilert Lovborg is in town, too.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Lovborg--!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 What! Has Eilert Lovborg come back? Fancy that, Hedda!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well well--I hear it.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 He has been here a week already. Just fancy--a whole week! In this
 terrible town, alone! With so many temptations on all sides.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 But, my dear Mrs. Elvsted--how does he concern you so much?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Looks at her with a startled air, and says rapidly.] He was the
 children's tutor.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Your children's?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 My husband's. I have none.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Your step-children's, then?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Somewhat hesitatingly.] Then was he--I don't know how to express
 it--was he--regular enough in his habits to be fit for the post? Eh?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 For the last two years his conduct has been irreproachable.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Has it indeed? Fancy that, Hedda!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I hear it.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Perfectly irreproachable, I assure you! In every respect. But all the
 same--now that I know he is here--in this great town--and with a large
 sum of money in his hands--I can't help being in mortal fear for him.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Why did he not remain where he was? With you and your husband? Eh?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 After his book was published he was too restless and unsettled to remain
 with us.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, by-the-bye, Aunt Julia told me he had published a new book.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, a big book, dealing with the march of civilisation--in broad
 outline, as it were. It came out about a fortnight ago. And since it has
 sold so well, and been so much read--and made such a sensation--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Has it indeed? It must be something he has had lying by since his better
 days.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Long ago, you mean?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 No, he has written it all since he has been with us--within the last
 year.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Isn't that good news, Hedda? Think of that.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Ah yes, if only it would last!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Have you seen him here in town?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 No, not yet. I have had the greatest difficulty in finding out his
 address. But this morning I discovered it at last.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looks searchingly at her.] Do you know, it seems to me a little odd of
 your husband--h'm--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Starting nervously.] Of my husband! What?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 That he should send you to town on such an errand--that he does not come
 himself and look after his friend.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh no, no--my husband has no time. And besides, I--I had some shopping
 to do.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [With a slight smile.] Ah, that is a different matter.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Rising quickly and uneasily.] And now I beg and implore you, Mr.
 Tesman--receive Eilert Lovborg kindly if he comes to you! And that he
 is sure to do. You see you were such great friends in the old days.
 And then you are interested in the same studies--the same branch of
 science--so far as I can understand.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 We used to be at any rate.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 That is why I beg so earnestly that you--you too--will keep a sharp eye
 upon him. Oh, you will promise me that, Mr. Tesman--won't you?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 With the greatest of pleasure, Mrs. Rysing--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Elvsted.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 I assure you I shall do all I possibly can for Eilert. You may rely upon
 me.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, how very, very kind of you! [Presses his hands.] Thanks, thanks,
 thanks! [Frightened.] You see, my husband is so very fond of him!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Rising.] You ought to write to him, Tesman. Perhaps he may not care to
 come to you of his own accord.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well, perhaps it would be the right thing to do, Hedda? Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And the sooner the better. Why not at once?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Imploringly.] Oh, if you only would!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 I'll write this moment. Have you his address, Mrs.--Mrs. Elvsted.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes. [Takes a slip of paper from her pocket, and hands it to him.] Here
 it is.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Good, good. Then I'll go in-- [Looks about him.] By-the-bye,--my
 slippers? Oh, here. [Takes the packet and is about to go.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Be sure you write him a cordial, friendly letter. And a good long one
 too.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, I will.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 But please, please don't say a word to show that I have suggested it.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No, how could you think I would? Eh?
 
      [He goes out to the right, through the inner room.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Goes up to MRS. ELVSTED, smiles, and says in a low voice.] There! We
 have killed two birds with one stone.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 What do you mean?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Could you not see that I wanted him to go?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, to write the letter--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And that I might speak to you alone.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Confused.] About the same thing?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Precisely.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Apprehensively.] But there is nothing more, Mrs. Tesman! Absolutely
 nothing!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh yes, but there is. There is a great deal more--I can see that. Sit
 here--and we'll have a cosy, confidential chat.
 
    [She forces MRS. ELVSTED to sit in the easy-chair beside the
        stove, and seats herself on one of the footstools.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Anxiously, looking at her watch.] But, my dear Mrs. Tesman--I was
 really on the point of going.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, you can't be in such a hurry.--Well? Now tell me something about
 your life at home.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, that is just what I care least to speak about.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 But to me, dear--? Why, weren't we schoolfellows?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, but you were in the class above me. Oh, how dreadfully afraid of
 you I was then!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Afraid of me?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, dreadfully. For when we met on the stairs you used always to pull
 my hair.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Did I, really?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, and once you said you would burn it off my head.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh that was all nonsense, of course.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, but I was so silly in those days.--And since then, too--we have
 drifted so far--far apart from each other. Our circles have been so
 entirely different.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well then, we must try to drift together again. Now listen. At school
 we said _du_(4) to each other; and we called each other by our Christian
 names--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 No, I am sure you must be mistaken.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, not at all! I can remember quite distinctly. So now we are going to
 renew our old friendship. [Draws the footstool closer to MRS. ELVSTED.]
 There now! [Kisses her cheek.] You must say _du_ to me and call me
 Hedda.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Presses and pats her hands.] Oh, how good and kind you are! I am not
 used to such kindness.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 There, there, there! And I shall say _du_ to you, as in the old days,
 and call you my dear Thora.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 My name is Thea.(5)
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Why, of course! I meant Thea. [Looks at her compassionately.] So you are
 not accustomed to goodness and kindness, Thea? Not in your own home?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, if I only had a home! But I haven't any; I have never had a home.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looks at her for a moment.] I almost suspected as much.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Gazing helplessly before her.] Yes--yes--yes.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I don't quite remember--was it not as housekeeper that you first went to
 Mr. Elvsted's?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 I really went as governess. But his wife--his late wife--was an
 invalid,--and rarely left her room. So I had to look after the
 housekeeping as well.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And then--at last--you became mistress of the house.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Sadly.] Yes, I did.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Let me see--about how long ago was that?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 My marriage?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Five years ago.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 To be sure; it must be that.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh those five years--! Or at all events the last two or three of them!
 Oh, if you(6) could only imagine--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Giving her a little slap on the hand.] De? Fie, Thea!
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, yes, I will try--. Well, if--you could only imagine and
 understand--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Lightly.] Eilert Lovborg has been in your neighbourhood about three
 years, hasn't he?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Looks at here doubtfully.] Eilert Lovborg? Yes--he has.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Had you known him before, in town here?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Scarcely at all. I mean--I knew him by name of course.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 But you saw a good deal of him in the country?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, he came to us every day. You see, he gave the children lessons; for
 in the long run I couldn't manage it all myself.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, that's clear.--And your husband--? I suppose he is often away from
 home?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes. Being sheriff, you know, he has to travel about a good deal in his
 district.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Leaning against the arm of the chair.] Thea--my poor, sweet Thea--now
 you must tell me everything--exactly as it stands.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Well, then you must question me.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 What sort of a man is your husband, Thea? I mean--you know--in everyday
 life. Is he kind to you?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Evasively.] I am sure he means well in everything.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I should think he must be altogether too old for you. There is at least
 twenty years' difference between you, is there not?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Irritably.] Yes, that is true, too. Everything about him is repellent
 to me! We have not a thought in common. We have no single point of
 sympathy--he and I.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 But is he not fond of you all the same? In his own way?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh I really don't know. I think he regards me simply as a useful
 property. And then it doesn't cost much to keep me. I am not expensive.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 That is stupid of you.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Shakes her head.] It cannot be otherwise--not with him. I don't think
 he really cares for any one but himself--and perhaps a little for the
 children.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And for Eilert Lovborg, Thea?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Looking at her.] For Eilert Lovborg? What puts that into your head?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well, my dear--I should say, when he sends you after him all the way
 to town-- [Smiling almost imperceptibly.] And besides, you said so
 yourself, to Tesman.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [With a little nervous twitch.] Did I? Yes, I suppose I did.
 [Vehemently, but not loudly.] No--I may just as well make a clean breast
 of it at once! For it must all come out in any case.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Why, my dear Thea--?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Well, to make a long story short: My husband did not know that I was
 coming.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 What! Your husband didn't know it!
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 No, of course not. For that matter, he was away from home himself--
 he was travelling. Oh, I could bear it no longer, Hedda! I couldn't
 indeed--so utterly alone as I should have been in future.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well? And then?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 So I put together some of my things--what I needed most--as quietly as
 possible. And then I left the house.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Without a word?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes--and took the train to town.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Why, my dear, good Thea--to think of you daring to do it!
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Rises and moves about the room.] What else could I possibly do?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 But what do you think your husband will say when you go home again?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [At the table, looks at her.] Back to him?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Of course.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 I shall never go back to him again.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Rising and going towards her.] Then you have left your home--for good
 and all?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes. There was nothing else to be done.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 But then--to take flight so openly.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, it's impossible to keep things of that sort secret.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 But what do you think people will say of you, Thea?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 They may say what they like, for aught _I_ care. [Seats herself wearily
 and sadly on the sofa.] I have done nothing but what I had to do.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [After a short silence.] And what are your plans now? What do you think
 of doing.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 I don't know yet. I only know this, that I must live here, where Eilert
 Lovborg is--if I am to live at all.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Takes a chair from the table, seats herself beside her, and strokes
 her hands.] My dear Thea--how did this--this friendship--between you and
 Eilert Lovborg come about?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh it grew up gradually. I gained a sort of influence over him.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Indeed?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 He gave up his old habits. Not because I asked him to, for I never dared
 do that. But of course he saw how repulsive they were to me; and so he
 dropped them.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Concealing an involuntary smile of scorn.] Then you have reclaimed
 him--as the saying goes--my little Thea.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 So he says himself, at any rate. And he, on his side, has made a real
 human being of me--taught me to think, and to understand so many things.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Did he give you lessons too, then?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 No, not exactly lessons. But he talked to me--talked about such an
 infinity of things. And then came the lovely, happy time when I began to
 share in his work--when he allowed me to help him!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh he did, did he?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes! He never wrote anything without my assistance.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 You were two good comrades, in fact?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Eagerly.] Comrades! Yes, fancy, Hedda--that is the very word he
 used!--Oh, I ought to feel perfectly happy; and yet I cannot; for I
 don't know how long it will last.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Are you no surer of him than that?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Gloomily.] A woman's shadow stands between Eilert Lovborg and me.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looks at her anxiously.] Who can that be?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 I don't know. Some one he knew in his--in his past. Some one he has
 never been able wholly to forget.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 What has he told you--about this?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 He has only once--quite vaguely--alluded to it.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well! And what did he say?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 He said that when they parted, she threatened to shoot him with a
 pistol.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [With cold composure.] Oh nonsense! No one does that sort of thing here.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 No. And that is why I think it must have been that red-haired
 singing-woman whom he once--
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, very likely.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 For I remember they used to say of her that she carried loaded firearms.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh--then of course it must have been she.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Wringing her hands.] And now just fancy, Hedda--I hear that this
 singing-woman--that she is in town again! Oh, I don't know what to do--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Glancing towards the inner room.] Hush! Here comes Tesman. [Rises and
 whispers.] Thea--all this must remain between you and me.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Springing up.] Oh yes--yes! For heaven's sake--!
 
 
   GEORGE TESMAN, with a letter in his hand, comes from the right
   through the inner room.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 There now--the epistle is finished.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 That's right. And now Mrs. Elvsted is just going. Wait a moment--I'll
 go with you to the garden gate.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Do you think Berta could post the letter, Hedda dear?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Takes it.] I will tell her to.
 
 
   BERTA enters from the hall.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 Judge Brack wishes to know if Mrs. Tesman will receive him.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, ask Judge Brack to come in. And look here--put this letter in the
 post.
 
 
 BERTA. [Taking the letter.] Yes, ma'am.
 
    [She opens the door for JUDGE BRACK and goes out herself.  Brack
        is a main of forty-five; thick set, but well-built and elastic
        in his movements.  His face is roundish with an aristocratic
        profile.  His hair is short, still almost black, and carefully
        dressed.  His eyebrows thick.  His moustaches are also thick,
        with short-cut ends.  He wears a well-cut walking-suit, a
        little too youthful for his age.  He uses an eye-glass, which
        he now and then lets drop.
 
 
 JUDGE BRACK.
 
 [With his hat in his hand, bowing.] May one venture to call so early in
 the day?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Of course one may.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Presses his hand.] You are welcome at any time. [Introducing him.]
 Judge Brack--Miss Rysing--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh--!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Bowing.] Ah--delighted--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looks at him and laughs.] It's nice to have a look at you by daylight,
 Judge!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 So you find me--altered?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 A little younger, I think.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Thank you so much.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 But what do you think of Hedda--eh? Doesn't she look flourishing? She
 has actually--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, do leave me alone. You haven't thanked Judge Brack for all the
 trouble he has taken--
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Oh, nonsense--it was a pleasure to me--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, you are a friend indeed. But here stands Thea all impatience to be
 off--so _au revoir_ Judge. I shall be back again presently.
 
    [Mutual salutations.  MRS. ELVSTED and HEDDA go out by the hall
        door.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well,--is your wife tolerably satisfied--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, we can't thank you sufficiently. Of course she talks of a little
 re-arrangement here and there; and one or two things are still wanting.
 We shall have to buy some additional trifles.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Indeed!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 But we won't trouble you about these things. Hedda say she herself will
 look after what is wanting.--Shan't we sit down? Eh?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Thanks, for a moment. [Seats himself beside the table.] There is
 something I wanted to speak to about, my dear Tesman.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Indeed? Ah, I understand! [Seating himself.] I suppose it's the serious
 part of the frolic that is coming now. Eh?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Oh, the money question is not so very pressing; though, for that matter,
 I wish we had gone a little more economically to work.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 But that would never have done, you know! Think of Hedda, my dear
 fellow! You, who know her so well--! I couldn't possibly ask her to put
 up with a shabby style of living!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 No, no--that is just the difficulty.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 And then--fortunately--it can't be long before I receive my appointment.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well, you see--such things are often apt to hang fire for a long time.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Have you heard anything definite? Eh?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Nothing exactly definite--. [Interrupting himself.] But by-the-bye--I
 have one piece of news for you.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Your old friend, Eilert Lovborg, has returned to town.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 I know that already.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Indeed! How did you learn it?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 From that lady who went out with Hedda.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Really? What was her name? I didn't quite catch it.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Mrs. Elvsted.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Aha--Sheriff Elvsted's wife? Of course--he has been living up in their
 regions.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 And fancy--I'm delighted to hear that he is quite a reformed character.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 So they say.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 And then he has published a new book--eh?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes, indeed he has.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 And I hear it has made some sensation!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Quite an unusual sensation.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Fancy--isn't that good news! A man of such extraordinary talents--. I
 felt so grieved to think that he had gone irretrievably to ruin.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 That was what everybody thought.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 But I cannot imagine what he will take to now! How in the world will he
 be able to make his living? Eh?
 
    [During the last words, HEDDA has entered by the hall door.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [To BRACK, laughing with a touch of scorn.] Tesman is for ever worrying
 about how people are to make their living.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well you see, dear--we were talking about poor Eilert Lovborg.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Glancing at him rapidly.] Oh, indeed? [Sets herself in the arm-chair
 beside the stove and asks indifferently:] What is the matter with him?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well--no doubt he has run through all his property long ago; and he can
 scarcely write a new book every year--eh? So I really can't see what is
 to become of him.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Perhaps I can give you some information on that point.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Indeed!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 You must remember that his relations have a good deal of influence.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh, his relations, unfortunately, have entirely washed their hands of
 him.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 At one time they called him the hope of the family.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 At one time, yes! But he has put an end to all that.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Who knows? [With a slight smile.] I hear they have reclaimed him up at
 Sheriff Elvsted's--
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 And then this book that he has published--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well well, I hope to goodness they may find something for him to do. I
 have just written to him. I asked him to come and see us this evening,
 Hedda dear.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 But my dear fellow, you are booked for my bachelor's party this evening.
 You promised on the pier last night.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Had you forgotten, Tesman?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, I had utterly forgotten.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 But it doesn't matter, for you may be sure he won't come.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 What makes you think that? Eh?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [With a little hesitation, rising and resting his hands on the back of
 his chair.] My dear Tesman--and you too, Mrs. Tesman--I think I ought
 not to keep you in the dark about something that--that--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 That concerns Eilert--?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Both you and him.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well, my dear Judge, out with it.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 You must be prepared to find your appointment deferred longer than you
 desired or expected.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Jumping up uneasily.] Is there some hitch about it? Eh?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 The nomination may perhaps be made conditional on the result of a
 competition--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Competition! Think of that, Hedda!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Leans further back in the chair.] Aha--aha!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 But who can my competitor be? Surely not--?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes, precisely--Eilert Lovborg.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Clasping his hands.] No, no--it's quite impossible! Eh?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 H'm--that is what it may come to, all the same.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well but, Judge Brack--it would show the most incredible lack of
 consideration for me. [Gesticulates with his arms.] For--just think--I'm
 a married man! We have married on the strength of these prospects, Hedda
 and I; and run deep into debt; and borrowed money from Aunt Julia too.
 Good heavens, they had as good as promised me the appointment. Eh?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well, well, well--no doubt you will get it in the end; only after a
 contest.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Immovable in her arm-chair.] Fancy, Tesman, there will be a sort of
 sporting interest in that.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Why, my dearest Hedda, how can you be so indifferent about it?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [As before.] I am not at all indifferent. I am most eager to see who
 wins.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 In any case, Mrs. Tesman, it is best that you should know how matters
 stand. I mean--before you set about the little purchases I hear you are
 threatening.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 This can make no difference.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Indeed! Then I have no more to say. Good-bye! [To TESMAN.] I shall look
 in on my way back from my afternoon walk, and take you home with me.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh yes, yes--your news has quite upset me.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Reclining, holds out her hand.] Good-bye, Judge; and be sure you call
 in the afternoon.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Many thanks. Good-bye, good-bye!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Accompanying him to the door.] Good-bye my dear Judge! You must really
 excuse me-- [JUDGE BRACK goes out by the hall door.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Crosses the room.] Oh Hedda--one should never rush into adventures. Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looks at him, smiling.] Do you do that?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, dear--there is no denying--it was adventurous to go and marry and
 set up house upon mere expectations.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Perhaps you are right there.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well--at all events, we have our delightful home, Hedda! Fancy, the home
 we both dreamed of--the home we were in love with, I may almost say. Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Rising slowly and wearily.] It was part of our compact that we were to
 go into society--to keep open house.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, if you only knew how I had been looking forward to it! Fancy--to
 see you as hostess--in a select circle! Eh? Well, well, well--for the
 present we shall have to get on without society, Hedda--only to invite
 Aunt Julia now and then.--Oh, I intended you to lead such an utterly
 different life, dear--!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Of course I cannot have my man in livery just yet.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh, no, unfortunately. It would be out of the question for us to keep a
 footman, you know.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And the saddle-horse I was to have had--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Aghast.] The saddle-horse!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 --I suppose I must not think of that now.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Good heavens, no!--that's as clear as daylight!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Goes up the room.] Well, I shall have one thing at least to kill time
 with in the meanwhile.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Beaming.] Oh thank heaven for that! What is it, Hedda. Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [In the middle doorway, looks at him with covert scorn.] My pistols,
 George.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [In alarm.] Your pistols!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [With cold eyes.] General Gabler's pistols.
 
    [She goes out through the inner room, to the left.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Rushes up to the middle doorway and calls after her:] No, for heaven's
 sake, Hedda darling--don't touch those dangerous things! For my sake
 Hedda! Eh?
 
 
 
 
 ACT SECOND.
 
 
   The room at the TESMANS' as in the first Act, except that the
   piano has been removed, and an elegant little writing-table
   with the book-shelves put in its place.  A smaller table
   stands near the sofa on the left.  Most of the bouquets have
   been taken away.  MRS. ELVSTED'S bouquet is upon the large
   table in front.--It is afternoon.
 
   HEDDA, dressed to receive callers, is alone in the room. She
   stands by the open glass door, loading a revolver.  The
   fellow to it lies in an open pistol-case on the writing-
   table.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looks down the garden, and calls:] So you are here again, Judge!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Is heard calling from a distance.] As you see, Mrs. Tesman!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Raises the pistol and points.] Now I'll shoot you, Judge Brack!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Calling unseen.] No, no, no! Don't stand aiming at me!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 This is what comes of sneaking in by the back way.(7) [She fires.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Nearer.] Are you out of your senses--!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Dear me--did I happen to hit you?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Still outside.] I wish you would let these pranks alone!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Come in then, Judge.
 
 
   JUDGE BRACK, dressed as though for a men's party, enters by
   the glass door.  He carries a light overcoat over his arm.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 What the deuce--haven't you tired of that sport, yet? What are you
 shooting at?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, I am only firing in the air.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Gently takes the pistol out of her hand.] Allow me, madam! [Looks at
 it.] Ah--I know this pistol well! [Looks around.] Where is the case? Ah,
 here it is. [Lays the pistol in it, and shuts it.] Now we won't play at
 that game any more to-day.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Then what in heaven's name would you have me do with myself?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Have you had no visitors?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Closing the glass door.] Not one. I suppose all our set are still out
 of town.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 And is Tesman not at home either?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [At the writing-table, putting the pistol-case in a drawer which she
 shuts.] No. He rushed off to his aunt's directly after lunch; he didn't
 expect you so early.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 H'm--how stupid of me not to have thought of that!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Turning her head to look at him.] Why stupid?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Because if I had thought of it I should have come a little--earlier.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Crossing the room.] Then you would have found no one to receive you;
 for I have been in my room changing my dress ever since lunch.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 And is there no sort of little chink that we could hold a parley
 through?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 You have forgotten to arrange one.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 That was another piece of stupidity.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well, we must just settle down here--and wait. Tesman is not likely to
 be back for some time yet.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Never mind; I shall not be impatient.
 
 
   HEDDA seats herself in the corner of the sofa.  BRACK lays his
   overcoat over the back of the nearest chair, and sits down, but
   keeps his hat in his hand.  A short silence.  They look at each
   other.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [In the same tone.] Well?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I spoke first.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Bending a little forward.] Come, let us have a cosy little chat, Mrs.
 Hedda.(8)
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Leaning further back in the sofa.] Does it not seem like a whole
 eternity since our last talk? Of course I don't count those few words
 yesterday evening and this morning.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 You mean since out last confidential talk? Our last _tete-a-tete_?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well yes--since you put it so.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Not a day passed but I have wished that you were home again.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And I have done nothing but wish the same thing.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 You? Really, Mrs. Hedda? And I thought you had been enjoying your tour
 so much!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh yes, you may be sure of that!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 But Tesman's letters spoke of nothing but happiness.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, Tesman! You see, he thinks nothing is so delightful as grubbing
 in libraries and making copies of old parchments, or whatever you call
 them.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [With a smile of malice.] Well, that is his vocation in life--or part of
 it at any rate.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, of course; and no doubt when it's your vocation--. But _I_! Oh, my
 dear Mr. Brack, how mortally bored I have been.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Sympathetically.] Do you really say so? In downright earnest?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, you can surely understand it--! To go for six whole months without
 meeting a soul that knew anything of our circle, or could talk about
 things we were interested in.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes, yes--I too should feel that a deprivation.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And then, what I found most intolerable of all--
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 --was being everlastingly in the company of--one and the same person--
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [With a nod of assent.] Morning, noon, and night, yes--at all possible
 times and seasons.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I said "everlastingly."
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Just so. But I should have thought, with our excellent Tesman, one
 could--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Tesman is--a specialist, my dear Judge.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Undeniable.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And specialists are not at all amusing to travel with. Not in the long
 run at any rate.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Not even--the specialist one happens to love?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Faugh--don't use that sickening word!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Taken aback.] What do you say, Mrs. Hedda?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Half laughing, half irritated.] You should just try it! To hear of
 nothing but the history of civilisation, morning, noon, and night--
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Everlastingly.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes yes yes! And then all this about the domestic industry of the middle
 ages--! That's the most disgusting part of it!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Looks searchingly at her.] But tell me--in that case, how am I to
 understand your--? H'm--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 My accepting George Tesman, you mean?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well, let us put it so.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Good heavens, do you see anything so wonderful in that?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes and no--Mrs. Hedda.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I had positively danced myself tired, my dear Judge. My day was
 done-- [With a slight shudder.] Oh no--I won't say that; nor think
 it either!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 You have assuredly no reason to.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, reasons-- [Watching him closely.] And George Tesman--after all, you
 must admit that he is correctness itself.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 His correctness and respectability are beyond all question.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And I don't see anything absolutely ridiculous about him.--Do you?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Ridiculous? N--no--I shouldn't exactly say so--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well--and his powers of research, at all events, are untiring.--I see no
 reason why he should not one day come to the front, after all.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Looks at her hesitatingly.] I thought that you, like every one else,
 expected him to attain the highest distinction.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [With an expression of fatigue.] Yes, so I did.--And then, since he was
 bent, at all hazards, on being allowed to provide for me--I really don't
 know why I should not have accepted his offer?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 No--if you look at it in that light--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 It was more than my other adorers were prepared to do for me, my dear
 Judge.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Laughing.] Well, I can't answer for all the rest; but as for myself,
 you know quite well that I have always entertained a--a certain respect
 for the marriage tie--for marriage as an institution, Mrs. Hedda.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Jestingly.] Oh, I assure you I have never cherished any hopes with
 respect to you.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 All I require is a pleasant and intimate interior, where I can make
 myself useful in every way, and am free to come and go as--as a trusted
 friend--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Of the master of the house, do you mean?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Bowing.] Frankly--of the mistress first of all; but of course of the
 master too, in the second place. Such a triangular friendship--if I may
 call it so--is really a great convenience for all the parties, let me
 tell you.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, I have many a time longed for some one to make a third on our
 travels. Oh--those railway-carriage _tete-a-tetes_--!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Fortunately your wedding journey is over now.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Shaking her head.] Not by a long--long way. I have only arrived at a
 station on the line.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well, then the passengers jump out and move about a little, Mrs. Hedda.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I never jump out.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Really?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No--because there is always some one standing by to--
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Laughing.] To look at your ankles, do you mean?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Precisely.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well but, dear me--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [With a gesture of repulsion.] I won't have it. I would rather keep my
 seat where I happen to be--and continue the _tete-a-tete_.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 But suppose a third person were to jump in and join the couple.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Ah--that is quite another matter!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 A trusted, sympathetic friend--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 --with a fund of conversation on all sorts of lively topics--
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 --and not the least bit of a specialist!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [With an audible sigh.] Yes, that would be a relief indeed.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Hears the front door open, and glances in that direction.] The triangle
 is completed.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Half aloud.] And on goes the train.
 
 
   GEORGE TESMAN, in a grey walking-suit, with a soft felt hat,
   enters from the hall.  He has a number of unbound books under
   his arm and in his pockets.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Goes up to the table beside the corner settee.] Ouf--what a load for
 a warm day--all these books. [Lays them on the table.] I'm positively
 perspiring, Hedda. Hallo--are you there already, my dear Judge? Eh?
 Berta didn't tell me.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Rising.] I came in through the garden.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 What books have you got there?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Stands looking them through.] Some new books on my special subjects
 --quite indispensable to me.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Your special subjects?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes, books on his special subjects, Mrs. Tesman.
 
    [BRACK and HEDDA exchange a confidential smile.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Do you need still more books on your special subjects?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, my dear Hedda, one can never have too many of them. Of course one
 must keep up with all that is written and published.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, I suppose one must.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Searching among his books.] And look here--I have got hold of Eilert
 Lovborg's new book too. [Offering it to her.] Perhaps you would like to
 glance through it, Hedda? Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, thank you. Or rather--afterwards perhaps.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 I looked into it a little on the way home.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well, what do you think of it--as a specialist?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 I think it shows quite remarkable soundness of judgment. He never wrote
 like that before. [Putting the books together.] Now I shall take all
 these into my study. I'm longing to cut the leaves--! And then I must
 change my clothes. [To BRACK.] I suppose we needn't start just yet? Eh?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Oh, dear no--there is not the slightest hurry.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well then, I will take my time. [Is going with his books, but stops in
 the doorway and turns.] By-the-bye, Hedda--Aunt Julia is not coming this
 evening.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Not coming? Is it that affair of the bonnet that keeps her away?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh, not at all. How could you think such a thing of Aunt Julia? Just
 fancy--! The fact is, Aunt Rina is very ill.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 She always is.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, but to-day she is much worse than usual, poor dear.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, then it's only natural that her sister should remain with her. I
 must bear my disappointment.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 And you can't imagine, dear, how delighted Aunt Julia seemed to be--
 because you had come home looking so flourishing!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Half aloud, rising.] Oh, those everlasting Aunts!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 What?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Going to the glass door.] Nothing.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh, all right. [He goes through the inner room, out to the right.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 What bonnet were you talking about?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, it was a little episode with Miss Tesman this morning. She had laid
 down her bonnet on the chair there--[Looks at him and smiles.]--and I
 pretended to think it was the servant's.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Shaking his head.] Now my dear Mrs. Hedda, how could you do such a
 thing? To the excellent old lady, too!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Nervously crossing the room.] Well, you see--these impulses come over
 me all of a sudden; and I cannot resist them. [Throws herself down in
 the easy-chair by the stove.] Oh, I don't know how to explain it.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Behind the easy-chair.] You are not really happy--that is at the bottom
 of it.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looking straight before her.] I know of no reason why I should be--
 happy. Perhaps you can give me one?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well-amongst other things, because you have got exactly the home you had
 set your heart on.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looks up at him and laughs.] Do you too believe in that legend?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Is there nothing in it, then?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh yes, there is something in it.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 There is this in it, that I made use of Tesman to see me home from
 evening parties last summer--
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 I, unfortunately, had to go quite a different way.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 That's true. I know you were going a different way last summer.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Laughing.] Oh fie, Mrs. Hedda! Well, then--you and Tesman--?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well, we happened to pass here one evening; Tesman, poor fellow, was
 writhing in the agony of having to find conversation; so I took pity on
 the learned man--
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Smiles doubtfully.] You took pity? H'm--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, I really did. And so--to help him out of his torment--I happened to
 say, in pure thoughtlessness, that I should like to live in this villa.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 No more than that?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Not that evening.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 But afterwards?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, my thoughtlessness had consequences, my dear Judge.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Unfortunately that too often happens, Mrs. Hedda.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Thanks! So you see it was this enthusiasm for Secretary Falk's villa
 that first constituted a bond of sympathy between George Tesman and me.
 From that came our engagement and our marriage, and our wedding journey,
 and all the rest of it. Well, well, my dear Judge--as you make your bed
 so you must lie, I could almost say.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 This is exquisite! And you really cared not a rap about it all the time?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, heaven knows I didn't.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 But now? Now that we have made it so homelike for you?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Uh--the rooms all seem to smell of lavender and dried rose-leaves.--But
 perhaps it's Aunt Julia that has brought that scent with her.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Laughing.] No, I think it must be a legacy from the late Mrs. Secretary
 Falk.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, there is an odour of mortality about it. It reminds me of a
 bouquet--the day after the ball. [Clasps her hands behind her head,
 leans back in her chair and looks at him.] Oh, my dear Judge--you cannot
 imagine how horribly I shall bore myself here.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Why should not you, too, find some sort of vocation in life, Mrs. Hedda?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 A vocation--that should attract me?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 If possible, of course.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Heaven knows what sort of a vocation that could be. I often wonder
 whether-- [Breaking off.] But that would never do either.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Who can tell? Let me hear what it is.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Whether I might not get Tesman to go into politics, I mean.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Laughing.] Tesman? No really now, political life is not the thing for
 him--not at all in his line.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, I daresay not.--But if I could get him into it all the same?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Why--what satisfaction could you find in that? If he is not fitted for
 that sort of thing, why should you want to drive him into it?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Because I am bored, I tell you! [After a pause.] So you think it quite
 out of the question that Tesman should ever get into the ministry?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 H'm--you see, my dear Mrs. Hedda--to get into the ministry, he would
 have to be a tolerably rich man.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Rising impatiently.] Yes, there we have it! It is this genteel poverty
 I have managed to drop into--! [Crosses the room.] That is what makes
 life so pitiable! So utterly ludicrous!--For that's what it is.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Now _I_ should say the fault lay elsewhere.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Where, then?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 You have never gone through any really stimulating experience.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Anything serious, you mean?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes, you may call it so. But now you may perhaps have one in store.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Tossing her head.] Oh, you're thinking of the annoyances about this
 wretched professorship! But that must be Tesman's own affair. I assure
 you I shall not waste a thought upon it.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 No, no, I daresay not. But suppose now that what people call--in elegant
 language--a solemn responsibility were to come upon you? [Smiling.] A
 new responsibility, Mrs. Hedda?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Angrily.] Be quiet! Nothing of that sort will ever happen!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Warily.] We will speak of this again a year hence--at the very outside.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Curtly.] I have no turn for anything of the sort, Judge Brack. No
 responsibilities for me!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Are you so unlike the generality of women as to have no turn for duties
 which--?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Beside the glass door.] Oh, be quiet, I tell you!--I often think there
 is only one thing in the world I have any turn for.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Drawing near to her.] And what is that, if I may ask?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Stands looking out.] Boring myself to death. Now you know it. [Turns,
 looks towards the inner room, and laughs.] Yes, as I thought! Here comes
 the Professor.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Softly, in a tone of warning.] Come, come, come, Mrs. Hedda!
 
 
   GEORGE TESMAN, dressed for the party, with his gloves and hat
   in his hand, enters from the right through the inner room.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Hedda, has no message come from Eilert Lovborg? Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Then you'll see he'll be here presently.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Do you really think he will come?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, I am almost sure of it. For what you were telling us this morning
 must have been a mere floating rumour.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 You think so?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 At any rate, Aunt Julia said she did not believe for a moment that he
 would ever stand in my way again. Fancy that!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well then, that's all right.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Placing his hat and gloves on a chair on the right.] Yes, but you must
 really let me wait for him as long as possible.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 We have plenty of time yet. None of my guests will arrive before seven
 or half-past.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Then meanwhile we can keep Hedda company, and see what happens. Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Placing BRACK'S hat and overcoat upon the corner settee.] And at the
 worst Mr. Lovborg can remain here with me.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Offering to take his things.] Oh, allow me, Mrs. Tesman!--What do you
 mean by "At the worst"?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 If he won't go with you and Tesman.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Looks dubiously at her.] But, Hedda dear--do you think it would quite
 do for him to remain here with you? Eh? Remember, Aunt Julia can't come.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, but Mrs. Elvsted is coming. We three can have a cup of tea together.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh yes, that will be all right.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Smiling.] And that would perhaps be the safest plan for him.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Why so?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well, you know, Mrs. Tesman, how you used to gird at my little bachelor
 parties. You declared they were adapted only for men of the strictest
 principles.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 But no doubt Mr. Lovborg's principles are strict enough now. A converted
 sinner-- [BERTA appears at the hall door.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 There's a gentleman asking if you are at home, ma'am--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well, show him in.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Softly.] I'm sure it is he! Fancy that!
 
 
   EILERT LOVBORG enters from the hall.  He is slim and lean;
   of the same age as TESMAN, but looks older and somewhat
   worn-out.  His hair and beard are of a blackish brown, his
   face long and pale, but with patches of colour on the cheeks.
   He is dressed in a well-cut black visiting suit, quite new.
   He has dark gloves and a silk hat.  He stops near the door,
   and makes a rapid bow, seeming somewhat embarrassed.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Goes up to him and shakes him warmly by the hand.] Well, my dear
 Eilert--so at last we meet again!
 
 
 EILERT LOVBORG.
 
 [Speaks in a subdued voice.] Thanks for your letter, Tesman.
 [Approaching HEDDA.] Will you too shake hands with me, Mrs. Tesman?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Taking his hand.] I am glad to see you, Mr. Lovborg. [With a motion of
 her hand.] I don't know whether you two gentlemen--?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Bowing slightly.] Judge Brack, I think.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Doing likewise.] Oh yes,--in the old days--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [To LOVBORG, with his hands on his shoulders.] And now you must make
 yourself entirely at home, Eilert! Mustn't he, Hedda?--For I hear you
 are going to settle in town again? Eh?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Yes, I am.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Quite right, quite right. Let me tell you, I have got hold of your new
 book; but I haven't had time to read it yet.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 You may spare yourself the trouble.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Why so?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Because there is very little in it.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Just fancy--how can you say so?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 But it has been very much praised, I hear.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 That was what I wanted; so I put nothing into the book but what every
 one would agree with.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Very wise of you.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well but, my dear Eilert--!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 For now I mean to win myself a position again--to make a fresh start.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [A little embarrassed.] Ah, that is what you wish to do? Eh?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Smiling, lays down his hat, and draws a packet wrapped in paper, from
 his coat pocket.] But when this one appears, George Tesman, you will
 have to read it. For this is the real book--the book I have put my true
 self into.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Indeed? And what is it?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 It is the continuation.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 The continuation? Of what?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Of the book.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Of the new book?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Of course.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 
 Why, my dear Eilert--does it not come down to our own days?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Yes, it does; and this one deals with the future.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 With the future! But, good heavens, we know nothing of the future!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 No; but there is a thing or two to be said about it all the same. [Opens
 the packet.] Look here--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Why, that's not your handwriting.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 I dictated it. [Turning over the pages.] It falls into two sections. The
 first deals with the civilising forces of the future. And here is the
 second--[running through the pages towards the end]--forecasting the
 probable line of development.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 How odd now! I should never have thought of writing anything of that
 sort.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [At the glass door, drumming on the pane.] H'm--. I daresay not.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Replacing the manuscript in its paper and laying the packet on the
 table.] I brought it, thinking I might read you a little of it this
 evening.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 That was very good of you, Eilert. But this evening--? [Looking back at
 BRACK.] I don't see how we can manage it--
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Well then, some other time. There is no hurry.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 I must tell you, Mr. Lovborg--there is a little gathering at my house
 this evening--mainly in honour of Tesman, you know--
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Looking for his hat.] Oh--then I won't detain you--
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 No, but listen--will you not do me the favour of joining us?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Curtly and decidedly.] No, I can't--thank you very much.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Oh, nonsense--do! We shall be quite a select little circle. And I assure
 you we shall have a "lively time," as Mrs. Hed--as Mrs. Tesman says.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 I have no doubt of it. But nevertheless--
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 And then you might bring your manuscript with you, and read it to Tesman
 at my house. I could give you a room to yourselves.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, think of that, Eilert,--why shouldn't you? Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Interposing.] But, Tesman, if Mr. Lovborg would really rather not! I
 am sure Mr. Lovborg is much more inclined to remain here and have supper
 with me.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Looking at her.] With you, Mrs. Tesman?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And with Mrs. Elvsted.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Ah-- [Lightly.] I saw her for a moment this morning.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Did you? Well, she is coming this evening. So you see you are almost
 bound to remain, Mr. Lovborg, or she will have no one to see her home.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 That's true. Many thanks, Mrs. Tesman--in that case I will remain.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Then I have one or two orders to give the servant--
 
    [She goes to the hall door and rings.  BERTA enters. HEDDA talks
        to her in a whisper, and points towards the inner room.  BERTA
        nods and goes out again.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [At the same time, to LOVBORG.] Tell me, Eilert--is it this new
 subject--the future--that you are going to lecture about?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 They told me at the bookseller's that you are going to deliver a course
 of lectures this autumn.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 That is my intention. I hope you won't take it ill, Tesman.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh no, not in the least! But--?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 I can quite understand that it must be very disagreeable to you.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Cast down.] Oh, I can't expect you, out of consideration for me, to--
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 But I shall wait till you have received your appointment.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Will you wait? Yes but--yes but--are you not going to compete with me?
 Eh?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 No; it is only the moral victory I care for.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Why, bless me--then Aunt Julia was right after all! Oh yes--I knew it!
 Hedda! Just fancy--Eilert Lovborg is not going to stand in our way!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Curtly.] Our way? Pray leave me out of the question.
 
    [She goes up towards the inner room, where BERTA is placing a
        tray with decanters and glasses on the table.  HEDDA nods
        approval, and comes forward again.  BERTA goes out.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [At the same time.] And you, Judge Brack--what do you say to this? Eh?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well, I say that a moral victory--h'm--may be all very fine--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, certainly. But all the same--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looking at TESMAN with a cold smile.] You stand there looking as if you
 were thunderstruck--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes--so I am--I almost think--
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Don't you see, Mrs. Tesman, a thunderstorm has just passed over?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Pointing towards the room.] Will you not take a glass of cold punch,
 gentlemen?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Looking at his watch.] A stirrup-cup? Yes, it wouldn't come amiss.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 A capital idea, Hedda! Just the thing! Now that the weight has been
 taken off my mind--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Will you not join them, Mr. Lovborg?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [With a gesture of refusal.] No, thank you. Nothing for me.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Why bless me--cold punch is surely not poison.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Perhaps not for everyone.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I will keep Mr. Lovborg company in the meantime.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, yes, Hedda dear, do.
 
      [He and BRACK go into the inner room, seat themselves, drink
        punch, smoke cigarettes, and carry on a lively conversation
        during what follows.  EILERT LOVBORG remains standing beside
        the stove.  HEDDA goes to the writing-table.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Raising he voice a little.] Do you care to look at some photographs,
 Mr. Lovborg? You know Tesman and I made a tour in the Tyrol on our way
 home?
 
      [She takes up an album, and places it on the table beside the
        sofa, in the further corner of which she seats herself.  EILERT
        LOVBORG approaches, stops, and looks at her.  Then he takes a
        chair and seats himself to her left.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Opening the album.] Do you see this range of mountains, Mr. Lovborg?
 It's the Ortler group. Tesman has written the name underneath. Here it
 is: "The Ortler group near Meran."
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Who has never taken his eyes off her, says softly and slowly:]
 Hedda--Gabler!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Glancing hastily at him.] Ah! Hush!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Repeats softly.] Hedda Gabler!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looking at the album.] That was my name in the old days--when we two
 knew each other.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 And I must teach myself never to say Hedda Gabler again--never, as long
 as I live.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Still turning over the pages.] Yes, you must. And I think you ought to
 practise in time. The sooner the better, I should say.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [In a tone of indignation.] Hedda Gabler married? And married to--
 George Tesman!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes--so the world goes.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Oh, Hedda, Hedda--how could you(9) throw yourself away!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looks sharply at him.] What? I can't allow this!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 What do you mean?
 
      [TESMAN comes into the room and goes towards the sofa.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Hears him coming and says in an indifferent tone.] And this is a view
 from the Val d'Ampezzo, Mr. Lovborg. Just look at these peaks! [Looks
 affectionately up at TESMAN.] What's the name of these curious peaks,
 dear?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Let me see. Oh, those are the Dolomites.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, that's it!--Those are the Dolomites, Mr. Lovborg.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Hedda, dear,--I only wanted to ask whether I shouldn't bring you a
 little punch after all? For yourself at any rate--eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, do, please; and perhaps a few biscuits.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No cigarettes?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Very well.
 
      [He goes into the inner room and out to the right.  BRACK sits
        in the inner room, and keeps an eye from time to time on HEDDA
        and LOVBORG.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Softly, as before.] Answer me, Hedda--how could you go and do this?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Apparently absorbed in the album.] If you continue to say _du_ to me I
 won't talk to you.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 May I not say _du_ even when we are alone?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No. You may think it; but you mustn't say it.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Ah, I understand. It is an offence against George Tesman, whom
 you(10)--love.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Glances at him and smiles.] Love? What an idea!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 You don't love him then!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 But I won't hear of any sort of unfaithfulness! Remember that.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Hedda--answer me one thing--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Hush! [TESMAN enters with a small tray from the inner room.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Here you are! Isn't this tempting? [He puts the tray on the table.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Why do you bring it yourself?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Filling the glasses.] Because I think it's such fun to wait upon you,
 Hedda.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 But you have poured out two glasses. Mr. Lovborg said he wouldn't have
 any--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No, but Mrs. Elvsted will soon be here, won't she?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, by-the-bye--Mrs. Elvsted--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Had you forgotten her? Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 We were so absorbed in these photographs. [Shows him a picture.] Do you
 remember this little village?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh, it's that one just below the Brenner Pass. It was there we passed
 the night--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 --and met that lively party of tourists.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, that was the place. Fancy--if we could only have had you with us,
 Eilert! Eh?
 
      [He returns to the inner room and sits beside BRACK.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Answer me one thing, Hedda--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Was there no love in your friendship for me either? Not a spark--not a
 tinge of love in it?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I wonder if there was? To me it seems as though we were two good
 comrades--two thoroughly intimate friends. [Smilingly.] You especially
 were frankness itself.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 It was you that made me so.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 As I look back upon it all, I think there was really something
 beautiful, something fascinating--something daring--in--in that secret
 intimacy--that comradeship which no living creature so much as dreamed
 of.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Yes, yes, Hedda! Was there not?--When I used to come to your father's
 in the afternoon--and the General sat over at the window reading his
 papers--with his back towards us--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And we two on the corner sofa--
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Always with the same illustrated paper before us--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 For want of an album, yes.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Yes, Hedda, and when I made my confessions to you--told you about
 myself, things that at that time no one else knew! There I would sit
 and tell you of my escapades--my days and nights of devilment. Oh,
 Hedda--what was the power in you that forced me to confess these things?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Do you think it was any power in me?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 How else can I explain it? And all those--those roundabout questions you
 used to put to me--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Which you understood so particularly well--
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 How could you sit and question me like that? Question me quite
 frankly--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 In roundabout terms, please observe.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Yes, but frankly nevertheless. Cross-question me about--all that sort of
 thing?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And how could you answer, Mr. Lovborg?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Yes, that is just what I can't understand--in looking back upon it. But
 tell me now, Hedda--was there not love at the bottom of our friendship?
 On your side, did you not feel as though you might purge my stains
 away--if I made you my confessor? Was it not so?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, not quite.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 What was you motive, then?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Do think it quite incomprehensible that a young girl--when it can be
 done--without any one knowing--
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Well?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 --should be glad to have a peep, now and then, into a world which--?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Which--?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 --which she is forbidden to know anything about?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 So that was it?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Partly. Partly--I almost think.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Comradeship in the thirst for life. But why should not that, at any
 rate, have continued?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 The fault was yours.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 It was you that broke with me.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, when our friendship threatened to develop into something more
 serious. Shame upon you, Eilert Lovborg! How could you think of wronging
 your--your frank comrade.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Clenches his hands.] Oh, why did you not carry out your threat? Why did
 you not shoot me down?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Because I have such a dread of scandal.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Yes, Hedda, you are a coward at heart.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 A terrible coward. [Changing her tone.] But it was a lucky thing for
 you. And now you have found ample consolation at the Elvsteds'.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 I know what Thea has confided to you.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And perhaps you have confided to her something about us?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Not a word. She is too stupid to understand anything of that sort.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Stupid?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 She is stupid about matters of that sort.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And I am cowardly. [Bends over towards him, without looking him in the
 face, and says more softly:] But now I will confide something to you.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Eagerly.] Well?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 The fact that I dared not shoot you down--
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Yes!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 --that was not my arrant cowardice--that evening.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Looks at her a moment, understands, and whispers passionately.] Oh,
 Hedda! Hedda Gabler! Now I begin to see a hidden reason beneath our
 comradeship! You(11) and I--! After all, then, it was your craving for
 life--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Softly, with a sharp glance.] Take care! Believe nothing of the sort!
 
    [Twilight has begun to fall.  The hall door is opened from
        without by BERTA.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Closes the album with a bang and calls smilingly:] Ah, at last! My
 darling Thea,--come along!
 
   MRS. ELVSTED enters from the hall.  She is in evening dress.
   The door is closed behind her.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [On the sofa, stretches out her arms towards her.] My sweet Thea--you
 can't think how I have been longing for you!
 
      [MRS. ELVSTED, in passing, exchanges slight salutations with
        the gentlemen in the inner room, then goes up to the table
        and gives HEDDA her hand.  EILERT LOVBORG has risen.  He and
        MRS. ELVSTED greet each other with a silent nod.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Ought I to go in and talk to your husband for a moment?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, not at all. Leave those two alone. They will soon be going.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Are they going out?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, to a supper-party.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Quickly, to LOVBORG.] Not you?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 No.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Mr. Lovborg remains with us.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Takes a chair and is about to seat herself at his side.] Oh, how nice
 it is here!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, thank you, my little Thea! Not there! You'll be good enough to come
 over here to me. I will sit between you.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, just as you please.
 
    [She goes round the table and seats herself on the sofa on
        HEDDA'S right.  LOVBORG re-seats himself on his chair.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [After a short pause, to HEDDA.] Is not she lovely to look at?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Lightly stroking her hair.] Only to look at!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Yes. For we two--she and I--we are two real comrades. We have absolute
 faith in each other; so we can sit and talk with perfect frankness--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Not round about, Mr. Lovborg?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Well--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Softly clinging close to HEDDA.] Oh, how happy I am, Hedda! For only
 think, he says I have inspired him too.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looks at her with a smile.] Ah! Does he say that, dear?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 And then she is so brave, Mrs. Tesman!
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Good heavens--am I brave?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Exceedingly--where your comrade is concerned.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Exceedingly--where your comrade is concerned.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Ah, yes--courage! If one only had that!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 What then? What do you mean?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Then life would perhaps be liveable, after all. [With a sudden change
 of tone.] But now, my dearest Thea, you really must have a glass of cold
 punch.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 No, thanks--I never take anything of that kind.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well then, you, Mr. Lovborg.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Nor I, thank you.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 No, he doesn't either.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looks fixedly at him.] But if I say you shall?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 It would be of no use.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Laughing.] Then I, poor creature, have no sort of power over you?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Not in that respect.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 But seriously, I think you ought to--for your own sake.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Why, Hedda--!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 How so?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Or rather on account of other people.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Indeed?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Otherwise people might be apt to suspect that--in your heart of
 hearts--you did not feel quite secure--quite confident in yourself.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Softly.] Oh please, Hedda--!
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 People may suspect what they like--for the present.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Joyfully.] Yes, let them!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I saw it plainly in Judge Brack's face a moment ago.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 What did you see?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 His contemptuous smile, when you dared not go with them into the inner
 room.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Dared not? Of course I preferred to stop here and talk to you.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 What could be more natural, Hedda?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 But the Judge could not guess that. And I say, too, the way he smiled
 and glanced at Tesman when you dared not accept his invitation to this
 wretched little supper-party of his.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Dared not! Do you say I dared not?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 _I_ don't say so. But that was how Judge Brack understood it.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Well, let him.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Then you are not going with them?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 I will stay here with you and Thea.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, Hedda--how can you doubt that?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Smiles and nods approvingly to LOVBORG.] Firm as a rock! Faithful to
 your principles, now and for ever! Ah, that is how a man should be!
 [Turns to MRS. ELVSTED and caresses her.] Well now, what did I tell you,
 when you came to us this morning in such a state of distraction--
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Surprised.] Distraction!
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Terrified.] Hedda--oh Hedda--!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 You can see for yourself! You haven't the slightest reason to be in such
 mortal terror-- [Interrupting herself.] There! Now we can all three
 enjoy ourselves!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Who has given a start.] Ah--what is all this, Mrs. Tesman?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh my God, Hedda! What are you saying? What are you doing?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Don't get excited! That horrid Judge Brack is sitting watching you.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 So she was in mortal terror! On my account!
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Softly and piteously.] Oh, Hedda--now you have ruined everything!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Looks fixedly at her for a moment. His face is distorted.] So that was
 my comrade's frank confidence in me?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Imploringly.] Oh, my dearest friend--only let me tell you--
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Takes one of the glasses of punch, raises it to his lips, and says in a
 low, husky voice.] Your health, Thea!
 
    [He empties the glass, puts it down, and takes the second.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Softly.] Oh, Hedda, Hedda--how could you do this?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 _I_ do it? _I_? Are you crazy?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Here's to your health too, Mrs. Tesman. Thanks for the truth. Hurrah for
 the truth!
 
    [He empties the glass and is about to re-fill it.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Lays her hand on his arm.] Come, come--no more for the present.
 Remember you are going out to supper.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 No, no, no!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Hush! They are sitting watching you.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Putting down the glass.] Now, Thea--tell me the truth--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Did your husband know that you had come after me?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Wringing her hands.] Oh, Hedda--do you hear what his is asking?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Was it arranged between you and him that you were to come to town and
 look after me? Perhaps it was the Sheriff himself that urged you to
 come? Aha, my dear--no doubt he wanted my help in his office! Or was it
 at the card-table that he missed me?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Softly, in agony.] Oh, Lovborg, Lovborg--!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Seizes a glass and is on the point of filling it.] Here's a glass for
 the old Sheriff too!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Preventing him.] No more just now. Remember, you have to read your
 manuscript to Tesman.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Calmly, putting down the glass.] It was stupid of me all this. Thea--to
 take it in this way, I mean. Don't be angry with me, my dear, dear
 comrade. You shall see--both you and the others--that if I was fallen
 once--now I have risen again! Thanks to you, Thea.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Radiant with joy.] Oh, heaven be praised--!
 
      [BRACK has in the meantime looked at his watch.  He and TESMAN
        rise and come into the drawing-room.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Takes his hat and overcoat.] Well, Mrs. Tesman, our time has come.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I suppose it has.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Rising.] Mine too, Judge Brack.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Softly and imploringly.] Oh, Lovborg, don't do it!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Pinching her arm.] They can hear you!
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [With a suppressed shriek.] Ow!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [To BRACK.] You were good enough to invite me.
 
 
 JUDGE BRACK.
 
 Well, are you coming after all?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Yes, many thanks.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 I'm delighted--
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [To TESMAN, putting the parcel of MS. in his pocket.] I should like to
 show you one or two things before I send it to the printers.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Fancy--that will be delightful. But, Hedda dear, how is Mrs. Elvsted to
 get home? Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, that can be managed somehow.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Looking towards the ladies.] Mrs. Elvsted? Of course, I'll come again
 and fetch her. [Approaching.] At ten or thereabouts, Mrs. Tesman? Will
 that do?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Certainly. That will do capitally.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well, then, that's all right. But you must not expect me so early,
 Hedda.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, you may stop as long--as long as ever you please.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Trying to conceal her anxiety.] Well then, Mr. Lovborg--I shall remain
 here until you come.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [With his hat in his hand.] Pray do, Mrs. Elvsted.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 And now off goes the excursion train, gentlemen! I hope we shall have a
 lively time, as a certain fair lady puts it.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Ah, if only the fair lady could be present unseen--!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Why unseen?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 In order to hear a little of your liveliness at first hand, Judge Brack.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Laughing.] I should not advise the fair lady to try it.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Also laughing.] Come, you're a nice one Hedda! Fancy that!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well, good-bye, good-bye, ladies.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Bowing.] About ten o'clock, then,
 
    [BRACK, LOVBORG, and TESMAN go out by the hall door.  At the
        same time, BERTA enters from the inner room with a lighted
        lamp, which she places on the drawing-room table; she goes
        out by the way she came.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Who has risen and is wandering restlessly about the room.] Hedda--
 Hedda--what will come of all this?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 At ten o'clock--he will be here. I can see him already--with vine-leaves
 in his hair--flushed and fearless--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, I hope he may.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And then, you see--then he will have regained control over himself. Then
 he will be a free man for all his days.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh God!--if he would only come as you see him now!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 He will come as I see him--so, and not otherwise! [Rises and approaches
 THEA.] You may doubt him as long as you please; _I_ believe in him. And
 now we will try--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 You have some hidden motive in this, Hedda!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, I have. I want for once in my life to have power to mould a human
 destiny.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Have you not the power?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I have not--and have never had it.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Not your husband's?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Do you think that is worth the trouble? Oh, if you could only understand
 how poor I am. And fate has made you so rich! [Clasps her passionately
 in her arms.] I think I must burn your hair off after all.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Let me go! Let me go! I am afraid of you, Hedda!
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 [In the middle doorway.] Tea is laid in the dining-room, ma'am.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Very well. We are coming
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 No, no, no! I would rather go home alone! At once!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Nonsense! First you shall have a cup of tea, you little stupid. And
 then--at ten o'clock--Eilert Lovborg will be here--with vine-leaves in
 his hair.
 
    [She drags MRS. ELVSTED almost by force to the middle doorway.
 
 
 
 
 ACT THIRD.
 
 
   The room at the TESMANS'.  The curtains are drawn over the
   middle doorway, and also over the glass door.  The lamp,
   half turned down, and with a shade over it, is burning on
   the table.  In the stove, the door of which stands open,
   there has been a fire, which is now nearly burnt out.
 
   MRS. ELVSTED, wrapped in a large shawl, and with her feet
   upon a foot-rest, sits close to the stove, sunk back in
   the arm-chair.  HEDDA, fully dressed, lies sleeping upon
   the sofa, with a sofa-blanket over her.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [After a pause, suddenly sits up in her chair, and listens eagerly. Then
 she sinks back again wearily, moaning to herself.] Not yet!--Oh God--oh
 God--not yet!
 
 
   BERTA slips cautiously in by the hall door.  She has a letter in
   her hand.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Turns and whispers eagerly.] Well--has any one come?
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 [Softly.] Yes, a girl has just brought this letter.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Quickly, holding out her hand.] A letter! Give it to me!
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 No, it's for Dr. Tesman, ma'am.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, indeed.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 It was Miss Tesman's servant that brought it. I'll lay it here on the
 table.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, do.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 [Laying down the letter.] I think I had better put out the lamp. It's
 smoking.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, put it out. It must soon be daylight now.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 [Putting out the lamp.] It is daylight already, ma'am.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, broad day! And no one come back yet--!
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 Lord bless you, ma'am--I guessed how it would be.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 You guessed?
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 Yes, when I saw that a certain person had come back to town--and that he
 went off with them. For we've heard enough about that gentleman before
 now.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Don't speak so loud. You will waken Mrs. Tesman.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 [Looks towards the sofa and sighs.] No, no--let her sleep, poor thing.
 Shan't I put some wood on the fire?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Thanks, not for me.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 Oh, very well. [She goes softly out by the hall door.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Is wakened by the shutting of the door, and looks up.] What's that--?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 It was only the servant.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looking about her.] Oh, we're here--! Yes, now I remember. [Sits erect
 upon the sofa, stretches herself, and rubs her eyes.] What o'clock is
 it, Thea?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Looks at her watch.] It's past seven.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 When did Tesman come home?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 He has not come.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Not come home yet?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Rising.] No one has come.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Think of our watching and waiting here till four in the morning--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Wringing her hands.] And how I watched and waited for him!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Yawns, and says with her hand before her mouth.] Well well--we might
 have spared ourselves the trouble.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Did you get a little sleep?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh yes; I believe I have slept pretty well. Have you not?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Not for a moment. I couldn't, Hedda!--not to save my life.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Rises and goes towards her.] There there there! There's nothing to be
 so alarmed about. I understand quite well what has happened.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Well, what do you think? Won't you tell me?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Why, of course it has been a very late affair at Judge Brack's--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, yes--that is clear enough. But all the same--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And then, you see, Tesman hasn't cared to come home and ring us up in
 the middle of the night. [Laughing.] Perhaps he wasn't inclined to show
 himself either--immediately after a jollification.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 But in that case--where can he have gone?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Of course he has gone to his Aunts' and slept there. They have his old
 room ready for him.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 No, he can't be with them for a letter has just come for him from Miss
 Tesman. There it lies.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Indeed? [Looks at the address.] Why yes, it's addressed in Aunt Julia's
 hand. Well then, he has remained at Judge Brack's. And as for Eilert
 Lovborg--he is sitting, with vine-leaves in his hair, reading his
 manuscript.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, Hedda, you are just saying things you don't believe a bit.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 You really are a little blockhead, Thea.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh yes, I suppose I am.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And how mortally tired you look.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, I am mortally tired.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well then, you must do as I tell you. You must go into my room and lie
 down for a little while.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh no, no--I shouldn't be able to sleep.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I am sure you would.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Well, but you husband is certain to come soon now; and then I want to
 know at once--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I shall take care to let you know when he comes.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Do you promise me, Hedda?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, rely upon me. Just you go in and have a sleep in the meantime.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Thanks; then I'll try. [She goes off to the inner room.
 
      [HEDDA goes up to the glass door and draws back the curtains.
        The broad daylight streams into the room.  Then she takes a
        little hand-glass from the writing-table, looks at herself
        in it, and arranges her hair.  Next she goes to the hall
        door and presses the bell-button.
 
 
   BERTA presently appears at the hall door.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 Did you want anything, ma'am?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes; you must put some more wood in the stove. I am shivering.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 Bless me--I'll make up the fire at once. [She rakes the embers together
 and lays a piece of wood upon them; then stops and listens.] That was a
 ring at the front door, ma'am.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Then go to the door. I will look after the fire.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 It'll soon burn up. [She goes out by the hall door.
 
      [HEDDA kneels on the foot-rest and lays some more pieces of
        wood in the stove.
 
 
    After a short pause, GEORGE TESMAN enters from the hall.  He
    steals on tiptoe towards the middle doorway and is about to
    slip through the curtains.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [At the stove, without looking up.] Good morning.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Turns.] Hedda! [Approaching her.] Good heavens--are you up so early?
 Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, I am up very early this morning.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 And I never doubted you were still sound asleep! Fancy that, Hedda!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Don't speak so loud. Mrs. Elvsted is resting in my room.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Has Mrs. Elvsted been here all night?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, since no one came to fetch her.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Ah, to be sure.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Closes the door of the stove and rises.] Well, did you enjoy yourselves
 at Judge Brack's?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Have you been anxious about me? Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, I should never think of being anxious. But I asked if you had
 enjoyed yourself.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh yes,--for once in a way. Especially the beginning of the evening; for
 then Eilert read me part of his book. We arrived more than an hour too
 early--fancy that! And Brack had all sorts of arrangements to make--so
 Eilert read to me.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Seating herself by the table on the right.] Well? Tell me then--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Sitting on a footstool near the stove.] Oh, Hedda, you can't conceive
 what a book that is going to be! I believe it is one of the most
 remarkable things that have ever been written. Fancy that!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes yes; I don't care about that--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 I must make a confession to you, Hedda. When he had finished reading--a
 horrid feeling came over me.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 A horrid feeling?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 I felt jealous of Eilert for having had it in him to write such a book.
 Only think, Hedda!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, yes, I am thinking!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 And then how pitiful to think that he--with all his gifts--should be
 irreclaimable, after all.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I suppose you mean that he has more courage than the rest?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No, not at all--I mean that he is incapable of taking his pleasure in
 moderation.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And what came of it all--in the end?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well, to tell the truth, I think it might best be described as an orgie,
 Hedda.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Had he vine-leaves in his hair?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Vine-leaves? No, I saw nothing of the sort. But he made a long, rambling
 speech in honour of the woman who had inspired him in his work--that was
 the phrase he used.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Did he name her?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No, he didn't; but I can't help thinking he meant Mrs. Elvsted. You may
 be sure he did.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well--where did you part from him?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 On the way to town. We broke up--the last of us at any rate--all
 together; and Brack came with us to get a breath of fresh air. And then,
 you see, we agreed to take Eilert home; for he had had far more than was
 good for him.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I daresay.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 But now comes the strange part of it, Hedda; or, I should rather say,
 the melancholy part of it. I declare I am almost ashamed--on Eilert's
 account--to tell you--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, go on--!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well, as we were getting near town, you see, I happened to drop a little
 behind the others. Only for a minute or two--fancy that!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes yes yes, but--?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 And then, as I hurried after them--what do you think I found by the
 wayside? Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, how should I know!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 You mustn't speak of it to a soul, Hedda! Do you hear! Promise me, for
 Eilert's sake. [Draws a parcel, wrapped in paper, from his coat pocket.]
 Fancy, dear--I found this.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Is not that the parcel he had with him yesterday?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, it is the whole of his precious, irreplaceable manuscript! And he
 had gone and lost it, and knew nothing about it. Only fancy, Hedda! So
 deplorably--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 But why did you not give him back the parcel at once?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 I didn't dare to--in the state he was then in--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Did you not tell any of the others that you had found it?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh, far from it! You can surely understand that, for Eilert's sake, I
 wouldn't do that.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 So no one knows that Eilert Lovborg's manuscript is in your possession?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No. And no one must know it.
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Then what did you say to him afterwards?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 I didn't talk to him again at all; for when we got in among the streets,
 he and two or three of the others gave us the slip and disappeared.
 Fancy that!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Indeed! They must have taken him home then.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, so it would appear. And Brack, too, left us.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And what have you been doing with yourself since?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well, I and some of the others went home with one of the party, a jolly
 fellow, and took our morning coffee with him; or perhaps I should rather
 call it our night coffee--eh? But now, when I have rested a little, and
 given Eilert, poor fellow, time to have his sleep out, I must take this
 back to him.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Holds out her hand for the packet.] No--don't give it to him! Not in
 such a hurry, I mean. Let me read it first.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No, my dearest Hedda, I mustn't, I really mustn't.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 You must not?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No--for you can imagine what a state of despair he will be in when he
 wakens and misses the manuscript. He has no copy of it, you must know!
 He told me so.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looking searchingly at him.] Can such a thing not be reproduced?
 Written over again?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No, I don't think that would be possible. For the inspiration, you
 see--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, yes--I suppose it depends on that--[Lightly.] But, by-the-bye
 --here is a letter for you.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Fancy--!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Handing it to him.] It came early this morning.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 It's from Aunt Julia! What can it be? [He lays the packet on the other
 footstool, opens the letter, runs his eye through it, and jumps up.] Oh,
 Hedda--she says that poor Aunt Rina is dying!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well, we were prepared for that.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 And that if I want to see her again, I must make haste. I'll run in to
 them at once.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Suppressing a smile.] Will you run?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh, my dearest Hedda--if you could only make up your mind to come with
 me! Just think!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Rises and says wearily, repelling the idea.] No, no don't ask me. I
 will not look upon sickness and death. I loathe all sorts of ugliness.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well, well, then--! [Bustling around.] My hat--? My overcoat--? Oh,
 in the hall--. I do hope I mayn't come too late, Hedda! Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, if you run-- [BERTA appears at the hall door.
 
 
 BERTA.
 
 Judge Brack is at the door, and wishes to know if he may come in.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 At this time! No, I can't possibly see him.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 But I can. [To BERTA.] Ask Judge Brack to come in. [BERTA goes out.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Quickly, whispering.] The parcel, Tesman!
 
    [She snatches it up from the stool.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, give it to me!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, no, I will keep it till you come back.
 
      [She goes to the writing-table and places it in the bookcase.
        TESMAN stands in a flurry of haste, and cannot get his
        gloves on.
 
 
   JUDGE BRACK enters from the hall.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Nodding to him.] You are an early bird, I must say.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes, don't you think so! [To TESMAN.] Are you on the move, too?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, I must rush of to my aunts'. Fancy--the invalid one is lying at
 death's door, poor creature.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Dear me, is she indeed? Then on no account let me detain you. At such a
 critical moment--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, I must really rush-- Good-bye! Good-bye!
 
    [He hastens out by the hall door.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Approaching.] You seem to have made a particularly lively night of it
 at your rooms, Judge Brack.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 I assure you I have not had my clothes off, Mrs. Hedda.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Not you, either?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 No, as you may see. But what has Tesman been telling you of the night's
 adventures?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, some tiresome story. Only that they went and had coffee somewhere or
 other.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 I have heard about that coffee-party already. Eilert Lovborg was not
 with them, I fancy?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, they had taken him home before that.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Tesman too?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, but some of the others, he said.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Smiling.] George Tesman is really an ingenuous creature, Mrs. Hedda.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, heaven knows he is. Then is there something behind all this?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes, perhaps there may be.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well then, sit down, my dear Judge, and tell your story in comfort.
 
      [She seats herself to the left of the table.  BRACK sits near
        her, at the long side of the table.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Now then?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 I had special reasons for keeping track of my guests--last night.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Of Eilert Lovborg among the rest, perhaps?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Frankly, yes.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Now you make me really curious--
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Do you know where he and one or two of the others finished the night,
 Mrs. Hedda?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 If it is not quite unmentionable, tell me.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Oh no, it's not at all unmentionable. Well, they put in an appearance at
 a particularly animated soiree.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Of the lively kind?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Of the very liveliest--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Tell me more of this, Judge Brack--
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Lovborg, as well as the others, had been invited in advance. I knew all
 about it. But he had declined the invitation; for now, as you know, he
 has become a new man.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Up at the Elvsteds', yes. But he went after all, then?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well, you see, Mrs. Hedda--unhappily the spirit moved him at my rooms
 last evening--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, I hear he found inspiration.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Pretty violent inspiration. Well, I fancy that altered his purpose; for
 we menfolk are unfortunately not always so firm in our principles as we
 ought to be.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, I am sure you are an exception, Judge Brack. But as to Lovborg--?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 To make a long story short--he landed at last in Mademoiselle Diana's
 rooms.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Mademoiselle Diana's?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 It was Mademoiselle Diana that was giving the soiree, to a select circle
 of her admirers and her lady friends.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Is she a red-haired woman?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Precisely.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 A sort of a--singer?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Oh yes--in her leisure moments. And moreover a mighty huntress--of
 men--Mrs. Hedda. You have no doubt heard of her. Eilert Lovborg was one
 of her most enthusiastic protectors--in the days of his glory.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And how did all this end?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Far from amicably, it appears. After a most tender meeting, they seem to
 have come to blows--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Lovborg and she?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes. He accused her or her friends of having robbed him. He declared
 that his pocket-book had disappeared--and other things as well. In
 short, he seems to have made a furious disturbance.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And what came of it all?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 It came to a general scrimmage, in which the ladies as well as the
 gentlemen took part. Fortunately the police at last appeared on the
 scene.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 The police too?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes. I fancy it will prove a costly frolic for Eilert Lovborg, crazy
 being that he is.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 How so?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 He seems to have made a violent resistance--to have hit one of the
 constables on the head and torn the coat off his back. So they had to
 march him off to the police-station with the rest.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 How have you learnt all this?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 From the police themselves.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Gazing straight before her.] So that is what happened. Then he had no
 vine-leaves in his hair.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Vine-leaves, Mrs. Hedda?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Changing her tone.] But tell me now, Judge--what is your real reason
 for tracking out Eilert Lovborg's movements so carefully?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 In the first place, it could not be entirely indifferent to me if it
 should appear in the police-court that he came straight from my house.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Will the matter come into court then?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Of course. However, I should scarcely have troubled so much about that.
 But I thought that, as a friend of the family, it was my duty to supply
 you and Tesman with a full account of his nocturnal exploits.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Why so, Judge Brack?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Why, because I have a shrewd suspicion that he intends to use you as a
 sort of blind.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, how can you think such a thing!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Good heavens, Mrs. Hedda--we have eyes in our head. Mark my words! This
 Mrs. Elvsted will be in no hurry to leave town again.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well, even if there should be anything between them, I suppose there are
 plenty of other places where they could meet.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Not a single home. Henceforth, as before, every respectable house will
 be closed against Eilert Lovborg.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And so ought mine to be, you mean?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes. I confess it would be more than painful to me if this personage
 were to be made free of your house. How superfluous, how intrusive, he
 would be, if he were to force his way into--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 --into the triangle?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Precisely. It would simply mean that I should find myself homeless.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looks at him with a smile.] So you want to be the one cock in the
 basket(12)--that is your aim.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Nods slowly and lowers his voice.] Yes, that is my aim. And for that I
 will fight--with every weapon I can command.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Her smile vanishing.] I see you are a dangerous person--when it comes
 to the point.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Do you think so?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I am beginning to think so. And I am exceedingly glad to think--that you
 have no sort of hold over me.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Laughing equivocally.] Well well, Mrs. Hedda--perhaps you are right
 there. If I had, who knows what I might be capable of?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Come come now, Judge Brack! That sounds almost like a threat.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Rising.] Oh, not at all! The triangle, you know, ought, if possible, to
 be spontaneously constructed.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 There I agree with you.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well, now I have said all I had to say; and I had better be getting back
 to town. Good-bye, Mrs. Hedda. [He goes towards the glass door.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Rising.] Are you going through the garden?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes, it's a short cut for me.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And then it is a back way, too.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Quite so. I have no objection to back ways. They may be piquant enough
 at times.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 When there is ball practice going on, you mean?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [In the doorway, laughing to her.] Oh, people don't shoot their tame
 poultry, I fancy.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Also laughing.] Oh no, when there is only one cock in the basket--
 
      [They exchange laughing nods of farewell.  He goes.  She closes
        the door behind him.
 
      [HEDDA, who has become quite serious, stands for a moment
        looking out.  Presently she goes and peeps through the
        curtain over the middle doorway.  Then she goes to the
        writing-table, takes LOVBORG'S packet out of the bookcase,
        and is on the point of looking through its contents.  BERTA
        is heard speaking loudly in the hall.  HEDDA turns and
        listens.  Then she hastily locks up the packet in the drawer,
        and lays the key on the inkstand.
 
 
   EILERT LOVBORG, with his greatcoat on and his hat in his
   hand, tears open the hall door.  He looks somewhat confused
   and irritated.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Looking towards the hall.] and I tell you I must and will come in!
 There!
 
      [He closes the door, turns, sees HEDDA, at once regains his self-
        control, and bows.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [At the writing-table.] Well, Mr Lovborg, this is rather a late hour to
 call for Thea.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 You mean rather an early hour to call on you. Pray pardon me.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 How do you know that she is still here?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 They told me at her lodgings that she had been out all night.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Going to the oval table.] Did you notice anything about the people of
 the house when they said that?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Looks inquiringly at her.] Notice anything about them?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I mean, did they seem to think it odd?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Suddenly understanding.] Oh yes, of course! I am dragging her down with
 me! However, I didn't notice anything.--I suppose Tesman is not up yet.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No--I think not--
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 When did he come home?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Very late.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Did he tell you anything?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, I gathered that you had had an exceedingly jolly evening at Judge
 Brack's.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Nothing more?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I don't think so. However, I was so dreadfully sleepy--
 
 
     MRS. ELVSTED enters through the curtains of the middle doorway.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Going towards him.] Ah, Lovborg! At last--!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Yes, at last. And too late!
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Looks anxiously at him.] What is too late?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Everything is too late now. It is all over with me.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh no, no--don't say that!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 You will say the same when you hear--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 I won't hear anything!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Perhaps you would prefer to talk to her alone? If so, I will leave you.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 No, stay--you too. I beg you to stay.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, but I won't hear anything, I tell you.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 It is not last night's adventures that I want to talk about.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 What is it then--?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 I want to say that now our ways must part.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Part!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Involuntarily.] I knew it!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 You can be of no more service to me, Thea.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 How can you stand there and say that! No more service to you! Am I not
 to help you now, as before? Are we not to go on working together?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Henceforward I shall do no work.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Despairingly.] Then what am I to do with my life?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 You must try to live your life as if you had never know me.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 But you know I cannot do that!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Try if you cannot, Thea. You must go home again--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [In vehement protest.] Never in this world! Where you are, there will I
 be also! I will not let myself be driven away like this! I will remain
 here! I will be with you when the book appears.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Half aloud, in suspense.] Ah yes--the book!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Looks at her.] My book and Thea's; for that is what it is.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, I feel that it is. And that is why I have a right to be with you
 when it appears! I will see with my own eyes how respect and honour pour
 in upon you afresh. And the happiness--the happiness--oh, I must share
 it with you!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Thea--our book will never appear.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Ah!
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Never appear!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Can never appear.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [In agonised foreboding.] Lovborg--what have you done with the
 manuscript?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looks anxiously at him.] Yes, the manuscript--?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Where is it?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 The manuscript--. Well then--I have torn the manuscript into a thousand
 pieces.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Shrieks.] Oh no, no--!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Involuntarily.] But that's not--
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Looks at her.] Not true, you think?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Collecting herself.] Oh well, of course--since you say so. But it
 sounded so improbable--
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 It is true, all the same.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Wringing her hands.] Oh God--oh God, Hedda--torn his own work to
 pieces!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 I have torn my own life to pieces. So why should I not tear my
 life-work too--?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 And you did this last night?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Yes, I tell you! Tore it into a thousand pieces--and scattered them on
 the fiord--far out. There there is cool sea-water at any rate--let them
 drift upon it--drift with the current and the wind. And then presently
 they will sink--deeper and deeper--as I shall, Thea.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Do you know, Lovborg, that what you have done with the book--I shall
 think of it to my dying day as though you had killed a little child.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Yes, you are right. It is a sort of child-murder.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 How could you, then--! Did not the child belong to me too?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Almost inaudibly.] Ah, the child--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Breathing heavily.] It is all over then. Well well, now I will go,
 Hedda.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 But you are not going away from town?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, I don't know what I shall do. I see nothing but darkness before me.
 [She goes out by the hall door.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Stands waiting for a moment.] So you are not going to see her home, Mr.
 Lovborg?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 I? Through the streets? Would you have people see her walking with me?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Of course I don't know what else may have happened last night. But is it
 so utterly irretrievable?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 It will not end with last night--I know that perfectly well. And the
 thing is that now I have no taste for that sort of life either. I won't
 begin it anew. She has broken my courage and my power of braving life
 out.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looking straight before her.] So that pretty little fool has had her
 fingers in a man's destiny. [Looks at him.] But all the same, how could
 you treat her so heartlessly.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Oh, don't say that I was heartless!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 To go and destroy what has filled her whole soul for months and years!
 You do not call that heartless!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 To you I can tell the truth, Hedda.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 The truth?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 First promise me--give me your word--that what I now confide in you Thea
 shall never know.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I give you my word.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Good. Then let me tell you that what I said just now was untrue.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 About the manuscript?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Yes. I have not torn it to pieces--nor thrown it into the fiord.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, no--. But--where is it then?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 I have destroyed it none the less--utterly destroyed it, Hedda!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I don't understand.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Thea said that what I had done seemed to her like a child-murder.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, so she said.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 But to kill his child--that is not the worst thing a father can do to
 it.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Not the worst?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Suppose now, Hedda, that a man--in the small hours of the morning--came
 home to his child's mother after a night of riot and debauchery, and
 said: "Listen--I have been here and there--in this place and in that.
 And I have taken our child with--to this place and to that. And I have
 lost the child--utterly lost it. The devil knows into what hands it may
 have fallen--who may have had their clutches on it."
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well--but when all is said and done, you know--this was only a book--
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Thea's pure soul was in that book.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, so I understand.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 And you can understand, too, that for her and me together no future is
 possible.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 What path do you mean to take then?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 None. I will only try to make an end of it all--the sooner the better.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [A step nearer him.] Eilert Lovborg--listen to me.--Will you not try
 to--to do it beautifully?
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Beautifully? [Smiling.] With vine-leaves in my hair, as you used to
 dream in the old days--?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, no. I have lost my faith in the vine-leaves. But beautifully
 nevertheless! For once in a way!--Good-bye! You must go now--and do not
 come here any more.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Good-bye, Mrs. Tesman. And give George Tesman my love.
 
    [He is on the point of going.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, wait! I must give you a memento to take with you.
 
      [She goes to the writing-table and opens the drawer and the
        pistol-case; then returns to LOVBORG with one of the pistols.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Looks at her.] This? Is this the memento?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Nodding slowly.] Do you recognise it? It was aimed at you once.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 You should have used it then.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Take it--and do you use it now.
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 [Puts the pistol in his breast pocket.] Thanks!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And beautifully, Eilert Lovborg. Promise me that!
 
 
 LOVBORG.
 
 Good-bye, Hedda Gabler. [He goes out by the hall door.
 
      [HEDDA listens for a moment at the door.  Then she goes up to
        the writing-table, takes out the packet of manuscript, peeps
        under the cover, draws a few of the sheets half out, and
        looks at them.  Next she goes over and seats herself in the
        arm-chair beside the stove, with the packet in her lap.
        Presently she opens the stove door, and then the packet.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Throws one of the quires into the fire and whispers to herself.] Now I
 am burning your child, Thea!--Burning it, curly-locks! [Throwing one
 or two more quires into the stove.] Your child and Eilert Lovborg's.
 [Throws the rest in.] I am burning--I am burning your child.
 
 
 
 
 ACT FOURTH.
 
   The same rooms at the TESMANS'.  It is evening.  The drawing-
   room is in darkness.  The back room is light by the hanging
   lamp over the table.  The curtains over the glass door are
   drawn close.
 
   HEDDA, dressed in black, walks to and fro in the dark room.
   Then she goes into the back room and disappears for a moment
   to the left.  She is heard to strike a few chords on the
   piano.  Presently she comes in sight again, and returns to
   the drawing-room.
 
   BERTA enters from the right, through the inner room, with a
   lighted lamp, which she places on the table in front of the
   corner settee in the drawing-room.  Her eyes are red with
   weeping, and she has black ribbons in her cap.  She goes
   quietly and circumspectly out to the right.  HEDDA goes up
   to the glass door, lifts the curtain a little aside, and
   looks out into the darkness.
 
   Shortly afterwards, MISS TESMAN, in mourning, with a bonnet
   and veil on, comes in from the hall.  HEDDA goes towards her
   and holds out her hand.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Yes, Hedda, here I am, in mourning and forlorn; for now my poor sister
 has at last found peace.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I have heard the news already, as you see. Tesman sent me a card.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Yes, he promised me he would. But nevertheless I thought that to
 Hedda--here in the house of life--I ought myself to bring the tidings of
 death.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 That was very kind of you.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Ah, Rina ought not to have left us just now. This is not the time for
 Hedda's house to be a house of mourning.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Changing the subject.] She died quite peacefully, did she not, Miss
 Tesman?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Oh, her end was so calm, so beautiful. And then she had the unspeakable
 happiness of seeing George once more--and bidding him good-bye.--Has he
 not come home yet?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No. He wrote that he might be detained. But won't you sit down?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 No thank you, my dear, dear Hedda. I should like to, but I have so much
 to do. I must prepare my dear one for her rest as well as I can. She
 shall go to her grave looking her best.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Can I not help you in any way?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Oh, you must not think of it! Hedda Tesman must have no hand in such
 mournful work. Nor let her thought dwell on it either--not at this time.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 One is not always mistress of one's thoughts--
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 [Continuing.] Ah yes, it is the way of the world. At home we shall be
 sewing a shroud; and here there will soon be sewing too, I suppose--but
 of another sort, thank God!
 
 
   GEORGE TESMAN enters by the hall door.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Ah, you have come at last!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 You here, Aunt Julia? With Hedda? Fancy that!
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 I was just going, my dear boy. Well, have you done all you promised?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No; I'm really afraid I have forgotten half of it. I must come to you
 again to-morrow. To-day my brain is all in a whirl. I can't keep my
 thoughts together.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Why, my dear George, you mustn't take it in this way.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Mustn't--? How do you mean?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Even in your sorrow you must rejoice, as I do--rejoice that she is at
 rest.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh yes, yes--you are thinking of Aunt Rina.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 You will feel lonely now, Miss Tesman.
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Just at first, yes. But that will not last very long, I hope. I daresay
 I shall soon find an occupant for Rina's little room.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Indeed? Who do you think will take it? Eh?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Oh, there's always some poor invalid or other in want of nursing,
 unfortunately.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Would you really take such a burden upon you again?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 A burden! Heaven forgive you, child--it has been no burden to me.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 But suppose you had a total stranger on your hands--
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Oh, one soon makes friends with sick folk; and it's such an absolute
 necessity for me to have some one to live for. Well, heaven be praised,
 there may soon be something in this house, too, to keep an old aunt
 busy.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, don't trouble about anything here.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, just fancy what a nice time we three might have together, if--?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 If--?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Uneasily.] Oh nothing. It will all come right. Let us hope so--eh?
 
 
 MISS TESMAN.
 
 Well well, I daresay you two want to talk to each other. [Smiling.] And
 perhaps Hedda may have something to tell you too, George. Good-bye! I
 must go home to Rina. [Turning at the door.] How strange it is to think
 that now Rina is with me and with my poor brother as well!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, fancy that, Aunt Julia! Eh?
 
    [MISS TESMAN goes out by the hall door.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Follows TESMAN coldly and searchingly with her eyes.] I almost believe
 your Aunt Rina's death affects you more than it does your Aunt Julia.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh, it's not that alone. It's Eilert I am so terribly uneasy about.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Quickly.] Is there anything new about him?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 I looked in at his rooms this afternoon, intending to tell him the
 manuscript was in safe keeping.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well, did you find him?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No. He wasn't at home. But afterwards I met Mrs. Elvsted, and she told
 me that he had been here early this morning.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, directly after you had gone.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 And he said that he had torn his manuscript to pieces--eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, so he declared.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Why, good heavens, he must have been completely out of his mind! And I
 suppose you thought it best not to give it back to him, Hedda?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, he did not get it.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 But of course you told him that we had it?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No. [Quickly.] Did you tell Mrs. Elvsted?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No; I thought I had better not. But you ought to have told him. Fancy,
 if, in desperation, he should go and do himself some injury! Let me have
 the manuscript, Hedda! I will take it to him at once. Where is it?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Cold and immovable, leaning on the arm-chair.] I have not got it.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Have not got it? What in the world do you mean?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I have burnt it--every line of it.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [With a violent movement of terror.] Burnt! Burnt Eilert's manuscript!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Don't scream so. The servant might hear you.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Burnt! Why, good God--! No, no, no! It's impossible!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 It is so, nevertheless.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Do you know what you have done, Hedda? It's unlawful appropriation of
 lost property. Fancy that! Just ask Judge Brack, and he'll tell you what
 it is.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I advise you not to speak of it--either to Judge Brack or to anyone
 else.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 But how could you do anything so unheard-of? What put it into your head?
 What possessed you? Answer me that--eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Suppressing an almost imperceptible smile.] I did it for your sake,
 George.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 For my sake!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 This morning, when you told me about what he had read to you--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes yes--what then?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 You acknowledged that you envied him his work.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh, of course I didn't mean that literally.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No matter--I could not bear the idea that any one should throw you into
 the shade.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [In an outburst of mingled doubt and joy.] Hedda! Oh, is this true?
 But--but--I never knew you show your love like that before. Fancy that!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well, I may as well tell you that--just at this time-- [Impatiently
 breaking off.] No, no; you can ask Aunt Julia. She well tell you, fast
 enough.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh, I almost think I understand you, Hedda! [Clasps his hands together.]
 Great heavens! do you really mean it! Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Don't shout so. The servant might hear.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Laughing in irrepressible glee.] The servant! Why, how absurd you are,
 Hedda. It's only my old Berta! Why, I'll tell Berta myself.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Clenching her hands together in desperation.] Oh, it is killing me,
 --it is killing me, all this!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 What is, Hedda? Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Coldly, controlling herself.] All this--absurdity--George.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Absurdity! Do you see anything absurd in my being overjoyed at the news!
 But after all--perhaps I had better not say anything to Berta.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh--why not that too?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No, no, not yet! But I must certainly tell Aunt Julia. And then that you
 have begun to call me George too! Fancy that! Oh, Aunt Julia will be so
 happy--so happy!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 When she hears that I have burnt Eilert Lovborg's manuscript--for your
 sake?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No, by-the-bye--that affair of the manuscript--of course nobody must
 know about that. But that you love me so much,(13) Hedda--Aunt Julia
 must really share my joy in that! I wonder, now, whether this sort of
 thing is usual in young wives? Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I think you had better ask Aunt Julia that question too.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 I will indeed, some time or other. [Looks uneasy and downcast again.]
 And yet the manuscript--the manuscript! Good God! it is terrible to
 think what will become of poor Eilert now.
 
 
   MRS. ELVSTED, dressed as in the first Act, with hat and cloak,
   enters by the hall door.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Greets them hurriedly, and says in evident agitation.] Oh, dear Hedda,
 forgive my coming again.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 What is the matter with you, Thea?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Something about Eilert Lovborg again--eh?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes! I am dreadfully afraid some misfortune has happened to him.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Seized her arm.] Ah,--do you think so?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Why, good Lord--what makes you think that, Mrs. Elvsted?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 I heard them talking of him at my boarding-house--just as I came in. Oh,
 the most incredible rumours are afloat about him to-day.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, fancy, so I heard too! And I can bear witness that he went straight
 home to bed last night. Fancy that!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well, what did they say at the boarding-house?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, I couldn't make out anything clearly. Either they knew nothing
 definite, or else--. They stopped talking when the saw me; and I did
 not dare to ask.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Moving about uneasily.] We must hope--we must hope that you
 misunderstood them, Mrs. Elvsted.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 No, no; I am sure it was of him they were talking. And I heard something
 about the hospital or--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 The hospital?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No--surely that cannot be!
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, I was in such mortal terror! I went to his lodgings and asked for
 him there.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 You could make up your mind to that, Thea!
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 What else could I do? I really could bear the suspense no longer.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 But you didn't find him either--eh?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 No. And the people knew nothing about him. He hadn't been home since
 yesterday afternoon, they said.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yesterday! Fancy, how could they say that?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, I am sure something terrible must have happened to him.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Hedda dear--how would it be if I were to go and make inquiries--?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No, no--don't you mix yourself up in this affair.
 
 
   JUDGE BRACK, with his hat in his hand, enters by the hall
   door, which BERTA opens, and closes behind him.  He looks
   grave and bows in silence.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh, is that you, my dear Judge? Eh?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes. It was imperative I should see you this evening.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 I can see you have heard the news about Aunt Rina?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes, that among other things.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Isn't it sad--eh?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well, my dear Tesman, that depends on how you look at it.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Looks doubtfully at him.] Has anything else happened?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [In suspense.] Anything sad, Judge Brack?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 That, too, depends on how you look at it, Mrs. Tesman.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Unable to restrain her anxiety.] Oh! it is something about Eilert
 Lovborg!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [With a glance at her.] What makes you think that, Madam? Perhaps you
 have already heard something--?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [In confusion.] No, nothing at all, but--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh, for heaven's sake, tell us!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Shrugging his shoulders.] Well, I regret to say Eilert Lovborg has been
 taken to the hospital. He is lying at the point of death.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Shrieks.] Oh God! oh God--!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 To the hospital! And at the point of death!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Involuntarily.] So soon then--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Wailing.] And we parted in anger, Hedda!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Whispers.] Thea--Thea--be careful!
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Not heeding her.] I must go to him! I must see him alive!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 It is useless, Madam. No one will be admitted.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, at least tell me what has happened to him? What is it?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 You don't mean to say that he has himself-- Eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, I am sure he has.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Keeping his eyes fixed upon her.] Unfortunately you have guessed quite
 correctly, Mrs. Tesman.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, how horrible!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Himself, then! Fancy that!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Shot himself!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Rightly guessed again, Mrs. Tesman.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [With an effort at self-control.] When did it happen, Mr. Brack?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 This afternoon--between three and four.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 But, good Lord, where did he do it? Eh?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [With some hesitation.] Where? Well--I suppose at his lodgings.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 No, that cannot be; for I was there between six and seven.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well then, somewhere else. I don't know exactly. I only know that he was
 found--. He had shot himself--in the breast.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, how terrible! That he should die like that!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [To BRACK.] Was it in the breast?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes--as I told you.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Not in the temple?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 In the breast, Mrs. Tesman.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Well, well--the breast is a good place, too.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 How do you mean, Mrs. Tesman?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Evasively.] Oh, nothing--nothing.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 And the wound is dangerous, you say--eh?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Absolutely mortal. The end has probably come by this time.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, yes, I feel it. The end! The end! Oh, Hedda--!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 But tell me, how have you learnt all this?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Curtly.] Through one of the police. A man I had some business with.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [In a clear voice.] At last a deed worth doing!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Terrified.] Good heavens, Hedda! what are you saying?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I say there is beauty in this.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 H'm, Mrs. Tesman--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, Hedda, how can you talk of beauty in such an act!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Eilert Lovborg has himself made up his account with life. He has had the
 courage to do--the one right thing.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 No, you must never think that was how it happened! It must have been in
 delirium that he did it.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 In despair!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 That he did not. I am certain of that.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, yes! In delirium! Just as when he tore up our manuscript.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Starting.] The manuscript? Has he torn that up?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, last night.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Whispers softly.] Oh, Hedda, we shall never get over this.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 H'm, very extraordinary.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Moving about the room.] To think of Eilert going out of the world
 in this way! And not leaving behind him the book that would have
 immortalised his name--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, if only it could be put together again!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, if it only could! I don't know what I would not give--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Perhaps it can, Mr. Tesman.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 What do you mean?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Searches in the pocket of her dress.] Look here. I have kept all the
 loose notes he used to dictate from.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [A step forward.] Ah--!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 You have kept them, Mrs. Elvsted! Eh?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, I have them here. I put them in my pocket when I left home. Here
 they still are--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh, do let me see them!
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Hands him a bundle of papers.] But they are in such disorder--all mixed
 up.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Fancy, if we could make something out of them, after all! Perhaps if we
 two put our heads together--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh yes, at least let us try--
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 We will manage it! We must! I will dedicate my life to this task.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 You, George? Your life?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, or rather all the time I can spare. My own collections must wait in
 the meantime. Hedda--you understand, eh? I owe this to Eilert's memory.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Perhaps.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 And so, my dear Mrs. Elvsted, we will give our whole minds to it. There
 is no use in brooding over what can't be undone--eh? We must try to
 control our grief as much as possible, and--
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Yes, yes, Mr. Tesman, I will do the best I can.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Well then, come here. I can't rest until we have looked through the
 notes. Where shall we sit? Here? No, in there, in the back room. Excuse
 me, my dear Judge. Come with me, Mrs. Elvsted.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Oh, if only it were possible!
 
      [TESMAN and MRS. ELVSTED go into the back room.  She takes
        off her hat and cloak.  They both sit at the table under the
        hanging lamp, and are soon deep in an eager examination of
        the papers.  HEDDA crosses to the stove and sits in the arm-
        chair.  Presently BRACK goes up to her.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [In a low voice.] Oh, what a sense of freedom it gives one, this act of
 Eilert Lovborg's.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Freedom, Mrs. Hedda? Well, of course, it is a release for him--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I mean for me. It gives me a sense of freedom to know that a deed
 of deliberate courage is still possible in this world,--a deed of
 spontaneous beauty.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Smiling.] H'm--my dear Mrs. Hedda--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, I know what you are going to say. For you are a kind of specialist
 too, like--you know!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Looking hard at her.] Eilert Lovborg was more to you than perhaps you
 are willing to admit to yourself. Am I wrong?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I don't answer such questions. I only know that Eilert Lovborg has had
 the courage to live his life after his own fashion. And then--the last
 great act, with its beauty! Ah! that he should have the will and the
 strength to turn away from the banquet of life--so early.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 I am sorry, Mrs. Hedda,--but I fear I must dispel an amiable illusion.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Illusion?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Which could not have lasted long in any case.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 What do you mean?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Eilert Lovborg did not shoot himself--voluntarily.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Not voluntarily?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 No. The thing did not happen exactly as I told it.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [In suspense.] Have you concealed something? What is it?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 For poor Mrs. Elvsted's sake I idealised the facts a little.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 What are the facts?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 First, that he is already dead.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 At the hospital?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes--without regaining consciousness.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 What more have you concealed?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 This--the event did not happen at his lodgings.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, that can make no difference.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Perhaps it may. For I must tell you--Eilert Lovborg was found shot
 in--in Mademoiselle Diana's boudoir.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Makes a motion as if to rise, but sinks back again.] That is
 impossible, Judge Brack! He cannot have been there again to-day.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 He was there this afternoon. He went there, he said, to demand the
 return of something which they had taken from him. Talked wildly about a
 lost child--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Ah--so that is why--
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 I thought probably he meant his manuscript; but now I hear he destroyed
 that himself. So I suppose it must have been his pocket-book.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, no doubt. And there--there he was found?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes, there. With a pistol in his breast-pocket, discharged. The ball had
 lodged in a vital part.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 In the breast--yes?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 No--in the bowels.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looks up at him with an expression of loathing.] That too! Oh, what
 curse is it that makes everything I touch turn ludicrous and mean?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 There is one point more, Mrs. Hedda--another disagreeable feature in the
 affair.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 And what is that?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 The pistol he carried--
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Breathless.] Well? What of it?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 He must have stolen it.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Leaps up.] Stolen it! That is not true! He did not steal it!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 No other explanation is possible. He must have stolen it--. Hush!
 
 
   TESMAN and MRS. ELVSTED have risen from the table in the back-
   room, and come into the drawing-room.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [With the papers in both his hands.] Hedda, dear, it is almost
 impossible to see under that lamp. Think of that!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, I am thinking.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Would you mind our sitting at you writing-table--eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 If you like. [Quickly.] No, wait! Let me clear it first!
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Oh, you needn't trouble, Hedda. There is plenty of room.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No no, let me clear it, I say! I will take these things in and put them
 on the piano. There!
 
      [She has drawn out an object, covered with sheet music, from
        under the bookcase, places several other pieces of music upon
        it, and carries the whole into the inner room, to the left.
        TESMAN lays the scraps of paper on the writing-table, and moves
        the lamp there from the corner table.  He and Mrs. Elvsted sit
        down and proceed with their work.  HEDDA returns.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Behind Mrs. Elvsted's chair, gently ruffling her hair.] Well, my sweet
 Thea,--how goes it with Eilert Lovborg's monument?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Looks dispiritedly up at her.] Oh, it will be terribly hard to put in
 order.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 We must manage it. I am determined. And arranging other people's papers
 is just the work for me.
 
      [HEDDA goes over to the stove, and seats herself on one of the
        footstools.  BRACK stands over her, leaning on the arm-chair.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Whispers.] What did you say about the pistol?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Softly.] That he must have stolen it.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Why stolen it?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Because every other explanation ought to be impossible, Mrs. Hedda.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Indeed?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Glances at her.] Of course Eilert Lovborg was here this morning. Was he
 not?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Were you alone with him?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Part of the time.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Did you not leave the room whilst he was here?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Try to recollect. Were you not out of the room a moment?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Yes, perhaps just a moment--out in the hall.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 And where was you pistol-case during that time?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I had it locked up in--
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well, Mrs. Hedda?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 The case stood there on the writing-table.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Have you looked since, to see whether both the pistols are there?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 No.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well, you need not. I saw the pistol found in Lovborg's pocket, and I
 knew it at once as the one I had seen yesterday--and before, too.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Have you it with you?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 No; the police have it.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 What will the police do with it?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Search till they find the owner.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Do you think they will succeed?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Bends over her and whispers.] No, Hedda Gabler--not so long as I say
 nothing.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looks frightened at him.] And if you do not say nothing,--what then?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Shrugs his shoulders.] There is always the possibility that the pistol
 was stolen.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Firmly.] Death rather than that.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Smiling.] People say such things--but they don't do them.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Without replying.] And supposing the pistol was not stolen, and the
 owner is discovered? What then?
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well, Hedda--then comes the scandal!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 The scandal!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Yes, the scandal--of which you are so mortally afraid. You will, of
 course, be brought before the court--both you and Mademoiselle Diana.
 She will have to explain how the thing happened--whether it was an
 accidental shot or murder. Did the pistol go off as he was trying to
 take it out of his pocket, to threaten her with? Or did she tear the
 pistol out of his hand, shoot him, and push it back into his pocket?
 That would be quite like her; for she is an able-bodied young person,
 this same Mademoiselle Diana.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 But _I_ have nothing to do with all this repulsive business.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 No. But you will have to answer the question: Why did you give Eilert
 the pistol? And what conclusions will people draw from the fact that you
 did give it to him?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Lets her head sink.] That is true. I did not think of that.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 Well, fortunately, there is no danger, so long as I say nothing.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Looks up at him.] So I am in your power, Judge Brack. You have me at
 your beck and call, from this time forward.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Whispers softly.] Dearest Hedda--believe me--I shall not abuse my
 advantage.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 I am in your power none the less. Subject to your will and your demands.
 A slave, a slave then! [Rises impetuously.] No, I cannot endure the
 thought of that! Never!
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [Looks half-mockingly at her.] People generally get used to the
 inevitable.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Returns his look.] Yes, perhaps. [She crosses to the writing-table.
 Suppressing an involuntary smile, she imitates TESMAN'S intonations.]
 Well? Are you getting on, George? Eh?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Heaven knows, dear. In any case it will be the work of months.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [As before.] Fancy that! [Passes her hands softly through Mrs. Elvsted's
 hair.] Doesn't it seem strange to you, Thea? Here are you sitting with
 Tesman--just as you used to sit with Eilert Lovborg?
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 Ah, if I could only inspire your husband in the same way!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Oh, that will come too--in time.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, do you know, Hedda--I really think I begin to feel something of the
 sort. But won't you go and sit with Brack again?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Is there nothing I can do to help you two?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 No, nothing in the world. [Turning his head.] I trust to you to keep
 Hedda company, my dear Brack.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [With a glance at HEDDA.] With the very greatest of pleasure.
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 Thanks. But I am tired this evening. I will go in and lie down a little
 on the sofa.
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 Yes, do dear--eh?
 
      [HEDDA goes into the back room and draws the curtains.  A short
        pause.  Suddenly she is heard playing a wild dance on the piano.
 
 
 MRS. ELVSTED.
 
 [Starts from her chair.] Oh--what is that?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Runs to the doorway.] Why, my dearest Hedda--don't play dance-music
 to-night! Just think of Aunt Rina! And of Eilert too!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Puts her head out between the curtains.] And of Aunt Julia. And of all
 the rest of them.--After this, I will be quiet. [Closes the curtains
 again.]
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [At the writing-table.] It's not good for her to see us at this
 distressing work. I'll tell you what, Mrs. Elvsted,--you shall take the
 empty room at Aunt Julia's, and then I will come over in the evenings,
 and we can sit and work there--eh?
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [In the inner room.] I hear what you are saying, Tesman. But how am _I_
 to get through the evenings out here?
 
 
 TESMAN.
 
 [Turning over the papers.] Oh, I daresay Judge Brack will be so kind as
 to look in now and then, even though I am out.
 
 
 BRACK.
 
 [In the arm-chair, calls out gaily.] Every blessed evening, with all the
 pleasure in life, Mrs. Tesman! We shall get on capitally together, we
 two!
 
 
 HEDDA.
 
 [Speaking loud and clear.] Yes, don't you flatter yourself we will,
 Judge Brack? Now that you are the one cock in the basket--
 
      [A shot is heard within.  TESMAN, MRS. ELVSTED, and BRACK leap
        to their feet.

 WHEN WE DEAD AWAKEN
 
 By Henrik Ibsen.
 
 
 Introduction and translation by William Archer.
 
 
 
 
 INTRODUCTION.
 
 
 From _Pillars of Society_ to _John Gabriel Borkman_, Ibsen's plays had
 followed each other at regular intervals of two years, save when his
 indignation over the abuse heaped upon _Ghosts_ reduced to a single
 year the interval between that play and _An Enemy of the People_. _John
 Gabriel Borkman_ having appeared in 1896, its successor was expected in
 1898; but Christmas came and brought no rumour of a new play. In a
 man now over seventy, this breach of a long-established habit seemed
 ominous. The new National Theatre in Christiania was opened in September
 of the following year; and when I then met Ibsen (for the last time) he
 told me that he was actually at work on a new play, which he thought of
 calling a "Dramatic Epilogue." "He wrote _When We Dead Awaken_,"
 says Dr. Elias, "with such labour and such passionate agitation, so
 spasmodically and so feverishly, that those around him were almost
 alarmed. He must get on with it, he must get on! He seemed to hear
 the beating of dark pinions over his head. He seemed to feel the grim
 Visitant, who had accompanied Alfred Allmers on the mountain paths,
 already standing behind him with uplifted hand. His relatives are firmly
 convinced that he knew quite clearly that this would be his last play,
 that he was to write no more. And soon the blow fell."
 
 _When We Dead Awaken_ was published very shortly before Christmas 1899.
 He had still a year of comparative health before him. We find him in
 March 1900, writing to Count Prozor: "I cannot say yet whether or not
 I shall write another drama; but if I continue to retain the vigour of
 body and mind which I at present enjoy, I do not imagine that I shall be
 able to keep permanently away from the old battlefields. However, if I
 were to make my appearance again, it would be with new weapons and
 in new armour." Was he hinting at the desire, which he had long ago
 confessed to Professor Herford, that his last work should be a drama in
 verse? Whatever his dream, it was not to be realised. His last letter
 (defending his attitude of philosophic impartiality with regard to the
 South African war) is dated December 9, 1900. With the dawn of the new
 century, the curtain descended upon the mind of the great dramatic poet
 of the age which had passed away.
 
 _When We Dead Awaken_ was acted during 1900 at most of the leading
 theatres in Scandinavia and Germany. In some German cities (notably
 in Frankfort on Main) it even attained a considerable number of
 representatives. I cannot learn, however, that it has anywhere held the
 stage. It was produced in London, by the State Society, at the Imperial
 Theatre, on January 25 and 26, 1903. Mr. G. S. Titheradge played Rubek,
 Miss Henrietta Watson Irene, Miss Mabel Hackney Maia, and Mr. Laurence
 Irving Ulfheim. I find no record of any American performance.
 
 In the above-mentioned letter to Count Prozor, Ibsen confirmed that
 critic's conjecture that "the series which ends with the Epilogue really
 began with _The Master Builder_." As the last confession, so to speak,
 of a great artist, the Epilogue will always be read with interest. It
 contains, moreover, many flashes of the old genius, many strokes of the
 old incommunicable magic. One may say with perfect sincerity that there
 is more fascination in the dregs of Ibsen's mind than in the "first
 sprightly running" of more common-place talents. But to his sane
 admirers the interest of the play must always be melancholy, because it
 is purely pathological. To deny this is, in my opinion, to cast a slur
 over all the poet's previous work, and in great measure to justify the
 criticisms of his most violent detractors. For _When We Dead Awaken_ is
 very like the sort of play that haunted the "anti-Ibsenite" imagination
 in the year 1893 or thereabouts. It is a piece of self-caricature, a
 series of echoes from all the earlier plays, an exaggeration of manner
 to the pitch of mannerism. Moreover, in his treatment of his symbolic
 motives, Ibsen did exactly what he had hitherto, with perfect justice,
 plumed himself upon never doing: he sacrificed the surface reality
 to the underlying meaning. Take, for instance, the history of Rubek's
 statue and its development into a group. In actual sculpture this
 development is a grotesque impossibility. In conceiving it we are
 deserting the domain of reality, and plunging into some fourth dimension
 where the properties of matter are other than those we know. This is an
 abandonment of the fundamental principle which Ibsen over and over again
 emphatically expressed--namely, that any symbolism his work might be
 found to contain was entirely incidental, and subordinate to the truth
 and consistency of his picture of life. Even when he dallied with the
 supernatural, as in _The Master Builder_ and _Little Eyolf_, he was
 always careful, as I have tried to show, not to overstep decisively
 the boundaries of the natural. Here, on the other hand, without any
 suggestion of the supernatural, we are confronted with the wholly
 impossible, the inconceivable. How remote is this alike from his
 principles of art and from the consistent, unvarying practice of his
 better years! So great is the chasm between _John Gabriel Borkman_ and
 _When We Dead Awaken_ that one could almost suppose his mental breakdown
 to have preceded instead of followed the writing of the latter play.
 Certainly it is one of the premonitions of the coming end. It is Ibsen's
 _Count Robert of Paris_. To pretend to rank it with his masterpieces is
 to show a very imperfect sense of the nature of their mastery.
 
 
 
 
 
 WHEN WE DEAD AWAKEN.
 
 A DRAMATIC EPILOGUE.
 
 
 CHARACTERS.
 
 
       PROFESSOR ARNOLD RUBEK, a sculptor.
       MRS. MAIA RUBEK, his wife.
       THE INSPECTOR at the Baths.
       ULFHEIM, a landed proprietor.
       A STRANGER LADY.
       A SISTER OF MERCY.
 
       Servants, Visitors to the Baths, and Children.
 
 
 The First Act passes at a bathing establishment on the coast; the Second
 and Third Acts in the neighbourhood of a health resort, high in the
 mountains.
 
 
 
 
 ACT FIRST.
 
 
    [Outside the Bath Hotel. A portion of the main building can be seen
    to the right.
 
    An open, park-like place with a fountain, groups
    of fine old trees, and shrubbery.  To the left, a little pavilion
    almost covered with ivy and Virginia creeper.  A table and chair
    outside it.  At the back a view over the fjord, right out to sea,
    with headlands and small islands in the distance.  It is a calm,
    warm and sunny summer morning.
 
    [PROFESSOR RUBEK and MRS. MAIA RUBEK are sitting in basket chairs
    beside a covered table on the lawn outside the hotel, having just
    breakfasted.  They have champagne and seltzer water on the table,
    and each has a newspaper.  PROFESSOR RUBEK is an elderly man of
    distinguished appearance, wearing a black velvet jacket, and
    otherwise in light summer attire.  MAIA is quite young, with
    a vivacious expression and lively, mocking eyes, yet with a
    suggestion of fatigue.  She wears an elegant travelling dress.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Sits for some time as though waiting for the PROFESSOR to say
 something, then lets her paper drop with a deep sigh.] Oh dear, dear,
 dear--!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Looks up from his paper.] Well, Maia? What is the matter with you?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Just listen how silent it is here.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Smiles indulgently.] And you can hear that?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 What?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 The silence?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, indeed I can.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Well, perhaps you are right, _mein Kind_. One can really hear the
 silence.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Heaven knows you can--when it's so absolutely overpowering as it is
 here--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Here at the Baths, you mean?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Wherever you go at home here, it seems to me. Of course there was noise
 and bustle enough in the town. But I don't know how it is--even the
 noise and bustle seemed to have something dead about it.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [With a searching glance.] You don't seem particularly glad to be at
 home again, Maia?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Looks at him.] Are you glad?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Evasively.] I--?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, you, who have been so much, much further away than I. Are you
 entirely happy, now that you are at home again?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 No--to be quite candid--perhaps not entirely happy--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [With animation.] There, you see! Didn't I know it!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I have been too long abroad. I have drifted quite away from all
 this--this home life.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Eagerly, drawing her chair nearer him.] There, you see, Rubek! We had
 much better get away again! As quickly as ever we can.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Somewhat impatiently.] Well, well, that is what we intend to do, my
 dear Maia. You know that.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 But why not now--at once? Only think how cozy and comfortable we could
 be down there, in our lovely new house--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Smiles indulgently.] We ought by rights to say: our lovely new home.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Shortly.] I prefer to say house--let us keep to that.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [His eyes dwelling on her.] You are really a strange little person.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Am I so strange?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Yes, I think so.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 But why, pray? Perhaps because I'm not desperately in love with mooning
 about up here--?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Which of us was it that was absolutely bent on our coming north this
 summer?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 I admit, it was I.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 It was certainly not I, at any rate.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 But good heavens, who could have dreamt that everything would have
 altered so terribly at home here? And in so short a time, too! Why, it
 is only just four years since I went away--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Since you were married, yes.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Married? What has that to do with the matter?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Continuing.] --since you became the Frau Professor, and found yourself
 mistress of a charming home--I beg your pardon--a very handsome house, I
 ought to say. And a villa on the Lake of Taunitz, just at the point that
 has become most fashionable, too--. In fact it is all very handsome and
 distinguished, Maia, there's no denying that. And spacious too. We need
 not always be getting in each other's way--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Lightly.] No, no, no--there's certainly no lack of house-room, and that
 sort of thing--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Remember, too, that you have been living in altogether more spacious
 and distinguished surroundings--in more polished society than you were
 accustomed to at home.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Looking at him.] Ah, so you think it is _I_ that have changed?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Indeed I do, Maia.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 I alone? Not the people here?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Oh yes, they too--a little, perhaps. And not at all in the direction of
 amiability. That I readily admit.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 I should think you must admit it, indeed.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Changing the subject.] Do you know how it affects me when I look at the
 life of the people around us here?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 No. Tell me.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 It makes me think of that night we spent in the train, when we were
 coming up here--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Why, you were sound asleep all the time.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Not quite. I noticed how silent it became at all the little roadside
 stations. I heard the silence--like you, Maia--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 H'm,--like me, yes.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK. --and that assured me that we had crossed the
 frontier--that we were really at home. For the train stopped at all the
 little stations--although there was nothing doing at all.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Then why did it stop--though there was nothing to be done?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Can't say. No one got out or in; but all the same the train stopped a
 long, endless time. And at every station I could make out that there
 were two railway men walking up and down the platform--one with a
 lantern in his hand--and they said things to each other in the night,
 low, and toneless, and meaningless.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, that is quite true. There are always two men walking up and down,
 and talking--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK. --of nothing. [Changing to a livelier tone.] But just
 wait till to-morrow. Then we shall have the great luxurious steamer
 lying in the harbour. We'll go on board her, and sail all round the
 coast--northward ho!--right to the polar sea.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, but then you will see nothing of the country--and of the people.
 And that was what you particularly wanted.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Shortly and snappishly.] I have seen more than enough.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Do you think a sea voyage will be better for you?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 It is always a change.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Well, well, if only it is the right thing for you--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 For me? The right thing? There is nothing in the world the matter with
 me.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Rises and goes to him.] Yes, there is, Rubek. I am sure you must feel
 it yourself.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Why my dearest Maia--what should be amiss with me?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Behind him, bending over the back of his chair.] That you must tell me.
 You have begun to wander about without a moment's peace. You cannot rest
 anywhere--neither at home nor abroad. You have become quite misanthropic
 of late.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [With a touch of sarcasm.] Dear me--have you noticed that?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 No one that knows you can help noticing it. And then it seems to me so
 sad that you have lost all pleasure in your work.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 That too, eh?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 You that used to be so indefatigable--working from morning to night!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Gloomily.] Used to be, yes--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 But ever since you got your great masterpiece out of hand--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Nods thoughtfully.] "The Resurrection Day"--
 
 
 MAIA. --the masterpiece that has gone round the whole world, and made
 you so famous--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Perhaps that is just the misfortune, Maia.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 How so?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 When I had finished this masterpiece of mine--[Makes a passionate
 movement with his hand]--for "The Resurrection Day" is a masterpiece! Or
 was one in the beginning. No, it is one still. It must, must, must be a
 masterpiece!
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Looks at him in astonishment.] Why, Rubek--all the world knows that.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Short, repellently.] All the world knows nothing! Understands nothing!
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Well, at any rate it can divine something--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Something that isn't there at all, yes. Something that never was in my
 mind. Ah yes, that they can all go into ecstasies over! [Growling to
 himself.] What is the good of working oneself to death for the mob and
 the masses--for "all the world"!
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Do you think it is better, then--do you think it is worthy of you, to do
 nothing at all but portrait-bust now and then?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [With a sly smile.] They are not exactly portrait-busts that I turn out,
 Maia.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, indeed they are--for the last two or three years--ever since you
 finished your great group and got it out of the house--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 All the same, they are no mere portrait-busts, I assure you.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 What are they, then?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 There is something equivocal, something cryptic, lurking in and behind
 these busts--a secret something, that the people themselves cannot see--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Indeed?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Decisively.] I alone can see it. And it amuses me unspeakably.--On the
 surface I give them the "striking likeness," as they call it, that they
 all stand and gape at in astonishment--[Lowers his voice]--but at bottom
 they are all respectable, pompous horse-faces, and self-opinionated
 donkey-muzzles, and lop-eared, low-browed dog-skulls, and fatted
 swine-snouts--and sometimes dull, brutal bull-fronts as well--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Indifferently.] All the dear domestic animals, in fact.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Simply the dear domestic animals, Maia. All the animals which men have
 bedevilled in their own image--and which have bedevilled men in return.
 [Empties his champagne-glass and laughs.] And it is these double-faced
 works of art that our excellent plutocrats come and order of me. And
 pay for in all good faith--and in good round figures too--almost their
 weight in gold, as the saying goes.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Fills his glass.] Come, Rubek! Drink and be happy.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Passes his hand several times across his forehead and leans back in his
 chair.] I am happy, Maia. Really happy--in a way. [Short silence.]
 For after all there is a certain happiness in feeling oneself free and
 independent on every hand--in having at ones command everything one can
 possibly wish for--all outward things, that is to say. Do you not agree
 with me, Maia?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Oh yes, I agree. All that is well enough in its way. [Looking at
 him.] But do you remember what you promised me the day we came to an
 understanding on--on that troublesome point--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Nods.] --on the subject of our marriage, yes. It was no easy matter for
 you, Maia.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Continuing unruffled.] --and agreed that I was to go abroad with you,
 and live there for good and all--and enjoy myself.--Do you remember what
 you promised me that day?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Shaking his head.] No, I can't say that I do. Well, what did I promise?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 You said you would take me up to a high mountain and show me all the
 glory of the world.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [With a slight start.] Did I promise you that, too?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Me too? Who else, pray?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Indifferently.] No, no, I only meant did I promise to show you--?
 
 
 MAIA. --all the glory of the world? Yes, you did. And all that glory
 should be mine, you said.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 That is sort of figure of speech that I was in the habit of using once
 upon a time.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Only a figure of speech?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Yes, a schoolboy phrase--the sort of thing I used to say when I wanted
 to lure the neighbours' children out to play with me, in the woods and
 on the mountains.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Looking hard at him.] Perhaps you only wanted to lure me out to play,
 as well?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Passing it off as a jest.] Well, has it not been a tolerable amusing
 game, Maia?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Coldly.] I did not go with you only to play.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 No, no, I daresay not.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 And you never took me up with you to any high mountain, or showed me--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [With irritation.] --all the glory of the world? No, I did not. For, let
 me tell you something: you are not really born to be a mountain-climber,
 little Maia.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Trying to control herself.] Yet at one time you seemed to think I was.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Four or five years ago, yes. [Stretching himself in his chair.] Four or
 five years--it's a long, long time, Maia.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Looking at him with a bitter expression.] Has the time seemed so very
 long to you, Rubek?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I am beginning now to find it a trifle long. [Yawning.] Now and then,
 you know.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Returning to her place.] I shall not bore you any longer.
 
       [She resumes her seat, takes up the newspaper, and begins turning
        over the leaves.  Silence on both sides.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Leaning on his elbows across the table, and looking at her teasingly.]
 Is the Frau Professor offended?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Coldly, without looking up.] No, not at all.
 
     [Visitors to the baths, most of them ladies, begin to pass,
        singly and in groups, through the park from the right, and
        out to the left.
 
     [Waiters bring refreshments from the hotel, and go off behind
        the pavilion.
 
     [The INSPECTOR, wearing gloves and carrying a stick, comes from
        his rounds in the park, meets visitors, bows politely, and
        exchanges a few words with some of them.
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 [Advancing to PROFESSOR RUBEK's table and politely taking off his hat.]
 I have the honour to wish you good morning, Mrs. Rubek.--Good morning,
 Professor Rubek.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Good morning, good morning Inspector.
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 [Addressing himself to MRS. RUBEK.] May I venture to ask if you have
 slept well?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, thank you; excellently--for my part. I always sleep like a stone.
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 I am delighted to hear it. The first night in a strange place is often
 rather trying.--And the Professor--?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Oh, my night's rest is never much to boast of--especially of late.
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 [With a show of sympathy.] Oh--that is a pity. But after a few weeks'
 stay at the Baths--you will quite get over that.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Looking up at him.] Tell me, Inspector--are any of your patients in the
 habit of taking baths during the night?
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 [Astonished.] During the night? No, I have never heard of such a thing.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Have you not?
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 No, I don't know of any one so ill as to require such treatment.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Well, at any rate there is some one who is in the habit of walking about
 the park by night?
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 [Smiling and shaking his head.] No, Professor--that would be against the
 rules.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Impatiently.] Good Heavens, Rubek, I told you so this morning--you must
 have dreamt it.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Drily.] Indeed? Must I? Thank you! [Turning to the INSPECTOR.] The fact
 is, I got up last night--I couldn't sleep--and I wanted to see what sort
 of night it was--
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 [Attentively.] To be sure--and then--?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I looked out at the window--and caught sight of a white figure in there
 among the trees.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Smiling to the INSPECTOR.] And the Professor declares that the figure
 was dressed in a bathing costume--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK. --or something like it, I said. Couldn't distinguish
 very clearly. But I am sure it was something white.
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 Most remarkable. Was it a gentleman or a lady?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I could almost have sworn it was a lady. But then after it came another
 figure. And that one was quite dark--like a shadow--.
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 [Starting.] A dark one? Quite black, perhaps?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Yes, I should almost have said so.
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 [A light breaking in upon him.] And behind the white figure? Following
 close upon her--?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Yes--at a little distance--
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 Aha! Then I think I can explain the mystery, Professor.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Well, what was it then?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Simultaneously.] Was the professor really not dreaming?
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 [Suddenly whispering, as he directs their attention towards the
 background on the right.] Hush, if you please! Look there--don't speak
 loud for a moment.
 
     [A slender lady, dressed in fine, cream-white cashmere, and
        followed by a SISTER OF MERCY in black, with a silver cross
        hanging by a chain on her breast, comes forward from behind
        the hotel and crosses the park towards the pavilion in front
        on the left.  Her face is pale, and its lines seem to have
        stiffened; the eyelids are drooped and the eyes appear as
        though they saw nothing.  Her dress comes down to her feet
        and clings to the body in perpendicular folds.  Over her head,
        neck, breast, shoulders and arms she wears a large shawl of
        white crape.  She keeps her arms crossed upon her breast.
        She carries her body immovably, and her steps are stiff and
        measured.  The SISTER's bearing is also measured, and she has
        the air of a servant.  She keeps her brown piercing eyes
        incessantly fixed upon the lady.  WAITERS, with napkins on
        their arms, come forward in the hotel doorway, and cast
        curious glances at the strangers, who take no notice of
        anything, and, without looking round, enter the pavilion.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Has risen slowly and involuntarily, and stands staring at the closed
 door of the pavilion.] Who was that lady?
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 She is a stranger who has rented the little pavilion there.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 A foreigner?
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 Presumably. At any rate they both came from abroad--about a week ago.
 They have never been here before.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Decidedly; looking at him.] It was she I saw in the park last night.
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 No doubt it must have been. I thought so from the first.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 What is this lady's name, Inspector?
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 She has registered herself as "Madame de Satow, with companion." We know
 nothing more.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Reflecting.] Satow? Satow--?
 
 
 MAIA. [Laughing mockingly.] Do you know any one of that name, Rubek? Eh?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Shaking his head.] No, no one.--Satow? It sounds Russian--or in all
 events Slavonic. [To the INSPECTOR.] What language does she speak?
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 When the two ladies talk to each other, it is in a language I cannot
 make out at all. But at other times she speaks Norwegian like a native.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Exclaims with a start.] Norwegian? You are sure you are not mistaken?
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 No, how could I be mistaken in that?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Looks at him with eager interest.] You have heard her yourself?
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 Yes. I myself have spoken to her--several times.--Only a few words,
 however; she is far from communicative. But--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 But Norwegian it was?
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 Thoroughly good Norwegian--perhaps with a little north-country accent.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Gazing straight before him in amazement, whispers.] That too?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [A little hurt and jarred.] Perhaps this lady has been one of your
 models, Rubek? Search your memory.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Looks cuttingly at her.] My models?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [With a provoking smile.] In your younger days, I mean. You are said to
 have had innumerable models--long ago, of course.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [In the same tone.] Oh no, little Frau Maia. I have in reality had only
 one single model. One and only one--for everything I have done.
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 [Who has turned away and stands looking out to the left.] If you'll
 excuse me, I think I will take my leave. I see some one coming whom it
 is not particularly agreeable to meet. Especially in the presence of
 ladies.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Looking in the same direction.] That sportsman there? Who is it?
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 It is a certain Mr. Ulfheim, from--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Oh, Mr. Ulfheim--
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR. --the bear-killer, as they call him--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I know him.
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 Who does not know him?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Very slightly, however. Is he on your list of patients--at last?
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 No, strangely enough--not as yet. He comes here only once a year--on his
 way up to his hunting-grounds.--Excuse me for the moment--
 
     [Makes a movement to go into the hotel.
 
 
 ULFHEIM's VOICE.
 
 [Heard outside.] Stop a moment, man! Devil take it all, can't you stop?
 Why do you always scuttle away from me?
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 [Stops.] I am not scuttling at all, Mr. Ulfheim.
 
     [ULFHEIM enters from the left followed by a servant with a
        couple of sporting dogs in leash.  ULFHEIM is in shooting
        costume, with high boots and a felt hat with a feather in
        it.  He is a long, lank, sinewy personage, with matted hair
        and beard, and a loud voice.  His appearance gives no precise
        clue to his age, but he is no longer young.]
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Pounces upon the INSPECTOR.] Is this a way to receive strangers, hey?
 You scamper away with your tail between your legs--as if you had the
 devil at your heels.
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 [Calmly, without answering him.] Has Mr. Ulfheim arrived by the steamer?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Growls.] Haven't had the honour of seeing any steamer. [With his arms
 akimbo.] Don't you know that I sail my own cutter? [To the SERVANT.]
 Look well after your fellow-creatures, Lars. But take care you keep them
 ravenous, all the same. Fresh meat-bones--but not too much meat on them,
 do you hear? And be sure it's reeking raw, and bloody. And get something
 in your own belly while you're about it. [Aiming a kick at him.] Now
 then, go to hell with you!
 
     [The SERVANT goes out with the dogs, behind the corner of the
        hotel.]
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 Would not Mr. Ulfheim like to go into the dining-room in the meantime?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 In among all the half-dead flies and people? No, thank you a thousand
 times, Mr. Inspector.
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 Well, well, as you please.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 But get the housekeeper to prepare a hamper for me as usual. There must
 be plenty of provender in it--and lots of brandy--! You can tell her
 that I or Lars will come and play Old Harry with her if she doesn't--
 
 
 THE INSPECTOR.
 
 [Interrupting.] We know your ways of old. [Turning.] Can I give the
 waiter any orders, Professor? Can I send Mrs. Rubek anything?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 No thank you; nothing for me.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Nor for me.
 
     [The INSPECTOR goes into the hotel.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Stares at them for a moment; then lifts his hat.] Why, blast me if here
 isn't a country tyke that has strayed into regular tip-top society.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Looking up.] What do you mean by that, Mr. Ulfheim?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 
 [More quietly and politely.] I believe I have the honour of addressing
 no less a person than the great Sculptor Rubek.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Nods.] I remember meeting you once or twice--the autumn when I was last
 at home.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 That's many years ago, now. And then you weren't so illustrious as I
 hear you've since become. At that time even a dirty bear-hunter might
 venture to come near you.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Smiling.] I don't bite even now.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Looks with interest at ULFHEIM.] Are you really and truly a
 bear-hunter?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Seating himself at the next table, nearer the hotel.] A bear-hunter
 when I have the chance, madam. But I make the best of any sort of game
 that comes in my way--eagles, and wolves, and women, and elks, and
 reindeer--if only it's fresh and juicy and has plenty of blood in it.
 
     [Drinks from his pocket-flask.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Regarding him fixedly.] But you like bear-hunting best?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 I like it best, yes. For then one can have the knife handy at a pinch.
 [With a slight smile.] We both work in a hard material, madam--both your
 husband and I. He struggles with his marble blocks, I daresay; and I
 struggle with tense and quivering bear-sinews. And we both of us win
 the fight in the end--subdue and master our material. We never rest till
 we've got the upper hand of it, though it fight never so hard.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Deep in thought.] There's a great deal of truth in what you say.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Yes, for I take it the stone has something to fight for too. It is dead,
 and determined by no manner of means to let itself be hammered into
 life. Just like the bear when you come and prod him up in his lair.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Are you going up into the forests now to hunt?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 I am going right up into the high mountain.--I suppose you have never
 been in the high mountain, madam?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 No, never.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Confound it all then, you must be sure and come up there this very
 summer! I'll take you with me--both you and the Professor, with
 pleasure.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Thanks. But Rubek is thinking of taking a sea trip this summer.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Round the coast--through the island channels.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Ugh--what the devil would you do in those damnable sickly
 gutters--floundering about in the brackish ditchwater? Dishwater I
 should rather call it.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 There, you hear, Rubek!
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 No, much better come up with me to the mountain--away, clean away, from
 the trail and taint of men. You cant' think what that means for me. But
 such a little lady--
 
     [He stops.
 
     [The SISTER OF MERCY comes out of the pavilion and goes into
        the hotel.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Following her with his eyes.] Just look at her, do! That night-crow
 there!--Who is it that's to be buried?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I have not heard of any one--
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Well, there's some one on the point of giving up the ghost, then--in on
 corner or another.--People that are sickly and rickety should have the
 goodness to see about getting themselves buried--the sooner the better.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Have you ever been ill yourself, Mr. Ulfheim.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Never. If I had, I shouldn't be here.--But my nearest friends--they have
 been ill, poor things.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 And what did you do for your nearest friends?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Shot them, of course.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Looking at him.] Shot them?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Moving her chair back.] Shot them dead?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Nods.] I never miss, madam.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 But how can you possibly shoot people!
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 I am not speaking of people--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 You said your nearest friends--
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Well, who should they be but my dogs?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Are your dogs your nearest friends?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 I have none nearer. My honest, trusty, absolutely loyal comrades--. When
 one of them turns sick and miserable--bang!--and there's my friend sent
 packing--to the other world.
 
     [The SISTER OF MERCY comes out of the hotel with a tray on which
        is bread and milk.  She places it on the table outside the
        pavilion, which she enters.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Laughs scornfully.] That stuff there--is that what you call food for
 human beings! Milk and water and soft, clammy bread. Ah, you should see
 my comrades feeding. Should you like to see it?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Smiling across to the PROFESSOR and rising.] Yes, very much.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Also rising.] Spoken like a woman of spirit, madam! Come with me, then!
 They swallow whole great thumping meat-bones--gulp them up and then gulp
 them down again. Oh, it's a regular treat to see them. Come along and
 I'll show you--and while we're about it, we can talk over this trip to
 the mountains--
 
     [He goes out by the corner of the hotel, MAIA following him.
 
     [Almost at the same moment the STRANGE LADY comes out of the
        pavilion and seats herself at the table.
 
     [The LADY raises her glass of milk and is about to drink, but
        stops and looks across at RUBEK with vacant, expressionless
        eyes.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Remains sitting at his table and gazes fixedly and earnestly at her.
 At last he rises, goes some steps towards her, stops, and says in a low
 voice.] I know you quite well, Irene.
 
 
 THE LADY.
 
 [In a toneless voice, setting down her glass.] You can guess who I am,
 Arnold?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Without answering.] And you recognise me, too, I see.
 
 
 THE LADY.
 
 With you it is quite another matter.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 With me?--How so?
 
 
 THE LADY.
 
 Oh, you are still alive.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Not understanding.] Alive--?
 
 
 THE LADY.
 
 [After a short pause.] Who was the other? The woman you had with
 you--there at the table?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [A little reluctantly.] She? That was my--my wife.
 
 
 THE LADY.
 
 [Nods slowly.] Indeed. That is well, Arnold. Some one, then, who does
 not concern me--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Nods.] No, of course not--
 
 
 THE LADY. --one whom you have taken to you after my lifetime.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Suddenly looking hard at her.] After your--? What do you mean by that,
 Irene?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Without answering.] And the child? I hear the child is prospering too.
 Our child survives me--and has come to honour and glory.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Smiles as at a far-off recollection.] Our child? Yes, we called it
 so--then.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 In my lifetime, yes.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Trying to take a lighter tone.] Yes, Irene.--I can assure you "our
 child" has become famous all the wide world over. I suppose you have
 read about it.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Nods.] And has made its father famous too.--That was your dream.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [More softly, with emotion.] It is to you I owe everything, everything,
 Irene--and I thank you.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Lost in thought for a moment.] If I had then done what I had a right to
 do, Arnold--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Well? What then?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 I should have killed that child.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Killed it, you say?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Whispering.] Killed it--before I went away from you. Crushed
 it--crushed it to dust.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Shakes his head reproachfully.] You would never have been able to,
 Irene. You had not the heart to do it.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 No, in those days I had not that sort of heart.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 But since then? Afterwards?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Since then I have killed it innumerable times. By daylight and in the
 dark. Killed it in hatred--and in revenge--and in anguish.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Goes close up to the table and asks softly.] Irene--tell me now
 at last--after all these years--why did you go away from me? You
 disappeared so utterly--left not a trace behind--
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Shaking her head slowly.] Oh Arnold--why should I tell you that
 now--from the world beyond the grave.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Was there some one else whom you had come to love?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 There was one who had no longer any use for my love--any use for my
 life.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Changing the subject.] H'm--don't let us talk any more of the past--
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 No, no--by all means let us not talk of what is beyond the grave--what
 is now beyond the grave for me.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Where have you been, Irene? All my inquiries were fruitless--you seemed
 to have vanished away.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 I went into the darkness--when the child stood transfigured in the
 light.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Have you travelled much about the world?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Yes. Travelled in many lands.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Looks compassionately at her.] And what have you found to do, Irene?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Turning her eyes upon him.] Wait a moment; let me see--. Yes, now I
 have it. I have posed on the turntable in variety-shows. Posed as a
 naked statue in living pictures. Raked in heaps of money. That was more
 than I could do with you; for you had none.--And then I turned the
 heads of all sorts of men. That too, was more than I could do with you,
 Arnold. You kept yourself better in hand.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Hastening to pass the subject by.] And then you have married, too?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Yes; I married one of them.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Who is your husband?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 He was a South American. A distinguished diplomatist. [Looks straight
 in front of her with a stony smile.] Him I managed to drive quite out of
 his mind; mad--incurably mad; inexorably mad.--It was great sport, I can
 tell you--while it was in the doing. I could have laughed within me all
 the time--if I had anything within me.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 And where is he now?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Oh, in a churchyard somewhere or other. With a fine handsome monument
 over him. And with a bullet rattling in his skull.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Did he kill himself?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Yes, he was good enough to take that off my hands.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Do you not lament his loss, Irene?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Not understanding.] Lament? What loss?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Why, the loss of Herr von Satow, of course.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 His name was not Satow.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Was it not?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 My second husband is called Satow. He is a Russian--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 And where is he?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Far away in the Ural Mountains. Among all his gold-mines.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 So he lives there?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Shrugs her shoulders.] Lives? Lives? In reality I have killed him--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Start.] Killed--!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Killed him with a fine sharp dagger which I always have with me in bed--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Vehemently.] I don't believe you, Irene!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [With a gentle smile.] Indeed you may believe it, Arnold.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Looks compassionately at her.] Have you never had a child?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Yes, I have had many children.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 And where are your children now?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 I killed them.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Severely.] Now you are telling me lies again!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 I have killed them, I tell you--murdered them pitilessly. As soon as
 ever they came into the world. Oh, long, long before. One after the
 other.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Sadly and earnestly.] There is something hidden behind everything you
 say.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 How can I help that? Every word I say is whispered into my ear.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I believe I am the only one that can divine your meaning.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Surely you ought to be the only one.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Rests his hands on the table and looks intently at her.] Some of the
 strings of your nature have broken.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Gently.] Does not that always happen when a young warm-blooded woman
 dies?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Oh Irene, have done with these wild imaginings--! You are living!
 Living--living!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Rises slowly from her chair and says, quivering.] I was dead for many
 years. They came and bound me--laced my arms together behind my back--.
 Then they lowered me into a grave-vault, with iron bars before the
 loop-hole. And with padded walls--so that no one on the earth above
 could hear the grave-shrieks--. But now I am beginning, in a way, to
 rise from the dead.
 
     [She seats herself again.]
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [After a pause.] In all this, do you hold me guilty?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Yes.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Guilty of that--your death, as you call it.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Guilty of the fact that I had to die. [Changing her tone to one of
 indifference.] Why don't you sit down, Arnold?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 May I?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Yes.--You need not be afraid of being frozen. I don't think I am quite
 turned to ice yet.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Moves a chair and seats himself at her table.] There, Irene. Now we two
 are sitting together as in the old days.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 A little way apart from each other--also as in the old days.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Moving nearer.] It had to be so, then.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Had it?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Decisively.] There had to be a distance between us--
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Was it absolutely necessary, Arnold?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Continuing.] Do you remember what you answered when I asked if you
 would go with me out into the wide world?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 I held up three fingers in the air and swore that I would go with you
 to the world's end and to the end of life. And that I would serve you in
 all things--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 As the model for my art--
 
 
 IRENE. --in frank, utter nakedness--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [With emotion.] And you did serve me, Irene--so bravely--so gladly and
 ungrudgingly.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Yes, with all the pulsing blood of my youth, I served you!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Nodding, with a look of gratitude.] That you have every right to say.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 I fell down at your feet and served you, Arnold! [Holding her clenched
 hand towards him.] But you, you,--you--!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Defensively.] I never did you any wrong! Never, Irene!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Yes, you did! You did wrong to my innermost, inborn nature--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Starting back.] I--!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Yes, you! I exposed myself wholly and unreservedly to your gaze--[More
 softly.] And never once did you touch me.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Irene, did you not understand that many a time I was almost beside
 myself under the spell of all your loveliness?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Continuing undisturbed.] And yet--if you had touched me, I think I
 should have killed you on the spot. For I had a sharp needle always upon
 me--hidden in my hair-- [Strokes her forehead meditatively.] But after
 all--after all--that you could--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Looks impressively at her.] I was an artist, Irene.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Darkly.] That is just it. That is just it.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 An artist first of all. And I was sick with the desire to achieve the
 great work of my life. [Losing himself in recollection.] It was to be
 called "The Resurrection Day"--figured in the likeness of a young woman,
 awakening from the sleep of death--
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Our child, yes--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Continuing.] It was to be the awakening of the noblest, purest, most
 ideal woman the world ever saw. Then I found you. You were what I
 required in every respect. And you consented so willingly--so gladly.
 You renounced home and kindred--and went with me.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 To go with you meant for me the resurrection of my childhood.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 That was just why I found in you all that I required--in you and in no
 one else. I came to look on you as a thing hallowed, not to be touched
 save in adoring thoughts. In those days I was still young, Irene. And
 the superstition took hold of me that if I touched you, if I desired you
 with my senses, my soul would be profaned, so that I should be unable
 to accomplish what I was striving for.--And I still think there was some
 truth in that.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Nods with a touch of scorn.] The work of art first--then the human
 being.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 You must judge me as you will; but at that time I was utterly dominated
 by my great task--and exultantly happy in it.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 And you achieved your great task, Arnold.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Thanks and praise be to you, I achieved my great task. I wanted to
 embody the pure woman as I saw her awakening on the Resurrection Day.
 Not marvelling at anything new and unknown and undivined; but filled
 with a sacred joy at finding herself unchanged--she, the woman of
 earth--in the higher, freer, happier region--after the long, dreamless
 sleep of death. [More softly.] Thus did I fashion her.--I fashioned her
 in your image, Irene.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Laying her hands flat upon the table and leaning against the back of
 her chair.] And then you were done with me--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Reproachfully.] Irene!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 You had no longer any use for me--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 How can you say that!
 
 
 IRENE. --and began to look about you for other ideals--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I found none, none after you.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 And no other models, Arnold?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 You were no model to me. You were the fountainhead of my achievement.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Is silent for a short time.] What poems have you made since? In marble
 I mean. Since the day I left you.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I have made no poems since that day--only frittered away my life in
 modelling.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 And that woman, whom you are now living with--?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Interrupting vehemently.] Do not speak of her now! It makes me tingle
 with shame.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Where are you thinking of going with her?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Slack and weary.] Oh, on a tedious coasting-voyage to the North, I
 suppose.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Looks at him, smiles almost imperceptibly, and whispers.] You should
 rather go high up into the mountains. As high as ever you can. Higher,
 higher,--always higher, Arnold.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [With eager expectation.] Are you going up there?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Have you the courage to meet me once again?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Struggling with himself, uncertainly.] If we could--oh, if only we
 could--!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Why can we not do what we will? [Looks at him and whispers beseechingly
 with folded hands.] Come, come, Arnold! Oh, come up to me--!
 
     [MAIA enters, glowing with pleasure, from behind the hotel,
        and goes quickly up to the table where they were previously
        sitting.]
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Still at the corner of the hotel, without looking around.] Oh, you
 may say what you please, Rubek, but--[Stops, as she catches sight of
 IRENE]--Oh, I beg your pardon--I see you have made an acquaintance.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Curtly.] Renewed an acquaintance. [Rises.] What was it you wanted with
 me?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 I only wanted to say this: you may do whatever you please, but _I_ am
 not going with you on that disgusting steamboat.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Why not?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Because I want to go up on the mountains and into the forests--that's
 what I want. [Coaxingly.] Oh, you must let me do it, Rubek.--I shall be
 so good, so good afterwards!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Who is it that has put these ideas into your head?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Why he--that horrid bear-killer. Oh you cannot conceive all the
 marvelous things he has to tell about the mountains. And about life up
 there! They're ugly, horrid, repulsive, most of the yarns he spins--for
 I almost believe he's lying--but wonderfully alluring all the same. Oh,
 won't you let me go with him? Only to see if what he says is true, you
 understand. May I, Rubek?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Yes, I have not the slightest objection. Off you go to the mountains--as
 far and as long as you please. I shall perhaps be going the same way
 myself.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Quickly.] No, no, no, you needn't do that! Not on my account!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I want to go to the mountains. I have made up my mind to go.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Oh thanks, thanks! May I tell the bear-killer at once?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Tell the bear-killer whatever you please.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Oh thanks, thanks, thanks! [Is about to take his hand; he repels the
 movement.] Oh, how dear and good you are to-day, Rubek!
 
     [She runs into the hotel.
 
     [At the same time the door of the pavilion is softly and
        noiselessly set ajar.  The SISTER OF MERCY stands in the
        opening, intently on the watch.  No one sees her.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Decidedly, turning to IRENE.] Shall we meet up there then?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Rising slowly.] Yes, we shall certainly meet.--I have sought for you so
 long.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 When did you begin to seek for me, Irene?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [With a touch of jesting bitterness.] From the moment I realised that I
 had given away to you something rather indispensable, Arnold. Something
 one ought never to part with.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Bowing his head.] Yes, that is bitterly true. You gave me three or four
 years of your youth.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 More, more than that I gave you--spend-thrift as I then was.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Yes, you were prodigal, Irene. You gave me all your naked loveliness--
 
 
 IRENE. --to gaze upon--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK. --and to glorify--
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Yes, for your own glorification.--And the child's.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 And yours too, Irene.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 But you have forgotten the most precious gift.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 The most precious--? What gift was that?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 I gave you my young, living soul. And that gift left me empty
 within--soulless. [Looking at him with a fixed stare.] It was that I
 died of, Arnold.
 
     [The SISTER OF MERCY opens the door wide and makes room for her.
        She goes into the pavilion.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Stands and looks after her; then whispers.] Irene!
 
 
 
 
 ACT SECOND.
 
 
 [Near a mountain resort. The landscape stretches, in the form of
    an immense treeless upland, towards a long mountain lake.  Beyond
    the lake rises a range of peaks with blue-white snow in the clefts.
    In the foreground on the left a purling brook falls in severed
    streamlets down a steep wall of rock, and thence flows smoothly
    over the upland until it disappears to the right.  Dwarf trees,
    plants, and stones along the course of the brook.  In the
    foreground on the right a hillock, with a stone bench on the
    top of it.  It is a summer afternoon, towards sunset.
 
 [At some distance over the upland, on the other side of the brook,
    a troop of children is singing, dancing, and playing.  Some are
    dressed in peasant costume, others in town-made clothes.  Their
    happy laughter is heard, softened by distance, during the
    following.
 
 [PROFESSOR RUBEK is sitting on the bench, with a plaid over his
    shoulders, and looking down at the children's play.
 
 [Presently, MAIA comes forward from among some bushes on the upland
    to the left, well back, and scans the prospect with her hand
    shading her eyes.  She wears a flat tourist cap, a short skirt,
    kilted up, reaching only midway between ankle and knee, and high,
    stout lace-boots.  She has in her hand a long alpenstock.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [At last catches sight of RUBEK and calls.] Hallo!
 
     [She advances over the upland, jumps over the brook, with the
        aid of her alpenstock, and climbs up the hillock.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Panting.] Oh, how I have been rushing around looking for you, Rubek.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Nods indifferently and asks.] Have you just come from the hotel?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, that was the last place I tried--that fly-trap.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Looking at her for moment.] I noticed that you were not at the
 dinner-table.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 No, we had our dinner in the open air, we two.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 "We two"? What two?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Why, I and that horrid bear-killer, of course.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Oh, he.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes. And first thing to-morrow morning we are going off again.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 After bears?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes. Off to kill a brown-boy.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Have you found the tracks of any?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [With superiority.] You don't suppose that bears are to be found in the
 naked mountains, do you?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Where, then?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Far beneath. On the lower slopes; in the thickest parts of the forest.
 Places your ordinary town-folk could never get through--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 And you two are going down there to-morrow?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Throwing herself down among the heather.] Yes, so we have arranged.--Or
 perhaps we may start this evening.--If you have no objection, that's to
 say?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I? Far be it from me to--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Quickly.] Of course Lars goes with us--with the dogs.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I feel no curiosity as to the movements of Mr. Lars and his dogs.
 [Changing the subject.] Would you not rather sit properly on the seat?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Drowsily.] No, thank you. I'm lying so delightfully in the soft
 heather.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I can see that you are tired.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Yawning.] I almost think I'm beginning to feel tired.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 You don't notice it till afterwards--when the excitement is over--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [In a drowsy tone.] Just so. I will lie and close my eyes.
 
     [A short pause.
 
 MAIA.
 
 [With sudden impatience.] Ugh, Rubek--how can you endure to sit there
 listening to these children's screams! And to watch all the capers they
 are cutting, too!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 There is something harmonious--almost like music--in their movements,
 now and then; amid all the clumsiness. And it amuses me to sit and watch
 for these isolated moments--when they come.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [With a somewhat scornful laugh.] Yes, you are always, always an artist.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 And I propose to remain one.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Lying on her side, so that her back is turned to him.] There's not a
 bit of the artist about him.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [With attention.] Who is it that's not an artist?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Again in a sleepy tone.] Why, he--the other one, of course.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 The bear-hunter, you mean?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes. There's not a bit of the artist about him--not the least little
 bit.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Smiling.] No, I believe there's no doubt about that.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Vehemently, without moving.] And so ugly as he is! [Plucks up a tuft of
 heather and throws it away.] So ugly, so ugly! Isch!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Is that why you are so ready to set off with him--out into the wilds?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Curtly.] I don't know. [Turning towards him.] You are ugly, too, Rubek.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Have you only just discovered it?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 No, I have seen it for long.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Shrugging his shoulders.] One doesn't grow younger. One doesn't grow
 younger, Frau Maia.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 It's not that sort of ugliness that I mean at all. But there has come to
 be such an expression of fatigue, of utter weariness, in your eyes--when
 you deign, once in a while, to cast a glance at me.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Have you noticed that?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Nods.] Little by little this evil look has come into your eyes. It
 seems almost as though you were nursing some dark plot against me.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Indeed? [In a friendly but earnest tone.] Come here and sit beside me,
 Maia; and let us talk a little.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Half rising.] Then will you let me sit upon your knee? As I used to in
 the early days?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 No, you mustn't--people can see us from the hotel. [Moves a little.] But
 you can sit here on the bench--at my side.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 No, thank you; in that case I'd rather lie here, where I am. I can hear
 you quite well here. [Looks inquiringly at him.] Well, what is it you
 want to say to me?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Begins slowly.] What do you think was my real reason for agreeing to
 make this tour?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Well--I remember you declared, among other things, that it was going to
 do me such a tremendous lot of good. But--but--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 But--?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 But now I don't believe the least little bit that that was the reason--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Then what is your theory about it now?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 I think now that it was on account of that pale lady.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Madame von Satow--!
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, she who is always hanging at our heels. Yesterday evening she made
 her appearance up here too.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 But what in all the world--!
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Oh, I know you knew her very well indeed--long before you knew me.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 And had forgotten her, too--long before I knew you.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Sitting upright.] Can you forget so easily, Rubek?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Curtly.] Yes, very easily indeed. [Adds harshly.] When I want to
 forget.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Even a woman who has been a model to you?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 When I have no more use for her--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 One who has stood to you undressed?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 That means nothing--nothing for us artists. [With a change of tone.]
 And then--may I venture to ask--how was I to guess that she was in this
 country?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Oh, you might have seen her name in a Visitor's List--in one of the
 newspapers.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 But I had no idea of the name she now goes by. I had never heard of any
 Herr von Satow.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Affecting weariness.] Oh well then, I suppose it must have been for
 some other reason that you were so set upon this journey.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Seriously.] Yes, Maia--it was for another reason. A quite different
 reason. And that is what we must sooner or later have a clear
 explanation about.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [In a fit of suppressed laughter.] Heavens, how solemn you look!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Suspiciously scrutinising her.] Yes, perhaps a little more solemn than
 necessary.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 How so--?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 And that is a very good thing for us both.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 You begin to make me feel curious, Rubek.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Only curious? Not a little bit uneasy.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Shaking her head.] Not in the least.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Good. Then listen.--You said that day down at the Baths that it seemed
 to you I had become very nervous of late--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, and you really have.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 And what do you think can be the reason of that?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 How can I tell--? [Quickly.] Perhaps you have grown weary of this
 constant companionship with me.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Constant--? Why not say "everlasting"?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Daily companionship, then. Here have we two solitary people lived down
 there for four or five mortal years, and scarcely have an hour away from
 each other.--We two all by ourselves.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [With interest.] Well? And then--?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [A little oppressed.] You are not a particularly sociable man, Rubek.
 You like to keep to yourself and think your own thoughts. And of course
 I can't talk properly to you about your affairs. I know nothing about
 art and that sort of thing-- [With an impatient gesture.] And care very
 little either, for that matter!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Well, well; and that's why we generally sit by the fireside, and chat
 about your affairs.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Oh, good gracious--I have no affairs to chat about.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Well, they are trifles, perhaps; but at any rate the time passes for us
 in that way as well as another, Maia.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, you are right. Time passes. It is passing away from you,
 Rubek.--And I suppose it is really that that makes you so uneasy--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Nods vehemently.] And so restless! [Writhing in his seat.] No, I shall
 soon not be able to endure this pitiful life any longer.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Rises and stands for a moment looking at him.] If you want to get rid
 of me, you have only to say so.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Why will you use such phrases? Get rid of you?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, if you want to have done with me, please say so right out. And I
 will go that instant.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [With an almost imperceptible smile.] Do you intend that as a threat,
 Maia?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 There can be no threat for you in what I said.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Rising.] No, I confess you are right there. [Adds after a pause.] You
 and I cannot possibly go on living together like this--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Well? And then--?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 There is no "then" about it. [With emphasis on his words.] Because we
 two cannot go on living together alone--it does not necessarily follow
 that we must part.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Smiles scornfully.] Only draw away from each other a little, you mean?
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Shakes his head.] Even that is not necessary.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Well then? Come out with what you want to do with me.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [With some hesitation.] What I now feel so keenly--and so
 painfully--that I require, is to have some one about me who really and
 truly stands close to me--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Interrupts him anxiously.] Don't I do that, Rubek?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Waving her aside.] Not in that sense. What I need is the companionship
 of another person who can, as it were, complete me--supply what is
 wanting in me--be one with me in all my striving.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Slowly.] It's true that things like that are a great deal too hard for
 me.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Oh no, they are not at all in your line, Maia.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [With an outburst.] And heaven knows I don't want them to be, either!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I know that very well.--And it was with no idea of finding any such help
 in my life-work that I married you.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Observing him closely.] I can see in your face that you are thinking of
 some one else.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Indeed? I have never noticed before that you were a thought-reader. But
 you can see that, can you?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, I can. Oh, I know you so well, so well, Rubek.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Then perhaps you can also see who it is I am thinking of?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, indeed I can.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Well? Have the goodness to--?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 You are thinking of that--that model you once used for-- [Suddenly
 letting slip the train of thought.] Do you know, the people down at the
 hotel think she's mad.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Indeed? And pray what do the people down at the hotel think of you and
 the bear-killer?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 That has nothing to do with the matter. [Continuing the former train of
 thought.] But it was this pale lady you were thinking of.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Calmly.] Precisely, of her.--When I had no more use for her--and when,
 besides, she went away from me--vanished without a word--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Then you accepted me as a sort of makeshift, I suppose?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [More unfeelingly.] Something of the sort, to tell the truth, little
 Maia. For a year or a year and a half I had lived there lonely and
 brooding, and had put the last touch--the very last touch, to my work.
 "The Resurrection Day" went out over the world and brought me fame--and
 everything else that heart could desire. [With greater warmth.] But I no
 longer loved my own work. Men's laurels and incense nauseated me, till I
 could have rushed away in despair and hidden myself in the depths of the
 woods. [Looking at her.] You, who are a thought-reader--can you guess
 what then occurred to me?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Lightly.] Yes, it occurred to you to make portrait-busts of gentlemen
 and ladies.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Nods.] To order, yes. With animals' faces behind the masks. Those I
 threw in gratis--into the bargain, you understand. [Smiling.] But that
 was not precisely what I had in my mind.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 What, then?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Again serious.] It was this, that all the talk about the artist's
 vocation and the artist's mission, and so forth, began to strike me as
 being very empty, and hollow, and meaningless at bottom.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Then what would you put in its place?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Life, Maia.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Life?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Yes, is not life in sunshine and in beauty a hundred times better worth
 while than to hang about to the end of your days in a raw, damp hole,
 and wear yourself out in a perpetual struggle with lumps of clay and
 blocks of stone?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [With a little sigh.] Yes, I have always thought so, certainly.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 And then I had become rich enough to live in luxury and in indolent,
 quivering sunshine. I was able to build myself the villa on the Lake of
 Taunitz, and the palazzo in the capital,--and all the rest of it.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Taking up his tone.] And last but not least, you could afford to
 treat yourself to me, too. And you gave me leave to share in all your
 treasures.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Jesting, so as to turn the conversation.] Did I not promise to take you
 up to a high enough mountain and show you all the glory of the world?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [With a gentle expression.] You have perhaps taken me up with you to a
 high enough mountain, Rubek--but you have not shown me all the glory of
 the world.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [With a laugh of irritation.] How insatiable you are, Maia.! Absolutely
 insatiable! [With a vehement outburst.] But do you know what is the most
 hopeless thing of all, Maia? Can you guess that?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [With quiet defiance.] Yes, I suppose it is that you have gone and tied
 yourself to me--for life.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I would not have expressed myself so heartlessly.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 But you would have meant it just as heartlessly.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 You have no clear idea of the inner workings of an artist's nature.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Smiling and shaking her head.] Good heavens, I haven't even a clear
 idea of the inner workings of my own nature.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Continuing undisturbed.] I live at such high speed, Maia. We live so,
 we artists. I, for my part, have lived through a whole lifetime in the
 few years we two have known each other. I have come to realise that I
 am not at all adapted for seeking happiness in indolent enjoyment. Life
 does not shape itself that way for me and those like me. I must go on
 working--producing one work after another--right up to my dying day.
 [Forcing himself to continue.] That is why I cannot get on with you any
 longer, Maia--not with you alone.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Quietly.] Does that mean, in plain language, that you have grown tired
 of me?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Bursts forth.] Yes, that is what it means! I have grown
 tired--intolerably tired and fretted and unstrung--in this life with
 you! Now you know it. [Controlling himself.] These are hard, ugly words
 I am using. I know that very well. And you are not at all to blame in
 this matter;--that I willingly admit. It is simply and solely I myself,
 who have once more undergone a revolution--[Half to himself]--and
 awakening to my real life.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Involuntarily folding her hands.] Why in all the world should we not
 part then?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Looks at her in astonishment.] Should you be willing to?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Shrugging her shoulders.] Oh yes--if there's nothing else for it,
 then--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Eagerly.] But there is something else for it. There is an alternative--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Holding up her forefinger.] Now you are thinking of the pale lady
 again!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Yes, to tell the truth, I cannot help constantly thinking of her. Ever
 since I met her again. [A step nearer her.] For now I will tell you a
 secret, Maia.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Well?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Touching his own breast.] In here, you see--in here I have a little
 bramah-locked casket. And in that casket all my sculptor's visions are
 stored up. But when she disappeared and left no trace, the lock of
 the casket snapped to. And she had the key--and she took it away with
 her.--You, little Maia, you had no key; so all that the casket contains
 must lie unused. And the years pass! And I have no means of getting at
 the treasure.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Trying to repress a subtle smile.] Then get her to open the casket for
 you again--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Not understanding.] Maia--?
 
 
 MAIA. --for here she is, you see. And no doubt it's on account of this
 casket that she has come.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I have not said a single word to her on this subject!
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Looks innocently at him.] My dear Rubek--is it worth while to make all
 this fuss and commotion about so simple a matter?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Do you think this matter is so absolutely simple?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, certainly I think so. Do you attach yourself to whoever you most
 require. [Nods to him.] I shall always manage to find a place for
 myself.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Where do you mean?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Unconcerned, evasively.] Well--I need only take myself off to the
 villa, if it should be necessary. But it won't be; for in town--in all
 that great house of ours--there must surely, with a little good will, be
 room enough for three.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Uncertainly.] And do you think that would work in the long run?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [In a light tone.] Very well, then--if it won't work, it won't. It is no
 good talking about it.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 And what shall we do then, Maia--if it does not work?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Untroubled.] Then we two will simply get out of each other's way--part
 entirely. I shall always find something new for myself, somewhere in the
 world. Something free! Free! Free!--No need to be anxious about that,
 Professor Rubek! [Suddenly points off to the right.] Look there! There
 we have her.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Turning.] Where?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Out on the plain. Striding--like a marble stature. She is coming this
 way.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Stands gazing with his hand over his eyes.] Does not she look like the
 Resurrection incarnate? [To himself.] And her I could displace--and move
 into the shade! Remodel her--. Fool that I was!
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 What do you mean by that?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Putting the question aside.] Nothing. Nothing that you would
 understand.
 
     [IRENE advances from the right over the upland.  The children
        at their play have already caught sight of her and run to
        meet her.  She is now surrounded by them; some appear confident
        and at ease, others uneasy and timid.  She talks low to them
        and indicates that they are to go down to the hotel; she
        herself will rest a  little beside the brook.  The children
        run down over the slope to the left, half way to the back.
        IRENE goes up to the wall of rock, and lets the rillets of
        the cascade flow over her hands, cooling them.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [In a low voice.] Go down and speak to her alone, Rubek.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 And where will you go in the meantime?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Looking significantly at him.] Henceforth I shall go my own ways.
 
     [She descends form the hillock and leaps over the brook, by aid
        of her alpenstock.  She stops beside IRENE.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Professor Rubek is up there, waiting for you, madam.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 What does he want?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 He wants you to help him to open a casket that has snapped to.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Can I help him in that?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 He says you are the only person that can.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Then I must try.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, you really must, madam.
 
     [She goes down by the path to the hotel.
 
     [In a little while PROFESSOR RUBEK comes down to IRENE, but stops
        with the brook between them.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [After a short pause.] She--the other one--said that you had been
 waiting for me.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I have waited for you year after year--without myself knowing it.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 I could not come to you, Arnold. I was lying down there, sleeping the
 long, deep, dreamful sleep.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 But now you have awakened, Irene!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Shakes her head.] I have the heavy, deep sleep still in my eyes.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 You shall see that day will dawn and lighten for us both.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Do not believe that.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Urgently.] I do believe it! And I know it! Now that I have found you
 again--
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Risen from the grave.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Transfigured!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Only risen, Arnold. Not transfigured.
 
     [He crosses over to her by means of stepping-stones below the
        cascade.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Where have you been all day, Irene?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Pointing.] Far, far over there, on the great dead waste--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Turning the conversation.] You have not your--your friend with you
 to-day, I see.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Smiling.] My friend is keeping a close watch on me, none the less.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Can she?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Glancing furtively around.] You may be sure she can--wherever I may
 go. She never loses sight of me-- [Whispering.] Until, one fine sunny
 morning, I shall kill her.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Would you do that?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 With the utmost delight--if only I could manage it.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Why do you want to?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Because she deals in witchcraft. [Mysteriously.] Only think, Arnold--she
 has changed herself into my shadow.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Trying to calm her.] Well, well, well--a shadow we must all have.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 I am my own shadow. [With an outburst.] Do you not understand that!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Sadly.] Yes, yes, Irene, I understand.
 
     [He seats himself on a stone beside the brook.  She stands behind
        him, leaning against the wall of rock.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [After a pause.] Why do you sit there turning your eyes away from me?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Softly, shaking his head.] I dare not--I dare not look at you.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Why dare you not look at me any more?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 You have a shadow that tortures me. And I have the crushing weight of my
 conscience.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [With a glad cry of deliverance.] At last!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Springs up.] Irene--what is it!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Motioning him off.] Keep still, still, still! [Draws a deep breath and
 says, as though relieved of a burden.] There! Now they let me go. For
 this time.--Now we can sit down and talk as we used to--when I was
 alive.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Oh, if only we could talk as we used to.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Sit there, where you were sitting. I will sit here beside you.
 
     [He sits down again.  She seats herself on another stone, close
        to him.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [After a short interval of silence.] Now I have come back to you from
 the uttermost regions, Arnold.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Aye, truly, from an endless journey.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Come home to my lord and master--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 To our home;--to our own home, Irene.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Have you looked for my coming every single day?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 How dared I look for you?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [With a sidelong glance.] No, I suppose you dared not. For you
 understood nothing.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Was it really not for the sake of some one else that you all of a sudden
 disappeared from me in that way?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Might it not quite well be for your sake, Arnold?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Looks doubtfully at her.] I don't understand you--?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 When I had served you with my soul and with my body--when the statue
 stood there finished--our child as you called it--then I laid at your
 feet the most precious sacrifice of all--by effacing myself for all
 time.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Bows his head.] And laying my life waste.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Suddenly firing up.] It was just that I wanted! Never, never should you
 create anything again--after you had created that only child of ours.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Was it jealously that moved you, then?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Coldly.] I think it was rather hatred.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Hatred? Hatred for me?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Again vehemently.] Yes, for you--for the artist who had so lightly and
 carelessly taken a warm-blooded body, a young human life, and worn the
 soul out of it--because you needed it for a work of art.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 And you can say that--you who threw yourself into my work with such
 saint-like passion and such ardent joy?--that work for which we two met
 together every morning, as for an act of worship.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Coldly, as before.] I will tell you one thing, Arnold.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Well?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 I never loved your art, before I met you.--Nor after either.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 But the artist, Irene?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 The artist I hate.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 The artist in me too?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 In you most of all. When I unclothed myself and stood for you, then I
 hated you, Arnold--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Warmly.] That you did not, Irene! That is not true!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 I hated you, because you could stand there so unmoved--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Laughs.] Unmoved? Do you think so?
 
 
 IRENE. --at any rate so intolerably self-controlled. And because you
 were an artist and an artist only--not a man! [Changing to a tone full
 of warmth and feeling.] But that statue in the wet, living clay, that
 I loved--as it rose up, a vital human creature, out of those raw,
 shapeless masses--for that was our creation, our child. Mine and yours.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Sadly.] It was so in spirit and in truth.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Let me tell you, Arnold--it is for the sake of this child of ours that I
 have undertaken this long pilgrimage.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Suddenly alert.] For the statue's--?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Call it what you will. I call it our child.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 And now you want to see it? Finished? In marble, which you always
 thought so cold? [Eagerly.] You do not know, perhaps, that it is
 installed in a great museum somewhere--far out in the world?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 I have heard a sort of legend about it.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 And museums were always a horror to you. You called them grave-vaults--
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 I will make a pilgrimage to the place where my soul and my child's soul
 lie buried.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Uneasy and alarmed.] You must never see that statue again! Do you hear,
 Irene! I implore you--! Never, never see it again!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Perhaps you think it would mean death to me a second time?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Clenching his hands together.] Oh, I don't know what I think.--But how
 could I ever imagine that you would fix your mind so immovably on that
 statue? You, who went away from me--before it was completed.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 It was completed. That was why I could go away from you--and leave you
 alone.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Sits with his elbows upon his knees, rocking his head from side to
 side, with his hands before his eyes.] It was not what it afterwards
 became.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Quietly but quick as lightning, half-unsheathes a narrow-bladed sharp
 knife which she carried in her breast, and asks in a hoarse whisper.]
 Arnold--have you done any evil to our child?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Evasively.] Any evil?--How can I be sure what you would call it?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Breathless.] Tell me at once: what have you done to the child?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I will tell you, if you will sit and listen quietly to what I say.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Hides the knife.] I will listen as quietly as a mother can when she--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Interrupting.] And you must not look at me while I am telling you.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Moves to a stone behind his back.] I will sit here, behind you.--Now
 tell me.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Takes his hands from before his eyes and gazes straight in front of
 him. When I had found you, I knew at once how I should make use of you
 for my life-work.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 "The Resurrection Day" you called your life-work.--I call it "our
 child."
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I was young then--with no knowledge of life. The Resurrection, I
 thought, would be most beautifully and exquisitely figured as a young
 unsullied woman--with none of our earth-life's experiences--awakening
 to light and glory without having to put away from her anything ugly and
 impure.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Quickly.] Yes--and so I stand there now, in our work?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Hesitating.] Not absolutely and entirely so, Irene.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [In rising excitement.] Not absolutely--? Do I not stand as I always
 stood for you?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Without answering.] I learned worldly wisdom in the years that
 followed, Irene. "The Resurrection Day" became in my mind's eye
 something more and something--something more complex. The little round
 plinth on which your figure stood erect and solitary--it no longer
 afforded room for all the imagery I now wanted to add--
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Groped for her knife, but desists.] What imagery did you add then? Tell
 me!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I imagined that which I saw with my eyes around me in the world. I had
 to include it--I could not help it, Irene. I expanded the plinth--made
 it wide and spacious. And on it I placed a segment of the curving,
 bursting earth. And up from the fissures of the soil there now swarm men
 and women with dimly-suggested animal-faces. Women and men--as I knew
 them in real life.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [In breathless suspense.] But in the middle of the rout there stands the
 young woman radiant with the joy of light?--Do I not stand so, Arnold?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Evasively.] Not quite in the middle. I had unfortunately to move
 that figure a little back. For the sake of the general effect, you
 understand. Otherwise it would have dominated the whole too much.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 But the joy in the light still transfigures my face?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Yes, it does, Irene--in a way. A little subdued perhaps--as my altered
 idea required.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Rising noiselessly.] That design expresses the life you now see,
 Arnold.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Yes, I suppose it does.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 And in that design you have shifted me back, a little toned down--to
 serve as a background-figure--in a group.
 
     [She draws the knife.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Not a background-figure. Let us say, at most, a figure not quite in the
 foreground--or something of that sort.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Whispers hoarsely.] There you uttered your own doom.
 
     [On the point of striking.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Turns and looks up at her.] Doom?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Hastily hides the knife, and says as though choked with agony.] My
 whole soul--you and I--we, we, we and our child were in that solitary
 figure.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Eagerly, taking off his hat and drying the drops of sweat upon his
 brow.] Yes, but let me tell you, too, how I have placed myself in the
 group. In front, beside a fountain--as it were here--sits a man weighed
 down with guilt, who cannot quite free himself from the earth-crust.
 I call him remorse for a forfeited life. He sits there and dips his
 fingers in the purling stream--to wash them clean--and he is gnawed and
 tortured by the thought that never, never will he succeed. Never in all
 eternity will he attain to freedom and the new life. He will remain for
 ever prisoned in his hell.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Hardly and coldly.] Poet!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Why poet?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Because you are nerveless and sluggish and full of forgiveness for
 all the sins of your life, in thought and in act. You have killed
 my soul--so you model yourself in remorse, and self-accusation, and
 penance--[Smiling.] --and with that you think your account is cleared.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Defiantly.] I am an artist, Irene. And I take no shame to myself for
 the frailties that perhaps cling to me. For I was born to be an artist,
 you see. And, do what I may, I shall never be anything else.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Looks at him with a lurking evil smile, and says gently and softly.]
 You are a poet, Arnold. [Softly strokes his hair.] You dear, great,
 middle-aged child,--is it possible that you cannot see that!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Annoyed.] Why do you keep on calling me a poet?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [With malign eyes.] Because there is something apologetic in the word,
 my friend. Something that suggests forgiveness of sins--and spreads
 a cloak over all frailty. [With a sudden change of tone.] But I was a
 human being--then! And I, too, had a life to live,--and a human destiny
 to fulfil. And all that, look you, I let slip--gave it all up in order
 to make myself your bondwoman.--Oh, it was self-murder--a deadly sin
 against myself! [Half whispering.] And that sin I can never expiate!
 
     [She seats herself near him beside the brook, keeps close, though
        unnoticed, watch upon him, and, as though in absence of mind,
        plucks some flowers form the shrubs around them.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [With apparent self-control.] I should have borne children in the
 world--many children--real children--not such children as are hidden
 away in grave-vaults. That was my vocation. I ought never to have served
 you--poet.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Lost in recollection.] Yet those were beautiful days, Irene.
 Marvellously beautiful days--as I now look back upon them--
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Looking at him with a soft expression.] Can you remember a little word
 that you said--when you had finished--finished with me and with our
 child? [Nods to him.] Can you remember that little word, Arnold?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Looks inquiringly at her.] Did I say a little word then, which you
 still remember?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Yes, you did. Can you not recall it?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Shaking his head.] No, I can't say that I do. Not at the present
 moment, at any rate.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 You took both my hands and pressed them warmly. And I stood there in
 breathless expectation. And then you said: "So now, Irene, I thank you
 from my heart. This," you said, "has been a priceless episode for me."
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Looks doubtfully at her.] Did I say "episode"? It is not a word I am in
 the habit of using.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 You said "episode."
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [With assumed cheerfulness.] Well, well--after all, it was in reality an
 episode.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Curtly.] At that word I left you.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 You take everything so painfully to heart, Irene.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Drawing her hand over her forehead.] Perhaps you are right. Let us
 shake off all the hard things that go to the heart. [Plucks off the
 leaves of a mountain rose and strews them on the brook.] Look there,
 Arnold. There are our birds swimming.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 What birds are they?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Can you not see? Of course they are flamingoes. Are they not rose-red?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Flamingoes do not swim. They only wade.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Then they are not flamingoes. They are sea-gulls.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 They may be sea-gulls with red bills, yes. [Plucks broad green leaves
 and throws them into the brook.] Now I send out my ships after them.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 But there must be no harpoon-men on board.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 No, there shall be no harpoon-men. [Smiles to her.] Can you remember the
 summer when we used to sit like this outside the little peasant hut on
 the Lake of Taunitz?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Nods.] On Saturday evenings, yes,--when we had finished our week's
 work--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK. --And taken the train out to the lake--to stay there
 over Sunday--
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [With an evil gleam of hatred in her eyes.] It was an episode, Arnold.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [As if not hearing.] Then, too, you used to set birds swimming in the
 brook. They were water-lilies which you--
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 They were white swans.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I meant swans, yes. And I remember that I fastened a great furry leaf to
 one of the swans. It looked like a burdock-leaf--
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 And then it turned into Lohengrin's boat--with the swan yoked to it.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 How fond you were of that game, Irene.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 We played it over and over again.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Every single Saturday, I believe,--all the summer through.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 You said I was the swan that drew your boat.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Did I say so? Yes, I daresay I did. [Absorbed in the game.] Just see how
 the sea-gulls are swimming down the stream!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Laughing.] And all your ships have run ashore.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Throwing more leaves into the brook.] I have ships enough in reserve.
 [Follows the leaves with his eyes, throws more into the brook, and says
 after a pause.] Irene,--I have bought the little peasant hut beside the
 Lake of Taunitz.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Have you bought it? You often said you would, if you could afford it.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 The day came when I could afford it easily enough; and so I bought it.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [With a sidelong look at him.] Then do you live out there now--in our
 old house?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 No, I have had it pulled down long ago. And I have built myself a great,
 handsome, comfortable villa on the site--with a park around it. It is
 there that we-- [Stops and corrects himself.] --there that I usually
 live during the summer.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Mastering herself.] So you and--and the other one live out there now?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [With a touch of defiance.] Yes. When my wife and I are not
 travelling--as we are this year.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Looking far before her.] Life was beautiful, beautiful by the Lake of
 Taunitz.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [As though looking back into himself.] And yet, Irene--
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Completing his thought.] --yet we two let slip all that life and its
 beauty.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Softly, urgently.] Does repentance come too late, now?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Does not answer, but sits silent for a moment; then she points over
 the upland.] Look there, Arnold,--now the sun is going down behind the
 peaks. See what a red glow the level rays cast over all the heathery
 knolls out yonder.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Looks where she is pointing.] It is long since I have seen a sunset in
 the mountains.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Or a sunrise?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 A sunrise I don't think I have ever seen.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Smiles as though lost in recollection.] I once saw a marvellously
 lovely sunrise.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Did you? Where was that?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 High, high up on a dizzy mountain-top.--You beguiled me up there by
 promising that I should see all the glory of the world if only I--
 
     [She stops suddenly.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 If only you--? Well?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 I did as you told me--went with you up to the heights. And there I
 fell upon my knees and worshipped you, and served you. [Is silent for a
 moment; then says softly.] Then I saw the sunrise.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Turning at him with a scornful smile.] With you--and the other woman?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Urgently.] With me--as in our days of creation. You could open all that
 is locked up in me. Can you not find it in your heart, Irene?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Shaking her head.] I have no longer the key to you, Arnold.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 You have the key! You and you alone possess it! [Beseechingly.] Help
 me--that I may be able to live my life over again!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Immovable as before.] Empty dreams! Idle--dead dreams. For the life you
 and I led there is no resurrection.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Curtly, breaking off.] Then let us go on playing.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Yes, playing, playing--only playing!
 
     [They sit and strew leaves and petals over the brook, where they
        float and sail away.
 
     [Up the slope to the left at the back come ULFHEIM and MAIA in
        hunting costume.  After them comes the SERVANT with the leash
        of dogs, with which he goes out to the right.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Catching sight of them.] Ah! There is little Maia, going out with the
 bear-hunter.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Your lady, yes.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Or the other's.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Looks around as she is crossing the upland, sees the two sitting by
 the brook, and calls out.] Good-night, Professor! Dream of me. Now I am
 going off on my adventures!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Calls back to her.] What sort of an adventure is this to be?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Approaching.] I am going to let life take the place of all the rest.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Mockingly.] Aha! So you too are going to do that, little Maia?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes. And I've made a verse about it, and this is how it goes:
 
     [Sings triumphantly.]
 
               I am free!  I am free!  I am free!
               No more life in the prison for me!
               I am free as a bird!  I am free!
               For I believe I have awakened now--at last.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 It almost seems so.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Drawing a deep breath.] Oh--how divinely light one feels on waking!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Good-night, Frau Maia--and good luck to--
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Calls out, interposing.] Hush, hush!--for the devil's sake let's have
 none of your wizard wishes. Don't you see that we are going out to
 shoot--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 What will you bring me home from the hunting, Maia?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 You shall have a bird of prey to model. I shall wing one for you.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Laughs mockingly and bitterly.] Yes, to wing things--without knowing
 what you are doing--that has long been quite in your way.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Tossing her head.] Oh, just let me take care of myself for the future,
 and I wish you then--! [Nods and laughs roguishly.] Good-bye--and a
 good, peaceful summer night on the upland!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Jestingly.] Thanks! And all the ill-luck in the world over you and your
 hunting!
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Roaring with laughter.] There now, that is a wish worth having!
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Laughing.] Thanks, thanks, thanks, Professor!
 
     [They have both crossed the visible portion of the upland, and go
        out through the bushes to the right.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [After a short pause.] A summer night on the upland! Yes, that would
 have been life!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Suddenly, with a wild expression in her eyes.] Will you spend a summer
 night on the upland--with me?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Stretching his arms wide.] Yes, yes,--come!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 My adored lord and master!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Oh, Irene!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Hoarsely, smiling and groping in her breast.] It will be only an
 episode-- [Quickly, whispering.] Hush!--do not look round, Arnold!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Also in a low voice.] What is it?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 A face that is staring at me.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Turns involuntarily.] Where! [With a start.] Ah--!
 
     [The SISTER OF MERCY's head is partly visible among the bushes
        beside the descent to the left.  Her eyes are immovably fixed
        on IRENE.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Rises and says softly.] We must part then. No, you must remain sitting.
 Do you hear? You must not go with me. [Bends over him and whispers.]
 Till we meet again--to-night--on the upland.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 And you will come, Irene?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Yes, surely I will come. Wait for me here.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Repeats dreamily.] Summer night on the upland. With you. With you. [His
 eyes meet hers.] Oh, Irene--that might have been our life.--And that we
 have forfeited--we two.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 We see the irretrievable only when--
 
     [Breaks off.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Looks inquiringly at her.] When--?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 When we dead awaken.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Shakes his head mournfully.] What do we really see then?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 We see that we have never lived.
 
     [She goes towards the slope and descends.
 
     [The SISTER OF MERCY makes way for her and follows her.
        PROFESSOR RUBEK remains sitting motionless beside the brook.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Is heard singing triumphantly among the hills.]
 
                I am free!  I am free!  I am free!
                No more life in the prison for me!
                I am free as a bird!  I am free!
 
 
 
 
 ACT THIRD.
 
 
 [A wild riven mountain-side, with sheer precipices at the back.
    Snow-clad peaks rise to the right, and lose themselves in drifting
    mists.  To the left, on a stone-scree, stands an old, half-ruined
    hut.  It is early morning.  Dawn is breaking.  The sun has not
    yet risen.
 
 [MAIA comes, flushed and irritated, down over the stone-scree on the
    left. ULFHEIM follows, half angry, half laughing, holding her
    fast by the sleeve.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Trying to tear herself loose.] Let me go! Let me go, I say!
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Come, Come! are you going to bite now? You're as snappish as a wolf.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Striking him over the hand.] Let me, I tell you? And be quiet!
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 No, confound me if I will!
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Then I will not go another step with you. Do you hear?--not a single
 step!
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Ho, ho! How can you get away from me, here, on the wild mountain-side?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 I will jump over the precipice yonder, if need be--
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 And mangle and mash yourself up into dogs'-meat! A juicy morsel! [Lets
 go his hold.] As you please. Jump over the precipice if you want to.
 It's a dizzy drop. There's only one narrow footpath down it, and that's
 almost impassable.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Dusts her skirt with her hand, and looks at him with angry eyes.] Well,
 you are a nice one to go hunting with!
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Say rather, sporting.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Oh! So you call this sport, do you?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Yes, I venture to take that liberty. It is the sort of sport I like best
 of all.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Tossing her head.] Well--I must say! [After a pause; looks searchingly
 at him.] Why did you let the dogs loose up there?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Blinking his eyes and smiling.] So that they too might do a little
 hunting on their own account, don't you see?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 There's not a word of truth in that! It wasn't for the dogs' sake that
 you let them go.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Still smiling.] Well, why did I let them go then? Let us hear.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 You let them go because you wanted to get rid of Lars. He was to run
 after them and bring them in again, you said. And in the meant-time--.
 Oh, it was a pretty way to behave!
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 In the meantime?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Curtly breaking off.] No matter!
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [In a confidential tone.] Lars won't find them. You may safely swear to
 that. He won't come with them before the time's up.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Looking angrily at him.] No, I daresay not.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Catching at her arm.] For Lars--he knows my--my methods of sport, you
 see.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Eludes him, and measures him with a glance.] Do you know what you look
 like, Mr. Ulfheim?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 I should think I'm probably most like myself.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, there you're exactly right. For you're the living image of a faun.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 A faun?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, precisely; a faun.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 A faun! Isn't that a sort of monster? Or a kind of a wood demon, as you
 might call it?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, just the sort of creature you are. A thing with a goat's beard and
 goat-legs. Yes, and the faun has horns too!
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 So, so!--has he horns too?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 A pair of ugly horns, just like yours, yes.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Can you see the poor little horns _I_ have?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, I seem to see them quite plainly.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Taking the dogs' leash out of his pocket.] Then I had better see about
 tying you.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Have you gone quite mad? Would you tie me?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 If I am a demon, let me be a demon! So that's the way of it! You can see
 the horns, can you?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Soothingly.] There, there, there! Now try to behave nicely, Mr.
 Ulfheim. [Breaking off.] But what has become of that hunting-castle
 of yours, that you boasted so much of? You said it lay somewhere
 hereabouts.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Points with a flourish to the hut.] There you have it, before your very
 eyes.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Looks at him.] That old pig-stye!
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Laughing in his beard.] It has harboured more than one king's daughter,
 I can tell you.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Was it there that that horrid man you told me about came to the king's
 daughter in the form of a bear?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Yes, my fair companion of the chase--this is the scene. [With a gesture
 of invitation.] If you would deign to enter--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Isch! If ever I set foot in it--! Isch!
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Oh, two people can doze away a summer night in there comfortably enough.
 Or a whole summer, if it comes to that!
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Thanks! One would need to have a pretty strong taste for that kind of
 thing. [Impatiently.] But now I am tired both of you and the hunting
 expedition. Now I am going down to the hotel--before people awaken down
 there.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 How do you propose to get down from here?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 That's your affair. There must be a way down somewhere or other, I
 suppose.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Pointing towards the back.] Oh, certainly! There is a sort of
 way--right down the face of the precipice yonder--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 There, you see. With a little goodwill--
 
 
 ULFHEIM. --but just you try if you dare go that way.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Doubtfully.] Do you think I can't?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Never in this world--if you don't let me help you.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Uneasily.] Why, then come and help me! What else are you here for?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Would you rather I should take you on my back--?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Nonsense!
 
 
 ULFHEIM. --or carry you in my arms?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Now do stop talking that rubbish!
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [With suppressed exasperation.] I once took a young girl--lifted her up
 from the mire of the streets and carried her in my arms. Next my heart I
 carried her. So I would have borne her all through life--lest haply she
 should dash her foot against a stone. For her shoes were worn very thin
 when I found her--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 And yet you took her up and carried her next your heart?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Took her up out of the gutter and carried her as high and as carefully
 as I could. [With a growling laugh.] And do you know what I got for my
 reward?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 No. What did you get?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Looks at her, smiles and nods.] I got the horns! The horns that you can
 see so plainly. Is not that a comical story, madam bear-murderess?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Oh yes, comical enough! But I know another story that is still more
 comical.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 How does that story go?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 This is how it goes. There was once a stupid girl, who had both a father
 and a mother--but a rather poverty-stricken home. Then there came a high
 and mighty seigneur into the midst of all this poverty. And he took the
 girl in his arms--as you did--and travelled far, far away with her--
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Was she so anxious to be with him?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, for she was stupid, you see.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 And he, no doubt, was a brilliant and beautiful personage?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Oh, no, he wasn't so superlatively beautiful either. But he pretended
 that he would take her with him to the top of the highest of mountains,
 where there were light and sunshine without end.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 So he was a mountaineer, was he, that man?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, he was--in his way.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 And then he took the girl up with him--?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [With a toss of the head.] Took her up with him finely, you may be sure!
 Oh no! he beguiled her into a cold, clammy cage, where--as it seemed
 to her--there was neither sunlight nor fresh air, but only gilding and
 great petrified ghosts of people all around the walls.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Devil take me, but it served her right!
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, but don't you think it's quite a comical story, all the same?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Looks at her moment.] Now listen to me, my good companion of the
 chase--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Well, what it is now?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Should not we two tack our poor shreds of life together?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Is his worship inclined to set up as a patching-tailor?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Yes, indeed he is. Might not we two try to draw the rags together here
 and there--so as to make some sort of a human life out of them?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 And when the poor tatters were quite worn out--what then?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [With a large gesture.] Then there we shall stand, free and serene--as
 the man and woman we really are!
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Laughing.] You with your goat-legs yes!
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 And you with your--. Well, let that pass.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, come--let us pass--on.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Stop! Whither away, comrade?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Down to the hotel, of course.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 And afterward?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Then we'll take a polite leave of each other, with thanks for pleasant
 company.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Can we part, we two? Do you think we can?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Yes, you didn't manage to tie me up, you know.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 I have a castle to offer you--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Pointing to the hut.] A fellow to that one?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 It has not fallen to ruin yet.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 And all the glory of the world, perhaps?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 A castle, I tell you--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Thanks! I have had enough of castles.
 
 
 ULFHEIM. --with splendid hunting-grounds stretching for miles around it.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Are there works of art too in this castle?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Slowly.] Well, no--it's true there are no works of art; but--
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Relieved.] Ah! that's one good thing, at any rate!
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Will you go with me, then--as far and as long as I want you?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 There is a tame bird of prey keeping watch upon me.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Wildly.] We'll put a bullet in his wing, Maia!
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Looks at him a moment, and says resolutely.] Come then, and carry me
 down into the depths.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Puts his arm round her waist.] It is high time! The mist is upon us!
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Is the way down terribly dangerous?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 The mountain is more dangerous still.
 
     [She shakes him off, goes to the edge of the precipice and looks
        over, but starts quickly back.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Goes towards her, laughing.] What? Does it make you a little giddy?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Faintly.] Yes, that too. But go and look over. Those two, coming up--
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Goes and bends over the edge of the precipice.] It's only your bird of
 prey--and his strange lady.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 Can't we get past them--without their seeing us?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Impossible! The path is far too narrow. And there's no other way down.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Nerving herself.] Well, well--let us face them here, then!
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Spoken like a true bear-killer, comrade!
 
     [PROFESSOR RUBEK and IRENE appear over the edge of the precipice
        at the back. He has his plaid over his shoulders; she has a
        fur cloak thrown loosely over her white dress, and a swansdown
        hood over her head.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Still only half visible above the edge.] What, Maia! So we two meet
 once again?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [With assumed coolness.] At your service. Won't you come up?
 
     [PROFESSOR RUBEK climbs right up and holds out his hand to IRENE,
        who also comes right to the top.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Coldly to MAIA.] So you, too, have been all night on the mountain,--as
 we have?
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 I have been hunting--yes. You gave me permission, you know.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Pointing downward.] Have you come up that path there?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 As you saw.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 And the strange lady too?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Yes, of course. [With a glance at MAIA.] Henceforth the strange lady and
 I do not intend our ways to part.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Don't you know, then, that it is a deadly dangerous way you have come?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 We thought we would try it, nevertheless. For it did not seem
 particularly hard at first.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 No, at first nothing seems hard. But presently you may come to a tight
 place where you can neither get forward nor back. And then you stick
 fast, Professor! Mountain-fast, as we hunters call it.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Smiles and looks at him.] Am I to take these as oracular utterances,
 Mr. Ulfheim?
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 Lord preserve me from playing the oracle! [Urgently, pointing up towards
 the heights.] But don't you see that the storm is upon us? Don't you
 hear the blasts of wind?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Listening.] They sound like the prelude to the Resurrection Day.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 They are storm-blasts form the peaks, man! Just look how the clouds are
 rolling and sinking--soon they'll be all around us like a winding-sheet!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [With a start and shiver.] I know that sheet!
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Drawing ULFHEIM away.] Let us make haste and get down.
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [To PROFESSOR RUBEK.] I cannot help more than one. Take refuge in the
 hut in the mean-time--while the storm lasts. Then I shall send people up
 to fetch the two of you away.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [In terror.] To fetch us away! No, no!
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Harshly.] To take you by force if necessary--for it's a matter of life
 and death here. Now, you know it. [To MAIA.] Come, then--and don't fear
 to trust yourself in your comrade's hands.
 
 
 MAIA.
 
 [Clinging to him.] Oh, how I shall rejoice and sing, if I get down with
 a whole skin!
 
 
 ULFHEIM.
 
 [Begins the descent and calls to the others.] You'll wait, then, in the
 hut, till the men come with ropes, and fetch you away.
 
     [ULFHEIM, with MAIA in his arms, clambers rapidly but warily down
        the precipice.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Looks for some time at PROFESSOR RUBEK with terror-stricken eyes.] Did
 you hear that, Arnold?--men are coming up to fetch me away! Many men
 will come up here--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Do not be alarmed, Irene!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [In growing terror.] And she, the woman in black--she will come too. For
 she must have missed me long ago. And then she will seize me, Arnold!
 And put me in the strait-waistcoat. Oh, she has it with her, in her box.
 I have seen it with my own eyes--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Not a soul shall be suffered to touch you.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [With a wild smile.] Oh no--I myself have a resource against that.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 What resource do you mean?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Drawing out the knife.] This!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Tries to seize it.] Have you a knife?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Always, always--both day and night--in bed as well!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Give me that knife, Irene!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Concealing it.] You shall not have it. I may very likely find a use for
 it myself.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 What use can you have for it, here?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Looks fixedly at him.] It was intended for you, Arnold.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 For me!
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 As we were sitting by the Lake of Taunitz last evening--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 By the Lake of--
 
 
 IRENE. --outside the peasant's hut--and playing with swans and
 water-lilies--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 What then--what then?
 
 
 IRENE. --and when I heard you say with such deathly, icy coldness--that
 I was nothing but an episode in your life--
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 It was you that said that, Irene, not I.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Continuing.] --then I had my knife out. I wanted to stab you in the
 back with it.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Darkly.] And why did you hold your hand?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Because it flashed upon me with a sudden horror that you were dead
 already--long ago.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Dead?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Dead. Dead, you as well as I. We sat there by the Lake of Taunitz, we
 two clay-cold bodies--and played with each other.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 I do not call that being dead. But you do not understand me.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 Then where is the burning desire for me that you fought and battled
 against when I stood freely forth before you as the woman arisen from
 the dead?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Our love is assuredly not dead, Irene.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 The love that belongs to the life of earth--the beautiful, miraculous
 earth-life--the inscrutable earth-life--that is dead in both of us.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 [Passionately.] And do you know that just that love--it is burning and
 seething in me as hotly as ever before?
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 And I? Have you forgotten who I now am?
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Be who or what you please, for aught I care! For me, you are the woman I
 see in my dreams of you.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 I have stood on the turn-table-naked--and made a show of myself to many
 hundreds of men--after you.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 It was I that drove you to the turn-table--blind as I then was--I, who
 placed the dead clay-image above the happiness of life--of love.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Looking down.] Too late--too late!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Not by a hairsbreadth has all that has passed in the interval lowered
 you in my eyes.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [With head erect.] Nor in my own!
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Well, what then! Then we are free--and there is still time for us to
 live our life, Irene.
 
 
 IRENE.
 
 [Looks sadly at him.] The desire for life is dead in me, Arnold. Now I
 have arisen. And I look for you. And I find you.--And then I see that
 you and life lie dead--as I have lain.
 
 
 PROFESSOR RUBEK.
 
 Oh, how utterly you are astray! Both in us and around us life is
 fermenting and throbbing as fiercely as ever!
 
 
 IRENE.

                           INTRODUCTION
 
 
 One of the most remarkable facts about Ibsen is the orderly
 development of his genius.  He himself repeatedly maintained that
 his dramas were not mere isolated accidents.  In the foreword to
 the readers in the popular edition of 1898 he urges the public to
 read his dramas in the same order in which he had written them,
 deplores the fact that his earlier works are less known and less
 understood than his later works, and insists that his writings
 taken as a whole constitute an organic unity.  The three of his
 plays offered here for the first time in English translation will
 afford those not familiar with the original Norwegian some light
 on the early stages of his development.
 
 _Catiline_, the earliest of Ibsen's plays, was written in
 1849, while Ibsen was an apothecary's apprentice in Grimstad.  It
 appeared in Christiania in the following spring under the
 pseudonym Brynjolf Bjarme.  The revolutionary atmosphere of
 1848-49, the reading of the story of Catiline in Sallust and
 Cicero in preparation for the university examinations, the
 hostility which existed between the apprentice and his immediate
 social environment, the fate which the play met at the hands of
 the theatrical management and the publishers, his own struggles
 at the time,--are all set forth clearly enough in the preface to
 the second edition.  The play was written in the blank verse of
 Oehlenschlaeger's romantic dramas.  Ibsen's portrayal of the
 Roman politician is not in accord with tradition; Catiline is not
 an out-and-out reprobate, but an unfortunate and highly sensitive
 individual in whom idealism and licentiousness struggle for
 mastery.  Vasenius, in his study of the poet (_Ibsens
 Dramatiska Diktning in dess Foersta Skede_, Helsingfors, 1879),
 insists that Ibsen thus intuitively hit upon the real Catiline
 revealed by later nineteenth century research.  The poet seems
 not to have heard of Duma's _Catiline_, which appeared about
 the same time, nor of earlier plays on the subject by Ben Jonson
 and others.  The struggle in Ibsen's play is centered in the soul
 of Catiline; not once do his political opponents appear on the
 scene.  Only one critic raised his voice in behalf of the play at
 the time of its appearance, and only a few copies of the original
 edition survive.  Ibsen issued in 1875 a revised edition in
 celebration of his twenty-fifth anniversary as an author.  Since
 then a third edition has been issued in 1891, and a fourth in
 1913.
 
 _The Warrior's Barrow_, Ibsen's second play, was finished in
 1850 shortly after the publication of _Catiline_.  Ibsen
 entered upon his literary career with a gusto he seems soon to
 have lost; he wrote to his friend Ole Schulerud in January, 1850,
 that he was working on a play about Olaf Trygvesson, an
 historical novel, and a longer poem.  He had begun _The
 Warrior's Barrow_ while he was still at Grimstad, but this
 early version, called _The Normans_, he revised on reaching
 Christiania.  In style and manner and even in subject-matter the
 play echoes Oehlenschlaeger.  Ibsen's vikings are, however, of a
 fiercer type than Oehlenschlaeger's, and this treatment of viking
 character was one of the things the critics, bred to
 Oehlenschlaeger's romantic conception of more civilized vikings,
 found fault with in Ibsen's play.  The sketch fared better than
 _Catiline_: it was thrice presented on the stage in
 Christiania and was on the whole favorably reviewed.  When Ibsen
 became associated with the Bergen theater he undertook another
 revision of the play, and in this version the play was presented
 on the stage in 1854 and 1856.  The final version was published
 in the _Bergenske Blad_ in 1854, but no copy of this issue
 has survived; the play remained inaccessible to the public until
 1902, when it was included in a supplementary volume (Volume X)
 to Ibsen's collected works.  The earlier version remained in
 manuscript form until it was printed in 1917 in _Scandinavian
 Studies and Notes_ (Vol. IV, pp. 309-337).
 
 _Olaf Liljekrans_, which was presented on the Bergen stage
 in 1857, marks the end of Ibsen's early romantic interest.  The
 original idea for this play, which he had begun in 1850, he found
 in the folk-tale "The Grouse in Justedal," about a girl who alone
 had survived the Black Death in an isolated village.  Ibsen had
 with many others become interested in popular folk-tales and
 ballads.  It was from Faye's _Norwegian Folk-Tales_ (1844)
 that he took the story of "The Grouse in Justedal."  His interest
 was so great that he even turned collector.  Twice during this
 period he petitioned for and received small university grants to
 enable him to travel and "collect songs and legends still current
 among the people."  Of the seventy or eighty "hitherto
 unpublished legends" which he collected on the first of these
 trips only a few have ever appeared in print; the results of his
 second trip are unknown.  Ibsen had great faith in the
 availability of this medieval material for dramatic purposes; he
 even wrote an essay, "The Heroic Ballad and Its Significance for
 Artistic Poetry," urging its superior claims in contrast to that
 of the saga material, to which he was himself shortly to turn.
 The original play based on "The Grouse in Justedal" was left
 unfinished.  After the completion of _Lady Inger of Oestrat_
 and _The Feast at Solhoug_ he came back to it, and taking a
 suggestion from the ballad in Landstad's collection (1852-3) he
 recast the whole play, substituted the ballad meter for the
 iambic pentameters, and called the new version _Olaf
 Liljekrans_.  _Olaf Liljekrans_ indicates clearly a
 decline in Ibsen's interest in pure romance.  It is much more
 satirical than _The Feast at Solhoug_, and marks a step in
 the direction of those superb masterpieces of satire and romance,
 _Brand_ and _Peer Gynt_.  The play was twice presented
 on the stage in Bergen with considerable success, but the critics
 treated it harshly.
 
 The relationship of the revised versions to the original versions
 of Ibsen's early plays is interesting, and might, if
 satisfactorily elucidated, throw considerable light on the
 development of his genius.  It is evident that he was in this
 early period experimenting in metrical forms.  He employed blank
 verse in _Catiline_, in the original version of _The
 Grouse in Justedal_, and even as late as 1853 in the revision
 of _The Warrior's Barrow_.  There can be no question but
 that he was here following the Ochlenschlaeger tradition.
 Unrhymed pentameter, however, did not seem to satisfy him.  He
 could with difficulty keep from falling into rhyme in
 _Catiline_, and in the early version of _The Warrior's
 Barrow_ he used rhymed pentameters.  After the revision of
 this play he threw aside blank verse altogether.  "Iambic
 pentameter," he says in the essay on the heroic ballad, "is by no
 means the most suitable form for the treatment of ancient
 Scandinavian material; this form of verse is altogether foreign
 to our national meters, and it is surely through a national form
 that the national material can find its fullest expression."  The
 folk-tale and the ballad gave him the suggestion he needed.  In
 _The Feast at Solhoug_ and the final version of _Olaf
 Liljekrans_ he employed the ballad meter, and this form became
 the basis for the verse in all his later metrical plays.
 
 Six years intervened between _The Grouse in Justedal_ and
 _Olaf Liljekrans_, and the revision in this case amounted
 almost to the writing of a new play.  Fredrik Paasche in his
 study (_Olaf Liljekrans_, Christiania, 1909) discusses the
 relation of _Olaf Liljekrans_ to the earlier form of the
 play.  Three years intervened between the first and final
 versions of _The Warrior's Barrow_.  Professor
 A. M. Sturtevant maintains (_Journal of English and Germanic
 Philology_, XII, 407 ff.) that although "the influence of
 Ochlenschlaeger upon both versions of _The Warrior's Barrow_
 is unmistakable," yet "the two versions differ so widely from
 each other ... that it may be assumed that ... Ibsen had begun to
 free himself from the thraldom of Ochlenschlaeger's romantic
 conception of the viking character."  He points out the influence
 of Welhaven and Heiberg on the second version, elaborates upon
 the superior character-delineation, and shows in considerable
 detail the "inner necessity ... which brings about the change of
 heart in Gandalf and his warriors."
 
 The revision of _Catiline_ came twenty-five years after the
 original version, and consisted largely of linguistic changes.
 Ibsen seems never to have completely disowned this play; it has
 been included in all the complete editions, whereas _The
 Warrior's Barrow_ and _Olaf Liljekrans_ appear only in
 the first complete edition, and were even then relegated to a
 supplementary volume.  In suggesting the revision of
 _Catiline_, Ibsen proposed "to make no change in the thought
 and ideas, but only in the language in which these are expressed;
 for the verses are, as Brandes has somewhere remarked, bad,--one
 reason being that the book was printed from my first rough
 uncorrected draft."  He had at that time not developed his
 careful craftsmanship, and sought in the revision merely to put
 the drama into the form which he had originally had in mind, but
 which at that time he had been unable to achieve.  The changes
 that were actually made are summarized by D. A. Seip (Ibsen,
 _Samlede Digter Verker_, 1918, VII, 114) who quotes Halvdan
 Koht and Julius Elias (Ibsen, _Efterladte Skrifter_, III):
 "The two editions 'agree in the sequence of tenses, with a few
 exceptions also in the sequence of speeches, and on the whole
 even in the sequence of lines.  The changes involve principally
 the poetic expression itself; after the second act they become
 more and more extensive, and the last two acts have been
 augmented with 100 lines.'  ...  Not infrequently there appear
 words and expressions which are suggestive of Ibsen's later
 works."
 
 These plays now appear for the first time in English translation.
 A. Johnstone published in _Translations from the Norse, by a
 B. S. S._ (Gloucester, about 1876), an English rendering of
 the first act of _Catiline_ and a synopsis of the last two
 acts.  William Archer explains at length his omission of
 _Catiline_ from his edition of Ibsen.  "A great part of the
 interest lies in the very crudities of its style, which it would
 be a thankless task to reproduce in translation.  Moreover, the
 poet impaired even its biographical value by largely rewriting it
 before publication.  He did not make it, or attempt to make it, a
 better play, but he in some measure corrected its juvenility of
 expression.  Which version, then, should a translator choose?  To
 go back to the original would seem a deliberate disregard of the
 poet's wishes; while, on the other hand, the retouched version is
 clearly of far inferior interest.  It seems advisable, therefore,
 to leave the play alone, as far as this edition is concerned."
 _Olaf Liljekrans_ and _The Warrior's Barrow_ were acted
 in English in London in 1911 and 1912 respectively, but the
 English renderings used in these presentations have never
 appeared in print.
 
 The text of _Catiline_ in the present translation is that of
 the revised version as given in the edition of 1906-07; the text
 of the other two plays is that of the edition of 1898-1902.  The
 meters of the original have been carefully reproduced.  The great
 difficulty of rendering the ballad and lyrical meters of Ibsen
 into adequate English verse has made some stylistic changes
 necessary, such as the substitution of masculine for feminine
 rhymes, and the occasional alteration of the sense in slight
 measure.
 
 I take this opportunity to acknowledge my gratitude to Professor
 O. W. Firkins, now of _The Weekly Review_, who suggested the
 translating of these plays and who offered from time to time
 invaluable criticisms; to Professor Howard M. Jones, of the
 University of Texas, Professor S. B. Hustvedt, of the University
 of Minnesota, and Professor W. W. Lawrence, of Columbia
 University, who read all or parts of these translations and made
 many helpful suggestions; and to Professor G. P. Krapp, of
 Columbia University, and my wife, who were of assistance in
 various ways.

                   PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
 
 
 The drama _Catiline_, with which I entered upon my literary
 career, was written during the winter of 1848-49, that is in my
 twenty-first year.
 
 I was at the time in Grimstad, under the necessity of earning
 with my hands the wherewithal of life and the means for
 instruction preparatory to my taking the entrance examinations to
 the university.  The age was one of great stress.  The February
 revolution, the uprisings in Hungary and elsewhere, the Slesvig
 war,--all this had a great effect upon and hastened my
 development, however immature it may have remained for some time
 after.  I wrote ringing poems of encouragement to the Magyars,
 urging them for the sake of liberty and humanity to hold out in
 the righteous struggle against the "tyrants"; I wrote a long
 series of sonnets to King Oscar, containing particularly, as far
 as I can remember, an appeal to set aside all petty
 considerations and to march forthwith at the head of his army to
 the aid of our brothers on the outermost borders of Slesvig.
 Inasmuch as I now, in contrast to those times, doubt that my
 winged appeals would in any material degree have helped the cause
 of the Magyars or the Scandinavians, I consider it fortunate that
 they remained within the more private sphere of the manuscript.
 I could not, however, on more formal occasions keep from
 expressing myself in the impassioned spirit of my poetic
 effusions, which meanwhile brought me nothing--from friends or
 non-friends--but a questionable reward; the former greeted me as
 peculiarly fitted for the unintentionally droll, and the latter
 thought it in the highest degree strange that a young person in
 my subordinate position could undertake to inquire into affairs
 concerning which not even they themselves dared to entertain an
 opinion.  I owe it to truth to add that my conduct at various
 times did not justify any great hope that society might count on
 an increase in me of civic virtue, inasmuch as I also, with
 epigrams and caricatures, fell out with many who had deserved
 better of me and whose friendship I in reality prized.
 Altogether,--while a great struggle raged on the outside, I
 found myself on a war-footing with the little society where I
 lived cramped by conditions and circumstances of life.
 
 Such was the situation when amid the preparations for my
 examinations I read through Sallust's _Catiline_ together
 with Cicero's Catilinarian orations.  I swallowed these
 documents, and a few months later my drama was complete.  As will
 be seen from my book, I did not share at that time the conception
 of the two ancient Roman writers respecting the character and
 conduct of Catiline, and I am even now prone to believe that
 there must after all have been something great and consequential
 in a man whom Cicero, the assiduous counsel of the majority, did
 not find it expedient to engage until affairs had taken such a
 turn that there was no longer any danger involved in the attack.
 It should also be remembered that there are few individuals in
 history whose renown has been more completely in the hands of
 enemies than that of Catiline.
 
 My drama was written during the hours of the night.  The leisure
 hours for my study I practically had to steal from my employer, a
 good and respectable man, occupied however heart and soul with
 his business, and from those stolen study hours I again stole
 moments for writing verse.  There was consequently scarcely
 anything else to resort to but the night.  I believe this is the
 unconscious reason that almost the entire action of the piece
 transpires at night.
 
 Naturally a fact so incomprehensible to my associates as that I
 busied myself with the writing of plays had to be kept secret;
 but a twenty-year old poet can hardly continue thus without
 anybody being privy to it, and I confided therefore to two
 friends of my own age what I was secretly engaged upon.
 
 The three of us pinned great expectations on _Catiline_ when
 it had been completed.  First and foremost it was now to be
 copied in order to be submitted under an assumed name to the
 theater in Christiania, and furthermore it was of course to be
 published.  One of my faithful and trusting friends undertook to
 prepare a handsome and legible copy of my uncorrected draft, a
 task which he performed with such a degree of conscientiousness
 that he did not omit even a single one of the innumerable dashes
 which I in the heat of composition had liberally interspersed
 throughout wherever the exact phrase did not for the moment occur
 to me.  The second of my friends, whose name I here mention since
 he is no longer among the living, Ole C. Schulerud, at that time
 a student, later a lawyer, went to Christiania with the
 transcript.  I still remember one of his letters in which he
 informed me that _Catiline_ had now been submitted to the
 theater; that it would soon be given a performance,--about that
 there could naturally be no doubt inasmuch as the management
 consisted of very discriminating men; and that there could be as
 little doubt that the booksellers of the town would one and all
 gladly pay a round fee for the first edition, the main point
 being, he thought, only to discover the one who would make the
 highest bid.
 
 After a long and tense period of waiting there began to appear in
 the meantime a few difficulties.  My friend had the piece
 returned from the management with a particularly polite but
 equally peremptory rejection.  He now took the manuscript from
 bookseller to bookseller; but all to a man expressed themselves
 to the same effect as the theatrical management.  The highest
 bidder demanded so and so much to publish the piece without any
 fee.
 
 All this, however, was far from lessening my friend's belief in
 victory.  He wrote to the contrary that it was best even so; I
 should come forward myself as the publisher of my drama; the
 necessary funds he would advance me; the profits we should divide
 in consideration of his undertaking the business end of the deal,
 except the proof-reading, which he regarded as superfluous in
 view of the handsome and legible manuscript the printers had to
 follow.  In a later letter he declared that, considering these
 promising prospects for the future, he contemplated abandoning
 his studies in order to consecrate himself completely to the
 publishing of my works; two or three plays a year, he thought, I
 should with ease be able to write, and according to a calculation
 of probabilities he had made he had discovered that with our
 surplus we should at no distant time be able to undertake the
 journey so often agreed upon or discussed, through Europe and the
 Orient.
 
 My journey was for the time being limited to Christiania.  I
 arrived there in the beginning of the spring of 1850 and just
 previous to my arrival _Catiline_ had appeared in the
 bookstalls.  The drama created a stir and awakened considerable
 interest among the students, but the critics dwelt largely on the
 faulty verses and thought the book in other respects immature.  A
 more appreciative judgment was uttered from but one single
 quarter, but this expression came from a man whose appreciation
 has always been dear to me and weighty and whom I herewith offer
 my renewed gratitude.  Not very many copies of the limited
 edition were sold; my friend had a good share of them in his
 custody, and I remember that one evening when our domestic
 arrangements heaped up for us insurmountable difficulties, this
 pile of printed matter was fortunately disposed of as waste paper
 to a huckster.  During the days immediately following we lacked
 none of the prime necessities of life.
 
 During my sojourn at home last summer and particularly since my
 return here there loomed up before me more clearly and more
 sharply than ever before the kaleidoscopic scenes of my literary
 life.  Among other things I also brought out _Catiline_.
 The contents of the book as regards details I had almost
 forgotten; but by reading it through anew I found that it
 nevertheless contained a great deal which I could still
 acknowledge, particularly if it be remembered that it is my first
 undertaking.  Much, around which my later writings center, the
 contradiction between ability and desire, between will and
 possibility, the intermingled tragedy and comedy in humanity and
 in the individual,--appeared already here in vague
 foreshadowings, and I conceived therefore the plan of preparing a
 new edition, a kind of jubilee-edition,--a plan to which my
 publisher with his usual readiness gave his approval.
 
 But it was naturally not enough simply to reprint without further
 ado the old original edition, for this is, as already pointed
 out, nothing but a copy of my imperfect and uncorrected concept
 or of the very first rough draft.  In the rereading of it I
 remembered clearly what I originally had had in mind, and I saw
 moreover that the form practically nowhere gave a satisfactory
 rendering of what I had wished.
 
 I determined therefore to revise this drama of my youth in a way
 in which I believe even at that time I should have been able to
 do it had the time been at my disposal and the circumstances more
 favorable for me.  The ideas, the conceptions, and the
 development of the whole, I have not on the other hand altered.
 The book has remained the original; only now it appears in a
 complete form.
 
 With this in mind I pray that my friends in Scandinavia and
 elsewhere will receive it; I pray that they will receive it as a
 greeting from me at the close of a period which to me has been
 full of changes and rich in contradictions.  Much of what I
 twenty-five years ago dreamed has been realized, even though not
 in the manner nor as soon as I then hoped.  Yet I believe now
 that it was best for me thus; I do not wish that any of that
 which lies between should have been untried, and if I look back
 upon what I have lived through I do so with thanks for everything
 and thanks to all.

 FIRST ACT
 
 [The Flaminian Way outside of Rome.  Off the road a
 wooded hillside.  In the background loom the walls and
 the heights of the city.  It is evening.]
 
 [CATILINE stands on the hill among the bushes, leaning
 against a tree.]
 
 CATILINE.  I must!  I must!  A voice deep in my soul
 Urges me on,--and I will heed its call.
 Courage I have and strength for something better,
 Something far nobler than this present life,--
 A series of unbridled dissipations--!
 No, no; they do not satisfy the yearning soul.
 
 CATILINE.  I rave and rave,--long only to forget.
 'Tis past now,--all is past!  Life has no aim.
 
 CATILINE.  [After a pause.]
 And what became of all my youthful dreams?
 Like flitting summer clouds they disappeared,
 Left naught behind but sorrow and remorse;--
 Each daring hope in turn fate robbed me of.
 
 [He strikes his forehead.]
 
 CATILINE.  Despise yourself!  Catiline, scorn yourself!
 You feel exalted powers in your soul;--
 And yet what is the goal of all your struggle?
 The surfeiting of sensual desires.
 
 CATILINE.  [More calmly.]
 But there are times, such as the present hour,
 When secret longings kindle in my breast.
 Ah, when I gaze on yonder city, Rome,
 The proud, the rich,--and when I see that ruin
 And wretchedness to which it now is sunk
 Loom up before me like the flaming sun,--
 Then loudly calls a voice within my soul:
 Up, Catiline;--awake and be a man!
 
 CATILINE.  [Abruptly.]  Ah, these are but delusions of the night,
 Mere dreaming phantoms born of solitude.
 At the slightest sound from grim reality,--
 They flee into the silent depths within.
 
 [The ambassadors of the Allobroges, AMBIORIX and OLLOVICO, with
 their Escort, come down the highway without noticing CATILINE.]
 
 AMBIORIX.  Behold our journey's end!  The walls of Rome!
 To heaven aspires the lofty Capitol.
 
 OLLOVICO.  So that is Rome?  Italy's overlord,
 Germany's soon,--and Gaul's as well, perchance.
 
 AMBIORIX.  Ah, yes, alas;--so it may prove betimes;
 The sovereign power of Rome is merciless;
 It crushes all it conquers, down to earth.
 Now shall we see what lot we may expect:
 If here be help against the wrongs at home,
 And peace and justice for our native land.
 
 OLLOVICO.  It will be granted us.
 
 AMBIORIX.  So let us hope;
 For we know nothing yet with certainty.
 
 OLLOVICO.  You fear somewhat, it seems?
 
 AMBIORIX.  And with good reason.
 Jealous was ever Rome of her great power.
 And bear in mind, this proud and haughty realm
 Is not by chieftains ruled, as is our land.
 At home the wise man or the warrior reigns,--
 The first in wisdom and in war the foremost;
 Him choose we as the leader of our people,
 As arbiter and ruler of our tribe.
 But here--
 
 CATILINE.  [Calls down to them.]
 --Here might and selfishness hold sway;--
 Intrigue and craft are here the keys to power.
 
 OLLOVICO.  Woe to us, brethren, woe!  He spies upon us.
 
 AMBIORIX.  [To CATILINE.]
 Is such the practice of the high-born Roman?
 A woman's trick we hold it in our nation.
 
 CATILINE.  [comes down on the road.]
 Ah, have no fear;--spying is not my business;
 By chance it was I heard your conversation.--
 Come you from Allobrogia far away?
 Justice you think to find in Rome?  Ah, never!
 Turn home again!  Here tyranny holds sway,
 And rank injustice lords it more than ever.
 Republic to be sure it is in name;
 And yet all men are slaves who cringe and cower,
 Vassals involved in debt, who must acclaim
 A venal senate--ruled by greed and power.
 Gone is the social consciousness of old,
 The magnanimity of former ages;--
 Security and life are favors sold,
 Which must be bargained for with hire and wages.
 Not righteousness, but power here holds sway;
 The noble man is lost among the gilded--
 
 AMBIORIX.  But say,--who then are you to tear away
 The pillars of the hope on which we builded?
 
 CATILINE.  A man who burns in freedom's holy zeal;
 An enemy of all unrighteous power;
 Friend of the helpless trodden under heel,--
 Eager to hurl the mighty from their tower.
 
 AMBIORIX.  The noble race of Rome--?  Ah, Roman, speak--
 Since we are strangers here you would deceive us?
 Is Rome no more the guardian of the weak,
 The dread of tyrants,--ready to relieve us?
 
 CATILINE.  [Points towards the city and speaks.]
 Behold the mighty Capitol that towers
 On yonder heights in haughty majesty.
 See, in the glow of evening how it lowers,
 Tinged with the last rays of the western sky.--
 So too Rome's evening glow is fast declining,
 Her freedom now is thraldom, dark as night.--
 Yet in her sky a sun will soon be shining,
 Before which darkness quick will take its flight.
 
 [He goes.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 [A colonnade in Rome.]
 
 [LENTULUS, STATILIUS, COEPARIUS, and CETHEGUS enter,
 in eager conversation.]
 
 COEPARIUS.  Yes, you are right; things go from bad to worse;
 And what the end will be I do not know.
 
 CETHEGUS.  Bah!  I am not concerned about the end.
 The fleeting moment I enjoy; each cup
 Of pleasure as it comes I empty,--letting
 All else go on to ruin as it will.
 
 LENTULUS.  Happy is he who can.  I am not blessed
 With your indifference, that can outface
 The day when nothing shall be left us more,
 Nothing with which to pay the final score.
 
 STATILIUS.  And not the faintest glimpse of better things!
 Yet it is true: a mode of life like ours--
 
 CETHEGUS.  Enough of that!
 
 LENTULUS.  Today because of debt
 The last of my inheritance was seized.
 
 CETHEGUS.  Enough of sorrow and complaint!  Come, friends!
 We'll drown them in a merry drinking bout!
 
 COEPARIUS.  Yes, let us drink.  Come, come, my merry comrades!
 
 LENTULUS.  A moment, friends; I see old Manlius yonder,--
 Seeking us out, I think, as is his wont.
 
 MANLIUS.  [Enters impetuously.]
 Confound the shabby dogs, the paltry scoundrels!
 Justice and fairness they no longer know!
 
 LENTULUS.  Come, what has happened?  Wherefore so embittered?
 
 STATILIUS.  Have usurers been plaguing you as well?
 
 MANLIUS.  Something quite different.  As you all know,
 I served with honor among Sulla's troops;
 A bit of meadow land was my reward.
 And when the war was at an end, I lived
 Thereon; it furnished me my daily bread.
 Now is it taken from me!  Laws decree--
 State property shall to the state revert
 For equal distribution.  Theft, I say,--
 It is rank robbery and nothing else!
 Their greed is all they seek to satisfy.
 
 COEPARIUS.  Thus with our rights they sport to please themselves.
 The mighty always dare do what they will.
 
 CETHEGUS.  [Gaily.]  Hard luck for Manlius!  Yet, a worse mishap
 Has come to me, as I shall now relate.
 Listen,--you know my pretty mistress, Livia,--
 The little wretch has broken faith with me,
 Just now when I had squandered for her sake
 The slender wealth that still remained to me.
 
 STATILIUS.  Extravagance--the cause of your undoing.
 
 CETHEGUS.  Well, as you please; but I will not forego
 My own desires; these, while the day is fair,
 To their full measure I will satisfy.
 
 MANLIUS.  And I who fought so bravely for the glory
 And might which now the vaunting tyrants boast!
 I shall--!  If but the brave old band were here,
 My comrades of the battlefield!  But no;
 The greater part of them, alas, is dead;
 The rest live scattering in many lands.--
 
 MANLIUS.  Oh, what are you, the younger blood, to them?
 You bend and cringe before authority;
 You dare not break the chains that bind you fast;
 You suffer patiently this life of bondage!
 
 LENTULUS.  By all the Gods,--although indeed he taunts us,
 Yet, Romans, is there truth in what he says.
 
 CETHEGUS.  Oh, well,--what of it?  He is right, we grant,
 But where shall we begin?  Ay, there's the rub.
 
 LENTULUS.  Yes, it is true.  Too long have we endured
 This great oppression.  Now--now is the time
 To break the bonds asunder that injustice
 And vain ambition have about us forged.
 
 STATILIUS.  Ah, Lentulus, I understand.  Yet hold;
 For such a thing we need a mighty leader,--
 With pluck and vision.  Where can he be found?
 
 LENTULUS.  I know a man who has the power to lead us.
 
 MANLIUS.  Ah, you mean Catiline?
 
 LENTULUS.  The very man.
 
 CETHEGUS.  Yes, Catiline perchance is just the man.
 
 MANLIUS.  I know him well.  I was his father's friend;
 Many a battle side by side we fought.
 Often his young son went with him to war.
 Even his early years were wild and headstrong;
 Yet he gave open proof of rare endowments,--
 His mind was noble, dauntless was his courage.
 
 LENTULUS.  We'll find him, as I think, most prompt and willing.
 I met him late this evening much depressed;
 He meditates in secret some bold plan;--
 Some desperate scheme he long has had in mind.
 
 STATILIUS.  No doubt; the consulate he long has sought.
 
 LENTULUS.  His efforts are in vain; his enemies
 Have madly raged against him in the senate;--
 He was himself among them; full of wrath
 He left the council--brooding on revenge.
 
 STATILIUS.  Then will he surely welcome our proposal.
 
 LENTULUS.  I hope so.  Yet must we in secret weigh
 Our enterprise.  The time is opportune.
 
 [They go.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 [In the Temple of Vesta in Rome.  On an altar in the
 background burns a lamp with the sacred fire.]
 
 [CATILINE, followed by CURIUS, comes stealing in
 between the pillars.]
 
 CURIUS.  What, Catiline,--you mean to bring me here?
 In Vesta's temple!
 
 CATILINE.  [Laughing.]  Well, yes; so you see!
 
 CURIUS.  Ye gods,--what folly!  On this very day
 Has Cicero denounced you in the council;
 And yet you dare--
 
 CATILINE.  Oh, let that be forgotten!
 
 CURIUS.  You are in danger, and forget it thus--
 By rushing blindly into some new peril.
 
 CATILINE.  [Gaily.]  Well, change is my delight.  I never knew
 Ere now a vestal's love,--forbidden fruit;--
 Wherefore I came to try my fortune here.
 
 CURIUS.  What,--here, you say?  Impossible!  A jest!
 
 CATILINE.  A jest?  Why, yes,--as all my loving is.
 And yet I was in earnest when I spoke.
 During the recent games I chanced to see
 The priestesses in long and pompous train.
 By accident I cast my roving eye
 On one of them,--and with a hasty glance
 She met my gaze.  It pierced me to the soul.
 Ah, the expression in those midnight eyes
 I never saw before in any woman.
 
 CURIUS.  Yes, yes, I know.  But speak--what followed
 then?
 
 CATILINE.  A way into the temple I have found,
 And more than once I've seen and spoken to her.
 Oh, what a difference between this woman
 And my Aurelia!
 
 CURIUS.  And you love them both
 At once?  No,--that I cannot understand.
 
 CATILINE.  Yes, strange, indeed; I scarcely understand myself.
 And yet--I love them both, as you have said.
 But oh, how vastly different is this love!
 The one is kind: Aurelia often lulls
 With soothing words my soul to peace and rest;--
 But Furia--.  Come, away; some one approaches.
 
 [They hide themselves among the pillars.]
 
 FURIA.  [Enters from the opposite side.]
 Oh, hated walls,--witnesses of my anguish.
 Home of the torment I must suffer still!
 My hopes and cherished aspirations languish
 Within my bosom,--now with feverish chill
 Pervaded, now with all the heat of passion,
 More hot and burning than yon vestal fire.
 
 FURIA.  Ah, what a fate!  And what was my transgression
 That chained me to this temple-prison dire,--
 That robbed my life of every youthful pleasure,--
 In life's warm spring each innocent delight?
 
 FURIA.  Yet tears I shall not shed in undue measure;
 Hatred and vengeance shall my heart excite.
 
 CATILINE.  [Comes forward.]
 Not even for me, my Furia, do you cherish
 Another feeling,--one more mild than this?
 
 FURIA.  Ye gods! you, reckless man,--you here again?
 Do you not fear to come--?
 
 CATILINE.  I know no fear.
 'Twas always my delight to mock at danger.
 
 FURIA.  Oh, splendid!  Such is also my delight;--
 This peaceful temple here I hate the more,
 Because I live in everlasting calm,
 And danger never lurks within its walls.
 
 FURIA.  Oh, this monotonous, inactive life,
 A life faint as the flicker of the lamp--!
 How cramped a field it is for all my sum
 Of fervid longings and far-reaching plans!
 Oh, to be crushed between these narrow walls;--
 Life here grows stagnant; every hope is quenched;
 The day creeps slowly on in drowsiness,--
 And not one single thought is turned to deeds.
 
 CATILINE.  O Furia, strange, in truth, is your complaint!
 It seems an echo out of my own soul,--
 As if with flaming script you sought to paint
 My every longing towards a worthy goal.
 Rancour and hate in my soul likewise flourish;
 My heart--as yours--hate tempers into steel;
 I too was robbed of hopes I used to nourish;
 An aim in life I now no longer feel.
 
 CATILINE.  In silence still I mask my grief, my want;
 And none can guess what smoulders in my breast.
 They scoff and sneer at me,--these paltry things;
 They can not grasp how high my bosom beats
 For right and freedom, all the noble thoughts
 That ever stirred within a Roman mind.
 
 FURIA.  I knew it!  Ah, your soul, and yours alone,
 Is born for me,--thus clearly speaks a voice
 That never fails and never plays me false.
 Then come!  Oh, come--and let us heed the call.
 
 CATILINE.  What do you mean, my sweet enthusiast?
 
 FURIA.  Come,--let us leave this place, flee far away,
 And seek a new and better fatherland.
 Here is the spirit's lofty pride repressed;
 Here baseness smothers each auspicious spark
 Ere it can break into a burning flame.
 Come, let us fly;--lo, to the free-born mind
 The world's wide compass is a fatherland!
 
 CATILINE.  Oh, irresistibly you lure me on--
 
 FURIA.  Come, let us use the present moment then!
 High o'er the hills, beyond the sea's expanse,--
 Far, far from Rome we first will stay our journey.
 Thousands of friends will follow you outright;
 In foreign lands we shall a home design;
 There shall we rule; 'twill there be brought to light
 That no hearts ever beat as yours and mine.
 
 CATILINE.  Oh, wonderful!--But flee?  Why must we flee?
 Here too our love for freedom can be nourished;
 Here also is a field for thought and action,
 As vast as any that your soul desires.
 
 FURIA.  Here, do you say?  Here, in this paltry Rome,
 Where naught exists but thraldom and oppression?
 Ah, Lucius, are you likewise one of those
 Who can Rome's past recall without confession
 Of shame?  Who ruled here then?  Who rule to-day?
 Then an heroic race--and now a rabble,
 The slaves of other slaves--
 
 CATILINE.  Mock me you may;--
 Yet know,--to save Rome's freedom from this babble,
 To see yet once again her vanished splendor,
 Gladly I should, like Curtius, throw myself
 Into the abyss--
 
 FURIA.  I trust you, you alone;
 Your eyes glow bright; I know you speak the truth.
 Yet go; the priestesses will soon appear;
 Their wont it is to meet here at this hour.
 
 CATILINE.  I go; but only to return again.
 A magic power binds me to your side;--
 So proud a woman have I never seen.
 
 FURIA.  [With a wild smile.]  Then pledge me this; and
 swear that you will keep
 Whatever you may promise.  Will you, Lucius?
 
 CATILINE.  I will do aught my Furia may require;
 Command me,--tell me what am I to promise.
 
 FURIA.  Then listen.  Though I dwell a captive here,
 I know there lives a man somewhere in Rome
 Whom I have sworn deep enmity to death--
 And hatred even beyond the gloomy grave.
 
 CATILINE.  And then--?
 
 FURIA.  Then swear, my enemy shall be
 Your enemy till death.  Will you, my Lucius?
 
 CATILINE.  I swear it here by all the mighty gods!
 I swear it by my father's honored name
 And by my mother's memory--!  But, Furia,--
 What troubles you?  Your eyes are wildly flaming,--
 And white as marble, deathlike, are your cheeks.
 
 FURIA.  I do not know myself.  A fiery stream
 Flows through my veins.  Swear to the end your oath!
 
 CATILINE.  Oh, mighty powers, pour out upon this head
 Your boundless fury, let your lightning wrath
 Annihilate me, if I break my oath;
 Aye, like a demon I shall follow him!
 
 FURIA.  Enough!  I trust you.  Ah, my heart is eased.
 In your hand now indeed rests my revenge.
 
 CATILINE.  It shall be carried out.  But tell me this,--
 Who is your foe?  And what was his transgression?
 
 FURIA.  Close by the Tiber, far from the city's tumult,
 My cradle stood; it was a quiet home!
 A sister much beloved lived with me there,
 A chosen vestal from her childhood days.--
 Then came a coward to our distant valley;--
 He saw the fair, young priestess of the future--
 
 CATILINE.  [Surprised.]  A priestess?  Tell me--!  Speak--!
 
 FURIA.  He ravished her.
 She sought a grave beneath the Tiber's stream.
 
 CATILINE.  [Uneasy.]  You know him?
 
 FURIA.  I have never seen the man.
 When first I heard the tidings, all was past.
 His name is all I know.
 
 CATILINE.  Then speak it out!
 
 FURIA.  Now is it famed.  His name is Catiline.
 
 CATILINE.  [Taken aback.]
 What do you say?  Oh, horrors!  Furia, speak--!
 
 FURIA.  Calm yourself!  What perturbs you?  You grow pale.
 My Lucius,--is this man perhaps your friend?
 
 CATILINE.  My friend?  Ah, Furia, no;--no longer now.
 For I have cursed,--and sworn eternal hate
 Against myself.
 
 FURIA.  You--you are Catiline?
 
 CATILINE.  Yes, I am he.
 
 FURIA.  My Sylvia you disgraced?
 Nemesis then indeed has heard my prayer;--
 Vengeance you have invoked on your own head!
 Woe on you, man of violence!  Woe!
 
 CATILINE.  How blank
 The stare is in your eye.  Like Sylvia's shade
 You seem to me in this dim candle light.
 
 [He rushes out; the lamp with the sacred fire goes out.]
 
 FURIA.  [After a pause.]  Yes, now I understand it.  From my eyes
 The veil is fallen,--in the dark I see.
 Hatred it was that settled in my breast,
 When first I spied him in the market-place.
 A strange emotion; like a crimson flame!
 Ah, he shall know what such a hate as mine,
 Constantly brewing, never satisfied,
 Can fashion out in ruin and revenge!
 
 A VESTAL.  [Enters.]  Go, Furia, go; your watch is at an end;
 Therefore I came--.  Yet, sacred goddess, here--
 Woe unto you!  The vestal fire is dead!
 
 FURIA.  [Bewildered.]
 Dead, did you say?  So bright it never burned;--
 'Twill never, never die!
 
 THE VESTAL.  Great heavens,--what is this?
 
 FURIA.  The fires of hate are not thus lightly quenched!
 Behold, love bursts forth of a sudden,--dies
 Within the hour; but hate--
 
 THE VESTAL.  By all the gods,--
 This is sheer madness!
 
 [Calls out.]
 
 THE VESTAL.  Come!  Oh, help!  Come, help!
 
 [VESTALS and temple SERVANTS rush in.]
 
 SOME.  What is amiss?
 
 OTHERS.  The vestal fire is dead!
 
 FURIA.  But hate burns on; revenge still blazes high!
 
 THE VESTALS.  Away with her to trial and punishment!
 
 [They carry her out between them.]
 
 CURIUS.  [Comes forward.]
 To prison now they take her.  Thence to death.--
 No, no, by all the gods, this shall not be!
 Must she, most glorious of womankind,
 Thus perish in disgrace, entombed alive?--
 Oh, never have I felt so strangely moved.
 Is this then love?  Yes, love it is indeed.--
 Then shall I set her free!--But Catiline?
 With hate and vengeance will she follow him.
 Has he maligners not enough already?
 Dare I still others to their number add?
 He was to me as were an elder brother;
 And gratitude now bids me that I shield him.--
 But what of love?  Ah, what does it command?
 And should he quake, the fearless Catiline,
 Before the intrigues of a woman?  No;--
 Then to the rescue work this very hour!
 Wait, Furia;--I shall drag you from your grave
 To life again,--though at the risk of death!
 
 [He goes away quickly.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 [A room in CATILINE's house.]
 
 CATILINE.  [Enters impetuous and uneasy.]
 "Nemesis then indeed has heard my prayer,
 Vengeance you have invoked on your own head!"
 Such were the words from the enchantress' lips.
 Remarkable!  Perchance it was a sign,--
 A warning of what time will bring to me.
 
 CATILINE.  Now therefore I have pledged myself on oath
 The blood avenger of my own misdeed.
 Ah, Furia,--still I seem to see your eye,
 Wildly aflame like that of death's own goddess!
 Your words still echo hollow in my ears;--
 The oath I shall remember all my life.
 
 [During the following AURELIA enters and approaches him
 unnoticed.]
 
 CATILINE.  Yet, it is folly now to go on brooding
 Upon this nonsense; it is nothing else.
 Far better things there are to think upon;
 A greater work awaits my energies.
 The restless age is urgent with its plea;
 Toward this I must direct my thought in season;
 Of hope and doubt I am a stormy sea--
 
 AURELIA.  [Seizes his hand.]
 And may not your Aurelia know the reason?
 May she not know what moves within your breast,
 What stirs therein and rages with such madness?
 May she not cheer and soothe your soul to rest,
 And banish from your brow its cloud of sadness?
 
 CATILINE.  [Tenderly.]  O, my Aurelia,--O, how kind and tender--.
 Yet why should I embitter all your life?
 Why should I share with you my many sorrows?
 For my sake you have borne enough of anguish.
 Henceforth upon my own head I shall bear
 What ill-designing fate allotted me,--
 The curse that lies in such a soul as mine,
 Full of great spiritual energies,
 Of fervent longings for a life of deeds,
 Yet dwarfed in all its work by sordid cares.--
 Must you, too, sharing in my wretched life,
 Bitter with blasted hopes, then with me perish?
 
 AURELIA.  To comfort is the role of every wife,
 Though dreams of greatness she may never cherish.
 When the man, struggling for his lofty dream,
 Reaps nothing but adversity and sorrow,--
 Her words to him then sweet and tender seem,
 And give him strength sufficient for the morrow;
 And then he sees that even the quiet life
 Has pleasures which the most tumultuous lacks.
 
 CATILINE.  Yes, you are right; I know it all too well.
 And yet I cannot tear myself away.
 A ceaseless yearning surges in my breast,--
 Which only life's great tumult now can quiet.
 
 AURELIA.  Though your Aurelia be not all to you,--
 Though she can never still your restless soul,--
 Your heart yet open to a gentle word,
 A word of comfort from your loving wife.
 Though she may never slake your fiery thirst,
 Nor follow in their flight your noble thoughts,--
 Know this, that she can share your every sorrow,
 Has strength and fortitude to ease your burden.
 
 CATILINE.  Then listen, dear Aurelia; you shall hear
 What has of late depressed so deep my spirits.
 You know, I long have sought the consulate--
 Without avail.  You know the whole affair--
 How to increase the votes for my election,
 I have expended--
 
 AURELIA.  Catiline, no more;
 You torture me--
 
 CATILINE.  Do you too blame my course?
 What better means therefor had I to choose?--
 In vain I lavished all that I possessed;
 My one reward was mockery and shame.
 Now in the senate has my adversary,
 The crafty Cicero, trampled me to earth.
 His speech was a portrayal of my life,
 So glaring that I, even I, must gasp.
 In every look I read dismay and fear;
 With loathing people speak of Catiline;
 To races yet unborn my name will be
 A symbol of a low and dreadful union
 Of sensuality and wretchedness,
 Of scorn and ridicule for what is noble.--
 And there will be no deed to purge this name
 And crush to earth the lies that have been told!
 Each will believe whatever rumor tells--
 
 AURELIA.  But I, dear husband, trust no such reports.
 Let the whole world condemn you if it will;
 And let it heap disgrace upon your head;--
 I know you hide within your inmost soul
 A seed that still can blossom and bear fruit.
 Only it cannot burst forth here in Rome;
 Poisonous weeds would quickly prove the stronger.
 Let us forsake this degradation's home;--
 What binds you here?  Why should we dwell here longer?
 
 CATILINE.  I should forsake the field,--and go away?
 I should my greatest dreams in life surrender?
 The drowning man still clutches firm and fast
 The broken spars--though hope is frail and slender;
 And should the wreck be swallowed in the deep,
 And the last hope of rescue fail forever,--
 Still clings he to the lone remaining spar,
 And sinks with it in one last vain endeavor.
 
 AURELIA.  But should a kindly seacoast smile on him,
 With groves all green along the rolling billows,
 Hope then awakens in his heart again,--
 He struggles inward, toward the silvery willows.
 There reigns a quiet peace; 'tis beautiful;
 There roll the waves, in silence, without number;
 His heated brow sweet evening breezes cool,
 As weary-limbed he rests himself in slumber;
 Each sorrow-laden cloud they drive away;
 A restful calm his weary mind assuages;--
 There he finds shelter and prolongs his stay
 And soon forgets the sorry by-gone ages.
 The distant echo of the world's unrest
 Alone can reach his dwelling unfrequented.
 It does not break the calm within his breast;--
 It makes his soul more happy and contented;
 It calls to mind the by-gone time of strife,
 Its shattered hopes and its unbridled pleasures;
 He finds twice beautiful this quiet life--
 And would not change it for the greatest treasures.
 
 CATILINE.  You speak the truth; and in this very hour
 From strife and tumult I could go with you.
 But can you name me some such quiet spot,
 Where we can live in shelter and in peace?
 
 AURELIA.  [Joyful.]  You will go, Catiline?  What happiness,--
 Oh, richer than my bosom can contain!
 Let it be so, then!  Come!  This very night
 We'll go away--
 
 CATILINE.  But whither shall we go?
 Name me the spot where I may dare to rest
 My head in homely peace!
 
 AURELIA.  How can you ask?
 Have you forgot our villa in the country,
 Wherein I passed my childhood days, where since,
 Enraptured during love's first happy dawn,
 We two spent many a blithesome summer day?
 Where was the grass indeed so green as there?
 Where else the groves so shady and sweet-smelling?
 The snow-white villa from its wooded lair
 Peeps forth and bids us there to make our dwelling.
 There let us flee and dedicate our life
 To rural duties and to sweet contentment;--
 You will find comfort in a loving wife,
 And through her kisses banish all resentment.
 
 [Smiling.]
 
 AURELIA.  And when with all the flowers of the land
 You come to me, your sovereign, in my bowers,
 Then shall I crown you with the laurel band,
 And cry, All hail to you, my king of flowers!--
 But why do you grow pale?  Wildly you press
 My hand,--and strangely now your eyes are glowing--
 
 CATILINE.  Aurelia, alas, past is your happiness;--
 There we can never, never think of going.
 There we can never go!
 
 AURELIA.  You frighten me!
 Yet, surely,--you are jesting, Catiline?
 
 CATILINE.  I jest!  Would only that it were a jest!
 Each word you speak, like the avenging dart
 Of Nemesis, pierces my heavy heart,
 Which fate will never grant a moment's rest.
 
 AURELIA.  O gods! speak, speak!  What do you mean?
 
 CATILINE.  See here!
 Here is your villa,--here your future joys!
 
 [He draws out a purse filled with gold and throws it on the
 table.]
 
 AURELIA.  Oh, you have sold--?
 
 CATILINE.  Yes,--all I sold today;--
 And to what end?  In order to corrupt--
 
 AURELIA.  O Catiline, no more!  Let us not think
 On this affair; sorrow is all it brings.
 
 CATILINE.  Your quiet-patience wounds me tenfold more
 Than would a cry of anguish from your lips!
 
 [An old SOLDIER enters and approaches CATILINE.]
 
 THE SOLDIER.  Forgive me, master, that thus unannounced
 I enter your abode at this late hour.
 Ah, be not wroth--
 
 CATILINE.  What is your errand here?
 
 THE SOLDIER.  My errand here is but a humble prayer,
 Which you will hear.  I am a needy man,
 One who has sacrificed his strength for Rome.
 Now I am feeble, can no longer serve;
 Unused my weapons rust away at home.
 The hope of my old age was in a son,
 Who labored hard and was my one support.
 Alas,--in prison now he's held for debt.
 And not a ray of hope--.  Oh, help me, master!
 
 [Kneeling.]
 
 THE SOLDIER.  If but a penny!  I have gone on foot
 From house to house; each door is long since closed.
 I know not what to do--
 
 CATILINE.  The paltry knaves!
 A picture this is of the many's want.
 Thus they reward the old brave company.
 No longer gratitude is found in Rome!
 Time was I might have wished in righteous wrath
 To punish them with sword and crimson flames;
 But tender words have just been spoken here;
 My soul is moved; I do not wish to punish;--
 To ease misfortune likewise is a deed.--
 Take this, old warrior;--clear with this your debt.
 
 [He hands him the purse with the gold.]
 
 THE SOLDIER.  [Rising.]
 O gracious lord,--dare I believe your words?
 
 CATILINE.  Yes; but be quick, old man; go free your son.
 
 [The SOLDIER goes hurriedly out.]
 
 CATILINE.  A better use,--not so, Aurelia dear?--
 Than bribery and purchasing of votes?
 Noble it is to crush the tyrant's might;
 Yet quiet solace too has its reward.
 
 AURELIA.  [Throws herself in his arms.]
 Oh, rich and noble is your spirit still.
 Yes,--now I know my Catiline again.
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 [An underground tomb with a freshly walled-in passage
 high on the rear wall.  A lamp burns faintly.]
 
 [FURIA, in long black robes, is standing in the tomb
 as if listening.]
 
 FURIA.  A hollow sound.  'Tis thunder rolls above.
 I hear its rumble even in the tomb.
 Yet is the tomb itself so still--so still!
 Am I forever damned to drowsy rest?
 Never again am I to wander forth
 By winding paths, as ever was my wish?
 
 FURIA.  [After a pause.]
 A strange, strange life it was;--as strange a fate.
 Meteor-like all came--and disappeared.
 He met me.  A mysterious magic force,
 An inner harmony, together drew us.
 I was his Nemesis;--and he my victim;--
 Yet punishment soon followed the avenger.
 
 FURIA.  [Another pause.]
 Now daylight rules the earth.--Am I perchance
 To slip--unknowing--from the realm of light?
 'Tis well, if so it be,--if this delay
 Within the tomb be nothing but a flight
 Upon the wings of lightning into Hades,--
 If I be nearing even now the Styx!
 There roll the leaden billows on the shore;
 There silently old Charon plies his boat.
 Soon am I there!  Then shall I seat myself
 Beside the ferry,--question every spirit,
 Each fleeting shadow from the land of life,
 As light of foot he nears the river of death,--
 Shall ask each one in turn how Catiline
 Fares now among the mortals of the earth,--
 Shall ask each one how he has kept his oath.
 I shall illumine with blue sulphur light
 Each spectral countenance and hollow eye,--
 To ascertain if it be Catiline.
 And when he comes, then shall I follow him;--
 Together we shall make the journey hence,
 Together enter Pluto's silent hall.
 I too a shadow shall his shade pursue;--
 Where Catiline is, must Furia also be!
 
 FURIA.  [After a pause, more faintly.]
 The air is growing close and clammy here,--
 And every breath in turn more difficult.--
 Thus am I drawing near the gloomy swamps,
 Where creep the rivers of the underworld.
 
 FURIA.  [She listens; a dull noise is heard.]
 A muffled sound?  'Tis like the stroke of oars.
 It is the ferryman of shades who comes
 To take me hence.  No, here--here will I wait!
 
 [The stones in the freshly walled-in passage are broken asunder.
 CURIUS comes into view on the outside; he beckons to her.]
 
 FURIA.  Ah, greetings, Charon!  Are you ready now
 To lead me hence, a guest among the spirits?
 Here will I wait!
 
 CURIUS.  [Whispering.]  I come to set you free!
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 
 SECOND ACT
 
 [A room in CATILINE's house with a colonnade in the
 rear; a lamp lights up the room.]
 
 [CATILINE paces the floor back and forth; LENTULUS and
 CETHEGUS are with him.]
 
 CATILINE.  No, no!  I say, you do not understand
 Yourselves what you demand of me.  Should I
 Turn traitor and incite a civil war,--
 Besmear my hand with Roman blood?  No, no!
 I'll never do it!  Let the entire state
 Condemn me if--
 
 LENTULUS.  You will not, Catiline?
 
 CATILINE.  No.
 
 LENTULUS.  Tell me,--have you nothing to avenge?
 No insult?  No one here you fain would strike?
 
 CATILINE.  Let him who will avenge; I shall not stir.
 Yet silent scorn is likewise a revenge;--
 And that alone shall be enough.
 
 CETHEGUS.  Aha,--
 Our visit was, I see, inopportune.
 Yet doubtless will the morrow bring you back
 To other thoughts.
 
 CATILINE.  But why the morrow?
 
 CETHEGUS.  There are mysterious rumors in the air.
 A vestal recently was led to death--
 
 CATILINE.  [Surprised.]
 A vestal,--say you?  Ah, what do you mean?
 
 LENTULUS.  Why, yes, a vestal.  Many people murmur--
 
 CATILINE.  What do they murmur?
 
 CETHEGUS.  That in this dark affair
 You are not altogether innocent.
 
 CATILINE.  This they believe of me?
 
 LENTULUS.  Such is the rumor;
 Of course,--to us, to all your good old friends,
 Such talk is trifling and of no account;--
 The world, however, judges more severely.
 
 CATILINE.  [Deep in thought.]  And is she dead?
 
 CETHEGUS.  Undoubtedly she is.
 An hour's confinement in the convict tomb
 Is quite enough--
 
 LENTULUS.  That is not our affair.
 It was not therefore that we spoke of her.
 But hear me, Catiline!  Bethink yourself.
 You sought the consulate; and all your welfare
 Hung on that single fragile thread of hope.
 Now is it sundered; everything is lost.
 
 CATILINE.  [Still deep in thought.]
 "Vengeance you have invoked on your own head!"
 
 CETHEGUS.  Shake off these useless thoughts; they profit naught;
 Act like a man; still can this fight be won;
 A bold resolve now--; you have friends enough;
 Speak but the word, and we shall follow you.--
 You are not tempted?  Answer!
 
 CATILINE.  No, I say!
 And why are you so eager to conspire?
 Be honest!  Are you driven by thirst for freedom?
 Is it in order to renew Rome's splendor
 That you would ruin all?
 
 LENTULUS.  Indeed, 'tis not;
 Yet surely is the hope of personal greatness
 Sufficient motive for our enterprise!
 
 CETHEGUS.  And means enough to taste the joys of life
 Are not, in truth, to be so lightly scorned.
 That is my motive;--I am not ambitious.
 
 CATILINE.  I knew it.  Only mean and paltry motives,
 The hope of private vantage, urge you on.
 No, no, my friends; I aimed at nobler things!
 True, I have sought with bribes and promises
 To seize ere now the consulate, and yet
 My plan was greater and comprised much more
 Than means like these would point to.  Civic freedom,
 The welfare of the state,--these were my aims.
 Men have misjudged, appearances belied me;
 My fate has willed it so.  It must so be!
 
 CETHEGUS.  True;  but the thought of all your many friends
 Whom you can save from ruin and disgrace--?
 You know, we shall ere long be driven to take
 The beggars' staff because of our wild living.
 
 CATILINE.  Then stop in season; that is my resolve.
 
 LENTULUS.  What, Catiline,--now you intend to change
 Your mode of life?  Ha, ha! you surely jest?
 
 CATILINE.  I am in earnest,--by the mighty gods!
 
 CETHEGUS.  Then there is nothing we can do with him.
 Come, Lentulus, the others we'll inform
 What answer he has given.  We shall find
 The merry company with Bibulus.
 
 CATILINE.  With Bibulus?  How many a merry night
 We have caroused at Bibulus' table!
 Now is the tempest of my wild life ended;
 Ere dawns the day I shall have left the city.
 
 LENTULUS.  What is all this?
 
 CETHEGUS.  You mean to go away?
 
 CATILINE.  This very night my wife and I together
 Shall bid farewell to Rome forevermore.
 In quiet Gaul we two shall found a home;--
 The land I cultivate shall nourish us.
 
 CETHEGUS.  You will forsake the city, Catiline?
 
 CATILINE.  I will; I must!  Disgrace here weighs me down.
 Courage I have to bear my poverty,
 But in each Roman face to read disdain
 And frank contempt--!  No, no; that is too much!
 In Gaul I'll live in quiet solitude;
 There shall I soon forget my former self,
 Dull all my longings for the greater things,
 And as the vaguest dream recall the past.
 
 LENTULUS.  Then fare you well; may fortune follow you!
 
 CETHEGUS.  Remember us with kindness, Catiline,
 As we shall you remember!  To our brothers
 We will relate this new and strange resolve.
 
 CATILINE.  Then give them all a brother's hearty greeting!
 
 [LENTULUS and CETHEGUS leave.]
 
 [AURELIA has entered from the side, hut-stops frightened at the
 sight of those who are leaving; when they are gone she
 approaches CATILINE.]
 
 AURELIA.  [Gently reprimanding.]
 Again these stormy comrades in your house?
 O Catiline--!
 
 CATILINE.  This was their final visit.
 I bade them all farewell.  Now every bond
 Forevermore is broken that bound me fast
 And fettered me to Rome.
 
 AURELIA.  I've gathered up
 Our bit of property.  Not much perhaps;--
 Yet, Catiline, enough for our contentment.
 
 CATILINE.  [Engrossed in thought.]
 More than enough for me who squandered all.
 
 AURELIA.  Oh, brood no more on things we can not change;--
 Forget what--
 
 CATILINE.  Happy he who could forget,--
 Who could the memory tear from out his soul,
 The many hopes, the goal of all desires.
 Ah, time is needed ere I reach that state;
 But I shall struggle--
 
 AURELIA.  I shall help you strive;
 You shall be comforted for all your loss.
 Yet we must leave as soon as possible.
 Here life calls to you with a tempter's voice.
 Is it not so,--we go this very night?
 
 CATILINE.  Yes, yes,--we leave this very night, Aurelia!
 
 AURELIA.  The little money left I've gathered up;
 And for the journey it will be enough.
 
 CATILINE.  Good!  I shall sell my sword and buy a spade.
 What value henceforth is a sword to me?
 
 AURELIA.  You clear the land, and I shall till the soil.
 Around our home will grow in floral splendor
 A hedge of roses, sweet forget-me-nots,
 The silent tokens of a chastened soul,
 When as some youthful comrade you can greet
 Each memory recurrent of the past.
 
 CATILINE.  That time, Aurelia?  Ah, beloved, I fear--
 That hour lies in a distant future's keeping.
 
 CATILINE.  [In a milder tone.]
 But go, dear wife, and, while you may, repose.
 Soon after midnight we shall start our journey.
 The city then is lapped in deepest slumber,
 And none shall guess our hidden destination.
 The first glow in the morning sky shall find us
 Far--far away; there in the laurel grove
 We'll rest ourselves upon the velvet grass.
 
 AURELIA.  A new life opens up before us both--
 Richer in happiness than this that's ended.
 Now will I go.  An hour's quiet rest
 Will give me strength--.  Good-night, my Catiline!
 
 [She embraces him and goes out.]
 
 CATILINE.  [Gazes after her.]
 Now is she gone!  And I--what a relief!
 Now can I cast away this wearisome
 Hypocrisy, this show of cheerfulness,
 Which least of all is found within my heart.
 She is my better spirit.  She would grieve
 Were she to sense my doubt.  I must dissemble.
 Yet shall I consecrate this silent hour
 To contemplation of my wasted life.--
 This lamp,--ah, it disturbs my very thoughts;--
 Dark it must be here,--dark as is my soul!
 
 [He puts out the light; the moon shines through the pillars in
 the rear.]
 
 CATILINE.
 Too light,--yes, still too light!  And yet, no matter;--
 The pallid moonlight here does well befit
 The twilight and the gloom that shroud my soul,--
 Have ever shrouded all my earthly ways.
 
 CATILINE.  Hm, Catiline, then is this day your last;
 Tomorrow morning you will be no longer
 The Catiline you hitherto have been.
 Distant in barren Gaul my life shall run
 Its course, unknown as is a forest stream.--
 Now am I wakened from those many visions
 Of power, of greatness, of a life of deeds;--
 They vanished like the dew; in my dark soul
 They struggled long and died,--unseen of men.
 
 CATILINE.  Ah, it is not this dull and drowsy life,
 Far from all mundane tumult, that affrights me.
 If only for a moment I could shine,
 And blaze in splendor like a shooting star,--
 If only by a glorious deed I could
 Immortalize the name of Catiline
 With everlasting glory and renown,--
 Then gladly should I, in the hour of triumph,
 Forsake all things,--flee to a foreign strand;--
 I'd plunge the dagger in my exiled heart,
 Die free and happy; for I should have lived!
 
 CATILINE.  But oh,--to die without first having lived.
 Can that be possible?  Shall I so die?
 
 [With uplifted hands.]
 
 CATILINE.  A hint, oh angry powers,--that it is
 My fate to disappear from life forgotten,
 Without a trace!
 
 FURIA.  [Outside behind the pillars.]  It is not, Catiline!
 
 CATILINE.  [Taken aback.]
 Who speaks?  What warning voice is this I hear?
 A spirit voice from out the underworld!
 
 FURIA.  [Comes forward in the moonlight.]  I am your shadow.
 
 CATILINE.  [Terrified.]  What,--the vestal's ghost!
 
 FURIA.  Deep must your soul have sunk if you recoil
 From me!
 
 CATILINE.  Speak!  Have you risen from the grave
 With hatred and with vengeance to pursue me?
 
 FURIA.  Pursue you,--did you say?  I am your shadow.
 I must be with you wheresoe'er you go.
 
 [She comes nearer.]
 
 CATILINE.  She lives!  O gods,--then it is she,--no other,
 No disembodied ghost.
 
 FURIA.  Or ghost or not,--
 It matters little; I must follow you.
 
 CATILINE.  With mortal hate!
 
 FURIA.  Hate ceases in the grave,
 As love and all the passions do that flourish
 Within an earthly soul.  One thing alone
 In life and death remains unchangeable.
 
 CATILINE.  And what?  Say forth!
 
 FURIA.  Your fate, my Catiline!
 
 CATILINE.  Only the gods of wisdom know my fate,--
 No human being.
 
 FURIA.  Yet I know your fate.
 I am your shadow;--strange, mysterious ties
 Bind us together.
 
 CATILINE.  Bonds of hatred.
 
 FURIA.  No!
 Rose ever spirit from the dankest grave
 For hate and vengeance?  Listen, Catiline!
 The rivers of the underworld have quenched
 Each earthly flame that raged within my breast.
 As you behold me here, I am no longer
 The stormy Furia,--wild and passionate,--
 Whom once you loved--
 
 CATILINE.  You do not hate me then?
 
 FURIA.  Ah, now no more.  When in the tomb I stood,--
 And faltered on the path that separates
 This life from death, at any moment ready
 To greet the underworld,--lo, seized me then
 An eerie shuddering; I know not what--;
 I felt in me a mystic transformation;--
 Away flowed hate, revenge, my very soul;
 Each memory vanished and each earthly longing;--
 Only the name of "Catiline" remains
 Written in fiery letters on my heart.
 
 CATILINE.  Ah, wonderful!  No matter who you are,--
 A human form, a shadow from the dead,--
 There lies withal a dreadful fascination
 In your dark eyes, in every word you speak.
 
 FURIA.  Your mind is strong as mine; yet you give up,
 Disheartened and irresolute, each hope
 Of triumph and dominion.  You forsake
 The battlefield, where all your inmost plans
 Could grow and blossom forth into achievement.
 
 CATILINE.  I must!  Inexorable fate decrees it!
 
 FURIA.  Your fate?  Why were you given a hero's strength,--
 If not to struggle with what you call fate?
 
 CATILINE.  Oh, I have fought enough!  Was not my life
 A constant battle?  What are my rewards?
 Disgrace and scorn--!
 
 FURIA.  Ah, you are fallen low!
 You struggle towards a high and daring goal,
 Are eager to attain it; yet you fear
 Each trifling hindrance.
 
 CATILINE.  Fear is not the reason.
 The goal I sought is unattainable;--
 The whole was but a fleeting dream of youth.
 
 FURIA.  Now you deceive yourself, my Catiline!
 You hover still about that single project;--
 Your soul is noble,--worthy of a ruler,--
 And you have friends--.  Ah, wherefore hesitate?
 
 CATILINE.  [Meditating.]
 I shall--?  What do you mean--?  With civil blood--?
 
 FURIA.  Are you a man,--yet lack a woman's courage?
 Have you forgot that nimble dame of Rome,
 Who sought the throne straight over a father's corpse?
 I feel myself a Tullia now; but you--?
 Scorn and despise yourself, O Catiline!
 
 CATILINE.  Must I despise myself because my soul
 No longer harbors selfish aspirations?
 
 FURIA.  You stand here at a cross-road in your life;
 Yonder a dull, inactive course awaits you,--
 A half-way something, neither sleep nor death;--
 Before you, on the other hand, you see
 A sovereign's throne.  Then choose, my Catiline!
 
 CATILINE.  You tempt me and allure me to destruction.
 
 FURIA.  Cast but the die,--and in your hand is placed
 Forevermore the welfare of proud Rome.
 Glory and might your silent fate conceals,
 And yet you falter,--dare not lift a hand!
 You journey yonder to the forests, where
 Each longing that you cherished will be quenched.
 Ah, tell me, Catiline, is there no trace
 Of thirst for glory left within your heart?
 And must this princely soul, for triumphs born,
 Vanish unknown in yonder nameless desert?
 Hence, then!  But know that thus you lose forever
 What here you could by daring deeds attain.
 
 CATILINE.  Go on, go on!
 
 FURIA.  With trembling and with fear
 The future generations will recall
 Your fate.  Your life was all a daring game;--
 Yet in the lustre of atonement it would shine,
 Known to all men, if with a mighty hand
 You fought your way straight through this surging
 throng,--
 If the dark night of thraldom through your rule
 Gave way before a new-born day of freedom,--
 If at some time you--
 
 CATILINE.  Hold!  Ah, you have touched
 The string that quivers deepest in my soul.
 Your every word sounds like a ringing echo
 Of what my heart has whispered day and night.
 
 FURIA.  Now, Catiline, I know you once again!
 
 CATILINE.  I shall not go!  You have recalled to life
 My youthful zeal, my manhood's full-grown longings.
 Yes, I shall be a light to fallen Rome,--
 Daze them with fear like some erratic star!
 You haughty wretches,--you shall soon discover
 You have not humbled me, though for a time
 I weakened in the heat of battle!
 
 FURIA.  Listen!
 Whatever be the will of fate,--whatever
 The mighty gods decree, we must obey.
 Just so!  My hate is gone;--fate thus decreed,
 And so it had to be!  Give me your hand
 In solemn compact!--Ah, you hesitate?
 You will not?
 
 CATILINE.  Will--?  I gaze upon your eyes:
 They flash,--like lightning in the gloom of night.
 Now did you smile!  Just so I've often pictured
 Nemesis--
 
 FURIA.  What?  Herself you wish to see,--
 Then look within.  Have you forgot your oath?
 
 CATILINE.  No, I remember;--yet you seem to me
 A Nemesis--
 
 FURIA.  I am an image born
 From your own soul.
 
 CATILINE.  [Meditating.]  What is all this you say?
 I sense but vaguely what I fail to grasp;
 I glimpse mysterious, strangely clouded visions,--
 But can not understand.  I grope in darkness!
 
 FURIA.  It must be dark here.  Darkness is our realm;--
 In darkness is our rule.  Give me your hand
 In solemn pledge!
 
 CATILINE.  [Wildly.]  O lovely Nemesis,--
 My shadow,--image of my very soul,--
 Here is my hand in everlasting compact.
 
 [He seizes her hand violently; she looks at him with a stern
 smile.]
 
 FURIA.  Now we can never part!
 
 CATILINE.  Ah, like a stream
 Of fire your touch went coursing through my veins!
 'Tis blood no more that flows, but fiery flames;--
 My breast now cabins and confines my heart;
 My sight grows dull.  Soon shall a flaming sea
 Illumine with its light the Roman state!
 
 [He draws his sword and brandishes it.]
 
 CATILINE.  My sword!  My sword!  Do you see how it flashes?
 Soon will it redden in their tepid blood!--
 What change is this in me?  My brow burns hot;
 A multitude of visions flit before me.--
 Vengeance it is,--triumph for all those dreams
 Of greatness, regal power, and lasting fame.
 My watch-word shall be: livid flames and death!
 The capitol!  Now first I am myself!
 
 [He rushes out; FURIA follows him.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 [The inside of a dimly illumined tavern.]
 
 [STATILIUS, GABINIUS, COEPARIUS, and other young
 ROMANS enter.]
 
 STATILIUS.  Here, comrades, we can while away the night;
 Here we are safe; no one will overhear us.
 
 GABINIUS.  Ah, yes; now let us drink, carouse, enjoy!
 Who knows how long it will be granted us?
 
 STATILIUS.  No, let us first await whatever tidings
 Lentulus and Cethegus have for us.
 
 GABINIUS.  Bah, let them bring whatever news they will!
 Meanwhile the wine is here; come, let us taste.
 Quick, brothers, quick,--let's have a merry song!
 
 [SERVANTS bring in wine and glasses.]
 
 THE ASSEMBLED FRIENDS.  (Sing.)
 
   Bacchus, all praise to thee!
   Joyful we raise to thee
   Brimful the beaker!
   Hail to thee, hail!
   Wine, red and glowing,
   Merrily flowing,
   Drink of the wine-god,--
   This be our song.
 
   Gracious and friendly
   Smiles father Liber;
   Drunkenness waits us;
   Clear is the wine.
   Come, do not tarry!
   Wine will make merry,
   Joyful and airy,
   Body and soul.
 
   Thou above all the
   Glittering bubbles,
   Sparkling Falernian,
   Glorious drink!
   Courage and power,
   These are your dower.
   Gladsome the gift you
   Bring to the soul.
 
   Bacchus, all praise to thee!
   Joyful we raise to thee
   Brimful the beaker!
   Hail to thee, hail!
   Wine, red and glowing,
   Merrily flowing,
   Drink of the wine-god,--
   This be our song.
 
 [LENTULUS and CETHEGUS enter.]
 
 LENTULUS.  Cease all your song and merriment!
 
 STATILIUS.  What now?
 Is Catiline not in your company?
 
 GABINIUS.  Surely he was quite willing?
 
 COEPARIUS.  Come, say forth!
 What was his answer?
 
 CETHEGUS.  Ah, quite otherwise
 Than we expected was his answer.
 
 GABINIUS.  Well?
 
 LENTULUS.  Well, all of our proposals he declined;--
 He would not even hearken to our counsels.
 
 STATILIUS.  Is this the truth?
 
 COEPARIUS.  And wherefore would he not?
 
 LENTULUS.  In short, he will not.  He forsakes his friends,--
 Abandons us,--and leaves the city.
 
 STATILIUS.  What?
 He leaves, you say?
 
 CETHEGUS.  'Tis true;--he goes away
 This very night.  Yet,--blamed he can not be;
 His ground was valid--
 
 LENTULUS.  Fear was his excuse!
 In danger he forsakes us faithlessly.
 
 GABINIUS.  That is the friendship of our Catiline!
 
 COEPARIUS.  Never was Catiline faithless or afraid!
 
 LENTULUS.  And yet he leaves us now.
 
 STATILIUS.  Our hopes go with him.
 Where's now the man to take the leadership?
 
 COEPARIUS.  He'll not be found; our plan we must forego.
 
 LENTULUS.  Not yet, not yet, my friends!  First you shall hear
 What I will say.  Now what have we resolved?
 That we should win at last by force of arms
 What an unrighteous destiny denied.
 Tyrants oppress us;--yet we wish to rule.
 We suffer want;--yet wealth is our desire.
 
 MANY VOICES.  Yes, wealth and power!  Wealth and power we want!
 
 LENTULUS.  Yes, yes; we chose a comrade as our chief,
 On whom there was no doubt we could rely.
 Our trust he fails and turns his back to danger.
 Ah, brothers,--be not daunted.  He shall learn
 We can succeed without him.  What we need
 Is some one man, fearless and resolute,
 To take the lead--
 
 SOME.  Well, name us such a man!
 
 LENTULUS.  And should I name him, and should he comeforth,--
 Will you then straightway choose him as your leader?
 
 SOME.  Yes, we will choose him!
 
 OTHERS.  Yes, we will, we will!
 
 STATILIUS.  Then name him, friend!
 
 LENTULUS.  Suppose it were myself?
 
 GABINIUS.  Yourself?
 
 COEPARIUS.  You, Lentulus--!
 
 SEVERAL.  [In doubt.]  You wish to lead us?
 
 LENTULUS.  I do.
 
 CETHEGUS.  But can you?  Such a task requires
 The strength and courage of a Catiline.
 
 LENTULUS.  I do not lack the courage, nor the strength.
 Each to his task!  Or will you now turn back,
 Now when the moment seems most opportune?
 'Tis now or never!  All things prophesy
 Success for us--
 
 STATILIUS.  Good;--we will follow you!
 
 OTHERS.  We'll follow you!
 
 GABINIUS.  Well, now that Catiline
 Forsakes our cause, you are no doubt the man
 To lead us in our enterprise.
 
 LENTULUS.  Then hear
 What plan of action I have outlined.  First--
 
 [CATILINE enters hastily.]
 
 CATILINE.  Here, comrades, here I am!
 
 ALL.  Catiline!
 
 LENTULUS.  He?
 Oh, damned--
 
 CATILINE.  Speak out,--what do you ask of me?
 Yet stay; I know already what it is.
 I'll lead you on.  Say--will you follow me?
 
 ALL (EXCEPT LENTULUS).  Yes, Catiline,--we follow if you lead!
 
 STATILIUS.  They have deceived us--
 
 GABINIUS.  --and belied your name!
 
 COEPARIUS.  They said you did intend to leave the city
 And wash your hands completely of our cause.
 
 CATILINE.  Yes, so I did.  Yet now no more; henceforth
 Only for this great purpose do I live.
 
 LENTULUS.  What is this mighty purpose you proclaim?
 
 CATILINE.  My purpose here is higher than you think--
 Perhaps than any thinks.  Ah, hear me, friends!
 First will I win to us each citizen
 Who prizes liberty and values most
 The public honor and his country's weal.
 The spirit of ancient Rome is yet alive;--
 The last faint spark is not yet wholly dead.
 Now into brilliant flames it shall be fanned,
 More glorious than ever flames before!
 Alas, too long the stifling gloom of thraldom,
 Dark as the night, lay blanketed on Rome.
 Behold,--this realm--though proud and powerful
 It seems--totters upon the edge of doom.
 Therefore the stoutest hand must seize the helm.
 Rome must be cleansed,--cleansed to the very roots;
 The sluggish we must waken from their slumber,--
 And crush to earth the power of these wretches
 Who sow their poison in the mind and stifle
 The slightest promise of a better life.
 Look you,--'tis civic freedom I would further,--
 The civic spirit that in former times
 Was regnant here.  Friends, I shall conjure back
 The golden age, when Romans gladly gave
 Their lives to guard the honor of the nation,
 And all their riches for the public weal!
 
 LENTULUS.  Ah, Catiline, you rave!  Nothing of this
 Had we in mind.
 
 GABINIUS.  What will it profit us
 To conjure up again those ancient days
 With all their dull simplicity?
 
 SOME.  No, no!
 Might we demand--
 
 OTHERS.  --and means enough to live
 A gay and carefree life!
 
 MANY VOICES.  That is our aim!
 
 COEPARIUS.  Is it for others' happiness and freedom
 We stake our lives upon a throw of dice?
 
 THE WHOLE GROUP.  We want the spoils of victory!
 
 CATILINE.  Paltry race!
 Are you the offspring of those ancient fathers?
 To heap dishonor on your country's name,--
 In such a way you would preserve its lustre!
 
 LENTULUS.  And you dare taunt us,--you who long since were
 A terrifying token--
 
 CATILINE.  True, I was;
 I was a terror to the good; and yet,
 So paltry as you are was never I.
 
 LENTULUS.  Restrain your tongue; we brook no ridicule.
 
 MANY.  No, no,--we will not--
 
 CATILINE.  [Calmly.]  So?  You timid brood,--
 You dare to think of doing something,--you?
 
 LENTULUS.  Ah, down with him!
 
 MANY VOICES.  Yes, down with Catiline!
 
 [They draw their daggers and rush in on him; CATILINE calmly
 removes the cloak from his breast and regards them with a cold,
 scornful smile; they lower their daggers.]
 
 CATILINE.
 Thrust!  Thrust!  You dare not?  Oh, my friends, my friends,--
 I should respect you, if you plunged your daggers
 In this uncovered bosom, as you threaten.
 Is there no spark of courage in your souls?
 
 SOME.  He means our weal!
 
 OTHERS.  His taunts we have deserved.
 
 CATILINE.  You have, indeed.--Yet, see,--the hour is come
 When you can wash away the blot of shame.
 All that is of the past we will forget;--
 A new existence is in store for us.
 
 CATILINE.  [With bitterness.]
 Fool that I am!  To stake success on you!
 Burns any zeal within this craven mob?
 
 CATILINE.  [Carried away.]
 Time was my dreams were glorious; great visions
 Rushed through my mind or swept before my gaze.
 I dreamed that, winged like Icarus of old,
 I flew aloft beneath the vault of heaven;
 I dreamed the gods endued my hands with strength
 Of giants, offered me the lightning flash.
 And this hand seized the lightning in its flight
 And hurled it at the city far beneath.
 And when the crimson flames lapped all, and rose
 As Rome fell crumbling in a heap of ruins,--
 Then called I with a loud and mighty voice,
 And conjured Cato's comrades from the grave;
 Thousands of spirits heard my call and came,--
 Took life again--raised Rome from out her ashes.
 
 [He breaks off.]
 
 CATILINE.  These were but dreams!  Gods do not conjure up
 The by-gone past into the light of day,--
 And parted spirits never leave the grave.
 
 CATILINE.  [Wildly.]  Is now this hand unable to restore
 The ancient Rome, our Rome it shall destroy.
 Where marble colonnades now towering stand,
 Pillars of smoke through crackling flames shall whirl;
 Then shall the Capitol crumble from its heights,
 And palaces and temples sink to ruin!
 
 CATILINE.  Swear, comrades, that you dedicate your lives
 To this great purpose!  I shall take the lead.
 Say,--will you follow me?
 
 STATILIUS.  We'll follow you!
 
 [Several seem to be in doubt, and speak in whispers to one
 another.  CATILINE regards them with a scornful smile.]
 
 LENTULUS.  [In an undertone.]
 'Tis best we follow him.  In sunken ruins
 We're likeliest to realize our goal.
 
 ALL.  [Shouting.]  Yes, Catiline; we'll all--all follow you!
 
 CATILINE.  Swear to me by the gods of our great sires
 That you will heed my every nod!
 
 THE WHOLE GROUP.  [With uplifted hands.]  Yes, yes;
 We swear in all things blindly to obey!
 
 CATILINE.  Then singly steal your way, by different paths,
 Into my house.  Weapons you there will find.
 I shall come later; you shall then discover
 What plan of action I propose.  Now go!
 
 [They all go out.]
 
 LENTULUS.  [Detains CATILINE.]
 A word!  Know you the Allobrogian tribes
 Have to the Senate sent ambassadors
 With grievances and charges?
 
 CATILINE.  Yes, I know.
 They came today into the city.
 
 LENTULUS.  Good.
 What if we should attune them to our plans?
 With them all Gaul will rise up in revolt;
 And stir up strife against our enemies.
 
 CATILINE.  [Reluctant.]
 Ah, we should seek barbarian allies?
 
 LENTULUS.  But such a league is a necessity.
 With our own strength alone the fight is lost;
 Help from without--
 
 CATILINE.  [With a bitter smile.]  Ah, Rome is fallen low!
 Her walls no longer harbor men with strength
 Enough to overthrow a tottering ruin!
 
 [They go out.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 [A garden to the rear of CATILINE's house, which is
 visible through the trees.  To the left a
 side-building.]
 
 [CURIUS, CETHEGUS, and OTHER CONSPIRATORS enter
 cautiously from the right in whispered conversation.]
 
 CURIUS.  But is it really true what you relate?
 
 CETHEGUS.  Yes, every word is true.  A moment since
 It was decided.
 
 CURIUS.  He takes charge of all?
 
 CETHEGUS.  Of everything.  Just speak with him yourself.
 
 [All, except CURIUS, enter the house.]
 
 CURIUS.  An eerie night!  How all my thoughts are tossed
 About in circles!  Did I dream perchance?
 Ah, real or fancied,--now I am awake,--
 Whichever way I turn I see her form.
 
 [CATILINE enters from the right.]
 
 CATILINE.  [Goes toward him.]
 You here, my Curius?  I have missed you much.--
 My visit with the vestal took a turn
 Quite unexpected--
 
 CURIUS.  [Confused.]  So?  Yes, you are right!
 
 CATILINE.  I shall no longer think of this affair.
 It was a visit fraught with fate for me.
 
 CATILINE.  [Meditating.]
 The furies, we are told, return at times
 From the dark underworld to follow us
 Through life forever.--Ah, if it were so!
 
 CURIUS.  [Uneasy.]  What?  Have you seen her--?
 
 CATILINE.  She was here tonight.--
 Yet let this be forgotten.  Curius, listen,--
 A weighty undertaking is on foot--
 
 CURIUS.  I know it all.  Cethegus told me here--
 
 CATILINE.  Who knows what issue for this work the gods
 Have set?  Perchance it is my destiny
 To perish now, crushed by malignant forces,--
 And never reach my goal.  Well, be it so!
 But you, dear Curius, you whom I have loved
 Since childhood,--you shall not be drawn within
 This fateful maelstrom.  Promise me,--remain
 Within the city if I elsewhere choose
 To open my attack,--which is quite likely;
 Nor aid us till success has crowned our work.
 
 CURIUS.  [Moved.]
 Oh, what a friend and father!  All this care--!
 
 CATILINE.  You promise this?  Then here we say farewell;
 Wait but a moment; I shall soon return.
 
 [He goes into the house.]
 
 CURIUS.  [Gazing after him.]
 He loves me still.  Of naught is he distrustful.
 
 [LENTULUS and OTHER CONSPIRATORS enter from the right.]
 
 LENTULUS.  Ah, Curius, did not Catiline just now
 Pass through the garden?
 
 CURIUS.  Yes, he is within.
 
 [They go into the house.]
 
 CURIUS.  [Paces about uneasy.]
 How shall I curb this longing in my soul?
 There is a restless turmoil in my blood.
 Ah, Furia,--what a strange, mysterious woman!
 Where are you?  When shall I see your face again?
 
 CURIUS.  Where has she fled?  Ah, shadow-like she slipped
 Away, when I had freed her from the grave.
 And those mysterious, prophetic words,--
 And more, her eyes, gleaming at once and dimmed--!
 What if it were but madness?  Has the grave
 With all its terror darkened--?
 
 FURIA.  [Behind him among the trees.]  No, pale youth!
 
 CURIUS.  [With a cry.]  My Furia!  You--?
 
 FURIA.  [Comes nearer.]  Here dwells Catiline.
 Where he is,--there must Furia also be.
 
 CURIUS.  Oh, come with me, beloved.  I shall lead
 You into safety.  Think--if some one saw you!
 
 FURIA.  The dead need have no fear.  Have you forgotten--
 You took my corpse and brought it from the grave?
 
 CURIUS.  Again those terrifying words!  Oh, hear me;--
 Come to your senses,--come with me away!
 
 [He tries to seize her hand.]
 
 FURIA.  [Thrusts him wildly back.]
 You reckless fool,--do you not shrink with fear
 Before this child of death, but risen up
 A fleeting moment from the underworld?
 
 CURIUS.  Before you now I fear.  And yet this fear,
 This strange, mysterious dread, is my delight.
 
 FURIA.  What would you me?  In vain is all your pleading.
 I'm of the grave, and yonder is my home;--
 With dawn's approach I must again be speeding
 Back to the vale of shadows whence I come.
 You doubt me,--do not think that I have sat
 Among the pallid shades in Pluto's hall?
 I tell you, I was even now below,--
 Beyond the river and the gloomy marshes.
 
 CURIUS.  Then lead me there!
 
 FURIA.  You?
 
 CURIUS.  I shall gladly follow,
 Though you should lead me through the jaws of death!
 
 FURIA.  It cannot be!  On earth we two must part;--
 Yonder the dead and living dare not meet.--
 
 FURIA.  Why do you rob me of my fleeting moments?
 I've but the hours of night in which to work;
 My task is of the night; I am its herald.
 But where is Catiline?
 
 CURIUS.  Ah, him you seek?
 
 FURIA.  Yes, him I seek.
 
 CURIUS.  Then him you still pursue?
 
 FURIA.  Why rose I from the spirit underworld
 Tonight, if not because of Catiline?
 
 CURIUS.  Alas, this fury that has seized your soul--!
 Yet you are lovely even in your madness.
 Oh, Furia, think no more of Catiline!
 Come, flee with me!  Command me,--I shall serve you!
 
 [He prostrates himself before her.]
 
 CURIUS.  A prostrate slave I here entreat of you
 One single look.  Oh, hear me, Furia, hear me!
 I love but you!  A sweet and lethal fire
 Consumes my soul, and you--ah, you alone--
 Can ease my suffering.--
 
 FURIA.  [Looks towards the house.]  Yonder there's a light--
 And many men.  What now is going on
 Within the house of Catiline?
 
 CURIUS.  [Jumps up.]  Again
 This name!  Around him hover all your thoughts.
 Oh, I could hate him--!
 
 FURIA.  Has he then resolved
 To launch at last the daring enterprise
 He long has cherished?
 
 CURIUS.  Then you know--?
 
 FURIA.  Yes, all.
 
 CURIUS.  Ah, then you doubtless know, too, he himself
 Is foremost in this daring enterprise?
 Yet, I adjure you, beg you, think no more
 Of Catiline!
 
 FURIA.  Answer me this alone;
 'Tis all I ask of you.  Do you go with him?
 
 CURIUS.  He is to me a tender father--
 
 FURIA.  [Smiling.]  He?
 My Catiline?
 
 CURIUS.  Ah!
 
 FURIA.  He,--round whom my thoughts
 Course without rest?
 
 CURIUS.  My brain is in a tumult--
 I hate this man--!  Oh, I could murder him!
 
 FURIA.  Did you not lately swear you were prepared
 To do my bidding?
 
 CURIUS.  Ask me what you will;
 In everything I serve you and obey!
 I only beg,--forget this Catiline.
 
 FURIA.  I shall forget him first--when he has stepped
 Into his grave.
 
 CURIUS.  [Draws back.]  Ah, you demand that I--?
 
 FURIA.  You need not use the steel; you can betray
 His enterprise--
 
 CURIUS.  Murder and treachery
 At once!  Remember, Furia, he is still
 My foster-father and--
 
 FURIA.  --My aim in life!
 Ah, timid fool,--so you dare speak of love,--
 Who lack the fortitude to strike him down
 That stands across your path?  Away from me!
 
 [She turns her back on him.]
 
 CURIUS.  [Holding her back.]
 No;--do not leave me!  I am in all things willing!
 A shudder chills me as I look on you;
 And yet I cannot break this net asunder
 Wherein you trapped my soul.
 
 FURIA.  Then you are willing?
 
 CURIUS.  Why do you mock me with such questioning?
 If I am willing?  Have I any will?
 Your gaze is like the serpent's when 'tis fixed
 With magic power upon the bird, that circles
 Wildly about in terror-stricken awe,
 Drawn ever nearer to the dreadful fangs.
 
 FURIA.  Then to your task!
 
 CURIUS.  And when I've sacrificed
 My friendship to my love for you,--what then?
 
 FURIA.  I shall forget that Catiline existed.
 Then will my task be ended.  Ask no more!
 
 CURIUS.  For this reward I should--?
 
 FURIA.  You hesitate?
 Is then your hope so faint that you forget
 What gifts a grateful woman can bestow,
 When first the time--?
 
 CURIUS.  By all the powers of night,--
 I'll not delay!  He only stands between us.
 Then let him perish!  Quenched is every spark
 Of feeling for him; every bond is sundered!--
 Who are you, lovely vision of the night?
 Near you I'm turned to marble, burned to ashes.
 My longing chills me,--terror fires the soul;
 My love is blended hate and sorcery.
 Who am I now?  I know myself no more;
 One thing I know; I am not he I was,
 Ere you I saw.  I'll plunge into the deep
 To follow you!  Doomed--doomed is Catiline!
 I'll to the Capitol.  This very night
 The senate is assembled.  Then farewell!
 A written note betrays his enterprise.
 
 [He goes out hastily.]
 
 FURIA.  [To herself.]
 The heavens grow dark; soon will the lightning play.
 The end is fast approaching, Catiline;--
 With measured steps you journey to your grave!
 
 [The Allobrogian ambassadors, AMBIORIX and OLLOVICO, come out of
 the house without noticing FURIA, who stands half concealed in
 the shade between the trees.]
 
 AMBIORIX.  So then it is decided!  Venturesome
 It was to enter into such a compact.
 
 OLLOVICO.  True;
 Yet their refusal of each righteous claim
 Opens no other way to liberty.
 The prize of victory,--should our friends succeed,--
 Outweighs indeed the perils of the conflict
 That now awaits us.
 
 AMBIORIX.  Brother, so it is!
 
 OLLOVICO.  Emancipation from the rule of Rome,--
 Freedom long lost is surely worth a struggle.
 
 AMBIORIX.  Now we must hasten homeward with all speed,
 Kindling through Gaul the flames of insurrection.
 It will be easy to persuade the tribes
 To 'rise up in revolt; they'll follow us
 And join the partisans of Catiline.
 
 OLLOVICO.  Hard will the fight be; mighty still is Rome.
 
 AMBIORIX.  It must be risked.  Come, Ollovico, come!
 
 FURIA.  [Calls warningly to them.]  Woe unto you!
 
 AMBIORIX.  [Startled.]  By all the gods!
 
 OLLOVICO.  [Terrified.]  Ah, hear!
 A voice cries warning to us in the dark!
 
 FURIA.  Woe to your people!
 
 OLLOVICO.  Yonder stands she, brother,--
 The pale and ill-foreboding shadow.  See!
 
 FURIA.  Woe unto all who follow Catiline!
 
 AMBIORIX.  Home, home!  Away!  We'll break all promises!
 
 OLLOVICO.  A voice has warned us, and we shall obey.
 
 [They go out hurriedly to the right.]
 
 [CATILINE comes out of the house in the background.]
 
 CATILINE.  Ah, desperate hope--to think of crushing Rome
 With such a host of cowards and poltroons!
 What spurs them on?  With frankness they confess--
 Their only motive is their want and greed.
 Is it then worth the trouble for such aims
 To shed men's blood?  And what have I to win?
 What can I gain?
 
 FURIA.  [Invisible among the trees.]  Revenge, my Catiline!
 
 CATILINE.  [Startled.]
 Who speaks!  Who wakes the spirit of revenge
 From slumber?  Came this voice then from the deep
 Within my soul?  Revenge?  Yes, that's the word,--
 My watch-word and my battle-cry.  Revenge!
 Revenge for all the hopes and all the dreams
 Which ever a vindictive fate destroyed!
 Revenge for all my years of wasted life!
 
 [The CONSPIRATORS come armed out of the house.]
 
 LENTULUS.  Still rest the shades of darkness on the city.
 Now is it time to break away.
 
 SEVERAL.  [Whispering.]  Away!
 
 [AURELIA comes out of the side-building without noticing the
 CONSPIRATORS.]
 
 AURELIA.  Beloved,--are you here?
 
 CATILINE.  [With a cry.]  Aurelia!
 
 AURELIA.  Say,--
 Have you been waiting for me?
 
 [She becomes aware of the Conspirators and rushes to him.]
 
 AURELIA.  Gracious gods!
 
 CATILINE.  [Thrusts her aside.]  Woman, away from me!
 
 AURELIA.  Speak, Catiline!
 These many men in arms--?  And you as well--?
 Oh, you will go--
 
 CATILINE.  [Wildly.]  Yes, by the spirits of night,--
 A merry journey!  See--this flashing sword!
 It thirsts for blood!  I go--to quench its thirst.
 
 AURELIA.  My hope,--my dream!  Ah, blissful was my dream!
 Thus am I wakened from my dreaming--
 
 CATILINE.  Silence!
 Stay here,--or follow!  But my heart is cold
 To tears and lamentations.--Friends, behold
 How bright the full moon in the west declines!
 When next that full moon in its orient shines,
 An avalanche of fire shall sweep the state
 And all its golden glory terminate.
 A thousand years from now, when it shall light
 Mere crumbling ruins in the desert night,--
 One pillar in the dust of yonder dome
 Shall tell the weary wanderer: Here stood Rome!
 
 [He rushes out to the right; all follow him.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 
 THIRD ACT
 
 [CATILINE's camp in a wooded field in Etruria.  To the
 right is seen CATILINE's tent and close by it an old
 oak tree.  A camp fire is burning outside the tent;
 similar fires are to be seen among the trees in the
 background.  It is night.  At intervals the moon breaks
 through the clouds.]
 
 [STATILIUS lies stretched out asleep by the camp fire.
 MANLIUS paces back and forth in front of the tent.]
 
 MANLIUS.  Such is the way of young and buoyant souls.
 They slumber on as peaceful and secure
 As though embosomed in their mothers' arms,
 Instead of in a forest wilderness.
 They rest as though they dream some merry game
 Were held in store for them when they awake,
 Instead of battle,--the last one, perchance,
 That will be theirs to fight.
 
 STATILIUS.  [Awakes and rises.]  Still standing guard?
 You must be weary?  I'll relieve you now.
 
 MANLIUS.  Go rest yourself instead.  Youth needs his sleep;
 His untamed passions tax his native strength.
 'Tis otherwise when once the hair turns gray,
 When in our veins the blood flows lazily,
 And age weighs heavily upon our shoulders.
 
 STATILIUS.  Yes, you are right.  Thus I too shall in time,
 An old and hardened warrior--
 
 MANLIUS.  Are you sure
 The fates decreed you such a destiny?
 
 STATILIUS.  And pray, why not?  Why all these apprehensions?
 Has some misfortune chanced?
 
 MANLIUS.  You think no doubt
 That we have naught to fear, foolhardy youth?
 
 STATILIUS.  Our troops are strongly reenforced--
 
 MANLIUS.  Indeed,--
 With fugitive slaves and gladiators--
 
 STATILIUS.  Well,--
 Grant that they are; together they may prove
 No little aid, and all the tribes of Gaul
 Will send us help--
 
 MANLIUS.  --Which has not yet arrived.
 
 STATILIUS.  You doubt that the Allobroges will keep
 Their promised word?
 
 MANLIUS.  I know these people well
 From days gone by.  However, let that pass.
 The day that dawns will doubtless bring to light
 What destinies the gods have set for us.
 
 MANLIUS.  But go the rounds, my friend, and ascertain
 If all the guards perform their proper tasks.
 For we must fend against a night attack;
 We know not where the enemy makes his stand.
 
 [STATILIUS goes into the forest.]
 
 MANLIUS.  [Alone by the camp fire.]
 The clouds begin to gather thick and fast;
 It is a dark and storm-presaging night;--
 A misty fog hangs heavy on my breast,
 As though foreboding mishap to us all.
 Where is it now, that easy carefree spirit
 With which in former times I went to war?
 Ah, can it be the weight of years alone
 That now I feel?  Strange--strange, indeed,--last night
 Even the young seemed sorely out of heart.
 
 MANLIUS.  [After a pause.]
 The gods shall know revenge was not the aim
 For which I joined and followed Catiline.
 My wrath flared up within me for a space
 When first I felt I had been wronged, insulted;--
 The old blood is not yet entirely cold;
 Now and again it courses warmly through my veins.
 But the humiliation is forgotten.
 I followed Catiline for his own sake;
 And I shall watch o'er him with zealous care.
 Here stands he all alone amidst these hosts
 Of paltry knaves and dissolute companions.
 They cannot comprehend him,--he in turn
 Is far too proud to wish to fathom them.
 
 [He throws some branches on the fire and remains standing in
 silence.  CATILINE comes out of the tent.]
 
 CATILINE.  [To himself.]
 Midnight approaches.  Everything is hushed;--
 Only to my poor eyes sleep fails to come.
 Cold is the night wind; 'twill refresh my soul
 And give me strength anew--.  I sorely need it!
 
 [He becomes aware of MANLIUS.]
 
 CATILINE.  'Tis you, old Manlius?  And do you stand guard
 Alone on such a night?
 
 MANLIUS.  Oft have I stood
 Guard over you in childhood's early days.
 Say, do you not recall?
 
 CATILINE.  Those days are gone;
 With them, my peace; wherever now I go,
 I'm haunted by a multitude of visions.
 All things find shelter in my bosom, Manlius;--
 Save peace alone.  That--that is far away.
 
 MANLIUS.  Cast off these gloomy thoughts and take your rest!
 Remember that the morrow may require
 Your utmost strength for our deliverance.
 
 CATILINE.  I cannot rest.  If I but close my eyes
 One fleeting moment in forgetful slumber,
 I'm tossed about in strange, fantastic dreams.
 Here on my couch I lay now, half asleep,
 When these same visions reappeared again,
 More strange than ever,--more mysterious
 And puzzling--.  Ah, if I could only know
 What this forebodes!  But no--
 
 MANLIUS.  Confide your dream
 To me.  Perhaps I can expound its meaning.
 
 CATILINE.  [After a pause.]
 If I slept or if I waked, scarcely can I say;
 Visions fast pursued each other in a mad array.
 Soon a deepening twilight settles over everything;
 And a night swoops down upon me on her wide-spread wing,
 Terrible and dark, unpierced, save by the lightning's flare;
 I am in a grave-like dungeon, filled with clammy air.
 Lofty is the ceiling and with thunderclouds o'ercast;
 Multitudes of shadow forms go racing wildly past,
 Whirl around in roaring eddies, as the ocean wave
 Draws the raging storm and breaks against a rocky cave.
 Yet amid this frenzied tumult children often come,
 Decked in flowers, singing of a half-forgotten home.
 Soon the darkness round them changes to a vivid glare,--
 Dimly in the center I descry a lonely pair;
 Ah, two women,--stern the one and gloomy as the night,--
 And the other gentle, like the evening in its flight.
 How familiar to my eyes the two lone figures seemed!
 With her smiling countenance the one upon me beamed;
 Like the zigzag lightning flashed the other's piercing eye;
 Terror seized my soul,--yet on I gazed in ecstasy.
 Proudly upright stands the one, the other leans in weariness
 On the solitary table, where they play a game of chess.
 Pawns they barter, or they move them now from place to place;--
 Then the game is lost and won,--she fades away in space,--
 She who radiantly smiled, ah, she who lost the game;
 Instantly the bands of children vanish whence they came.
 Tumult rises; darkness deepens; but from out the night
 Two eyes fix upon me, in a victor's gloating right;
 Then my brain reels; I see nothing but those baleful eyes.
 But what else I dreamed of in that frenzied slumber lies
 Far within me hidden, buried deep beyond recall.
 Could I but remember.  Gone forever is it all.
 
 MANLIUS.  Remarkable, indeed, my Catiline,
 Is this your dream.
 
 CATILINE.  [Meditating.]  If I could but remember--
 But no; my memory fails me--
 
 MANLIUS.  Brood no longer
 Upon these thoughts.  For what are dreams, indeed,
 But pale chimeras only, darkling visions,
 On nothing founded, and by naught explained?
 
 CATILINE.  Yes, you are right; I will no longer brood;--
 Already I am calm.  But go your way;
 You need some rest.  The meanwhile I shall walk
 In privacy and meditate my plans.
 
 [MANLIUS goes into the forest.]
 
 CATILINE.  [Paces for some time back and forth by the
 camp fire, which is about to go out; then he stops and
 speaks thoughtfully.]  If I could only--.  Ah, it is unmanly
 To brood and be distressed by thoughts like these.
 And yet,--here in the stillness of the night,
 This lonely solitude, again I see
 Rising before me life-like all I dreamed.
 
 [A SHADOW, attired like an old warrior in armor and toga, stems
 to rise from the earth among the trees a short distance from
 him.]
 
 CATILINE.  [Recoils before THE SHADOW.]
 Great powers of heaven--!
 
 THE SHADOW.  Greetings, Catiline!
 
 CATILINE.  What will you have?  Who are you, pallid shade?
 
 THE SHADOW.  One moment!  It is here my right to question,--
 And you shall answer.  Do you no longer know
 This voice from ages long since passed away?
 
 CATILINE.  Methinks I do; yet certain I am not--.
 But speak, whom seek you at this midnight hour?
 
 THE SHADOW.  'Tis you I seek.  Know that this hour alone
 Is granted me as respite here on earth.
 
 CATILINE.  By all the gods!  Who are you?  Speak!
 
 THE SHADOW.  Be calm!
 Hither I come to call you to account.
 Why do you envy me the peace of death?
 Why do you drive me from my earthy dwelling?
 Why do you mar my rest with memories,
 That I must seek you, whisper menaces,
 To guard the honor I so dearly bought?
 
 CATILINE.  Alas! this voice--!  Somehow I seem to know--
 
 THE SHADOW.  What is there left of my imperial power?
 A shadow like myself; yes, scarcely that.
 Both sank into the grave--and came to naught.
 'Twas dearly bought; dear, dear was it attained.
 For it I sacrificed all peace in life,
 And waived all claims to peace beyond the grave.
 And now you come and want to wrest from me
 With daring hands what little I have left.
 Are there not paths enough to noble deeds?
 Why must you choose the one that I have chosen?
 I gave up everything in life to power;
 My name--so dreamed I--should forever stand,
 Not beaming like a star with friendly lustre,--
 No, like a flash against the midnight sky!
 I did not covet fame, the goal of hundreds,
 For magnanimity and noble deeds;
 Nor admiration;--far too many share
 That fate already: so will many more
 Until the end of time.  Of blood and horror
 I wished to build me my renown and fame.
 With silent dread, as on some meteor
 That now appears in mystery and is gone
 Again,--men should gaze back upon my life,
 And look askance on me, whom no one ever,
 Before or since then, dared to emulate.
 Yes, thus I dreamed and dreamed,--and was deceived.
 Why did I not surmise, when you stood near me,
 The secret thoughts then growing in your soul.
 Yet, Catiline, beware; know that I see
 Beyond the veil that hides from you the future.
 Written among the stars--I read your fate!
 
 CATILINE.  You read my fate?  Expound it then to me!
 
 THE SHADOW.  No, first beyond death's gloomy gate
   Shall fade away the mists that hide
   The gruesome and the nobly great,
   Borne ever on by time and tide.
   This from thy book of fate alone
   A liberated soul may tell thee:
   Perish thou shalt by deed thine own,
   And yet a stranger's hand shall fell thee.
 
 [THE SHADOW glides away as in a mist.]
 
 CATILINE.  [After a pause.]
 Ah, he has vanished.  Was it but a dream?
 No, no; even here he stood; the moonbeams played
 Upon his sallow visage.  Yes, I knew him!
 It was the man of blood, the old dictator,
 Who sallied from his grave to frighten me.
 He feared lest he should lose the victor's crown,--
 Not the reward of honor, but the terror
 Whereby his memory lives.  Are bloodless shades
 Spurred onward also by the thought of glory?
 
 [Paces to and fro uneasily.]
 
 CATILINE.  All things storm in upon me.  Now Aurelia
 In gentle admonition speaks,--and now
 In me reechoes Furia's warning cry.
 Nay, more than that;--out of the grave appear
 The pallid shadows of a by-gone age.
 They threaten me.  I should now stop and pause?
 I should turn back?  No.  I shall venture on
 Unfaltering;--the victory soon is mine!
 
 [CURIUS comes through the forest in great agitation.]
 
 CURIUS.  O Catiline--!
 
 CATILINE.  [Surprised.]  What, you,--you here, my friend!
 
 CURIUS.  I had to--
 
 CATILINE.  Wherefore staid you not in town?
 
 CURIUS.  Fear prompted me; I had to seek you here.
 
 CATILINE.  You rush for my sake blindly into danger.
 You thoughtless lad!  Yet, come into my arms!
 
 [Moves to embrace him.]
 
 CURIUS.  [Draws back.]
 No!  Do not touch me!  Do not even come near me!
 
 CATILINE.  What ails you, my dear Curius?
 
 CURIUS.  Up!  Break camp!
 Flee, if you can, even this very hour!
 On every highway come the enemy troops;
 Your camp is being surrounded.
 
 CATILINE.  Calm yourself;
 You rave.  Speak, has the journey shaken you--?
 
 CURIUS.  Oh no; but save yourself while there is time!
 You are betrayed--
 
 [Prostrates himself before him.]
 
 CATILINE.  [Starts back.]  Betrayed!  What are you saying?
 
 CURIUS.  Betrayed by one in friendly guise!
 
 CATILINE.  You err;
 These stormy friends are loyal even as you.
 
 CURIUS.  Then woe to you for all their loyalty!
 
 CATILINE.  Compose yourself!  It is your love for me,
 Your interest in my safety, that has wakened
 Imaginary dangers in your mind.
 
 CURIUS.  Oh, do you know these words do murder me?
 But flee!  I do entreat you earnestly--
 
 CATILINE.  Be calm and speak your mind.  Why should I flee?
 The enemy knows not where I make my stand.
 
 CURIUS.  Indeed he does,--he knows your every plan!
 
 CATILINE.  What, are you mad?  He knows--?  Impossible!
 
 CURIUS.  Oh, were it so!  But use the hour remaining;
 Still you may save yourself perhaps in flight!
 
 CATILINE.  Betrayed?  No,--ten times no; impossible!
 
 CURIUS.  [Seizes his dagger and holds it out to him.]
 Catiline, plunge this dagger in my bosom;--
 Straight through the heart!  'Twas I betrayed your plans!
 
 CATILINE.  You?  What madness!
 
 CURIUS.  Yes, it was in madness!
 Ask not the reason; scarce I know myself;
 I say,--I have revealed your every counsel.
 
 CATILINE.  [In bitter grief.]
 Now have you killed my faith in sacred friendship!
 
 CURIUS.  Oh, send the dagger home, and torture me
 No longer with forbearance--!
 
 CATILINE.  [Kindly.]  Live, my Curius!
 Arise!  You erred;--but I forgive you all.
 
 CURIUS.  [Overcome.]
 O Catiline, my heart is crushed with grief--!
 But hasten; flee!  There is no time to tarry.
 Soon will the Roman troops invade your camp;
 They're under way; on every side they come.
 
 CATILINE.  Our comrades in the city--?
 
 CURIUS.  They are captured;--
 Some were imprisoned, most of them were killed!
 
 CATILINE.  [To himself.]  What fate--what fate!
 
 CURIUS.  [Again holds out the dagger to him.]
 Then plunge it in my heart!
 
 CATILINE.  [Looks at him calmly.]  No, you were but a tool.
 You acted well--
 
 CURIUS.  Oh, let me die and expiate my sin!
 
 CATILINE.  I have forgiven you.
 
 CATILINE.  [As he goes.]  But one thing now
 Is there to choose!
 
 CURIUS.  [Jumps up.]  Yes, flight!
 
 CATILINE.  Heroic death!
 
 [He goes away through the forest.]
 
 CURIUS.  'Tis all in vain!  Ruin awaits him here.
 This mildness is a tenfold punishment!
 I'll follow him; one thing I shall be granted:--
 To perish fighting by the hero's side!
 
 [He rushes out.  LENTULUS and TWO GLADIATORS come stealing among
 the trees.]
 
 LENTULUS.  [Softly.]  Some one was speaking--
 
 ONE OF THE GLADIATORS.  Aye, but now all's quiet.
 
 THE OTHER GLADIATOR.  Perchance it was the sentinel relieved
 Of duty.
 
 LENTULUS.  That may be.  This is the place;
 Here shall you wait.  Are both your weapons sharp,
 Ground for their purpose?
 
 THE FIRST GLADIATOR.  Bright as is the lightning!
 
 THE SECOND GLADIATOR.
 Mine, too, cuts well.  In the last Roman games
 Two gladiators died beneath this sword.
 
 LENTULUS.  Then stand you ready in this thicket here.
 And when a man, whom I shall designate,
 Goes toward the tent, then shall you rush out quick
 And strike him from behind.
 
 THE FIRST GLADIATOR.  It shall be done!
 
 [Both GLADIATORS conceal themselves; LENTULUS goes spying
 around.]
 
 LENTULUS.  [To himself.]
 It is a daring game I here attempt;--
 Yet must it be performed this very night,
 If done at all.--If Catiline should fall,
 No one can lead them on except myself;
 I'll purchase them with golden promises,
 And march without delay upon the city,
 Where still the senate, struck with panic fear,
 Neglects to arm itself against the danger.
 
 [He goes in among the trees.]
 
 THE FIRST GLADIATOR.  [Softly to the other.]
 Who is this stranger we must fall upon?
 
 THE SECOND GLADIATOR.  What matters it to us who he may be?
 Lentulus pays our hire; the blame is his:
 He must himself defend the act we do.
 
 LENTULUS.  [Returns quickly.]
 Stand ready now; the man we wait is coming!
 
 [LENTULUS and the GLADIATORS lie in wait among the bushes.]
 
 [Soon after, CATILINE comes through the forest and goes toward
 the tent.]
 
 LENTULUS.  [Whispering.]
 Out!  Fall upon him!  Strike him from behind!
 
 [All three rush on CATILINE.]
 
 CATILINE.  [Draws his sword and defends himself.]
 Ah, scoundrels,--do you dare to--?
 
 LENTULUS.  [To the GLADIATORS.]  Cut him down!
 
 CATILINE.  [Recognizes him.]
 You, Lentulus, would murder Catiline?
 
 THE FIRST GLADIATOR.  [Terrified.]  He it is!
 
 THE SECOND GLADIATOR.  [Draws back.]  Catiline!  I'll never use
 The sword on him.  Come flee!
 
 [Both GLADIATORS make their escape.]
 
 LENTULUS.  Then die by mine!
 
 [They fight; CATILINE strikes the sword from the hand of
 Lentulus; the latter tries to escape, but CATILINE holds him
 fast.]
 
 CATILINE.  Murderer!  Traitor!
 
 LENTULUS.  [Entreating.]  Mercy, Catiline!
 
 CATILINE.  I spell your plans upon your countenance.
 You wished to murder me, and put yourself
 Into the chieftain's place.  Was it not so?
 
 LENTULUS.  Yes, Catiline, it was even so!
 
 CATILINE.  [Looks at him with repressed scorn.]  What then?
 If 'tis the power you want,--so let it be!
 
 LENTULUS.  Explain,--what do you mean?
 
 CATILINE.  I shall resign;
 And you may lead the army--
 
 LENTULUS.  [Surprised.]  You resign?
 
 CATILINE.  I shall.  But be prepared for all events;
 Know this--our undertaking is revealed:
 The senate is informed of every plan;
 Its troops hem us about--
 
 LENTULUS.  What do you say?
 
 CATILINE.  Now shall I call a council of our friends;
 Do you come too,--announce your leadership;
 I shall resign.
 
 LENTULUS.  [Detains him.]  One moment, Catiline!
 
 CATILINE.  Your time is precious; ere the dawn of day
 You may expect an onslaught--
 
 LENTULUS.  [Anxiously.]  Hear me, friend!
 Surely you jest?  It is impossible--
 
 CATILINE.  Our project, I have told you, is betrayed.
 Show now your firmness and sagacity!
 
 LENTULUS.  Betrayed?  Then woe to us!
 
 CATILINE.  [Smiles scornfully.]  You paltry coward!
 You tremble _now_;--yet _you_ would murder _me_;
 You think a man like you is called to rule?
 
 LENTULUS.  Forgive me, Catiline!
 
 CATILINE.  Make your escape
 By hurried flight, if still it can be done.
 
 LENTULUS.  Ah, you permit me then--?
 
 CATILINE.  And did you think
 It was my purpose to forsake this post
 In such an hour as this?  You little know me.
 
 LENTULUS.  O, Catiline--!
 
 CATILINE.  [Coldly.]  Waste not your moments here!
 Seek your own safety;--I know how to die.
 
 [He turns away from him.]
 
 LENTULUS.  [To himself.]
 I thank you for these tidings, Catiline;--
 I shall make use of them to serve my end.
 'Twill stand me in good stead now that I know
 This region well; I'll seek the hostile army
 And guide it hitherward by secret paths,
 To your destruction and to my salvation.--
 The serpent that you trample in the dust
 So arrogantly still retains its sting!
 
 [He goes.]
 
 CATILINE.  [After a pause.]
 This is the trust I built my hopes upon!
 Thus one by one they leave me.  Oh ye gods!
 Treason and cowardice alone stir up
 The sullen currents of their slavish souls.
 Oh, what a fool am I with all my hopes!
 I would destroy yon viper's nest, that Rome,--
 Which is long since a heap of sunken ruins.
 
 [The sound of arms is heard approaching; he listens.]
 
 CATILINE.  They come, they come!  Still are there valiant men
 Among them.  Ah, the joyous clang of steel!
 The merry clash of shields against each other!
 Anew the fire kindles in my breast;
 The reckoning is near,--the mighty hour
 That settles every doubt.  I hail the day!
 
 [MANLIUS, STATILIUS, GABINIUS, and many OTHER CONSPIRATORS come
 through the forest.]
 
 MANLIUS.  Here, Catiline, come your friends and comrades true;
 In camp I spread the alarm, as you commanded--
 
 CATILINE.  And have you told them--?
 
 MANLIUS.  Yes,--they know our plight.
 
 STATILIUS.  We know it well, and we shall follow you
 With sword in hand to fight for life and death.
 
 CATILINE.  I thank you all, my comrades brave in arms!
 But do not think, my friends, that life or death
 Is ours to choose;--our only choice is this:
 Death in heroic battle with the foe,
 Or death by torture when like savage beasts
 We shall be hounded down relentlessly.
 Ah, which do you prefer?  To risk in flight
 A wretched life prolonged in misery,
 Or like your proud and worthy sires of old
 To perish nobly on the battlefield?
 
 GABINIUS.  We choose to fight and die!
 
 MANY VOICES.  Lead us to death!
 
 CATILINE.  Then let us be off!  Through death we shall achieve
 The glorious life of immortality.
 Our fall, our name, through distant generations
 Shall be proclaimed with lofty pride--
 
 FURIA.  [Calls out behind him among the trees.]  --O terror!
 
 SOME VOICES.  Behold,--a woman--!
 
 CATILINE.  [Startled.]  Furia!  You--you here?
 What brought you here?
 
 FURIA.  Ah, I must lead you on
 To your great goal.
 
 CATILINE.  Where is my goal, then?  Speak!
 
 FURIA.  Each mortal seeks his goal in his own way.
 And you seek yours through ever hopeless strife;
 The struggle yields defeat and certain death.
 
 CATILINE.  Yet also honor and immortal fame!
 Go, woman!  Great and noble is this hour!
 My heart is closed against your raucous cries.
 
 [AURELIA appears in the door of the tent.]
 
 AURELIA.  My Catiline--!
 
 [She stops, terrified at the sight of the throng.]
 
 CATILINE.  [Painfully.]  Aurelia,--oh, Aurelia!
 
 AURELIA.  What is the trouble?  All this stir in camp--
 What is on foot here?
 
 CATILINE.  You I could forget!
 What will your fate be now--?
 
 FURIA.  [Whispers scornfully, unnoticed by AURELIA.]
 Ah, Catiline,
 Already wavering in your high resolve?
 Is this your death defiance?
 
 CATILINE.  [Flaring up.]  No, by the gods!
 
 AURELIA.  [Comes nearer.]
 Oh, speak, beloved!  Keep me in doubt no longer--
 
 FURIA.  [In an undertone behind him.]
 Flee with your wife--the while your comrades die!
 
 MANLIUS.  Tarry no longer; lead us out to battle--
 
 CATILINE.  Oh, what a choice!  And yet,--here is no choice;--
 I must go on,--I dare not stop midway.
 
 CATILINE.  [Calls out.]  Then follow me to battle on the plain!
 
 AURELIA.  [Throws herself in his arms.]
 Catiline,--do not leave me,--take me with you!
 
 CATILINE.  No, stay, Aurelia!
 
 FURIA.  [As before.]  Take her, Catiline!
 Worthy your death will be, as was your life,
 When you are vanquished--in a woman's arms!
 
 CATILINE.  [Thrusts AURELIA aside.]
 Away, you who would rob me of my fame!
 Death shall o'ertake me in the midst of men.
 I have a life to atone, a name to clear--
 
 FURIA.  Just so; just so, my gallant Catiline!
 
 CATILINE.  All things I will uproot from out my soul
 That bind me to my life of empty dreams!
 All that is of the past shall henceforth be
 As if 'twere not--
 
 AURELIA.  Oh, cast me not away!
 By all the love I bear you, Catiline,--
 I beg you, I adjure,--let us not part!
 
 CATILINE.  My heart is dead, my sight is blind to love.
 From life's great mockery I turn my eyes;
 And gaze but on the dim, yet mighty star
 Of fame that is to be!
 
 AURELIA.  O gods of mercy!
 
 [She leans faint against the tree outside the tent.]
 
 CATILINE.  [To the Warriors.]  And now away!
 
 MANLIUS.  The din of arms I hear!
 
 SEVERAL VOICES.  They come, they come.
 
 CATILINE.  Good!  We will heed their warning.
 Long was our night of shame; our dawn is near--.
 To battle in the crimson sky of morning!
 By Roman sword, with Roman fortitude,
 The last of Romans perish in their blood!
 
 [They rush out through the forest; a great alarm, rent with
 battle-cries, is heard from within the camp.]
 
 FURIA.  He is gone forever.  My great task in life is done.
 Cold and rigid we shall find him in the morning sun.
 
 AURELIA.  [Aside.]
 In his passion-glutted bosom then should love no longer dwell?
 Was it nothing but a dream?  His angry words I heard full well.
 
 FURIA.  Hark, the weapons clash; already at the brink
 of death he stands;
 Soon a noiseless shadow he will hasten toward the spirit
 lands.
 
 AURELIA.  [Startled.]
 Who are you, prophetic voice, that yonder comes to me,
 Like the night-owl's cry of warning from some far-off tree!
 Are you from the clammy underworld of spirits come
 Hence to lead my Catiline into your gloomy home?
 
 FURIA.  Home is ay the journey's goal, and all his wanderings lay
 Through the reeking swamps of life--
 
 AURELIA.  But only for a day.
 Free and noble was his heart, his spirit strong and true,
 Till around it serpent-like a poisoned seedling grew.
 
 FURIA.
 So the plane-tree, too, keeps fresh and green its leafy dress,
 Till its trunk is smothered in a clinging vine's caress.
 
 AURELIA.
 Now did you betray your source.  For time and time again
 Echoed from the lips of Catiline this one refrain.
 You the serpent are, who poisoned all my joy in life,
 Steeled his heart against my kindness through your deadly strife.
 From those waking night-dreams well I know your infamy,
 Like a threat I see you stand between my love and me.
 With my husband at my side I cherished in my breast
 Longings for a tranquil life, a home of peace and rest.
 Ah, a garden-bed I planted in his weary heart;
 As its fairest ornament our love I hedged apart.
 Flower and all have you uprooted with malignant hand;
 In the dust it lies where thriving it did lately stand.
 
 FURIA.  Foolish weakling; you would guide the steps of Catiline?
 Do you not perceive his heart was never wholly thine?
 Think you that in such a soil your flower can survive?
 In the sunny springtime only violets can thrive,
 While the henbane grows in strength beneath a clouded grey;
 And his soul was long ago a clouded autumn day.
 All is lost to you.  Soon dies the spark within his breast;
 As a victim of revenge he shall go to his rest.
 
 AURELIA.  [With increasing vehemence.]
 Thus he shall not perish; no, by all the gods of day!
 To his weary heart my tears will somehow force a way.
 If I find him pale and gory on the battlefield,
 I shall throw my arms about him and his bosom shield,
 Breathe upon his speechless lips the love within my soul,
 Ease the pain within him and his suffering mind console.
 Herald of revenge, your victim from you I shall wrest,
 Bind him to the land of sunshine, to a home of rest;
 If his eyes be dimmed already, stilled his beating heart,
 Linked together arm in arm we shall this life depart.
 Grant me, gods of mercy, in return for what I gave,
 By the side of him I love, the stillness of the grave.
 
 [She goes.]
 
 FURIA.  [Gazes after her.]
 Seek him, deluded soul;--I have no fear;
 I hold the victory safe within my hands.
 
 FURIA.  The roar of battle grows; its rumble blends
 With death-cries and the crash of broken shields.
 Is he perchance now dying?  Still alive?
 Oh, blessed is this hour!  The sinking moon
 Secludes herself in massive thunderclouds.
 One moment more it will be night anew
 Ere comes the day;--and with the coming day
 All will be over.  In the dark he dies,
 As in the dark he lived.  O blessed hour!
 
 [She listens.]
 
 FURIA.  Now sweeps the wind by, like an autumn gust,
 And lapses slowly in the far-off distance.
 The ponderous armies slowly sweep the plain.
 Like angry ocean billows on they roll,
 Unyielding, trampling down the fallen dead.
 Out yonder I hear whines and moans and sighs,--
 The final lullaby,--wherewith they lull
 Themselves to rest and all their pallid brothers.
 Now speaks the night-owl forth to welcome them
 Into the kingdom of the gloomy shadows.
 
 FURIA.  [After a pause.]
 How still it is.  Now is he mine at last,--
 Aye, mine alone, and mine forevermore.
 Now we can journey toward the river Lethe--
 And far beyond where never dawns the day.
 Yet first I'll seek his bleeding body yonder,
 And freely glut my eyes upon those features,
 Hated and yet so fair, ere they be marred
 By rising sunshine and by watchful vultures.
 
 [She starts to go, but is suddenly startled at something.]
 
 FURIA.  What is that gliding o'er the meadow yonder?
 Is it the misty vapors of the moor
 That form a picture in the morning chill?
 Now it draws near.--The shade of Catiline!
 His spectre--!  I can see his misty eye,
 His broken shield, his sword bereft of blade.
 Ah, he is surely dead; one thing alone,--
 Remarkable,--his wound I do not see.
 
 [CATILINE comes through the forest, pale and weary, with
 drooping head and troubled countenance.]
 
 CATILINE.  [To himself.]  "Perish thou shalt by deed thine own,
 And yet a stranger's hand shall fell thee."
 Such was his prophecy.  Now am I fallen--
 Though struck by no one.  Who will solve the riddle?
 
 FURIA.  I greet you after battle, Catiline!
 
 CATILINE.  Ah, who are you?
 
 FURIA.  I am a shadow's shadow.
 
 CATILINE.  You, Furia,--you it is!  You welcome me?
 
 FURIA.  Welcome at last into our common home!
 Now we can go--two shades--to Charon's bark.
 Yet first--accept the wreath of victory.
 
 [She picks some flowers, which she weaves into a wreath during
 the following.]
 
 CATILINE.  What make you there?
 
 FURIA.  Your brow I shall adorn.
 But wherefore come you hither all alone?
 A chieftain's ghost ten thousand dead should follow.
 Then where are all your comrades, Catiline?
 
 CATILINE.  They slumber, Furia!
 
 FURIA.  Ah, they slumber still?
 
 CATILINE.  They slumber still,--and they will slumber long.
 They slumber all.  Steal softly through the forest,
 Peer out across the plain,--disturb them not!
 There will you find them in extended ranks.
 They fell asleep lulled by the clang of steel;
 They fell asleep,--and wakened not, as I did,
 When in the distant hills the echoes died.
 A shadow now you called me.  True, I am
 A shadow of myself.  But do not think
 Their slumber yonder is so undisturbed
 And void of dreams.  Oh, do not think so!
 
 FURIA.  Speak!
 What may your comrades dream?
 
 CATILINE.  Ah, you shall hear.--
 I led the battle with despairing heart,
 And sought my death beneath the play of swords.
 To right and left I saw my comrades fall;
 Statilius first,--then one by one the rest;
 My Curius fell trying to shield my breast;
 All perished there beneath Rome's flaming sword,--
 The sword that me alone passed by untouched.
 Yes, Catiline was spared by the sword of Rome.
 Half-stunned I stood there with my broken shield,
 Aware of nothing as the waves of battle
 Swept o'er me.  I recovered first my senses
 When all grew still again, and I looked up
 And saw the struggle seething--far behind me!
 How long I stood there?  Only this I know,--
 I stood alone among my fallen comrades.
 But there was life within those misty eyes;
 The corners of their mouths betrayed a smile;
 And they addressed their smile and gaze to me,
 Who stood alone erect among the dead,--
 Who had for ages fought for them and Rome,--
 Who stood there lonely and disgraced, untouched
 By Roman sword.  Then perished Catiline.
 
 FURIA.  False have you read your fallen comrades' dreams;
 False have you judged the reason of your fall.
 Their smiles and glances were but invitations
 To sleep with them--
 
 CATILINE.  Yes, if I only could!
 
 FURIA.  Have courage,--spectre of a former hero;
 Your hour of rest is near.  Come, bend your head;--
 I shall adorn you with the victor's crown.
 
 [She offers the wreath to him.]
 
 CATILINE.  Bah,--what is that?  A poppy-wreath--!
 
 FURIA.  [With wild glee.]  Well, yes;
 Are not such poppies pretty?  They will glow
 Around your forehead like a fringe of blood.
 
 CATILINE.  No, cast the wreath away!  I hate this crimson.
 
 FURIA.  [Laughs aloud.]
 Ah, you prefer the pale and feeble shades?
 Good!  I shall bring the garland of green rushes
 That Sylvia carried in her dripping locks,
 The day she came afloat upon the Tiber?
 
 CATILINE.  Alas, what visions--!
 
 FURIA.  Shall I bring you rather
 The thorny brambles from the market-place,
 With crimson-spots, the stain of civic blood,
 That flowed at your behest, my Catiline?
 
 CATILINE.  Enough!
 
 FURIA.  Or would you like a crown of leaves
 From the old winter oak near mother's home,
 That withered when a young dishonored woman
 With piercing cries distraught leaped in the river?
 
 CATILINE.  Pour out at once your measures of revenge
 Upon my head--
 
 FURIA.  I am your very eye,--
 Your very memory, your very doom.
 
 CATILINE.  But wherefore now?
 
 FURIA.  His goal at length attained,
 The traveller spent looks back from whence he came.
 
 CATILINE.  Have I then reached my goal?  Is this the goal?
 I am no longer living,--nor yet buried.
 Where lies the goal?
 
 FURIA.  In sight,--if you but will.
 
 CATILINE.  A will I have no longer; my will perished
 When all the things I willed once, came to naught.
 
 CATILINE.  [Waves his arms.]
 Away,--away from me, ye sallow shades!
 What claim you here of me, ye men and women?
 I cannot give you--!  Oh, this multitude--!
 
 FURIA.  To earth your spirit still is closely bound!
 These thousand-threaded nets asunder tear!
 Come, let me press this wreath upon your locks,--
 'Tis gifted with a strong and soothing virtue;
 It kills the memory, lulls the soul to rest!
 
 CATILINE.  [Huskily.]
 It kills the memory?  Dare I trust your word?
 Then press your poison-wreath upon my forehead.
 
 FURIA.  [Puts the wreath on his head.]
 Now it is yours! Thus decked you shall appear
 Before the prince of darkness, Catiline!
 
 CATILINE.  Away! away!  I yearn to go below;--
 I long to pass into the spirit lands.
 Let us together go!  What holds me here?
 What stays my steps?  Behind me here I feel
 Upon the morning sky a misty star;--
 It holds me in the land of living men;
 It draws me as the moon attracts the sea.
 
 FURIA.  Away!  Away!
 
 CATILINE.  It beckons and it twinkles.
 I cannot follow you until this light
 Is quenched entirely, or by clouds obscured,--
 I see it clearly now; 'tis not a star;
 It is a human heart, throbbing and warm;
 It binds me here; it fascinates and draws me
 As draws the evening star the eye of children.
 
 FURIA.  Then stop this beating heart!
 
 CATILINE.  What do you mean?
 
 FURIA.  The dagger in your belt--.  A single thrust,--
 The star will vanish and the heart will die
 That stand between us like an enemy.
 
 CATILINE.  Ah, I should--?  Sharp and shining is the
 dagger--
 
 CATILINE.  [With a cry.]
 Aurelia!  O Aurelia, where--where are you?
 Were you but here--!  No, no,--I will not see you!
 And yet methinks all would be well again,
 And peace would come, if I could lay my head
 Upon your bosom and repent--repent!
 
 FURIA.  And what would you repent?
 
 CATILINE.  Oh, everything!
 That I have been, that I have ever lived.
 
 FURIA.  'Tis now too late--too late!  Whence now you stand
 No path leads back again.--Go try it, fool!
 Now am I going home.  Place you your head
 Upon her breast and see if there you find
 The blessed peace your weary soul desires.
 
 FURIA.  [With increasing wildness.]
 Soon will the thousand dead rise up again;
 Dishonored women will their numbers join;
 And all,--aye, they will all demand of you
 The life, the blood, the honor you destroyed.
 In terror you will flee into the night,--
 Will roam about the earth on every strand,
 Like old Actean, hounded by his dogs,--
 A shadow hounded by a thousand shades!
 
 CATILINE.  I see it, Furia.  Here I have no peace.
 I am an exile in the world of light!
 I'll go with you into the spirit realms;--
 The bond that binds me I will tear asunder.
 
 FURIA.  Why grope you with the dagger?
 
 CATILINE.  She shall die.
 
 [The lightning strikes and the thunder rolls.]
 
 FURIA.  The mighty powers rejoice at your resolve!--
 See, Catiline,--see, yonder comes your wife.
 
 [AURELIA comes through the forest in an anxious search.]
 
 AURELIA.  Where shall I find him?  Where--where can he be!
 I've searched in vain among the dead--
 
 [Discovers him.]
 
 AURELIA.  Great heavens,--
 My Catiline!
 
 [She rushes toward him.]
 
 CATILINE.  [Bewildered.]  Speak not that name again!
 
 AURELIA.  You are alive?
 
 [Is about to throw herself in his arms.]
 
 CATILINE.  [Thrusting her aside.]  Away!  I'm not alive.
 
 AURELIA.  Oh, hear me, dearest--!
 
 CATILINE.  No, I will not hear!
 I hate you.  I see through your cunning wiles.
 You wish to chain me to a living death.
 Cease staring at me!  Ah, your eyes torment me,--
 They pierce like daggers through my very soul!
 Ah, yes, the dagger!  Die!  Come, close your eyes--
 
 [He draws the dagger and seizes her by the hand.]
 
 AURELIA.  Keep guard, oh gracious gods, o'er him and me!
 
 CATILINE.  Quick, close your eyes; close them, I say;--in them
 I see the starlight and the morning sky--.
 Now shall I quench the heavenly star of dawn!
 
 [The thunder rolls again.]
 
 CATILINE.  Your heart; your blood!  Now speak the gods of life
 Their last farewell to you and Catiline!
 
 [He lifts the dagger toward her bosom; she escapes into the
 tent; he pursues her.]
 
 FURIA.  [Listens.]  She stretches out her hand imploringly.
 She pleads with him for life.  He hears her not.
 He strikes her down!  She reels in her own blood!
 
 [CATILINE comes slowly out of the tent with the dagger in his
 hand.]
 
 CATILINE.  Now am I free.  Soon I shall cease to be.
 Now sinks my soul in vague oblivion.
 My eyes are growing dim, my hearing faint,
 As if through rushing waters.  Ah, do you know
 What I have slain with this my little dagger?
 Not her alone,--but all the hearts on earth,--
 All living things, all things that grow and bloom;--
 The starlight have I dimmed, the crescent moon,
 The flaming sun.  Ah, see,--it fails to rise;
 'Twill never rise again; the sun is dead.
 Now is the whole wide realm of earth transformed
 Into a huge and clammy sepulchre,
 Its vault of leaden grey;--beneath this vault
 Stand you and I, bereft of light and darkness,
 Of death and life,--two restless exiled shadows.
 
 FURIA.  Now stand we, Catiline, before our goal!
 
 CATILINE.  No, one step more--before I reach my goal.
 Relieve me of my burden!  Do you not see,
 I bend beneath the corpse of Catiline?
 A dagger through the corpse of Catiline!
 
 [He shows her the dagger.]
 
 CATILINE.  Come, Furia, set me free!  Come, take this dagger;--
 On it the star of morning I impaled;--
 Take it--and plunge it straightway through the corpse;
 Then it will loose its hold, and I am free.
 
 FURIA.  [Takes the dagger.]
 Your will be done, whom I have loved in hate!
 Shake off your dust and come with me to rest.
 
 [She buries the dagger deep in his heart; he sinks down at the
 foot of the tree.]
 
 CATILINE.  [After a moment comes to consciousness
 again, passes his hand across his forehead, and speaks
 faintly.]  Now, mysterious voice, your prophecy I understand!
 I shall perish by my own, yet by a stranger's hand.
 Nemesis has wrought her end.  Shroud me, gloom of night!
 Raise your billows, murky Styx, roll on in all your might!
 Ferry me across in safety; speed the vessel on
 Toward the silent prince's realm, the land of shadows wan.
 Two roads there are running yonder; I shall journey dumb
 Toward the left--
 
 AURELIA.  [From the tent, pale and faltering, her
 bosom bloody.]  --no, toward the right!  Oh, toward Elysium!
 
 CATILINE.  [Startled.]
 How this bright and lurid picture fills my soul with dread!
 She herself it is!  Aurelia, speak,--are you not dead?
 
 AURELIA.  [Kneels before him.]
 No, I live that I may still your agonizing cry,--
 Live that I may lean my bosom on your breast and die.
 
 CATILINE.  Oh, you live!
 
 AURELIA.  I did but swoon; though my two eyes grew blurred,
 Dimly yet I followed you and heard your every word.
 And my love a spouse's strength again unto me gave;--
 Breast to breast, my Catiline, we go into the grave!
 
 CATILINE.  Oh, how gladly would I go!  Yet all in vain you sigh.
 We must part.  Revenge compels me with a hollow cry.
 You can hasten, free and blithesome, forth to peace and light;
 I must cross the river Lethe down into the night.
 
 [The day dawns in the background.]
 
 AURELIA.  [Points toward the increasing light.]
 No, the terrors and the gloom of death love scatters far.
 See, the storm-clouds vanish; faintly gleams the morning star.
 
 AURELIA.  [With uplifted arms.]
 Light is victor!  Grand and full of freshness dawns the day!
 Follow me, then!  Death already speeds me on his way.
 
 [She sinks down over him.]
 
 CATILINE.  [Presses her to himself and speaks with his last
 strength.]  Oh, how sweet!  Now I remember my forgotten dream,
 How the darkness was dispersed before a radiant beam,
 How the song of children ushered in the new-born day.
 Ah, my eye grows dim, my strength is fading fast away;
 But my mind is clearer now than ever it has been:
 All the wanderings of my life loom plainly up within.
 Yes, my life a tempest was beneath the lightning blaze;
 But my death is like the morning's rosy-tinted haze.
 
 [Bends over her.]
 
 CATILINE.
 You have driven the gloom away; peace dwells within my breast.
 I shall seek with you the dwelling place of light and rest!
 
 CATILINE.  [He tears the dagger quickly out of his breast and
 speaks with dying voice.]
 The gods of dawn are smiling in atonement from above;
 All the powers of darkness you have conquered with your love!
 
 [During the last scene FURIA has withdrawn farther and farther
 into the background and disappears at last among the trees.
 CATILINE's head sinks down on AURELIA's breast; they die.]

 SCENE I
 
 [At the right of the stage sits RODERIK writing.  To
 the left BLANKA in a half reclining position.]
 
 BLANKA.  Lo! the sky in dying glory
   Surges like a sea ablaze,--
   It is all so still before me,
   Still as in a sylvan maze.
   Summer evening's mellow power
   Settles round us like a dove,
   Hovers like a swan above
   Ocean wave and forest flower.
   In the orange thicket slumber
   Gods and goddesses of yore,
   Stone reminders in great number
   Of a world that is no more.
   Virtue, valor, trust are gone,
   Rich in memory alone;
   Could there be a more complete
   Picture of the South effete?
 
 [Rises.]
 
 BLANKA.  But my father has related
   Stories of a distant land,
   Of a life, fresh, unabated,
   Neither carved nor wrought by hand!
   Here the spirit has forever
   Vanished into stone and wave,--
   There it breathes as free as ever,
   Like a warrior strong and brave!
   When the evening's crystallizing
   Vapors settle on my breast,
   Lo!  I see before me rising
   Norway's snow-illumined crest!
   Here is life decayed and dying,
   Sunk in torpor, still, forlorn,--
   There go avalanches flying,
   Life anew in death is born!
   If I had the white swan's coat--
 
 RODERIK.  [After a pause writing.]
 "Then, it is said, will Ragnaroek have stilled
 The wilder powers, brought forth a chastened life;
 All-Father, Balder, and the gentle Freya
 Will rule again the race of man in peace!"--
 
 [After having watched her for a moment.]
 
 RODERIK.  But, Blanka, now you dream away again;
 You stare through space completely lost in thought,--
 What is it that you seek?
 
 BLANKA.  [Draws near.]  Forgive me, father!
 I merely followed for a space the swan,
 That sailed on snowy wings across the sea.
 
 RODERIK.  And if I had not stopped you in your flight,
 My young and pretty little swan! who knows
 How far you might have flown away from me,--
 Perchance to Thule?
 
 BLANKA.  And indeed why not?
 To Thule flies the swan in early spring,
 If only to return again each fall.
 
 [Seats herself at his feet.]
 
 BLANKA.  Yet I--I am no swan,--no, call me rather
 A captured falcon, sitting tame and true,
 A golden ring about his foot.
 
 RODERIK.  Well,--and the ring?
 
 BLANKA.  The ring?  That is my love for you, dear father!
 With that you have your youthful falcon bound,
 I cannot fly,--not even though I wished to.
 
 [Rises.]
 
 BLANKA.  But when I see the swan sail o'er the wave,
 Light as a cloud before the summer wind,
 Then I remember all that you have told
 Of the heroic life in distant Thule;
 Then, as it seems, the bird is like a bark
 With dragon head and wings of burnished gold;
 I see the youthful hero in the prow,
 A copper helmet on his yellow locks,
 With eyes of blue, a manly, heaving breast,
 His sword held firmly in his mighty hand.
 I follow him upon his rapid course,
 And all my dreams run riot round his bark,
 And frolic sportively like merry dolphins
 In fancy's deep and cooling sea!
 
 RODERIK.  O you,--
 You are an ardent dreamer, my good child,--
 I almost fear your thoughts too often dwell
 Upon the people in the rugged North.
 
 BLANKA.  And, father, whose the fault, if it were so?
 
 RODERIK.  You mean that I--?
 
 BLANKA.  Yes, what else could I mean;
 You live yourself but in the memory
 Of early days among these mighty Norsemen;
 Do not deny that often as you speak
 Of warlike forays, combats, fights,
 Your cheek begins to flush, your eye to glow;
 It seems to me that you grow young again.
 
 RODERIK.  Yes, yes, but I have reason so to do;
 For I have lived among them in the North,
 And every bit that memory calls to mind
 Is like a page to me from my own saga.
 But you, however, fostered in the South,
 Who never saw the silver-tinted mountains,
 Who never heard the trumpet's echoing song,--
 Ah, how could you be moved by what I tell?
 
 BLANKA.  Oh, must a human being see and hear
 All things but with his outer senses then?
 Has not the inner soul, too, eye and ear,
 With which it can both see and hearken well?
 'Tis true it is with eyes of flesh I see
 The richly glowing color of the rose;
 But with the spirit's eye I see within
 A lovely elf, a fairy butterfly,
 Who archly hides behind the crimson leaves,
 And singeth of a secret power from heaven
 That gave the flower brightness and perfume.
 
 RODERIK.  True, true, my child!
 
 BLANKA.  I almost do believe
 That just because I do not really see,
 The whole looms up more beautiful in thought;
 That, father, is the way with you at least!
 The ancient sagas and heroic lays,--
 These you remember, speak of with delight,
 And scratch in runic script upon your parchment;
 But if I ask about your youthful life
 In Norway's distant realm, your eyes grow dark,
 Your lips are silent, and it seems at times
 Your bosom houses gloomy memories.
 
 RODERIK.  [Rises.]
 Come, speak no more, good child, about the past.
 Who is there then whose youthful memories
 Are altogether free from self-reproach;
 You know, the Norsemen are a savage lot.
 
 BLANKA.  But are the warriors of the South less fierce?
 Have you forgot that night, now ten years past,
 The time the strangers landed on the coast,
 And plundered--?
 
 RODERIK.  [Visibly ill at ease.]  Say no more now,--let us hence;
 The sundown soon will be upon us;--come!
 
 BLANKA.  [As they go.]  Give me your hand!
 
 [Stops.]
 
 BLANKA.  No, wait!
 
 RODERIK.  What is the matter?
 
 BLANKA.  I have today for the first time forgot--
 
 RODERIK.  And what have you forgot?
 
 BLANKA.  [Points to the barrow.]  Behold the wreath!
 
 RODERIK.  It is--
 
 BLANKA.  The withered one of yesterday;
 I have forgot today to make the change;
 Yet, let me take you to the cabin first,
 Then shall I venture out in search of flowers;
 The violet never is so sweet and rare
 As when the dew has bathed its silver lining;
 The budding rose is never quite so fair
 As when 'tis plucked in child-like sleep reclining!

 SCENE II
 
 [GANDALF and the VIKINGS enter from the right.]
 
 ASGAUT.  Now we shall soon be there.
 
 GANDALF.  Point out the place!
 
 ASGAUT.  No, wait till we have gone beyond the wood.
 There was still standing on the rocky cliff
 Against the sea a remnant of the wall,--
 I dare say it is standing there to-day.
 
 JOSTEJN.  But tell us, king, what can it profit us
 To tramp about here on the isle like fools?
 
 HROLLOUG.  Yes, tell us what shall--
 
 GANDALF.  You shall hold your tongues!
 And blindly follow where your king commands!
 
 GANDALF.  [To ASGAUT.]
 It seems to me, however, you cleaned house
 Too well when you were last here on the isle;
 You might have left a little, I should think,
 For me and my revenge!
 
 HROLLOUG.  You are the king,
 And loyalty we pledged you at the thing,
 But when we followed you upon the war path,
 It was to win our share of fame and glory.
 
 JOSTEJN.  And golden treasures, Hrolloug, golden treasures.
 
 SEVERAL.  That, Gandalf, is the law, and heed it well!
 
 GANDALF.  I know the law perhaps as well as you;
 But is there not since days of old a law
 And covenant with us that when a kinsman
 Falls slain before the enemy and his corpse
 Unburied lies a prey unto the raven,
 Blood vengeance must be had?
 
 SOME.  Yes, so it is!
 
 GANDALF.  Then stand you ready with your sword and shield,--
 You have a king to avenge and I a father!
 
 [Commotion among the VIKINGS.]
 
 JOSTEJN.  A king?
 
 HROLLOUG.  A father?
 
 GANDALF.  Wait,--I shall relate
 How all this stands.  You know, my father was
 A mighty viking.  Twelve years gone it is
 Since he the last time sallied forth one spring
 With Asgaut there and all his old time warriors.
 Two years he roamed about from strand to strand,
 Visiting Bratland, Valland, even Blaaland;
 At length he went and harried Sicily,
 And there heard stories of a wealthy chief,
 Who lived upon this island in a castle
 With sturdy walls built on a rocky base,
 And in it there were costly treasures hid.
 At night he took his men and went ashore,
 And razed the castle walls with fire and sword.
 Himself went foremost like an angry bear,
 And in the fury of the fight saw not
 How all his warriors fell about him dead;
 And when the morning sun rose in the east,
 There lay the castle smouldering in ruin.
 Asgaut alone survived with one or two,--
 My father and the hundred others there
 Had ridden to Valhalla through the flames.
 
 ASGAUT.  I hoisted every sail upon the bark,
 And turned the prow straight homeward to the North;
 There sought I all in vain for Gandalf king;
 The youthful eagle, I was told, had flown
 Across the sea to Iceland or the Faroes.
 I hastened after him but found no trace,-
 Yet everywhere I went his name was known;
 For though his bark sped cloud-like in the storm,
 Yet flew his fame on even swifter wings.
 At last this spring I found him, as you know;
 It was in Italy; I told him then
 What things had happened, how his father died,
 And Gandalf swore by all Valhalla's gods
 Blood-vengeance he would take with fire and sword.
 
 JOSTEJN.  It is an ancient law and should be honored!
 But had I been in your place, Gandalf king,
 I should have lingered on in Italy,--
 For there was gold to win.
 
 HROLLOUG.  And honor too.
 
 GANDALF.  That is your loyalty to your dead king.
 
 JOSTEJN.  Come, come now; no offence; I merely meant
 The dead could wait perhaps.
 
 ASGAUT.  [With suppressed rage.]  You paltry race!
 
 JOSTEJN.  But now that we are here--
 
 HROLLOUG.  Yes; let us raise
 Unto the king a worthy monument!
 
 SOME.  Yes, yes!
 
 OTHERS.  With bloodshed and with fire!
 
 ASGAUT.  Now that I like!
 
 GANDALF.  And now away to spy around the island;
 For even tonight blood-vengeance shall be mine;
 If not, I must myself fall.
 
 ASGAUT.  So he swore.
 
 GANDALF.  I swore it solemnly by all the gods!
 And once again I swear it--
 
 HEMMING.  [With a harp on his shoulder has during the
 preceding emerged from among the WARRIORS and cries
 out imploringly.]  Swear not, Gandalf!
 
 GANDALF.  What troubles you?
 
 HEMMING.  Swear not here in this wood!
 Here in the South our gods can never hear;
 Out on your bark, up North among the hills,
 There they still hearken to you, but not here!
 
 ASGAUT.  Have you too breathed the poison of the South?
 
 HEMMING.  In Italy I heard the pious monks
 Tell lovely stories of the holy Christ,
 And what they told still lingers in my mind
 Through night and day and will no more be gone.
 
 GANDALF.  I had you brought with me because in youth
 You showed great promise of poetic gifts.
 You were to see my bold and warlike deeds,
 So that when I, King Gandalf, old and gray,
 Sat with my warriors round the oaken table,
 The king's young scald might while away
 Long winter evenings with heroic lays,
 And sing at last a saga of my deeds;
 The hero's fame voiced in the poet's song
 Outlives the monument upon his grave.
 But now, be off, and if you choose go cast
 Your harp aside and don the monkish cowl.
 Aha!  King Gandalf has a mighty scald!
 
 [The VIKINGS go into the forest to the left; HEMMING follows
 them.]
 
 ASGAUT.  It is a mouldy time we live in now;
 Our faith and customs from the olden days
 Are everywhere upon the downward path.
 Lucky it is that I am growing old;
 My eyes shall never see the North decay.
 But you, King Gandalf, you are young and strong;
 And wheresoe'er you roam in distant lands,
 Remember that it is a royal task
 To guard the people and defend the gods!
 
 [He follows the rest.]
 
 GANDALF.  [After a pause.]  Hm, he has no great confidence in me.
 'Tis well he went!  Whenever he is near,
 It is as if a burden weighed me down.
 The grim old viking with his rugged face,--
 He looks like Asathor, who with his belt
 Of strength and Mjoelnir stood within the grove,
 Carved out in marble, near my father's home.
 My father's home!  Who knows, alas! how things
 Around the ancient landmarks now may look!--
 Mountains and fields are doubtless still the same;
 The people--?  Have they still the same old heart?
 No, there is fallen mildew o'er the age,
 And it is that which saps the Northern life
 And eats away like poison what is best.
 Well, I will homeward,--save what still is left
 To save before it falls to utter ruin.
 
 GANDALF.  [After a pause during which he looks around.]
 How lovely in these Southern groves it is;
 My pine groves can not boast such sweet perfume.
 
 [He perceives the mound.]
 
 GANDALF.  What now?  A warrior's grave?  No doubt it hides
 A countryman from those more stirring days.
 A warrior's barrow in the South!--'Tis only just;
 It was the South gave us our mortal wound.
 How lovely it is here!  It brings to mind
 One winter night when as a lad I sat
 Upon my father's knee before the hearth,
 The while he told me stories of the gods,
 Of Odin, Balder, and the mighty Thor;
 And when I mentioned Freya's grove to him,
 He pictured it exactly like this grove,--
 But when I asked him something more of Freya,
 What she herself was like, the old man laughed
 And answered as he placed me on my feet,
 "A woman will in due time tell you that!"
 
 GANDALF.  [Listening.]
 Hush!  Footsteps in the forest!  Quiet, Gandalf,-
 They bring the first fruits of your blood-revenge!
 
 [He steps aside so that he is half concealed among the bushes to
 the right.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE III
 
 [GANDALF.  BLANKA with oak leaves in her hair and a
 basket of flowers enters from the left.]
 
 BLANKA.  [Seated at the left busily weaving a flower wreath.]
 Fountains may murmur in the sunny vales,
 Resplendent billows roll beneath the shore;
 Nor fountain's murmur, nor the billow's song
 Has half the magic of those flowers there,
 That stand in clusters round the barrow's edge
 And nod at one another lovingly;
 They draw me hither during night and day,--
 And it is here I long to come and dream.
 The wreath is done.  The hero's monument,
 So hard and cold, shall under it be hid.
 Yes, it is beautiful!
 
 [Pointing to the mound.]
 
 BLANKA.  A vanished life,
 Of giant strength, lies mouldering in the ground,--
 And the memorial which should speak to men,--
 A cold unyielding stone like yonder one!
 But then comes art, and with a friendly hand
 She gathers flowers from the breast of nature
 And hides the ugly, unresponsive stone
 With snow-white lilies, sweet forget-me-nots.
 
 [She ascends the barrow, hangs the wreath over the monument, and
 speaks after a pause.]
 
 BLANKA.  Again my dreams go sailing to the North
 Like birds of passage o'er the ocean waves;
 I feel an urging where I long to go,
 And willingly I heed the secret power,
 Which has its royal seat within the soul.
 I stand in Norway, am a hero's bride,
 And from the mountain peak watch eagle-like.
 O'er shining waves the vessel heaves in sight.--
 Oh, like the gull fly to your fatherland!
 I am a Southern child, I cannot wait;
 I tear the oaken wreath out of my hair,--
 Take this, my hero!  'Tis the second message
 I greet you with,--my yearning was the first.
 
 [She throws the wreath.  GANDALF steps forth and seizes it.]
 
 BLANKA.  What's this?  There stands a--
 
 [She rubs her eyes and stares amazed at him.]
 
 No, it is no dream.
 Who are you, stranger?  What is it you seek
 Here on the shore?
 
 GANDALF.  Step first from off the mound,--
 Then we can talk at ease.
 
 BLANKA.  [Comes down.]  Well, here I am!
 
 BLANKA.  [Aside as she looks him over.]
 The chain mail o'er his breast, the copper helmet,--
 Exactly as my father has related.
 
 BLANKA.  [Aloud.]  Take off your helmet!
 
 GANDALF.  Why?
 
 BLANKA.  Well, take it off!
 
 BLANKA.  [Aside.]
 Two sparkling eyes, locks like a field of grain,--
 Exactly as I saw him in my dream.
 
 GANDALF.  Who are you, woman?
 
 BLANKA.  I?  A poor, poor child!
 
 GANDALF.  Yet certainly the fairest on the isle.
 
 BLANKA.  The fairest?  That indeed is possible,
 For here there's no one else.
 
 GANDALF.  What,--no one else?
 
 BLANKA.  Unless my father be,--but he is old
 And has a silver beard, as long as this;
 No, after all I think I win the prize.
 
 GANDALF.  You have a merry spirit.
 
 BLANKA.  Not always now!
 
 GANDALF.  But tell me, pray, how this is possible;
 You say you live alone here with your father,
 Yet I have heard men say most certainly
 The island here is thickly populated?
 
 BLANKA.  It was so once, three years ago or more;
 But,--well, it is a sad and mournful tale--
 Yet you shall hear it if you wish.
 
 GANDALF.  Yes, certainly!
 
 BLANKA.  You see, three years ago--
 
 [Seats herself.]
 
 BLANKA.  Come, seat yourself!
 
 GANDALF.  [Steps back a pace.]  No, sit you down, I'll stand.
 
 BLANKA.  Three years ago there came, God knows from whence,
 A warlike band of robbers to the isle;
 They plundered madly as they went about,
 And murdered everything they found alive.
 A few escaped as best they could by flight
 And sought protection in my father's castle,
 Which stood upon the cliff right near the sea.
 
 GANDALF.  Your father's, did you say?
 
 BLANKA.  My father's, yes.--
 It was a cloudy evening when they burst
 Upon the castle gate, tore through the wall,
 Rushed in the court, and murdered right and left.
 I fled into the darkness terrified,
 And sought a place of refuge in the forest.
 I saw our home go whirling up in flames,
 I heard the clang of shields, the cries of death.--
 Then everything grew still; for all were dead.--
 The savage band proceeded to the shore
 And sailed away.--I sat upon the cliff
 The morning after, near the smouldering ruins.
 I was the only one whom they had spared.
 
 GANDALF.  But you just told me that your father lives.
 
 BLANKA.  My foster-father; wait, and you shall hear!
 I sat upon the cliff oppressed and sad,
 And listened to the awful stillness round;
 There issued forth a faint and feeble cry,
 As from beneath the rocky cleft beneath my feet;
 I listened full of fear, then went below,
 And found a stranger, pale with loss of blood.
 I ventured nearer, frightened as I was,
 Bound up his wounds and tended him,--
 
 GANDALF.  And he?
 
 BLANKA.  Told me as he recovered from his wounds,
 That he had come aboard a merchantman,
 Had reached the island on the very day
 The castle was destroyed,--took refuge there
 And fought the robber band with all his might
 Until he fell, faint with the loss of blood,
 Into the rocky cleft wherein I found him.
 And ever since we two have lived together;
 He built for us a cabin in the wood,
 I grew to love him more than any one.
 But you must see him,--come!
 
 GANDALF.  No, wait,--not now!
 We meet in ample time, I have no doubt.
 
 BLANKA.  Well, all right, as you please; but rest assured
 He would be glad to greet you 'neath his roof;
 For you must know that hospitality
 Is found not only in the North.
 
 GANDALF.  The North?
 You know then--
 
 BLANKA.  Whence you come, you mean?  Oh, yes!
 My father has so often told of you
 That I the moment that I saw you--
 
 GANDALF.  Yet you
 Were not afraid!
 
 BLANKA.  Afraid?  And why afraid?
 
 GANDALF.  Has he not told you then,--of course if not--
 
 BLANKA.  Told me that you were fearless heroes?  Yes!
 But pray, why should that frighten me?
 I know you seek your fame on distant shores,
 In manly combat with all doughty warriors;
 But I have neither sword nor coat of mail,
 Then why should I fear--
 
 GANDALF.  No, of course, of course!
 But still, those strangers who destroyed the castle?
 
 BLANKA.  And what of them?
 
 GANDALF.  Only,--has not your father
 Told you from whence they came?
 
 BLANKA.  Never!  How could he!
 Strangers they were alike to him and us.
 But if you wish I'll ask him right away.
 
 GANDALF.  [Quickly.]  No, let it be.
 
 BLANKA.  Ah, now I understand!
 You wish to know where you can seek them now,
 And take blood-vengeance, as you call it.
 
 GANDALF.  Ah,
 Blood-vengeance!  Thanks!  The word I had forgot;
 You bring me back--
 
 BLANKA.  But do you know, it is
 An ugly practice.
 
 GANDALF.  [Going toward the background.]  Farewell!
 
 BLANKA.  O, you are going?
 
 GANDALF.  We meet in time.
 
 [Stops.]
 
 GANDALF.  Tell me this one thing more:
 What warrior is it rests beneath the mound?
 
 BLANKA.  I do not know.
 
 GANDALF.  You do not know, and still
 You scatter flowers on the hero's grave.
 
 BLANKA.  My father led me here one morning early
 And pointed out to me the fresh-made mound,
 Which I had never seen upon the strand.
 He bade me say my morning prayers out here,
 And in my supplications to remember
 Those who had harried us with sword and fire.
 
 GANDALF.  And you?
 
 BLANKA.  Each morning from that day to this
 I sent a prayer to heaven for their salvation;
 And every evening flowers afresh I wove
 Into a garland for the grave.
 
 GANDALF.  Yes, strange!
 How can you pray thus for your enemy?
 
 BLANKA.  My faith commands me.
 
 GANDALF.  [Vehemently.]  Such a faith is craven;
 It is the faith which saps the hero's strength;
 'Twas therefore that the great, heroic life
 Died feebly in the South!
 
 BLANKA.  But now suppose
 My craven faith, as you see fit to call it,
 Could be transplanted to your virgin soil,--
 I know full well, there would spring forth a mass
 Of flowers so luxuriant as to hide
 The naked mountain.
 
 GANDALF.  Let the mountain stand
 In nakedness until the end of time!
 
 BLANKA.  O!  Take me with you!
 
 GANDALF.  What do you mean?
 I sail for home--
 
 BLANKA.  Well, I shall sail with you;
 For I have often traveled in my dreams
 To far-off Norway, where you live mid snow
 And ice and sombre woods of towering pines.
 There should come mirth and laughter in the hall,
 If I could have my say, I promise you;
 For I am merry;--have you any scald?
 
 GANDALF.  I had one, but the sultry Southern air
 Has loosened all the strings upon his harp,--
 They sing no longer--
 
 BLANKA.  Good!  Then shall I be
 Your scald.
 
 GANDALF.  And you?--You could go with us there,
 And leave your father and your home?
 
 BLANKA.  [Laughing.]  Aha!
 You think I meant it seriously?
 
 GANDALF.  Was it
 Only a jest?
 
 BLANKA.  Alas! a foolish dream
 I often used to dream before we met,--
 Which often I no doubt shall dream again,
 When you--
 
 [Suddenly breaking off.]
 
 BLANKA.  You stare so fixedly.
 
 GANDALF.  Do I?
 
 BLANKA.  Why, yes!  What are you thinking of?
 
 GANDALF.  I?  Nothing!
 
 BLANKA.  Nothing?
 
 GANDALF.  That is, I scarcely know myself;
 And yet I do--and you shall hear it now:
 I thought of you and how you would transplant
 Your flowers in the North, when suddenly
 My own faith came as if by chance to mind.
 One word therein I never understood
 Before; now have you taught me what it means.
 
 BLANKA.  And that is what?
 
 GANDALF.  Valfader, it is said,
 Receives but half the warriors slain in battle;
 The other half to Freya goes by right.
 That I could never fully comprehend;
 But--now I understand,--I am myself
 A fallen warrior, and to Freya goes
 The better part of me.
 
 BLANKA.  [Amazed.]  What does this mean?
 
 GANDALF.  Well, in a word, then know--
 
 BLANKA.  [Quickly.]  No, say it not!
 I dare not tarry longer here to-night,--
 My father waits, and I must go; farewell!
 
 GANDALF.  O, you are going?
 
 BLANKA.  [Takes the wreath of oak leaves which he has
 let fall and throws it around his helmet.]  You can keep it now.
 Lo, what I hitherto bestowed on you
 In dreams, I grant you now awake.
 
 GANDALF.  Farewell!
 
 [He goes quickly out to the right.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE IV
 
 BLANKA.  [Alone.]
   He is gone!  Ah, perfect stillness
   Rules upon the barren strand.
   Perfect stillness, grave-like stillness
   Rules my heart with heavy hand.
   Came he then to vanish only
   Through the mist, a ray of light?
   Soon he flies, a sea-gull lonely,
   Far away into the night!
   What is left me of this lover?
   But a flower in the dark:
   In my loneliness to hover
   Like a petrel round his bark!
 
 [The war trumpet of the Vikings is heard from the left.]
 
 BLANKA.  Ah!  What was that!  A trumpet from the wood!
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE V
 
 [BLANKA, GANDALF from the right.]
 
 GANDALF.  [Aside.]  It is too late!
 
 BLANKA.  O, there he is again!
 What do you want?
 
 GANDALF.  Quick,--quick, away from here!
 
 BLANKA.  What do you mean?
 
 GANDALF.  Away!  There's danger here!
 
 BLANKA.  What danger?
 
 GANDALF.  Death!
 
 BLANKA.  I do not understand you.
 
 GANDALF.  I thought to hide it from you,--hence I went
 To call my people to the ship again
 And sail away; you never should have known,--
 The trumpet warns me that it is too late,--
 That they are coming.
 
 BLANKA.  Who are coming?
 
 GANDALF.  Then know,--
 The strangers who once harried on the isle
 Were vikings like myself.
 
 BLANKA.  From Norway?
 
 GANDALF.  Yes.
 My father, who was chief among them, fell,--
 Hence must he be avenged.
 
 BLANKA.  Avenged?
 
 GANDALF.  Such is
 The custom.
 
 BLANKA.  Ah, I see now!
 
 GANDALF.  Here they come!
 Stand close behind me!
 
 BLANKA.  Man of blood,--away!
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE VI
 
 [The Preceding.]
 
 [ASGAUT, HEMMING and the VIKINGS, who lead RODERIK
 between them.]
 
 ASGAUT.  [To GANDALF.]  A meagre find, yet something, to be sure.
 
 BLANKA.  My father!
 
 [She throws herself in his arms.]
 
 RODERIK.  Blanka!  O, my child!
 
 JOSTEJN.  A woman!
 He will have company.
 
 ASGAUT.  Yes, straight to Hell!
 
 BLANKA.  O father, wherefore have you never told me--
 
 RODERIK.  Hush!  Hush! my child!
 
 [Points to GANDALF.]
 
 RODERIK.  Is this your chieftain?
 
 ASGAUT.  Yes.
 
 ASGAUT.  [To GANDALF.]
 This man can tell you how your father died;
 For he was in the thick of it, he says,
 The only one to get away alive.
 
 GANDALF.  Hush!  I will nothing hear.
 
 ASGAUT.  Good; let us then
 Begin the task.
 
 BLANKA.  O God! what will they do?
 
 GANDALF.  [In an undertone.]  I cannot, Asgaut!
 
 ASGAUT.  [Likewise.]  Is our king afraid?
 Has woman's flattering tongue beguiled his mind?
 
 GANDALF.  No matter,--I have said--
 
 ASGAUT.  Bethink yourself,--
 Your standing with your warriors is at stake.
 Your word you pledged Valhalla's mighty gods,
 And if you fail a dastard you'll be judged.
 Do not forget our faith is insecure--
 And wavering; one blow can strike its root,
 And if the blow comes from the king above,
 It will have had a mortal wound.
 
 GANDALF.  Ah me!
 That was a most unhappy oath I swore.
 
 ASGAUT.  [To the VIKINGS.]  Now ready, warriors!
 
 BLANKA.  Will you murder him,
 An old, defenseless man?
 
 ASGAUT.  Down with them both!
 
 BLANKA.  O God!
 
 HROLLOUG.  The woman is too fair!  Let her
 Return with us.
 
 JOSTEJN.  [Laughing.]  Yes, as a warrior maid.
 
 GANDALF.  Stand back!
 
 RODERIK.  O spare,--O spare at least my child!
 The slayer of your chieftain I will bring you,
 If you will only spare her!
 
 GANDALF.  [Quickly.]  Bring him here,
 And she is free.  What say you?
 
 THE VIKINGS.  She is free!
 
 BLANKA.  [To RODERIK.]  You promise that?
 
 ASGAUT.  Then fetch him!
 
 RODERIK.  Here he stands!
 
 SOME.  Ha, that old man!
 
 GANDALF.  O woe!
 
 BLANKA.  No, no, you shall not--
 
 RODERIK.  Struck by this hand the viking found his death,
 Now rests he peacefully in yonder mound!
 
 GANDALF.  My father's barrow!
 
 RODERIK.  He was strong and brave;
 Wherefore I laid him here in viking style.
 
 GANDALF.  Since he is buried, then,--
 
 ASGAUT.  Though he be buried,
 The fallen king cries for revenge,--strike, strike!
 
 BLANKA.  He is deceiving you!
 
 BLANKA.  [To GANDALF.]  Do you not see
 It is alone his daughter he would save?
 Yet, how should your kind understand a soul
 That sacrifices all--
 
 GANDALF.  I do not understand?
 You do not think I can?
 
 GANDALF.  [To the VIKINGS.]  He shall not die!
 
 ASGAUT.  How so?
 
 BLANKA.  O father!  He is good like you.
 
 ASGAUT.  You mean to break your oath?
 
 GANDALF.  No, I shall keep it!
 
 JOSTEJN.  Then what have you in mind?
 
 HROLLOUG.  Explain!
 
 GANDALF.  I swore
 To take revenge or else to die myself.
 Well, he is free,--I to Valhalla go.
 
 BLANKA.  [To RODERIK.]  What does he mean?
 
 ASGAUT.  Your honor you would save?--
 
 GANDALF.  Go,--hold a ship in readiness for me,
 With hoisted sail, the pyre light in the prow;
 In ancient fashion I shall go aboard!
 Behold, the evening breeze blows from the strand,--
 On crimson wings I sail into Valhalla!
 
 [JOSTEJN goes out to the right.]
 
 ASGAUT.  Ah, 'tis the woman who has cast her spell on you!
 
 BLANKA.  No, you must live!
 
 GANDALF.  I live?  No, to the gods
 I must be true, I cannot break with them.
 
 BLANKA.  Your oath is bloody, Balder hates it.
 
 GANDALF.  Yes,
 But Balder lives no longer with us now!
 
 BLANKA.  For you he lives; your soul is gentleness.
 
 GANDALF.  Yes, to my ruin!  It became my task
 As king to keep intact our great ideal,--
 But I lack strength enough!  Come, Asgaut, you
 Shall take the kingly sceptre from my hand;
 You are a warrior of the truest steel;
 On me the Southern plague has been at work.
 But if I cannot for my people live,
 I now can die for them.
 
 ASGAUT.  Well said, King Gandalf!
 
 BLANKA.  Then need no more be said!  Die like a hero,
 Faithful and true unto the very end!
 But now that we must part forever,--know,
 That when you die yourself to keep your oath
 You are then likewise marking me for death!
 
 GANDALF.  What!  You for death?
 
 BLANKA.  My life was like a flower,
 Transplanted in an unfamiliar soil,
 Which therefore slumbered in its prison folds:
 Then came a sunbeam from the distant home,--
 O, that was you, my Gandalf!  Opened then
 The flower its calyx.  In another hour,
 Alas! the sunbeam paled,--the flower died!
 
 GANDALF.  O, have I understood you right?  You could?
 Then is my promise thrice unfortunate!
 
 BLANKA.  But we shall meet again!
 
 GANDALF.  O, nevermore!
 You go to heaven and the holy Christ,
 I to Valhalla; silent I shall take
 My place among the rest,--but near the door;
 Valhalla's merriment is not for me.
 
 JOSTEJN.  [Returns with a banner in his hand.]
 See, now the bark is ready, as you bade.
 
 ASGAUT.  O, what a glorious end!  Many a man
 Will envy you, indeed.
 
 GANDALF.  [To BLANKA.]  Farewell!
 
 BLANKA.  Farewell!
 Farewell for life and for eternity!
 
 RODERIK.  [Struggling with himself.]  Wait!  Wait!
 
 [Prostrates himself before BLANKA.]
 
 RODERIK.  Mercy, I cry!  Forgive, forgive me!
 
 BLANKA.  O God!
 
 GANDALF.  What means he?
 
 RODERIK.  All will I confess:
 My whole life here with you has been deceit!
 
 BLANKA.  Ah, terror has unhinged his mind!
 
 RODERIK.  No, no!
 
 RODERIK.  [To GANDALF, after he has risen.]
 You are released forever from your vow;
 Your father's shadow needs no blood revenge!
 
 GANDALF.  Ah, then explain!
 
 BLANKA.  Oh, speak!
 
 RODERIK.  Here stands King Rorek!
 
 SOME.  The fallen king?
 
 BLANKA.  O heavens!
 
 GANDALF.  [In doubt.]  You,--my father?
 
 RODERIK.  See, Asgaut!  Do you still recall the scratch
 You gave me on our earliest viking trip,
 The time we fought about the booty?
 
 [He uncovers his arm and shows it to ASGAUT.]
 
 ASGAUT.  Yes,
 By Thor, it is King Rorek!
 
 GANDALF.  [Throws himself in his arms.]  Father!  Father!
 A second time now have you given me life.
 My humble thanks!
 
 RODERIK.  [Downcast; to BLANKA.]  And you now--what will you
 Grant the old robber?
 
 BLANKA.  Love as hitherto!
 I am your daughter!  Has not three years' care
 Wiped off each spot of blood upon your shield?
 
 ASGAUT.  Yet now explain,--how comes it that you live!
 
 GANDALF.  She saved his life.
 
 RODERIK.  Yes, like a friendly elf
 She healed my wounds and cared for me,
 And all the while she told me of the faith
 These quiet people in the South believe,
 Until my rugged heart itself was moved.
 And day by day I kept the truth from her;
 I did not dare to tell her--
 
 GANDALF.  But the mound there?
 
 RODERIK.  I laid therein my armor and my sword,
 It seemed to me the grim old savage viking
 Was buried then and there.  Each day my child
 Sent up a prayer for him beside the mound.
 
 ASGAUT.  Farewell!
 
 GANDALF.  Where do you go?
 
 ASGAUT.  Northward again!
 I now see clearly that my time is past--
 So likewise is the viking life.  I go
 To Iceland; there the plague has not yet come.
 
 ASGAUT.  [To BLANKA.]  You, woman, take my place beside the king!
 For Thor is gone--and Mjoelnir out of gear;
 Through you now Balder rules.--Farewell!
 
 [He goes.]
 
 GANDALF.  Yes, Balder ruleth now, through you, my Blanka!
 I see the meaning of my viking life!
 'Twas not alone desire for fame and wealth
 That drove me hence from my forefathers' home;
 No, that which called me was a secret longing,
 A quiet yearning after Balder.  See,
 Now is the longing stilled, now go we home;
 There will I live in peace among my people.
 
 GANDALF.  [To the VIKINGS.]  And will you follow?
 
 ALL.  We will follow you!
 
 GANDALF.  And you, my Blanka?
 
 BLANKA.  I?  I too am born
 A Northern child; for on your mountain sides
 The choicest flowers of my heart took root.
 To you it was I journeyed in my dreams,
 From you it was that I received my love.
 
 RODERIK.  And now away!
 
 GANDALF.  But you?
 
 BLANKA.  He comes with us!
 
 RODERIK.  I shall remain.
 
 [He points to the mound.]
 
 RODERIK.  My barrow waits for me.
 
 BLANKA.  And should I leave you here alone?
 
 HEMMING.  No, no!
 Be not afraid!  For I shall close his eyes
 And sing to him a saga from the mound;
 My last song it will be.
 
 HEMMING.  [Moved as he seizes GANDALF's hand.]
 Farewell, my king!
 Now have you found a better scald than I.
 
 RODERIK.  [With firmness.]
 It must be so, my Gandalf; you are king,
 And you have sacred duties to discharge.
 
 [He puts their hands together.]
 
 RODERIK.  You are the children of the coming dawn,--
 Go yonder where the royal throne awaits you;
 I am the last one of the by-gone age,
 My throne--it is the barrow--grant me that!
 
 [GANDALF and BLANKA throw themselves silently into his arms.
 RODERIK ascends the burial mound.--HEMMING with his harp seats
 himself at his feet.]
 
 GANDALF.  [With resolution.]  And now to Norway!
 
 HROLLOUG.  Home!
 
 ALL.  To Norway!  Home!
 
 BLANKA.  [Fired as she seizes the banner from JOSTEJN's hand.]
 Yes, now away!  Our course shall northward run
 O'er ocean billow on through storm and sun.
 Soon fades the daylight o'er the glacier's peak,
 Soon is the viking life a memory bleak!
 Already sits the hero on his mound;
 The time is past when he could sail around
 With sword and battle cry from strand to strand.
 Thor's hammer will no longer rule the land,
 The North will be itself a giant grave.
 But bear in mind the pledge All-Fader gave:
 When moss and flowers shall the barrow hide,
 To Idavold the hero's ghost shall ride,--
 Then Norway too shall from the grave be brought
 To chastened deeds within the realm of thought!

 FIRST ACT
 
 [A thickly wooded hillside which leads up to higher
 mountain regions; in a deep ravine a swift river runs
 from the background out to the right; over the river
 lie some old logs and other remnants of a dilapidated
 bridge.  Huge rocks lie scattered in the foreground;
 far away can be seen the summits of snow-capped
 mountain peaks.  Evening twilight rests over the
 landscape; later on the moon appears.]
 
 
 
 SCENE I
 
 [THORGJERD stands on a rocky projection near the river
 and listens to the various choruses which are heard
 off the stage.]
 
 CHORUS OF LADY KIRSTEN'S RETINUE.  [Deep in the wood to the
 right.]
 With ringing of bells we hurry along,
 We wander in field and in dell;
 O Christian, come, give heed to our song,
 Awake from your magic spell.
 
 RELATIVES OF ARNE OF GULDVIK.  [Far away to the right.]
 Now hasten we all
 To the wedding hall;
 The foal runneth light and gay!
 The hoofs resound
 On the grassy ground
 As the merry swains gallop away!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN'S RETINUE.  [A little nearer than before.]
 We conjure you forth from mountain and hill,
 From the places which hold you bound.
 Awake to our call, come, free your will
 From elves that hover around!
 
 [THORGJERD disappears in the ravine where the river runs; after
 a rapid interplay the choruses are heard much nearer.]
 
 ARNE'S RELATIVES.  Our way we shorten with jest and with song,
 And all of the bridal night.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN'S RETINUE.  With tears we wander the whole day long,
 We search to the left and the right.
 
 ARNE'S RELATIVES.  [In close proximity, yet still outside the
 scene.]  To wedding and banquet, to song and dance,
 Both servants and hand-maidens throng.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN'S RETINUE.  [Nearer than before.]
 Olaf Liljekrans!  Olaf Liljekrans!
 Why sleep you so deep and so long?
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE II
 
 [ARNE of Guldvik appears with his relatives, men and
 women, minstrels, etc., in the background to the right
 on the other side of the river; they are all in
 festive attire.  Shortly afterwards HEMMING from the
 same side.]
 
 ONE OF THE RETINUE.  See, here goes the way.
 
 ANOTHER.  No, here!
 
 A THIRD.  Not at all, it must be here.
 
 ARNE OF GULDVIK.  Well, well, are we now astray again!
 
 ARNE OF GULDVIK.  [Calls.]  Hemming!  Where is Hemming?
 
 HEMMING.  [Enters.]  Here!
 
 ARNE.  Have I not told you to keep yourself close so as to be of
 some service to me?
 
 HEMMING.  It was Mistress Ingeborg--she wanted,--and so--
 
 ARNE.  [Annoyed.]  Mistress Ingeborg!  Mistress Ingeborg!  Are
 you Mistress Ingeborg's maid?  You are my page; it is me you
 shall serve.  Do you not get your keep and wage therefor?  Come,
 tell us where the way goes,--we are stuck.
 
 HEMMING.  [Uncertain.]  The way?  Well now, I am little
 acquainted up here, but--
 
 ARNE.  I might have known it,--that is always the service you
 give me!  Well, we shall have to spend the night in the
 wilderness, as sure as I am Arne of Guldvik.
 
 HEMMING.  [Who has in the meantime spied the remnants of the
 bridge.]  Aha, no need of that; here we can get across.
 
 ARNE.  Why didn't you tell us so in the first place?
 
 [All cross the river and come forward on the stage.]
 
 ARNE.  [Looks about.]  Yes, now I have my bearings again.  The
 river there is the boundary between Lady Kirsten's dominions and
 mine.
 
 ARNE.  [Points to the left.]  Down there lies her estate; in
 another hour or two we can sit cozily in the bridal house, but
 then we must hurry along.
 
 ARNE.  [Calls.]  Ingeborg!--Hemming!  Now where's Ingeborg?
 
 HEMMING.  In the rear, up on the hillside.
 
 HEMMING.  [Points to the right.]  She is playing with her
 bridesmaids; they gather green twigs from the cherry trees and
 run about with joy and laughter.
 
 ARNE.  [Bitterly but in subdued voice.]  Hemming! this wedding
 makes me sick; there are so many vexations about it.
 
 ARNE.  [Gazes out to the right.]  There they run,--just look at
 them!  It was she who hit upon the idea of going over the
 mountain instead of following the highway; we should reach our
 goal the sooner, she thought;--and yet notwithstanding--hm!  I
 could go mad over it; tomorrow is she to go to the altar.  Are
 these the decorous customs she ought to observe!  What will Lady
 Kirsten say when she finds my daughter so ill disciplined?
 
 ARNE.  [As HEMMING starts to speak.]  Yes, for that she is; she
 is ill disciplined, I say.
 
 HEMMING.  Master!  You should never have married your daughter
 into Lady Kirsten's family; Lady Kirsten and her kinsmen are
 high-born people--
 
 ARNE.  You art stupid, Hemming!  High-born, high-born!  Much good
 that will do,--it neither feeds nor enriches a man.  If Lady
 Kirsten is high-born, then I am rich; I have gold in my chests
 and silver in my coffers.
 
 HEMMING.  Yes, but your neighbors make merry over the agreement
 you have concluded with her.
 
 ARNE.  Ah, let them, let them; it is all because they wish me
 ill.
 
 HEMMING.  They say that you have surrendered your legal right in
 order to have Ingeborg married to Olaf Liljekrans; I shouldn't
 mention it, I suppose,--but a lampoon about you is going the
 rounds, master!
 
 ARNE.  You lie in your throat; there is no one dares make a
 lampoon about Arne of Guldvik.  I have power; I can oust him from
 house and home whenever I please.  Lampoon!  And what do you know
 about lampoons!--If they have composed any songs, it is to the
 honor of the bride and her father!
 
 ARNE.  [Flaring up.]  But it is a wretched bit of verse
 nevertheless, really a wretched bit of verse, I tell you.  It is
 no man skilled in the art of poetry who has put it together, and
 if I once get hold of him, then--
 
 HEMMING.  Aha, master! then you know it too?  Is there some one
 who has dared sing it to you?
 
 ARNE.  Sing, sing!  Now don't stand there and delay me with your
 twaddle.
 
 ARNE.  [To the others.]  Away, my kinsmen; little must we delay
 if we are to reach the bridal house before midnight.  You should
 have heard what Hemming is telling.  He says there is a rumor
 around that Lady Kirsten has baked and brewed for five whole days
 in honor of our coming.  Is it not so, Hemming?
 
 HEMMING.  Aye, master!
 
 ARNE.  He says she owns not the beaker of silver so costly but
 she places it on the table shining and polished; so splendid a
 feast she has not prepared since the king came to visit her
 blessed lord twenty years ago.  Is it not true, Hemming?
 
 HEMMING.  Aye, master!
 
 HEMMING.  [Whispering.]  But, master, it is ill-thought to say
 such things; Lady Kirsten is proud of her birth; she thinks this
 marriage is somewhat of an honor to you; little you know how she
 intends to show herself to her guests.
 
 ARNE.  [Softly.]  Ah, what nonsense!
 
 ARNE.  [To the others.]  He says Lady Kirsten gives herself no
 rest; both day and night she is busy in pantry and cellar.  Is it
 not--?
 
 ARNE.  [Startled as he looks out to the right.]  Hemming! what is
 that?  See here, who is that coming?
 
 HEMMING.  [With a cry.]  Lady Kirsten Liljekrans!
 
 ALL.  [Astonished.]  Lady Kirsten!
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE III
 
 [The Preceding.  LADY KIRSTEN comes with her HOUSE
 CARLS from the left.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [To her followers, without noticing the others.]
 Now just a little farther and I am sure we shall find him.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Taken aback, aside.]  Arne of Guldvik!  Heaven
 help me!
 
 ARNE.  [As he goes to meet her.]  The peace of God, Lady Kirsten
 Liljekrans!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Composes herself and gives him her hand.]  The
 peace of God to you!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aside.]  Does he then know nothing?
 
 ARNE.  [Contentedly.]  And well met at the boundary!  Indeed,
 this pleases me; yet almost too great is the honor you show me.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  What mean you?
 
 ARNE.  I mean too great is the honor you show me, when you travel
 miles over fields and wildernesses in order to bid me welcome on
 your land.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Ah, Lord Arne--
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aside.]  He knows nothing as yet!
 
 ARNE.  And that on a day like this, when you have enough things
 to attend to; 'tis at your house we celebrate the wedding of our
 children, since my estate lies too far from the church, and yet
 you come here to meet me with all your servants.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Embarrassed.]  I beg you, say no more about that.
 
 ARNE.  Aye, I will speak of it loudly; the village people have
 said that you pride yourself on your noble birth, that you look
 down upon me and mine, and that you entered into the agreement
 only in order to put an end to the long-standing disputes which
 grew troublesome now that you have become a widow and begin to
 grow old; and if that had not been the case, you would never--
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  How can you listen to what evil tongues invent?
 No more will we think of our differences which have lasted since
 the days of your ancestors.  I think our families have suffered
 enough these years, yours as well as mine.  Look around you, Lord
 Arne!  Is not the hillside here like the wildest of upland
 pastures?  And yet in our fathers' days it was a region much
 frequented and rich.  A bridge there was across the river, and a
 highway from Guldvik to my father's house.  But with fire and
 sword they sallied forth from both sides; they laid everything
 waste that they came upon, for it seemed to them that they were
 too near neighbors.  Now all sorts of weeds grow in the highway,
 the bridge is broken, and it is only the bear and the wolf that
 make their homes here.
 
 ARNE.  Yes, they ran the road around the mountain below; it is a
 good deal longer and they could thus better keep an eye on one
 another; but there is little need of that now,--which is well and
 good for both of us.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  To be sure, to be sure!  But Ingeborg, the bride,
 where is she?  I do not see her, and the bridesmaids likewise are
 lacking; surely she is not--
 
 ARNE.  She follows in the rear; she must shortly be here.
 But--listen, Lady Kirsten!  One thing I will tell you, as well
 first as last, although, I should think, you know it.  Ingeborg
 has at times whims and moods,--I swear to you she has them,
 however well disciplined she may be.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Expectant.]  Well, what then?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aside.]  Is she too--
 
 ARNE.  Such things you must tame; I, as her father, will never
 succeed, but you will no doubt find ways and means.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Aye, rest you assured.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aside.]  And Olaf, who is nowhere to be seen!
 
 HEMMING.  [Who has looked out to the right.]  There comes
 Mistress Ingeborg.
 
 HEMMING.  [Aside.]  How fair she is advancing foremost in the
 group!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Slowly to her servants.]  You will keep silent
 about your errand up here.
 
 A SERVANT.  You may be sure of that.
 
 HEMMING.  [Aside, sighing, as he continues to look out
 to the right.]  Ah, happy is Olaf, who will have her!
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE IV
 
 [The Preceding.  INGEBORG and the Bridesmaids come over
 the bridge.]
 
 INGEBORG.  [Still in the background.]  Why do you run away from
 me?  What good will that do?  There can be no wedding anyway
 before I come.
 
 INGEBORG.  [Notices LADY KIRSTEN and her retinue.]  Lady Kirsten!
 you here?  Well, I am glad of that.
 
 [Casually to the retinue.]
 
 [To LADY KIRSTEN as she looks about.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Olaf!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aside.]  Woe is me! now it will out.
 
 ARNE.  Yes, Olaf, indeed!  Ha, ha, ha!  I must have been blind;
 'tis well the bride sees better than I; for I have not noticed
 that the bridegroom is lacking; but now I understand very well
 how it comes that we meet here,--it is he who is causing--
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  He--you mean--you know, that--
 
 ARNE.  I mean it has grown tedious for him down there in the
 festive hall.  Aye, aye, I remember now my own wedding day; at
 that time I also was young.  He has had a great desire to meet
 the bride, and accordingly he prevailed upon you to go with him.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  He greatly desired, to be sure, to meet the bride,
 but--
 
 INGEBORG.  But what?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Olaf is not here with us.
 
 HEMMING.  [Approaches.]  Not with you!
 
 ARNE.  And why not?
 
 INGEBORG.  Speak, I beg you!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Embarrassed and jestingly.]  Truly, it appears
 the bride also is anxious!  Come along, come along with me down
 to the bridal hall; there, I imagine he will be found.
 
 HEMMING.  [Whispering to ARNE.]  Master! remember I gave you
 warning.
 
 ARNE.  [Suspiciously to LADY KIRSTEN.]  First answer me; then
 shall we follow.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Well then,--he is ridden out to the hunt.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [As she is about to go.]  Come, 'tis fast growing
 dark.
 
 INGEBORG.  To the hunt?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Aye!  Does that surprise you?  You know the song
 of course:
   "The knight likes to ride in the forest around,
   To test his horse and his hound!"
 
 INGEBORG.  Does he think so little of his young bride that he
 uses the wedding days to go hunting wild animals?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Now you are jesting.  Come along, come along!
 
 ARNE.  [Who has in the meantime kept his eye on LADY KIRSTEN and
 her retinue.]  No, wait, Lady Kirsten!  I hardly dare measure
 myself in wisdom with you, but one thing clearly I see, and that
 is that you are concealing your real errand up here.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Confused.]  I?  How can you think that?
 
 ARNE.  From one thing and another I can see you are concealing
 something.  You are strangely downcast, and yet you pretend to be
 playful in spirit; but it won't do--
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  'Tis nothing new for you to think ill of me and
 mine.
 
 ARNE.  Perhaps; but never did I do so without just cause.
 
 ARNE.  [Bursting out.]  As sure as I live, there is something you
 are hiding from me.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aside.]  What will be the end of this?
 
 ARNE.  I let myself be fooled by you, but now I see clearly
 enough.  You said you came to greet me at the boundary.  How did
 you know we took the way over the mountain?  It was Ingeborg who
 suggested this way just as we left Guldvik, and no one could have
 informed you about it.
 
 ARNE.  [When LADY KIRSTEN does not answer.]  You are silent, as I
 might have known.
 
 HEMMING.  [In an undertone.]  You see, master!  Will you now
 believe what I said?
 
 ARNE.  [Likewise.]  Hush!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Who has in the meantime composed herself.]  Well
 and good, Lord Arne!  I will be honest with you; let chance take
 care of the rest.
 
 ARNE.  Then tell us--
 
 INGEBORG.  What mean you?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  The agreement between us is sealed with word and
 with hand,--many honorable men whom I see here can bear witness
 to that: Olaf, my son, was to wed your daughter; tomorrow at my
 house the wedding was to be held--
 
 ARNE.  [Impatiently.]  Yes, yes!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Dishonor to him who breaks his word, but--
 
 ARNE AND THE GUESTS..  What then!  Speak out!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  There can be no wedding tomorrow as we had agreed.
 
 ARNE.  No wedding?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  It must be postponed.
 
 HEMMING.  Ah, shame and disgrace!
 
 INGEBORG.  No wedding!
 
 ARNE.  Cursed be you that you play me false!
 
 THE GUESTS.  [Threatening, as several of them draw their knives
 and rush in on Lady Kirsten's people.]  Revenge!  Revenge on the
 house of Liljekrans!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN'S MEN.  [Raise their axes and prepare to defend
 themselves.]  Strike too!  Down with the men of Guldvik!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Throws herself between the contending parties.]
 Stop, stop; I pray you, stop!  Lord Arne! hear me to the end ere
 you judge my conduct.
 
 ARNE.  [Who has tried to quiet his kinsmen, approaches LADY
 KIRSTEN and speaks in a low tone as he tries to overcome his
 inner agitation, which is nevertheless apparent.]  Forgive me,
 Lady Kirsten!  I was too quick in my wrath.  Had I stopped to
 think I might surely have known the whole was a jest on your
 part; I beg you, do not contradict me, it must be so!  No wedding
 tomorrow,--how could such a thing happen!  If it is ale and mead
 you lack, or if you need silver or embroidered linens, then come
 you to me.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  It is no poor man's house that your daughter is
 marrying into, Lord Arne!  Do you but come to the wedding with
 all your kinsmen and friends, aye, come with three times as many
 if you wish,--in my home you shall find plenty of room and
 banquet fare, as much as you may desire.  Think not for a moment
 that such an inglorious reason could stand in my way.
 
 ARNE.  You have changed your mind, perchance?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Nor that either!  If I have given my word, then am
 I likewise ready to keep it, today just as well as tomorrow; for
 such was ever the custom and rule in my family.  But in this
 instance it is not in my power; one there is lacking--
 
 INGEBORG.  One!  Whom?  Surely I should think that when the bride
 is ready,--
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  For a wedding two people are needed, the groom as
 well as the bride--
 
 ARNE AND THE GUESTS.  Olaf!
 
 INGEBORG.  My betrothed!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Yes, he, my son--this night he is fled from his
 home and his bride.
 
 GUESTS.  Fled!
 
 ARNE.  Fled!  He!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  As I hope for the grace of heaven, I have no hand
 therein.
 
 ARNE.  [With suppressed exasperation.]  And the wedding was to be
 tomorrow!  My daughter has put on her golden attire; invitations
 I have sent around in the district; my kinsmen and friends come
 from far away to attend the festive day.
 
 ARNE.  [Flaring up.]  Ah, take you good care, if Arne of Guldvik
 is held up to scorn before his neighbors; it shall profit you
 little,--that I solemnly swear!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  You reason unjustly, if you think--
 
 ARNE.  'Tis not, Lady Kirsten, for you to say so!  We two have an
 old account to settle; it is not the first time that you set your
 cunning traps for me and mine.  The race of Guldvik has long had
 to suffer, when you and your kinsmen plotted deception and guile.
 Power we had,--we had wealth and property too; but you were too
 crafty for us.  You knew how to lure us with wily words and ready
 speech,--those are wares I am little able to reckon as I should.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Lord Arne!  Hear me, I pray!
 
 ARNE.  [Continuing.]  Now I see clearly that I have behaved like
 the man who built his house on the ice-floe: a thaw came on and
 down he went to the bottom.  But you shall have little joy of
 this.  I shall hold you to account, Lady Kirsten!  You must
 answer for your son; you it was who made love for him, and your
 affair it will be to keep the word you have given me!  A fool I
 was, aye, tenfold a fool, that I put my faith in your glib
 tongue.  Those who wished me well gave me warning; my enemies
 made me an object of scorn; but little heed gave I to either.  I
 put on my gala attire; kinsmen and friends I gathered together;
 with song and laughter we set out for the festive hall, and
 then,--the bridegroom has fled.
 
 INGEBORG.  Never will I marry one who holds me so lightly.
 
 ARNE.  Be still!
 
 HEMMING.  [Softly to ARNE.]  Mistress Ingeborg is right; best it
 is you break the agreement.
 
 ARNE.  Be still, I say!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [To ARNE.]  You may well be rilled with wrath and
 resentment; but if you think I meant to deceive you, you do me
 the greatest injustice.  You think we are playing a game of
 deception with you.  But tell me,--what would tempt me and my son
 to such a thing?  Does he not love Ingeborg?  Where could he
 choose him a better bride?  Is she not fair and lithe?  Is her
 father not rich and mighty?  Is not her family mentioned with
 honor as far as it is known?
 
 ARNE.  But how then could Olaf--
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  The lot I have suffered is worse than you think.
 You will pity me instead of growing angry when you have
 heard.--Since the sun rose this morning I have wandered up here
 to find him again.
 
 ARNE.  Up here?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Yes, up here; I must tell you--you'll be
 frightened--but nevertheless,--Olaf is bewitched in the mountain!
 
 GUESTS.  Bewitched in the mountain!
 
 INGEBORG.  [At the same time.]  Deliver me, God!
 
 ARNE.  What say you, Lady Kirsten?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  He is bewitched in the mountain!  Nothing else can
 it be.--Three weeks ago, after the betrothal feast at Guldvik, he
 did not come home till far into the next day.  Pale he was and
 moody and quiet as I had never seen him before.  And thus the
 days went by; he spoke but little; he lay in his bed most of the
 time and turned his face to the wall; but when evening came on,
 it seemed a strange uneasiness seized him; he saddled his horse
 and rode away, far up the mountain side; but no one dared follow
 him, and no one knew where he went beyond that.  Believe me, 'tis
 evil spirits that have charmed his mind; great is the power they
 wield in here; from the time the terrible plague overran the
 country it has never been quite safe in the mountain here; there
 is scarcely a day goes by but the chalet girls hear strange
 playing and music, although there is no living soul in the place
 whence it comes.
 
 ARNE.  Bewitched in the mountain!  Could such a thing be
 possible?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Would to God it were not; but I can no longer
 doubt it.  Three days is it now since he last was at home.
 
 ARNE.  And you have seen none who knows where he is?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Alas, no, it is not so easy.  Up here a hunter
 yesterday saw him; but he was wild and shy as the deer; he had
 picked all sorts of flowers, and these he scattered before him
 wherever he went, and all the while he whispered strange words.
 As soon as I heard of this, I set out with my people, but we have
 found nothing.
 
 INGEBORG.  You met none who could tell you--
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  You know of course the mountain-side is desolate.
 
 ARNE.  [As he spies THORGJERD, who rises from the river.]  Here
 comes one will I ask.
 
 HEMMING.  [Apprehensively.]  Master!  Master!
 
 ARNE.  What now?
 
 HEMMING.  Let him go!  Do you not see who it is?
 
 THE GUESTS AND LADY KIRSTEN'S PEOPLE.  [Whispering among
 themselves.]  Thorgjerd the fiddler!  The crazy Thorgjerd!
 
 INGEBORG.  He has learned the nixie's songs.
 
 HEMMING.  Let him go, let him go!
 
 ARNE.  No,--not even were he the nixie himself--
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 SCENE V
 
 [The Preceding.]
 
 [THORGJERD has in the meantime gone to the edge of the
 stage to the left; at ARNE's last words he turns about
 suddenly as if he had been addressed.]
 
 THORGJERD.  [As he draws a step or two nearer.]  What do you want
 of me?
 
 ARNE.  [Startled.]  What's that?
 
 HEMMING.  Now see!
 
 ARNE.  Let me manage this.
 
 ARNE.  [To THORGJERD.]  We seek Olaf Liljekrans.  Have you met
 him about here today?
 
 THORGJERD.  Olaf Liljekrans?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Why, yes,--you know him well.
 
 THORGJERD.  Is he not one of the evil men from the villages?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Evil?
 
 THORGJERD.  They are all evil there!  Olaf Liljekrans curses the
 little bird when it sings on his mother's roof.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  You lie, you fiddler!
 
 THORGJERD.  [With an artful smile.]  So much the better for him.
 
 ARNE.  How so?
 
 THORGJERD.  You ask about Olaf Liljekrans?  Has he gone astray in
 here?  You seek him and cannot find him?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Yes, yes!
 
 THORGJERD.  So much the better for him;--if it were a lie that I
 told, he will suffer no want.
 
 INGEBORG.  Speak out what you know!
 
 THORGJERD.  Then I should never be done!
 
 THORGJERD.  [Mischievously.]  Elves and sprites hold sway here.
 Be you of good cheer!  If you find him not he is at play with the
 elves; they are fond of all who love little birds, and Olaf, you
 said....  Go home,--go home again.  Olaf is up in the mountain;
 he suffers no want.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Curse you for saying such things!
 
 ARNE.  [To LADY KIRSTEN.]  Do not heed what he says.
 
 THORGJERD.  [Approaches again.]  I go hence now to tune my harp;
 Olaf Liljekrans is up in the mountain,--there shall his wedding
 be held.--Mad Thorgjerd must also be there; he can make tables
 and benches dance, so stirring is the music he plays.  But you,
 take you heed; go you home again; it is not safe for you here.
 Have you not heard the old saying:
   Beware of the elves when they frolic around,
   They may draw you into their play;
   And all that you see and all that you hear
   Will stay with your mind alway.
 
 THORGJERD.  [Suddenly breaking out with wild joy.]  But here
 there are wedding guests,--ah!  Each lady has on her very best
 gown, each man his very best coat,--now I see.  Olaf Liljekrans
 is likewise a groom in the village,--there also he has a
 betrothed!  Well, you have heard of such things before!  I know
 that at any rate once, --it is years ago--but well I remember....
 
 THORGJERD.  [He continues after a moment's pause, more and more
 wildly.]
   Sir Alvar and Ingrid had plighted their troth,
   She was a sprightly maiden;
   Three blessed long days they feasted and sang,
   With jolly good wine they were laden.
   The bride was fair and the bride was gay,
   The dance of the guests she led,
   When in came the nixie, the evil wight,
   And sat on the edge of the bed.
   Like a fiddler he sat on the edge of the bed,
   And music bewitchingly played.
   Around danced the benches and tables and all,
   As lightly as servant and maid!--
   The nixie he went through the open door,--
   The truth it boots not to hide!--
   And while he played on the harpstrings sweet,
   There followed him ever--the bride!
 
 THORGJERD.  [Wildly, triumphantly.]
   Fast in a spell lay knight and page,
   The groom knew not whither to go,
   The nixie made ready the bridal bed,
   Little Ingrid's bed in the river below.
 
 THORGJERD.  [Suddenly becomes quiet and says softly.]  That song
 I shall never forget!--But go you home, night is coming on, and
 when the sun is down the forest belongs to the others.  Farewell!
 I shall take greetings to Olaf where he sits--in the mountain!
 
 [Goes out to the left.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE VI
 
 [The Preceding except THORGJERD.]
 
 ARNE.  [To LADY KIRSTEN.]  He lies!  Do not believe him!
 
 HEMMING.  But it is nevertheless true,--the tale of the bride who
 disappeared on the eve of her wedding.
 
 ARNE.  Aye, that was many years ago; nowadays such things never
 happen.  But we'll all help to find him.
 
 INGEBORG.  It was not sung at my cradle that I should run about
 in forest and field to find my bridegroom.
 
 ARNE.  Be still!
 
 INGEBORG.  If he is enthralled in the mountain, then let her take
 him who has done it; I don't propose to share my betrothed's
 heart and soul.
 
 HEMMING.  [Softly and feelingly.]  The Lord bless you for those
 words!
 
 INGEBORG.  [With a haughty look of dismissal.]  What?
 
 ARNE.  Will you be silent, I say!
 
 ARNE.  [To the Guests.]  Now quick, my good men!  Spread out and
 search for him on every ridge and in every hillock!  Away!  Quite
 so!  Tomorrow we drink to the wedding!
 
 [The Guests and LADY KIRSTEN's People go out in different groups
 to the right and the left.]
 
 ARNE.  [Softly, to LADY KIRSTEN.]  We must find him!  It would
 cause me eternal shame if the wedding--
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Come, then, come!
 
 INGEBORG.  [Softly, to HEMMING, who stands downcast.]  Why do you
 not go with the rest?  Better it were that you brought me again
 my betrothed than stand here thus and bless me for words I really
 don't mean.
 
 ARNE.  [At the exit.]  Come, come!
 
 INGEBORG.  [To HEMMING, who starts to go.]  Wait, Hemming!
 Fasten my shoe buckle!
 
 [LADY KIRSTEN and ARNE go out to the left.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE VII
 
 [INGEBORG.  HEMMING.]
 
 INGEBORG.  [Puts her foot forward.]  See there,--fasten it tight!
 
 [HEMMING kneels and does her bidding.]
 
 INGEBORG.  [As she puts the other foot forward.]  There,--buckle
 this one too!  Well, why do you bow your head?  Has something
 gone wrong?
 
 HEMMING.  Do you demand that I shall speak honestly?
 
 INGEBORG.  Certainly I do.
 
 HEMMING.  Well, then you must know--
 
 INGEBORG.  [Quickly.]  O no, it isn't necessary.
 
 [She moves away a few steps; HEMMING rises.]
 
 HEMMING.  Alas, Lady Ingeborg!  Once you were so kind to me; but
 now since you have become a real grown-up lady--and especially, I
 imagine, since you gave your betrothal vow--
 
 INGEBORG.  What then?
 
 HEMMING.  O nothing!--
 
 [A pause.]
 
 HEMMING.  Can you remember,--we have been up here once before?
 
 INGEBORG.  [Curtly.]  I don't remember!
 
 HEMMING.  You had run after your spotted goat, and I followed
 you, as was always my custom,--yes, that was a long time ago, but
 I remember it as if it happened today; right down there lies the
 swamp, which--
 
 INGEBORG.  [Comes nearer.]  Was it the time we heard the bear?
 
 HEMMING.  Yes, the very time.
 
 INGEBORG.  [Constantly becoming more animated.]  I found the goat
 again.
 
 HEMMING.  No, it was I who first discovered it.
 
 INGEBORG.  Yes, yes, you are right; up there on the slope--
 
 HEMMING.  And then you took your garter.
 
 INGEBORG.  And bound it.
 
 HEMMING.  Yes, for we had come to pick strawberries.
 
 INGEBORG.  Over there on the hill, yes!  And you had made me a
 birch-bark scrip.
 
 HEMMING.  But then it was we heard--
 
 INGEBORG.  The bear, ha, ha, ha!  We had to cross the swamp just
 where it was the wettest,--
 
 HEMMING.  And then I took you in my arms.
 
 INGEBORG.  And jumped with me from tuft to tuft.
 
 INGEBORG.  [Laughing.]  How frightened we were, the two of us!
 
 HEMMING.  Of course I was most frightened for your sake.
 
 INGEBORG.  And I for yours--
 
 [Stops suddenly and as she continues to look at him her face
 assumes an imperious and wounded expression.]
 
 INGEBORG.  What is it you stand here and say?  Why don't you go?
 Is it fitting to speak thus to your master's daughter?  Go, go;
 you were to find my betrothed!
 
 HEMMING.  Alas, I forgot your betrothed; I forgot that you are my
 master's daughter.
 
 INGEBORG.  If you find him, I promise you an embroidered jacket
 for Christmas,--so pleased shall I be.
 
 HEMMING.  I don't want any jacket; I serve you neither for gold
 nor silver, neither for keep nor for knightly dress.  But now I
 am off; what lies in my power I shall do, if I know it pleases
 you.
 
 INGEBORG.  [Who has climbed up on a stone and is picking some
 blossoming cherry twigs.]  Hemming! how rich is my betrothed?
 
 HEMMING.  How rich he is I really can't say; but it is said of
 his grandsire in the song:
   With golden attire he can provide
   A hundred maids or more for his bride!
 So mighty perhaps is not Olaf Liljekrans, but still he owns
 both forest and field.
 
 INGEBORG.  [Still occupied.]  And you, what do you possess?
 
 HEMMING.  [Sighing.]  My poverty--is all I have.
 
 INGEBORG.  That isn't very much, Hemming!
 
 HEMMING.  No, it isn't very much, Mistress Ingeborg!
 
 INGEBORG.  [Hums, turned away from him, without changing her
 position, and still occupied as before.]
   'Tis little my heart is attracted indeed
   To him who has all the wealth he may need!
   Much more I fancy the humble swain,
   The friend of my heart he will ever remain!
 
 HEMMING.  [In the greatest joy.]  Ingeborg!  O, if what you say
 is true, I must tenfold bless my poverty.
 
 INGEBORG.  [Turns her head and speaks coldly.]  I don't
 understand you; the song was only an ancient ballad.
 
 [Comes down from the rock with the cherry twigs in her hand, and
 approaches him as she looks at him fixedly.]
 
 INGEBORG.  But I know another song too, and that I will sing for
 you:
   The king's court within stand the steeds so fair;
   The suitor who lacks not the courage to dare,--
   He shoes the yellow, he shoes the gray,
   The swiftest he saddles before it is day!
   He places his bride on the steed behind,
   She follows him safe, she follows him blind.
   He rides with her off, to the sea they hie,
   With him she would willingly live and die!
 
 HEMMING.  [As though beside himself.]  Ingeborg! Ingeborg! then
 nothing shall henceforth terrify me!  Not that you have a
 betrothed, not that you are my master's daughter;--yea, as sure
 as I live, I shall steal you tonight!
 
 INGEBORG.  [Vehemently, as she constantly struggles to suppress a
 smile.]  Help me, God! what is amiss with you?  What is it you
 are thinking of?  Will you steal your master's daughter?  You
 must be sick or mad to conceive such a thing!  Yet, it shall be
 forgotten--for this once.  Go, now! and thank heaven you escape
 so lightly; for you have certainly earned a blow--
 
 INGEBORG.  [Raises the twigs, but lets them fall, and says in a
 changed tone.]  --and my red golden ring--see there, take it!
 
 [Throws him a ring, which she has removed from her arm, and
 rushes out quickly to the left.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE VIII
 
 [HEMMING.  Shortly afterwards OLAF Liljekrans from the,
 background.  The moon rises.]
 
 HEMMING.  The golden ring unto me she has granted,
 Then still is she true, I am not deceived!
 'Twas only in jest that she scolded and ranted
 As though she were bitterly grieved.
 All will I venture, no more will I dread!
 
 HEMMING.  [Despondent.]  And yet, I am only a penniless swain,
 And early tomorrow is she to be wed!
 
 HEMMING.  [Quickly.]  But into the forest the bridegroom is fled;
 O, if he should never come home again!
 
 HEMMING.  [Starts to rush out, but stops with a cry.]
 Olaf! there is he!
 
 [OLAF comes slowly forward between the rocks in the background.
 He walks dreaming, his head uncovered, and his hands full of
 flowers which he tears to pieces and scatters on the way; his
 whole behavior during the following indicates an unsettled
 mind.]
 
 OLAF.  [Without noticing HEMMING.]
 If only I knew What she meant, could somehow the riddle unravel!
 
 [Starts to go out to the left.]
 
 HEMMING.  Lord Olaf!  Lord Olaf!  O where do you travel?
 O hear me, Lord Olaf!
 
 OLAF.  [Half awakening.]
 Hemming!  Is it you?  Stand not in my way!
 
 HEMMING.  What is it that weighs
 On your mind, that you wander in here for three days?
 
 [Observes him more closely.]
 
 HEMMING.  And what is the game that here you do play,--
 Your cheek is white, and your forehead is gray!
 
 OLAF.  Be not so amazed that my cheek is white,
 Three nights have I fought so strange a fight;
 Be not so amazed that my forehead is gray,
 Three nights have I been in the elfen play.
 
 HEMMING.  Heaven protect us!
 
 OLAF.  I am ill, I am faint!
 I remember neither devil nor saint!
 
 HEMMING.  [Apprehensively.]
 Come, Olaf, with me to your mother's estate!
 
 OLAF.  My mother's estate!  Where stood it of late?
 'Tis here, as it seems, that I have my home!
 The wood has become my ancestral hall,
 The river's roaring, the pine-trees' moan,
 Is sweeter to me than my mother's call.
 
 OLAF.  [With increasing rapture.]
 Aye, here it is quiet!  Aye, here it is fair!
 Behold, my hall for the feast I prepare.
 
 HEMMING.  [Aside.]  O what has come o'er him?
 
 OLAF.  Soon comes my bride!
 
 HEMMING.  Your bride!  Then you know--?
 
 OLAF.  [Continuing.]  When the day has died,
 When slumber the birds, when fades the cloud,
 Then here will she come so young and so proud!
 
 HEMMING.  [Crosses himself.]
 All heavenly saints!  I fear the worst!
 
 OLAF.  Know you when it was that I saw her here first?
 I rode late one evening from Guldvik hall,
 Some kind of feast I seem to recall.
 My spirit was heavy, my heart full of woe!
 That something had grieved me is all that I know.
 I rode all alone up the mountain side,
 At midnight I passed by the river so wide;
 Then heard I beyond a melodious wail,
 That rang like a song over mountain and dale.
 It seemed a plaintive, bewitching lay;
 I folded my hands, I tried to pray,
 But tied was my tongue and my thoughts went astray;
 The strains did beguile and lure me away.
 'Twas now like weeping and now like laughter,
 'Twas now full of mirth, and now ever after
 As were it the cry of a perishing man,
 As were it a soul in the anguish of death,
 That I heard in the song so beguiling, that ran
 Like a stream around me!--I scarce got my breath!
 So sorely bewildered was I in my soul;
 It was as if powers both gentle and strong
 Enticed me and lured me away from my goal,
 I needs must come up, I was carried along.
 And ever rang out the mysterious call;
 How far I rode on I no longer recall.
 
 HEMMING.  [Aside.]  And the bride, of whom the minstrel
 sang,--she too had to follow--
 
 OLAF.  My foal stopped short, I awoke in a maze,
 I looked around with a wondering gaze;
 'Twas all so pleasant and fair!  But what land
 I was in I could not understand!
 I stood in a valley;--a deep peace lay
 Over all like dew in the night!
 The moon on the edge of the tarn did play;
 It seemed to laugh as it vanished away
 In the rolling billows so bright!
 My head was heavy, my spirit oppressed,
 I yearned for nothing but sleep;
 I laid me down 'neath a linden to rest
 In the whispering forest so sweet!
 
 HEMMING.  Lord Olaf!  Lord Olaf!  How dared you do it?
 
 OLAF.  [Continuing.]
 I ventured then into the elf-maidens' play;
 The fairest of maidens gave me a bouquet
 Of snow-drops blue and of lilies white;
 She pierced my soul with her glances so bright,
 And whispered to me what nobody knows,--
 A word I'll keep ever in mind:
 "Olaf Liljekrans! know you where happiness grows,
 Know you the hour when peace you will find?
 Of all the flowers on the hill over yonder
 Must you the fairest one find,
 And bit by bit you must tear it asunder
 And scatter it far to the wind,
 Then--only then will you happiness find!"
 
 HEMMING.  You have slumbered and dreamed!
 
 OLAF.  That very same day
 My mother's estate grew cramped and narrow!
 Through thicket, o'er highway, I hastened away
 To the grove so pleasant with bow and with arrow!
 There met I again the elf-maiden fair.
 
 HEMMING.  [Steps back amazed.]  When then,--have you wakened and
 found--?
 
 OLAF.  I took my betrothal ring, shot with it there
 Right over her head, far into the air;
 Now is she evermore bound!
 
 HEMMING.  And it is the bride you are waiting for here?
 
 OLAF.  Yes, yes, the bride; soon will she be near!
 
 HEMMING.  [Aside.]  His soul is enthralled, his mind is ill;
 All this Lady Kirsten shall know!
 
 HEMMING.  [Aloud.]  And dare you go wandering fearless up here
 In the hills?
 
 OLAF.  It is here so still,
 'Tis sweetly I dream as I go!
 
 [Goes slowly in between the huge rocks in front on the right.]
 
 HEMMING.  His wedding tomorrow his people prepare;
 Yet for his betrothed he seems little to care;
 'Tis little he knows that she is so near,
 And less that she holds another one dear!--
 He wanders around in the forest astray,
 And Ingeborg gave me the golden ring!
 His mother I'll seek without further delay;
 The saints only know what the morrow will bring!
 
 [Goes out to the left.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE IX
 
 [OLAF LILJEKRANS enters again from the right.]
 
 OLAF.  [As he tears to pieces some flowers he has gathered off
 the stage.]  "Of all the flowers on the hill over yonder
 Must you the fairest one find;
 And bit by bit you must tear it asunder,
 And scatter it far to the wind,--
 Then--only then will you happiness find!"
 These mysterious words give my spirit no rest.
 The fairest of flowers?  And what is the test?
 Where will it be found?  Is its beauty revealed
 In the fragrance or deep in the blossom concealed?
 Or hid in some magic power that I never
 Can possibly find if I search forever?
 So may there be virtue in many a spear
 Whose steel is rusty and out of gear;
 So too may a harp that no longer sings
 But hangs forgotten in the halls of mirth,
 Hide in its forsaken and dusty strings
 The strangest magic on earth.
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE X
 
 [OLAF LILJEKRANS.  ALFHILD from the back of the stage.
 She is fantastically dressed and adorned with flowers
 and garlands of leaves; she looks about anxiously
 until she discovers OLAF and runs joyfully to meet
 him.]
 
 ALFHILD.  O, stay, stay!  Do not go away from me!
 
 OLAF.  [As if suddenly awakened to life.]  Alfhild! my young and
 beautiful bride!
 
 ALFHILD.  Olaf! my handsome knight!  I grew tired of waiting; I
 had to come here to meet you!
 
 OLAF.  But tell me, why are you always afraid to come here?
 
 ALFHILD.  I have so often told you that I never went beyond this
 valley until you visited me.  My father has said that evil powers
 hold sway out there; only here among the mountains could I fare
 safely and without harm!  O, let whatever power will hold sway;
 you are here, and that is enough for me!  Come, let me look into
 your eyes!  Truly, I have you again!
 
 OLAF.  Have me!  Alas, Alfhild!  You artful, you beautiful woman,
 indeed you have me again!  My soul you have charmed so deeply, so
 deeply.  Lead me whither and as far as you will, into the
 mountain, under the hill, to the grassy meadow, where song and
 refrain echo sweetly in the evening, on the bottom of the river,
 down under the rapids, where there are harps for powerful
 plaintive lays; wherever your home is, there I am ready to
 wander!
 
 ALFHILD.  Why speak you thus?  You must surely know better than
 what you are saying.--Spirits and elves hold sway in mountain and
 hillock, and on the bottom of the river lives the nixie,--so
 father has said.  Think you that I am an elf or--
 
 OLAF.  You are the fairest in the world; be you what you please,
 so long as you are mine!
 
 ALFHILD.  Were I an elfen maid, then truly, say I, it would fare
 with you ill!
 
 OLAF.  Me!
 
 ALFHILD.  Yes, you!  When you rode on your lonely path, I should
 go out to meet you and give you the drink of forgetfulness from
 the golden horn.  I should mix therein my magic and charm so that
 you would forget both heaven and earth, forget where you were
 born and reared, what name you answered to, and where your
 kinsmen fared,--one thing alone should you remember, one thing
 alone should fill your mind and soul.
 
 OLAF.  Forsooth, then are you the elfen maid!  For from the first
 hour you have practiced your magic on me.
 
 ALFHILD.  Have I?
 
 OLAF.  Through the meadow I rode, below where the river runs,--it
 was night and the songs and the plaintive lays echoed strangely
 around me....
 
 OLAF.  Bewildered I grew and lost my path; I wandered far, far in
 among the mountains; I discovered the beautiful valley, where no
 foot has trod, where no eye has feasted ere mine....
 
 OLAF.  A heavy slumber fell upon me in there; the elf maidens
 played in the meantime, and they drew me into their play....
 
 OLAF.  But when I awoke, there was affliction in my soul;
 homeward I rode, but down there I could no more be content; it
 seemed as if I had left behind me the richest and best in life,
 as if a wonderful treasure were held in store for me, if only I
 sought and found it....
 
 OLAF.  Up to the valley I had to go before I could find peace....
 
 OLAF.  You came to meet me, fair and glowing as in this hour; I
 seized your hand, I looked you in the eye--heaven and earth, the
 beauty of all creation, was in your eye!....
 
 OLAF.  Then I forgot both kinsmen and friends!....
 
 OLAF.  I came there the next night, I embraced you, I pressed you
 to my bosom,--the glory of heaven was in your embrace....
 
 OLAF.  --Then I forgot my Christian name and my forefathers'
 home....
 
 OLAF.  And I came the third night; I had to come; I kissed your
 red lips; my eyes burned their way into your soul.--More than the
 glory of creation was therein!  I forgot more than God and home,
 more than heaven and earth.  I forgot myself.
 
 [Prostrates himself before her.]
 
 OLAF.  Alfhild!  Alfhild!
 
 ALFHILD.  If it be a drink of forgetfulness which you speak of,
 then have I also charmed myself with it.  I have fared as the
 minstrel who learned the nixie's songs in order to charm his
 sweetheart;--he charmed and charmed so long that at length the
 magic wove itself round his own soul too, and he could never win
 himself free therefrom.
 
 [Stops and continues standing thoughtfully.]
 
 OLAF.  [As he rises.]  What are you brooding over?
 
 ALFHILD.  High in the mountain there is a rocky ledge so steep
 that not even the eagle can fasten his claws thereon; there
 stands a lonely birch,--ill does it thrive, it is poor in leaves;
 but downward it bends its branches to the valley which lies far
 away; it is as though it longed for its sisters in the fresh and
 luxuriant grove, as though it yearned to be transplanted in the
 warm sunny life down below....
 
 ALFHILD.  Like the birch in the mountain was also my life; I
 longed to get away; I longed for you through the long, long
 years, even before I knew you existed.  The valley became too
 cramped for me, but I did not know that beyond the mountains
 there was another valley like this one in here.  The knights and
 the ladies that visited me every evening were not enough for me,
 and they told me nothing of the life beyond!
 
 OLAF.  Knights and ladies?  You told me you never met any one
 there.
 
 ALFHILD.  No one like you!  But every evening my father
 sang songs to me, and when the night came and my eyes
 were closed, they came to visit me, all those that live
 in my father's songs.  Merry knights and beautiful ladies
 there were among them; they came with falcons on their
 hands, riding on stately steeds.  They danced in the field,
 and laughter and merriment reechoed wherever they fared;
 the elves listened silently from behind each flower and the
 birds from the trees where they had fallen asleep.  But
 with the coming of dawn they again disappeared; lonely
 I wandered; I decked myself with flowers and with green
 leaves, for I knew the next night they would come again.
 Alas, that life was after all not sufficient for me; a mighty
 longing rilled my bosom; it would never have been stilled
 if you had not come!
 
 OLAF.  You speak of your father; at no time did I see him in
 there!
 
 ALFHILD.  But seldom he comes now; he has never been there since
 the night we first met.
 
 OLAF.  But tell me, where is he?
 
 ALFHILD.  You have told me you rode late one summer night in the
 meadow where the river flows; there you heard strange songs which
 you only half understood, but which haunt and haunt you so that
 you will never forget them.
 
 OLAF.  Yes, yes!
 
 ALFHILD.  You once heard my father's songs!  It is on them that I
 have been nourished.  In truth, neither have I fully understood
 them; they seemed to me to be the most precious treasure, to be
 life itself; now they mean little to me; they are to me but a
 token of all the glory that was to come.  In all of them was
 there a handsome knight; I imagined him to be the best and most
 glorious thing in all the valleys, the best and most glorious as
 far as bird can fly, as far as clouds can sail.  Olaf! it was
 you,--I know you again!  Oh, you must tell me of your home, of
 the distant valley whence you come; life out there must be rich
 and glorious; there it must be that my birds all fly with the
 falling of the leaves; for when they again come to visit me, they
 have so much to tell that is strange, so many a marvel to sing
 about, that all the flowers begin to bud and to blossom, the
 trees to grow green, and the big and glorious sun to rise early
 and go tardily to rest, in order to listen to all the stories and
 songs.  But little grasp I of all that they tell; you must
 interpret it for me, you must make everything clear that inwardly
 craves an answer.
 
 OLAF.  Little am I able to answer what you ask of my home.  My
 home?  If I have had a home other than this, then I remember but
 little about it.  It is all to me like a misty dream which is
 forgotten in the hour we waken.  Yet, come! far below us there
 lies a village; there it seems I remember I wandered before I saw
 you; there it seems to me that my kinsmen live.  Do you hear how
 the river conjures and rushes; let us follow it; out on the ledge
 near the waterfall we can overlook the village where I--once had
 my home.  Come, come!
 
 ALFHILD.  But dare I--
 
 OLAF.  Follow and trust me, I shall protect you!
 
 ALFHILD.  I am ready; I know it well enough; whether I wished to
 or not, I must follow you wherever you go.
 
 [They go out to the right.]
 
 CHORUS OF WEDDING GUESTS AND LADY.  KIRSTEN'S PEOPLE
                 (From the forest to the left.)
   Awake to our call, come free your will
   From elves that hover around!
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE XI
 
 [LADY KIRSTEN and HEMMING enter from the left.]
 
 HEMMING.  Here he was;--why--now he is gone!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  And he said he was waiting for the bride who was
 to come?
 
 HEMMING.  Yes, but whom he had in mind I could not quite make
 out; for his speech was strangely incoherent.  Ingeborg he did
 not mean,--that is certain.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Say nothing, good Hemming! say nothing of what he
 just said!  You did well to let me alone know he was here.  You
 shall be richly rewarded for this, but first we must find him
 again--
 
 HEMMING.  [As he looks out to the right.]  See,--see there, in
 the moonlight, on the hill near the river,--yes, surely I think--
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Hush, hush, it is Olaf!
 
 HEMMING.  There are two; a woman is with him--
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Heavenly saints!
 
 HEMMING.  He is pointing out the village as if--there they go!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Call Lord Arne and our people!  We will meet again
 here; I bring Olaf with me!
 
 HEMMING.  But dare you then--?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Do as I say; but say nothing of what you have
 heard and seen.  You can say that Olaf came up here to hunt deer
 and bear, and that he went astray in the mountain.
 
 HEMMING.  You can rely on me, Lady Kirsten!
 
 [Goes out to the left.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Is it true, then?  Have evil sprites gained
 control over him?  Yes, so I can pretend to Arne of Guldvik, but
 little I believe it myself;--and yet it is said it happened often
 enough in the days gone by.  But it is elfen maids no doubt of
 flesh and blood that--.  There he goes down to the river,--I must
 hasten!
 
 [Goes out to the right in the background.]
 
 CHORUS.  [From the forest to the left.]
   With ringing of bells we hurry along,
   We wander in field and in dell!
   O Christian, come, give heed to our song,
   Wake up from your magic spell!
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE XII
 
 [OLAF and ALFHILD come in from the right in the
 background.  Later LADY KIRSTEN.]
 
 ALFHILD.  O, you must tell me still more of the world!
 Your words to my soul are refreshing indeed;
 It seems as if here in the wonders you tell
 My innermost longings you read!....
 
 Did you ne'er on a summer night sit by a tarn,
 So deep that no one could fathom it quite,
 And see in the water the stars so bright,
 Those knowing eyes that express with their flickering light
 Much more than a thousand tongues could possibly say?
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 I often sat thus; I sought with my hands to capture
 The sparkling riddles below in the deep--
 I snatched after them, I would see them close,
 Then they grew blurred like eyes that weep,--
 It is idle to search and to seek--
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 So too in my soul there was many a riddle
 I yearned to solve in the days that are gone!
 They tricked me as did all the stars in the deep,
 Grew stranger and stranger the more I brooded thereon!
 
 OLAF.  Am I not to myself a mysterious riddle?
 Am I Olaf Liljekrans, the nobly born,
 The knight so proud, who vaunted his race,
 Who laughed the singing of birds to scorn!
 And yet, from my heart I tear what I was!
 Happy I am,--and that can I understand--
 Your prophecy failed,--I should happiness find,
 When the fairest of flowers I had found in the land.
 Ah! happiness here I have found!
 
 ALFHILD.  I prophesied nothing.
 But--tell me more of the life that is yonder!
 
 OLAF.  The life that is yonder may go its own way;
 Here is my home; with you will I wander,
 My lovely wife!  Alfhild, behold!
 Is it not as if here in the mountainous fold
 Were built for us two a bower so fair!
 The snowdrops in splendor stand garbed everywhere;
 In here there is feasting, there is joy, there is mirth,
 More real than any I have found on this earth!
 The song rings out from the river so deep;
 It is that which makes me both laugh and weep!
 The song of magic, the mysterious lay,
 Has made me so free, so happy and gay!
 
 [Seizes her passionately in his arms.]
 
 OLAF.  Farewell to the village below I say!
 'Tis here that my bridal-bed I shall prepare;
 Farewell to the world forever and ay,--
 For here I shall hold my beautiful bride!
 
 ALFHILD.  [Moves away apprehensively.]  Olaf!
 
 OLAF.  [Stops suddenly, as if seized with a vague and painful
 remembrance.]  My bride!  What is it I say!
 Tell me--when first--I happened this way--
 Can you still remember the very first night?
 What was it I sought?--No longer I know!
 Did I come to fetch you--to--the village below?
 Did I come the wedding guests to invite?
 
 ALFHILD.  What mean you?  Wedding?  I can't understand--?
 
 OLAF.  Our betrothal at Guldvik was held, you remember!
 For three weeks thereafter our wedding was planned--
 But it seems to me that,--no, my brow like an ember
 Burns hot!  I will try no more to remember!
 
 CHORUS.  [Softly and far in the forest.]
 Olaf Liljekrans!  Olaf Liljekrans!
 Why sleep you so deep and so long?
 
 ALFHILD.  Hush, Olaf! do you hear?
 
 OLAF.  Did you hear it too?
 
 ALFHILD.  What was it?
 
 OLAF.  A memory of long ago,
 Which often comes back when I wander with you!
 'Tis evil,--it calls from the village below.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aside, as she enters from the rear of the stage
 unobserved by the others.]
 Ah, there!  He speaks; could I understand--!
 
 [Approaches listening.]
 
 OLAF.  [With increasing vehemence.]
 Yes, yes, I come; not alone will I ride!
 For ladies and knights shall heed my command,
 And come hither with song to greet my bride!
 For you shall be saddled my swiftest steed,
 The poet and minstrel shall ride in the lead,
 Thereafter shall follow the steward and priest,
 The people shall all be bid to the feast!
 Pages so courtly shall guide your steed,
 And beautiful flowers be strewn at your feet,
 The peasant shall bow to the ground like a weed,
 His wife shall curtsy to you as is meet!
 The church bell shall ring to the countryside:
 Now rides Olaf Liljekrans home with his bride!
 
 CHORUS OF WEDDING GUESTS.  [Animated, yet softly, in the forest
 to the left.]
   Now hasten we all
   To the wedding hall!
   The foal runneth light and gay!
   The hoofs resound
   On the grassy ground,
   As the merry swains gallop away!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aside during the chorus.]
 Heaven he praised then!  Hemming has told--!
 
 ALFHILD.  [Jubilant.]
 They come, they come, their voices I hear!
 How sweetly it sounds!  O Olaf, behold!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Olaf, my son!
 
 [Rushes to him unobserved by ALFHILD, who continues to look out
 to the left.]
 
 OLAF.  God help me!  What's here!
 My mother!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  My poor unfortunate son!
 Now are you saved from the evil one!
 There comes Lord Arne with Ingeborg, your wife!
 
 OLAF.  [With a cry and as if suddenly awakening.]
 Ingeborg!--With that have you shattered my life!
 My happiness then was not what it seemed!
 Alas, that you had to inform me of this!
 
 OLAF.  [In despair.]
 Dear mother! a beautiful dream I have dreamed;
 You waken me now,--there's an end to my bliss!
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE XIII
 
 [The Preceding.  ARNE, INGEBORG, HEMMING, WEDDING
 GUESTS, and LADY KIRSTEN from the left.]
 
 ARNE.  Good luck, Lady Kirsten, to you!  You have found him
 again, I am told.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Of course I have found him.--And now for home!
 
 ARNE.  [To OLAF.]  And no harm has been done you?
 
 OLAF.  [Absent-minded.]  Me!  What do you mean?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Interrupting.]  Of course not, Lord Arne!  He
 went astray on the hunt and--
 
 INGEBORG.  [Pointing to ALFHILD.]  But this young woman--?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  A poor child!  She has given him lodging and
 shelter.
 
 ARNE.  But there is no one who lives up here.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Yet a stray one here and there!  There is many a
 solitary family still dwells among the mountains since the time
 of the plague.
 
 ARNE.  Then come, come!  The horses are waiting below on the
 hill.
 
 OLAF.  [Painfully, as he glances at ALFHILD.]  O mother! I
 cannot!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Softly and resolute.]  You must!  It will be your
 eternal shame if you--
 
 ARNE.  What does he mean?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  He is sick and tired as yet, but it will pass off.
 Come!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [With a significant look at OLAF.]  The young
 woman comes too!
 
 INGEBORG.  You mean that she--!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Faithfully has she nursed him; it is only fitting
 that she be rewarded.
 
 ARNE.  And tomorrow the wedding is held!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Tomorrow,--that I solemnly swear!
 
 ARNE.  I have your word!
 
 HEMMING.  [Softly and triumphant, as he brings forth the ring.]
 And I have Ingeborg's golden ring!
 
 INGEBORG.  [Takes the ring from him and says carelessly.]
 My ring!  Aha,--so you have my ring, Hemming!  Thanks, I shall
 now take care of it myself!
 
 [HEMMING stands a moment dumfounded and then follows very slowly
 the rest, who all except ALFHILD go out to the left.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE XIV
 
 [ALFHILD.  Shortly afterwards THORGJERD from the
 background.]
 
 ALFHILD.  (Has observed in silent and childlike amazement
                 the preceding scene without however heeding the
                 action; when they are gone she suddenly comes to
                 herself as from a dream.)
 
 They are gone!  Can I trust my eyes;--is it true?
 Yes, here in the moonlight they stood in full view!
 There I see them again down the mountain side,
 And I must go with them, for I am the bride!
 
 [Starts as if to rush out to the left.]
 
 THORGJERD.  [In the background.]
 Alfhild! my child!  And how come you here?
 I have told you before--
 
 ALFHILD.  O my father dear!
 Now must I be free--as free as the wind,
 No longer can I in the hills be confined!
 
 THORGJERD.  [Comes nearer.]  What has befallen you?
 
 ALFHILD.  [In ecstasy.]  Now is he come!
 
 THORGJERD.  But who?
 
 ALFHILD.  The fair knight!  He will carry me home!
 Now first do I grasp all the restless desire,
 That long has been smouldering in me like fire!
 We often have sat, as the river rushed by,
 While you sang of the princess enthralled in the hill!
 The princess, my father! the princess am I;
 But he, the fair knight, bent the troll to his will!--
 And now I am free to do what I may;
 I will hence into life and its motley affray!
 His words were like song!  I am free as the wind;
 No power can stay me or hold me behind!
 
 THORGJERD.  Poor child!  You would down to the village below;
 It will cost you your happiness; stay, do not go!
 
 ALFHILD.  But, father, I must!  Your sweetest lays
 Will seem to me now like a misty haze!
 
 THORGJERD.  Then go, my Alfhild! and dream while you may,
 Your father will guard you alway!
 But look you take care of the crafty young swains
 With words so cunning and free!
 
 ALFHILD.  Away in the distant and sunny domains,--
 Where Olaf is, there must I be!
 There stands his castle with golden hall!
 From the ballads you sang his face I recall;
 The king's son is he, the knight who can ride,
 And I, the poor Alfhild,--I am his bride!
 Poor, did I say,--no, the princess on high,
 O, more than the princess,--his sweetheart am I!
 
 [The wedding chorus is heard far down the mountain side.]
 
 ALFHILD.  Listen, he calls with his trumpet and horn!
 Farewell now, forest and flower and thorn!
 Farewell, my valley; you have cramped me too long,
 The whole world is calling with laughter and song!
 Tomorrow attired in gold I shall ride
 Away to the church as Olaf's bride!
 We shall sit on the throne of honor within--
 Ah, now shall my life in its fulness begin!
 
 [She rushes out to the left.  THORGJERD gazes after her
 thoughtfully.  The chorus dies away in the distance as the
 curtain falls.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 
 SECOND ACT
 
 [The enclosure on Lady Kirsten's estate.  To the right
 is seen the main building with an opening in the
 gable; neither windows nor doors are visible.  Further
 towards the back of the stage on the same side a small
 log church and a churchyard.  On the left side a
 storehouse and other out-buildings.  On both sides in
 the foreground simple benches of stone.  It is
 afternoon.]
 
 
 
 SCENE I
 
 [LADY KIRSTEN.  Servants and Maids occupied with preparations for
 the wedding.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Let there be no lack of food or drink.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [To herself.]  Hard have I labored and struggled
 to bring things to this point; but now I shall give a feast that
 shall be heralded far and wide.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [To the servants.]  Be sure to see that on the
 banquet table--yet no, I shall attend to that myself.  The wine
 shall be poured into the silver flagons; the large drinking horns
 shall be filled with the Italian cider; the ale is for the
 servants only, and likewise the homebrewed mead;--and listen, be
 sure to see that there are enough yellow candles in the church;
 the bridal party are not to go to the altar until late in the
 evening, and with red lights shall they be escorted on their way
 from the banquet hall to the church.  Go now, all of you, and see
 that you remember, every one of you, the things I have told you.
 
 [The people go.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  God knows this wedding is costing me more than I
 well can bear; but Ingeborg brings with her a good dowry and
 besides--Oh, well, Arne I shall no doubt be able to manage and
 rule as I see fit, if he is first--
 
 [Looks out to the right.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  There comes Olaf!  If only I knew that he--
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE II
 
 [LADY KIRSTEN.  OLAF comes from the house in festive
 garb; he is pale and thoughtful.]
 
 OLAF.  [To himself.]  Yesterday and today!  There is but a
 midsummer night between the two, and yet it seems to me that both
 autumn and winter have overtaken my soul since the time I
 wandered up there on the mountain side--with her, with Alfhild!
 
 OLAF.  [Notices Lady Kirsten.]  Alas, my dear mother, are you
 there?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Quite so, my son!  I like to see you dressed in
 gold and in silk.  Now one can see by your dress who it is that
 is bridegroom tonight.  I see you have rested.
 
 OLAF.  I have slept, but little have I rested; for all the while
 I was dreaming.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  A bridegroom must dream,--that is an ancient
 custom.
 
 OLAF.  My fairest dream is ended; let us not think any longer
 about that.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Changing the subject.]  We shall have a merry
 time today, I think.
 
 OLAF.  It does not appear that heaven is pleased with my wedding
 day.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  How so?
 
 OLAF.  There are indications of a storm.  Do you see how heavily
 the clouds are gathering in the west?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  The brighter the festive candles will shine when
 you go to the church tonight.
 
 OLAF.  [Paces back and forth a few times; at length he stops
 before his mother and says.]  If I had married a poor man's
 daughter, without family or wealth,--tell me, mother, what would
 you have done?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Looks at him sharply.]  Why do you ask?
 
 OLAF.  Answer me first.  What would you have done?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Cursed you and gone to my grave in sorrow!--But
 tell me, why do you ask?
 
 OLAF.  Ah, it was only a jest; I little thought of doing so.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  That I can believe; for you have always held your
 family in high honor.  But be merry and gay; tomorrow Ingeborg
 will sit in there as your wife, and then you will find both peace
 and happiness.
 
 OLAF.  Peace and happiness.  One thing there is lacking.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  What do you mean?
 
 OLAF.  The fairest of flowers which I was to pick asunder and
 scatter far to the winds.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  The silly dream;--think no longer about it.
 
 OLAF.  Perhaps it would be best for me if I could forget.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  In the ladies' room your betrothed sits with all
 her maids; little have you talked with her today.  Do you not
 want to go in?
 
 OLAF.  [In thought.]  Yes, yes!  Where is she?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  In the ladies' room, as I said.
 
 OLAF.  [Lively.]  Nothing shall be lacking to her from this day.
 Shoes with silver buckles I shall give her; she shall wear
 brooches and rings.  The withered twigs shall be put away; I
 shall give her a golden necklace to wear.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Of whom do you speak?
 
 OLAF.  Of Alfhild!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  I was speaking of Ingeborg, your betrothed.  Olaf!
 Olaf!  You make me anxious and worried,--so strange are you.  I
 could really almost believe that she had bewitched you.
 
 OLAF.  That she has!  Yes, forsooth, mother, I have been
 bewitched.  I have been in the elf maidens' play; happy and gay I
 was as long as it lasted, but now--.  Through long, long years I
 shall be weighed down with woe as often as I call it to mind.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  If she were a witch, the stake would surely be
 hers; but she is a crafty and wily woman who has lured you on
 with her fair speech.
 
 OLAF.  She is pure as the mother of God herself!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Yes, yes, but beware!  Remember, whatever she is,
 tomorrow you are wed; it would be both sin and shame to you if
 you longer took notice of her.
 
 OLAF.  I realize it, mother, full well!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  And Ingeborg, whom you have betrothed and who
 loves you, yes, Olaf! loves you with all her heart--the
 punishment of heaven would be visited on you, in case you--
 
 OLAF.  True, true!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  I will not speak of our own circumstances; but you
 can easily see that Arne's daughter can help us greatly in one
 thing or another; our affairs have been going from bad to worse,
 and if the harvest should fail this year I should not in the
 least be surprised if we had to take up the beggar's staff.
 
 OLAF.  Yes, I know it.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  With Arne's money we can mend everything; an
 honorable place you will win for yourself among the king's men.
 Think this carefully over; if you have promised Alfhild more than
 you can fulfil--and I seem to notice in her something like that
 in spite of her quiet demeanor--why, speak with her about it.
 Tell her,--well, tell her anything you please; empty-handed she
 shall not go away from here,--that you can freely promise.  See,
 here she comes!  Olaf, my son! think of your betrothed and your
 noble race, think of your old mother who would have to go to her
 grave in shame, in case--be a man, Olaf!  Now I go in to look
 after the banqueting table.
 
 [Goes into the house.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE III
 
 [OLAF alone.]
 
 OLAF.  [Gazes out to the right.]
 As merry she is as the youthful roe,
 As it plays with no thought of the morrow;
 But soon will she wring her small hands in woe,
 And suffer in anguish and sorrow!
 Soon must I destroy the faith in her heart,
 And waken her out of her dreams.
 And then--yes, then we forever must part.
 Poor Alfhild!  So bitter your fate to me seems!
 
 OLAF.  [Brooding.]
 What cared I for honor, what cared I for power,
 What mattered my race when I wandered with you!
 It seemed in your eyes was reflected a flower,
 More precious than any the world ever knew!
 Forgotten I had both struggle and strife,
 But since I again came home to this life,
 Since at table I sat in my father's hall,
 Since I went to answer my mother's call--
 
 OLAF.  [Abruptly.]  'Tis true from a noble race I am born,
 And Alfhild lives up in the mountains forlorn.
 In her I should find but a constant sorrow.
 I must tell her--yet, no, I can't let her know!
 Yet truly--I must--I must ere the morrow,
 She must hear what to me is the bitterest woe!
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE IV
 
 [OLAF.  ALFHILD from the church.]
 
 ALFHILD.  [Runs eagerly to meet him.]
 Olaf!  Olaf!  You have led me to the land
 Where I walk amid flowers, where before I trod on sand.
 In truth you have here so pleasant an isle,
 O here I can live without worry or guile!
 So much I would question, so little I know,
 The riddles must you explain as we go.--
 Is it green here always in summer and spring?
 
 OLAF.  Alfhild!
 
 ALFHILD.  Your answer delay!
 You see yon house with its spire and wing?
 There went I this morning to play;
 Without there was joy, there was laughter and mirth;
 Within it was still as nowhere on earth.
 I stepped through the door, I saw a great hall,
 Within was a peace that was fair;
 A dawn softly breaking pervaded it all,
 And people were kneeling in prayer.
 But high from above them a virgin looked down,
 She sailed upon clouds of white,
 Her head shone forth like a crimson crown,
 Like heaven when dawns the light.
 Calm was her face, a blue dress she wore,
 A beautiful elf in her arms she bore,
 And round about her played angels of love,
 That laughed when they saw me below in the door
 From their place in the heavens above!
 
 OLAF.  [Aside.]  Alas!  I have wrought so woeful a play,
 Soon will her sorrow begin!
 
 ALFHILD.  O, tell me, Olaf! what people are they
 Who live in the house I was in?
 
 OLAF.  Each one who like you is good and kind,
 Each one who is child-like in spirit and mind.
 'Tis the church, God's house,--it belongs to him.
 
 ALFHILD.  The mighty father!  'Tis only your whim!
 His house is high over the stars in the sky,
 Where the white swan sails undefiled,
 So high 'tis beyond any mortal eye
 Save that of the dreaming child!--
 The church that you spoke of!  So then it is there
 We shall ride in festal procession,
 As bridegroom and bride!
 
 OLAF.  [Aside.]  No longer I dare
 Delay my wretched confession!
 
 ALFHILD.  Ah, each of your words has burned like a coal,
 And deep its mark it has left on my soul!
 My bosom is filled with joy and with song;
 Wherever I wander in field or at home,
 They shine on my path, they light me along,--
 Like stars at night in the heavenly dome!
 You said the whole world would be asked to the feast,
 And foremost should ride the minstrel and priest,
 Knights should go forward and guide my steed,
 And roses should blossom on every side,
 Each lily we met should bow like a weed,
 The flowers should curtsy before the bride!
 
 OLAF.  Have I said--
 
  ALFHILD.  Olaf, you surely recall!
 All things have followed your every desire;
 The lindens stand yonder so green and so tall;
 The roses are decked in their festive attire
 And dance like elves at an elfen ball.
 Never did heaven's illumining eye
 So radiantly shine as here from the sky;
 Never before sang the birds so sweet!
 They sing the bride and the bridegroom to greet!--
 O, you--you make me so happy and blessed,
 Both heaven and earth could I hold to my breast!
 Nowhere can so humble a weed be found
 Which under my feet I could crush and destroy,
 Nowhere a creature so deep in the ground,
 But I would share in its sorrow and joy!
 My bosom is filled with the glory of spring;
 It surges and roars like a wood in a storm!
 
 OLAF.  [Aside.]  And soon this youthful and lovely form
 Shall writhe beneath sorrow's tormenting sting!
 
 ALFHILD.  O, glorious life!
 
 [She kneels with upstretched arms.]
 
 ALFHILD.  O father of love,
 In the distant heaven!  Had I but the power,
 The tongues of the angels above,
 Thy praise I should sing every hour;
 I cannot, for I am of little worth,
 I can only bow down before you to the earth--
 O thanks, thou unspeakable!  Glory and praise
 For all I can here understand of thy ways!
 
 [She rises.]
 
 ALFHILD.  Yes, lovely is life in its every breath,
 As lovely almost as the journey to death!
 
 OLAF.  In the grave you think it is pleasant to lie?
 
 ALFHILD.  I know not your meaning, but I brooded long.
 And asked of my father "What means it to die?"
 In answer thereto he sang me a song:
 
   "When the child of man is weighted with grief
   And longs to be rocked to rest,
   Then comes there an elf with wings of white
   And frees its spirit oppressed.
 
   "The little elf with his wings of white
   Makes ready a downy bed,
   Of lilies he weaves the linen sheets
   And pillows of roses red.
 
   "Away on the pillows he carries the child,
   He carries it safe on his arm,
   He takes it to heaven aloft on a cloud
   Away from all earthly harm.
 
   "And cherubs there are in the heaven above
   (I tell what is true to you);
   They strew the pillows of rosy red
   With pearls of white and of blue.
 
   "Then wakens the little earthly child,
   It wakens to heavenly mirth,--
   But all that happiness, all that joy
   There's no one that knows here on earth."
 
 OLAF.  'Twere better, alas! had you never come here,
 Had you lived in the mountain your peaceful life.
 Your joy like a weed will wither and sear,
 Your faith will be killed--
 
 ALFHILD.  But as Olaf's wife
 I am strong as the torrent and have no fear!
 With you by my side let happen what may,
 With you I will laugh and suffer and languish.
 
 ALFHILD.  [Listening.]  Hush, Olaf!  You hear that mournful lay,
 It sounds like a song of the bitterest anguish!
 
 CHORUS OF PALLBEARERS.  [Softly outside to the right.]
   The little child we carry
   With sorrow to the grave,
   Beneath the mould we bury
   What soon the worms will crave.
 
   Hard is this lot and dreary:
   With mournful dirge and sigh
   To carry sad and weary
   The child where it shall lie!
 
 ALFHILD.  [Uncertain and anxious.]
 What is it, Olaf?  What is it, I say?
 
 OLAF.  A child that death is bearing away,
 A mother and children weep on the way.
 
 ALFHILD.  Death!  Then where are the pillows of red,
 The lily-white linen, and where is the dead?
 
 OLAF.  I see no pillows of red or of gray,
 But only the dark black boards of the bier;
 And thereon the dead sleeps on shavings and hay.
 
 ALFHILD.  On shavings and hay?
 
 OLAF.  That is all there is here!
 
 ALFHILD.  And where is the elf who bears on his arm
 The child far away from all earthly harm?
 
 OLAF.  I see but a mother whose heart will break,
 And little children who follow the wake.
 
 ALFHILD.  And where are the pearls of blue and of white,
 That the angels strew in the heaven of light?
 
 OLAF.  I see only this,--they weep many a tear
 As they stand at the side of the bier.
 
 ALFHILD.  And where is the home, the house of God,
 Where the dead dream only of mirth?
 
 OLAF.  Behold!  Now they place him beneath the sod
 And cover him over with earth.
 
 ALFHILD.  [Quiet and thoughtful, after a pause.]
 Not so was death in the song--not so.
 
 OLAF.  'Tis true; but no such joy and pleasure
 Has any one felt here below.--
 Have you never heard of the mountain king's treasure,
 Which night after night like gold would glow;
 But if you would seize the gold in your hand,
 You nothing would find save gravel and sand;
 And listen, Alfhild! it often is true
 That life turns out in the selfsame way;
 Approach not too near, it may happen to you,
 That you burn your fingers some day.
 'Tis true it may shine like a heavenly star,
 But only when seen from afar.
 
 [He becomes aware of Lady Kirsten off the stage to the right.]
 
 OLAF.  My mother--she'll tell you--I shall depart.
 The angels above send their peace to your heart!
 
 [He goes towards the house but is stopped by LADY KIRSTEN.--The
 sky becomes overcast with dark clouds; the wind begins to howl
 in the tree-tops.--ALFHILD stands absorbed in deep thought.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE V
 
 [The Preceding.  LADY KIRSTEN.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Softly.]  Not so, my son, you have told her--?
 
 OLAF.  All I was able to say I have said.  Now you tell her the
 rest, and then, mother, let me never, never see her again.
 
 [He casts a glance at ALFHILD and goes out past the house.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  That folly will soon be burned out of his
 soul, if--
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [As if she suddenly has an idea.]  But in case
 I--Ah, if that could succeed, then would he be cured,--that I can
 promise.  But Alfhild--?  Well, nevertheless, it must be
 attempted.
 
 ALFHILD.  [To herself.]
   So then there is here too anguish and woe;
   Well, so let it be; I shall never despair.
   The sorrow of earth I never need know,
   Still Olaf is good and fair!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Approaches.]  It seems to me that gloomy thoughts
 are weighing upon your mind.
 
 ALFHILD.  Yes, yes, the result of things I have recently heard.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  From Olaf?
 
 ALFHILD.  Certainly from Olaf; he has told me--
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  I know, Alfhild.  I know what he has said.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aside.]  He has mentioned to her his wedding, I
 see.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aloud.]  This very night it is to be held.
 
 ALFHILD.  What is to be held?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  The wedding!
 
 ALFHILD.  [Eagerly.]  Oh, yes, that I know!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  You know it and do not take it more to your heart
 than this?
 
 ALFHILD.  No.  Why should I take it to heart?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aside.]  There is something she is meditating,--I
 see that clearly.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aloud.]  Well, so much the better for all of us.
 But tell me, when the wedding is over, what then will you do?
 
 ALFHILD.  I?  I have little thought of that.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  I mean, have you in mind to remain here or to go
 home?
 
 ALFHILD.  [Looks at her, surprised.]  I have in mind to remain!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aside.]  There we have it; she thinks to hold him
 in her wiles even after he is wed.  Well, we shall see about
 that.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aloud.]  Alfhild!  I wish you every possible
 good, and if you dared rely on my--
 
 ALFHILD.  Yes, that I certainly dare!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Well and good; then you will let me take upon
 myself your happiness.  I shall take charge of you as best I know
 how, and if you but give me your word you shall this very night
 go to the church as a bride.
 
 ALFHILD.  Yes, I know that.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Surprised.]  You know that!  Who has told you?
 
 ALFHILD.  Olaf himself said so.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aside.]  Has Olaf--?  Yes, forsooth, he has had
 the same idea that I had, to marry her off in order to be rid of
 her.  Or perhaps in order to--well, no matter,--when she is
 finally married, when Olaf on his side is a married man, then--
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aloud.]  Well and good, Alfhild!  If Olaf has
 told you our intention for you, then it is not necessary for me
 to--But do you now hasten, go in there in the store house; there
 you will find my own wedding gown; that you shall wear!
 
 ALFHILD.  [With childlike joy.]  Shall I!  Your own wedding gown!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Do as I say.  Go in there and dress yourself as
 splendidly as you please.
 
 ALFHILD.  And do I also get a bridal crown?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Certainly!  A bridal crown and silver rings and
 golden bracelet.  You will find plenty of them in the coffers and
 chests.
 
 ALFHILD.  Silver rings and golden bracelets!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Go, go, and hurry as fast as you can.
 
 ALFHILD.  O, I shall not be long about it.
 
 [Claps her hands.]
 
 ALFHILD.  I shall have silver rings and golden bracelets!
 
 [She runs out to the left.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE VI
 
 [LADY KIRSTEN alone.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  The evil and cursed woman!  Happy and gay she is
 though she knows that Olaf is to wed another.  But that very fact
 will serve me well; it will go easier than I had thought.  She
 looks as innocent as a child, and yet she can agree to take him
 as a husband whom I first pick out for her.  And I who thought
 that she truly loved Olaf!  If he is still ignorant of her real
 spirit, he shall soon learn.  He shall know her to the core, he
 shall know how she has bewitched and lured him, and then, well,
 then she is no longer dangerous.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Smiling.]  Well, well!  Olaf thought of the same
 way of saving himself that I did; so good-natured I had never
 imagined him.--But where shall we find the man who is willing
 to--well, she is pretty, and I shall not mind a little silver and
 even a bit of land.  Has Olaf already spoken to some one?  That
 is hardly thinkable!--Well, then I shall see to that.  I have
 servants enough on the estate and--
 
 [Looks out to the right.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Hemming! what if I should try him!  But he saw
 them together in the mountain yesterday; he must surely know
 there is something between the two.  But none the less--he is a
 humble serving-man, and poor besides, and weak of mind--we shall
 see, we shall see!
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE VII
 
 [LADY KIRSTEN.  HEMMING from the right.]
 
 HEMMING.  [To himself.]  Nowhere is Ingeborg to be found; she
 will bring me to my grave,--that is certain.  Yesterday she was
 gracious to me; she gave me her ring; but then she took it away
 from me again; and today she will not so much as look at me as I
 pass.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Slowly, as she approaches.]  A little cautious I
 must be.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aloud.]  Ah, Hemming, is it you?  You prefer to
 wander alone, I see; you keep yourself away from the servants and
 maids; when I see such things I realize very well that you do so
 not without reason.
 
 HEMMING.  Why, my noble lady! what should--
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Yes, Hemming! there is something that you keep all
 to yourself as you go about; you are not very cheerful!
 
 HEMMING.  [Disconcerted.]  Not cheerful?  I?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Smiling.]  There is here today a young and
 beautiful girl whom you fancy very much.
 
  HEMMING.  All saints!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  And she in turn has a fancy for you.
 
  HEMMING.  Me--Whom?  I do not know whom you mean.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Come, Hemming, do not speak so; before me you need
 not feel ashamed.  Yes, yes, I see clearly, I tell you.
 
 HEMMING.  [Aside.]  Heaven! she must have noticed by Ingeborg's
 manner that--
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  I have seen that the wedding is but little joy to
 you.  The trip to the church you care little about, since you
 would yourself like to go as a groom, yet cannot see your way
 clear.
 
 HEMMING.  [In the greatest agitation.]  Alas, Lady Kirsten! my
 noble, august lady! be not offended!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Surprised.]  I?  And why should I be offended?
 
 HEMMING.  [Continuing.]  I have struggled and fought against this
 unhappy love as long as I have been able, and I honestly believe
 she has done the same.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  She?  Has she then told you that she cares for
 you?
 
 HEMMING.  Yes, almost!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Well and good; then you talked about it together?
 
 HEMMING.  Yes,--but only once, only one single time, I swear.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Once or ten times, it is all the same to me.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aside.]  Then they are already agreed; it was
 certainly a stroke of luck that I came upon Hemming; now I am not
 at all surprised that Alfhild was so willing to go to the altar.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aloud.]  Hemming!  I am much indebted to you for
 finding my son again and for otherwise being of help to me; now I
 shall make requital,--I shall to the limit of my power stand by
 you in the matter we just spoke of.
 
 HEMMING.  [Overcome with joy.]  You!  You will!  Lady Kirsten!
 Alas, great God and holy saints!  I hardly dare believe it.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Stops.]  But Lord Olaf, your son!  What do you
 think he will say?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  He will not interpose any objection,--I shall see
 to that.
 
 HEMMING.  [Unsuspecting.]  Yes, truly, it would be best for him
 too, for I know she cares little for him.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Smiling.]  That I have noticed, Hemming!
 
 HEMMING.  Have you!  Well, you are so clever, Lady Kirsten!  And
 I who thought that I was the only one who had noticed it.
 
 HEMMING.  [Doubtfully.]  Do you think that Lord Arne will give
 his consent?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Your master?  I shall know how to talk him into
 it,--that will not be so difficult.
 
 HEMMING.  You think so?  Alas, but I am so poor a man.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  I shall remedy that all right, in case Lord Arne
 is not prepared to do so.
 
 HEMMING.  Thanks, thanks, Lady Kirsten!  Heaven reward you for
 your kindness!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  But you will keep this that we have been speaking
 of to yourself.
 
 HEMMING.  That I promise.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Then hold yourself in readiness; the guests will
 assemble out here in a little while now, and do you be on hand.
 
 [She goes over to the door of the store house and looks for
 ALFHILD.]
 
 HEMMING.  [To himself.]  No, this is to me like a strange
 illusive dream.  Ingeborg and I,--we are to belong to
 each other!  Ah, can it be true?  So high I never dared let
 my thoughts ascend;--it seemed to me in the morning that
 I had been guilty of the greatest presumption if during
 the night I had dreamed about it.--Hm!  I know very
 well of course that it is not for my sake that Lady Kirsten
 goes to all this trouble.  She has something up her sleeve;
 she thinks it necessary to break the agreement with Lord
 Arne, and now that she has noticed that Ingeborg cares for
 me she will use that as an excuse.  Well, I have so often
 given my master warning, but he will never believe me.
 
 ARNE.  [Calls outside to the left.]  Hemming!  Hemming!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Comes forward.]  Your master calls!  Go now!
 After a while I shall speak to him; he will agree.  Believe me,
 he shall follow his page to the church in the same hour that he
 leads his daughter thither.
 
 HEMMING.  Thanks, thanks, Lady Kirsten!  Truly, you confer a
 blessing on us all.
 
 [He goes out to the left.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [To herself.]  So young she is and yet so cunning;
 she has been coquetting with Hemming all the while she made my
 son believe that--Well and good, he shall soon learn to know her
 arts.  But first I must see Lord Arne; he thinks highly of
 Hemming and would reluctantly part with him; it seemed too that
 Hemming feared that something like that might stand in the way;
 but they can easily remain as they are even if Hemming
 marries.--Hemming sees more clearly in the affair than I had
 expected.  What will Olaf say, he asked; he has evidently noticed
 that my son still thinks of Alfhild.  Well, let him; if he takes
 her he will say nothing, and when Alfhild is married,--I know
 Olaf; he has always wanted to stand in high honor among the men
 of the village, and for that reason he will certainly--yes, yes,
 it must, it shall succeed.
 
 [She goes out to the right.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE VIII
 
 [HEMMING comes from the left with a bowl of ale hidden
 under his coat.  ARNE follows him cautiously, looking
 about.]
 
 ARNE.  Is there anyone?
 
 HEMMING.  No, come along, master.
 
 ARNE.  But it seemed to me I heard Lady Kirsten.
 
 HEMMING.  She is gone now, come along!
 
 ARNE.  [Sits down on the bench to the left.]  Hemming!  it is
 well that the wedding is to be held tonight.  Tomorrow I go home;
 yes, that I will.  Not a day longer will I remain in Lady
 Kirsten's house.
 
 HEMMING.  Why, master! is there enmity again between you?
 
 ARNE.  Is it not enough, do you think, that she and all her
 superior relatives look down on me; at supper they laughed and
 jested among themselves because I could not bring myself to eat
 of all those ungodly, outlandish dishes.  And what was it that we
 got to drink?  Sweet wine and cider that will stay in my stomach
 for eight days.  No, the good old homebrewed ale for me.
 
 [Drinks and adds softly and bitterly.]
 
 ARNE.  Of this I had sent the wretched woman three full barrels.
 And what has she done?  Thrown it to her servants, and here I
 must steal myself a drink,--yes, Hemming! steal myself a drink of
 my own ale, that they may not revile me as a coarse peasant, who
 doesn't understand the more refined drinks.
 
 HEMMING.  Well, master!  I gave you warning.
 
 ARNE.  Ah--gave me warning!  You are stupid, Hemming!  You think
 I haven't noticed it myself; but wait, just wait!
 
 ARNE.  [Flaring up.]  To place my good nourishing ale before the
 house servants, as though it were not worthy to be put on the
 table of a lord.--
 
 HEMMING.  Yes, Lady Kirsten treats you ill, that is certain.
 
 ARNE.  [Hands him the bowl.]  Come, sit down and drink!
 
 ARNE.  [HEMMING sits down.]  Listen, Hemming!  I could wish we
 were home again.
 
 HEMMING.  Well, I have no fancy for this festive home.
 
 ARNE.  No, my old room at Guldvik for me;--when we sat there of
 an evening and played chess with the ale jug between us--
 
 HEMMING.  The while Mistress Ingeborg sat at the loom and
 embroidered roses and all sorts of flowers in the linen--
 
 ARNE.  And sang all the time so merrily that it seemed to me that
 I became young and active again.  Yes, Hemming! when the wedding
 is over, we shall go back and live our old ways again.
 
 HEMMING.  But then there will be no one who works the loom and
 sings merry lays the while.
 
 ARNE.  No, that is true enough; Ingeborg will then be gone.  It
 will be a little hard on me; she is wild and self-willed, but I
 shall miss her nevertheless,--miss her greatly.
 
 ARNE.  [Considers.]  Now and then I suppose I could visit her
 here--But no, that I will not!  Here they laugh at me, they
 whisper behind my back,--I see it well enough.
 
 HEMMING.  But in case you wished, it could still be changed.
 
 ARNE.  Changed!  You are stupid, Hemming!  Always you talk about
 changing.
 
 ARNE.  [Hands him the bowl.]  Come, drink, it will do you good.
 Changed; no, no, it shall never be changed!  It was evil spirits
 who put into my head the idea of marrying into Lady Kirsten's
 family.  But now it is done; the superior kinsmen will have to
 behave as they please, but my own relatives and friends shall not
 laugh at me,--if I have given my word, I shall keep it too.
 
 ARNE.  [Disheartened.]  If I only knew that Olaf would be kind to
 her; I shall ask him to--.
 
 ARNE.  [Vehemently.]  He _shall_ be kind, else I shall come
 and beat him with my old fists.
 
 HEMMING.  Yes, it is well that you keep your eye on her, for Olaf
 cares little for her, I do believe.
 
 ARNE.  So, you think so?
 
 HEMMING.  Do you remember Alfhild, the poor girl, who yesterday
 followed us down from the mountain?
 
 ARNE.  Indeed I do.  She is pretty!
 
 HEMMING.  [Rises.]  So thinks Olaf, too.
 
 ARNE.  What does that mean?
 
 HEMMING.  Olaf loves her!  'Tis many a time he visited her up
 there;--what Lady Kirsten has told you, you must never believe.
 
 ARNE.  And what you blab about I believe still less.  You are
 provoked with Ingeborg because at times she makes fun of you, and
 therefore you begrudge her this attractive marriage; yes, yes, I
 know you too well.
 
 HEMMING.  Why, master! you could believe that--
 
 ARNE.  Make me believe that Olaf Liljekrans loves that beggar
 woman!  A noble, high-born lord such as he!  It is almost as if
 one were to say that Ingeborg, my daughter, had a fancy for you.
 
 HEMMING.  [Embarrassed.]  For me--how could you ever imagine--
 
 ARNE.  No, I don't imagine!  But the one is as unreasonable as
 the other.  Come, drink! and don't talk any more such nonsense.
 
 ARNE.  [Rises.]  There is Lady Kirsten with the guests.  What's
 going to happen now?
 
 HEMMING.  They are all to assemble out here; they will then
 follow the bride and bridegroom to the banquet-table and thence
 to the church.
 
 ARNE.  Aye, what a cursed custom!  To the church at night!  Is
 then marriage a work of darkness?
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE IX
 
 [The Preceding.  LADY KIRSTEN, OLAF, INGEBORG,
 GUESTS, and SERVANTS and MAIDS enter gradually
 from the several sides.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [To herself.]  I have not seen Olaf alone; but
 when I think it over, it is probably best that he know nothing
 about it until it is all over.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Softly, to HEMMING, who has been whispering with
 INGEBORG.]  Well, Hemming!  How do you think your master is
 disposed?
 
 HEMMING.  Alas, Lady Kirsten!  I have but little hope unless you
 lend your aid.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Aye, we'll manage it all right.
 
 [She mingles with the GUESTS.]
 
 INGEBORG.  [Softly, to HEMMING.]  What do you mean?  What blessed
 hope is it you are speaking of?
 
 HEMMING.  Alas, I hardly dare believe it myself; but Lady Kirsten
 means well by us.  She will soon show you that--
 
 INGEBORG.  Hush! they are approaching.
 
 OLAF.  [In an undertone.]  Tell me, mother! how goes it with her?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Well enough, as I knew before.
 
 OLAF.  Then she knows how to comfort herself?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Smiling.]  It seems so.  Only wait!  This very
 evening you shall know for certain.
 
 OLAF.  What do you mean?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  I mean that she is a sly witch.  All her fair
 words have been deceitful wiles.
 
 OLAF.  No, no, mother!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  That we shall see!  Alfhild is happy and gay,--so
 much I know.
 
 OLAF.  It were well for me if she were!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Loudly and clearly.]  Lord Arne of Guldvik!  Now
 is the hour come at length which we have all, I imagine, been
 looking forward to.
 
 HEMMING.  [Aside.]  Now it begins!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Soon will the church bestow its blessing on our
 children and unite them in a long and loving union.
 
 HEMMING.  [Aside, startled.]  What now?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  The terms we have already agreed upon.  But I
 suggest that we here once again seal them with hand and word.
 
 HEMMING.  [As before.]  Heaven and earth!  Is she trying to
 deceive me?
 
 ARNE.  That is not necessary; I stand by my word like an
 honorable man.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  That I well know, Lord Arne! but it will take but
 a moment.  First of all, there shall be an end for all time to
 every quarrel and dispute between our families,--and as for the
 damages and injuries which our old disagreements have caused on
 either side, no one shall demand compensation for them; each must
 manage them as best he knows how.  We promise that, do we not?
 
 ARNE.  That we promise!
 
 [General shaking of hands among the relatives of the bridal
 couple.]
 
 HEMMING.  [Softly.]  Curses upon you; you lied to me shamefully!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Then we mention again, what we are already agreed
 upon, that the boundary line between Lord Arne's domains and mine
 shall be moved as far in upon his land as good and impartial men
 may judge to be fitting and just.
 
 ARNE.  Yes, yes, I suppose it must be so!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  That we promise, then?
 
 THE GUESTS.  That we promise!
 
 [Shaking of hands as before.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Finally, Lord Arne shall give in the form of a
 dowry to his daughter as much silver, linen, and other
 furnishings as were named and agreed upon at the betrothal feast,
 all of which shall here be placed in my home from the day
 Mistress Ingeborg moves herein as my son's lawful wife, which is
 tonight.  On that we are agreed?
 
 THE GUESTS.  That we solemnly promise!
 
 [Shaking of hands.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Then let the bride and bridegroom clasp hands and
 go to the banquet-table and thence to the church.
 
 ARNE.  [Aside.]  Ah, Hemming can now see whether Lady Kirsten
 deceives me.
 
 HEMMING.  [Softly.]  O, then it is all over for me; a fool I was
 to depend on her.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  But on this joyful day it is fitting that we make
 as many as possible happy.  And therefore I have a request to
 make, Lord Arne!
 
 ARNE.  Speak forth!  If I can I shall gladly comply.
 
 HEMMING.  [Aside.]  What does she purpose now?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  There is still a young couple who would like to go
 to the altar this evening; from what I hear, they are agreed
 between themselves.  The bride I shall take care of, but the
 bridegroom you must assist; it is Hemming, your page, and
 Alfhild!
 
 INGEBORG.  [With a cry.]  Hemming!
 
 OLAF.  [Likewise.]  Alfhild!
 
 HEMMING.  O, woe is me!  Now I understand--
 
 THE GUESTS.  [At the same time.]  Hemming and Alfhild!  The
 mountain girl!
 
 [Laughter and whispering.]
 
 OLAF.  Alfhild!  You will marry her off to--No, no, it shall not
 be!  Never, never!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Be still!--Olaf, my son; be still, I beg you!
 
 ARNE.  [To himself.]  What's this!  Yes, truly, then Hemming was
 right; there is something between Olaf and Alfhild.
 
 ARNE.  [Whispering.]  Aye, Lady Kirsten!  I see your scheme.  Now
 I know why Olaf wandered three days in the mountain, and now you
 intend to make use of Hemming to be rid of her.  Ha, ha!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [With forced composure.]  Lord Arne!  how can you
 believe such a thing?
 
 ARNE.  [In a low tone.]  O, I see clearly!  Now I should think I
 had very good reason to break the agreement.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Softly and frightened.]  Break the agreement!  I
 beg of you!  Will you put us all to shame?
 
 [They talk together softly.]
 
 HEMMING.  [To INGEBORG, with whom he has in the meantime been
 whispering.]  That is all there is to it, I swear.  Lady Kirsten
 and I have not understood each other.
 
 INGEBORG.  Well, then decline!  You shall!  I command you.
 
 HEMMING.  No, no!  I dare not; she will then see that it was you
 I was thinking of.
 
 INGEBORG.  Good; then I shall.
 
 INGEBORG.  [Aloud.]  Hemming shall not go to the altar with
 Alfhild;--he is too good to marry another man's darling!
 
 OLAF.  [With a cry.]  For shame!
 
 THE GUESTS.  Darling!
 
 ARNE.  [To INGEBORG.]  What are you saying?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Heaven protect us!
 
 OLAF.  Cursed be my soul!  She is put to shame!
 
 INGEBORG.  Yes, loudly I proclaim it: she is another man's
 darling.  Let him gainsay it who dares.
 
 ARNE.  Ingeborg!
 
 ARNE.  [Aside.]  What is the matter with her?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Softly.]  So that's the way it is!  She
 then,--she it is who cares for Hemming!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Softly and clearly, to ARNE.]  Do you now intend
 to break the agreement?  You can now see for yourself from your
 daughter's conduct what reason I had to get Hemming married!
 
 ARNE.  [Disconcerted.]  My daughter!  Could you imagine that
 she--
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  You need not pretend!  Ingeborg has a fancy for
 your house-carl; now I should think I had good reason to break
 our agreement.
 
 ARNE.  Break, break--!  What are you thinking of!  To bring on me
 such disgrace!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Mocking.]  Yes,--otherwise you would do it!
 
 ARNE.  [Quickly.]  No, no, I have reconsidered; it is best we
 both keep still!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [To herself.]  See, now have I won!  I know Olaf;
 a woman so scorned will never tempt him!
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE X
 
 [The Preceding.  ALFHILD comes unnoticed out of the
 storehouse in glittering bridal dress with a crown on
 her head and her hair flowing.]
 
 ARNE.  [Aside.]  This has been a cursed day for me!  O, he is a
 cunning dog, this Hemming!  He knew that Ingeborg had a fancy for
 him; it was therefore so galling to him that Olaf should have
 her.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Who has in the meantime regained her composure.]
 And now to the festive hall!  Hemming we can think of
 later.--Olaf, take your bride by the hand!
 
 ARNE.  [Reluctantly, as he sees INGEBORG whisper to HEMMING.]
 Where is the bride?  Come, come!
 
 ALFHILD AND INGEBORG.  [At the same time, as they each seize one
 of OLAF's hands.]  Here I am!
 
 THE GUESTS.  How,--she takes Olaf?
 
 [General amazement.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aside.]  So far has he gone, then!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aloud, to ALFHILD.]  You are mistaken!  That is
 not your bridegroom!
 
 ALFHILD.  Why, certainly, it is Olaf!
 
 INGEBORG.  [Lets go his hand.]  If then he has promised her--!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [In great agitation.]  Olaf is not your
 bridegroom, I say!  Tell her it yourself, my son!
 
 [OLAF is silent.  LADY KIRSTEN's Kinsmen look at each other
 embarrassed.  ARNE's Relatives draw nearer, angry and
 threatening.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [With raised voice.]  Olaf Liljekrans!  Answer
 loudly and clearly!  You owe it to yourself and to us.
 
 OLAF.  [In despair, struggling with himself.]  Let it be as you
 wish then, mother!  Yes, by all the saints!  I shall answer.
 Alfhild! you are mistaken!  I am not your bridegroom.
 
 OLAF.  [Pointing to INGEBORG.]  There--there stands my bride!
 
 ALFHILD.  [Withdraws a step or two dumfounded and stares at him.]
 She--your--
 
 OLAF.  [With rising irritation.]  Alfhild! go hence!  Go, go, far
 into the mountain again; 'twill be best for you.  I was sick and
 bewildered in mind when I wandered up there!  What I have told
 you I little remember!  I do not know and I do not want to know!
 Do you hear,--I do not want to!--The golden crown you can keep!
 Keep all, both the silver and gold, that you there stand dressed
 in.  More,--yea, tenfold more you shall have.--Well! why do you
 stare at me so?
 
 [ALFHILD takes off the crown and the other adornments and places
 them at OLAF's feet as she continues uninterruptedly to stare at
 him.]
 
 OLAF.  Perhaps I pretended to you that you were to be my bride
 tonight, perhaps you believed me!  Perhaps you thought that Olaf
 Liljekrans would marry a--a--what was it you called her?
 
 OLAF.  [Stamps with his foot.]  Do not stare at me so, I say!  I
 know you well enough; you have bewitched me.  I forgot my family;
 I forgot my bride, my betrothed, she who stands there.
 
 OLAF.  [Seizes ALFHILD violently by the arm.]  Look at her,
 Alfhild!  Aha, it is she that I love!
 
 [ALFHILD sinks down on her knees and covers her face with her
 hands.]
 
 OLAF.  Rise, Alfhild! rise, I say!  If you dare to grieve in this
 way, I shall kill you!--Why are you not happy?  Be merry and wild
 as I am!--And the rest of you!  Why do you stand so silently,
 looking at one another?  Laugh,--laugh loudly, so that it may
 echo around!--Alfhild!  Why don't you answer?  Have I not told
 you enough!  Aha!  Then add, you others, a word to what I have
 said!  Come, say something, you too; Lady Kirsten would like it!
 Laugh at her, mock her, trample her under your feet!
 
 OLAF.  [With ringing laughter.]  Ha, ha, ha!  She is Olaf's
 darling!
 
 [ALFHILD sinks down to the ground in such a way that she rests
 prostrate against the stone bench at the left.  A flash of
 lightning illuminates the scene and the thunder rolls; during
 the following to the close of the act the darkness and the storm
 increase.]
 
 OLAF.  See, see!  That I like; now do the powers above join in!
 Right now will I ride to the church with my bride!  Come,
 Mistress Ingeborg!  But first will we drink,--yes, drink, drink!
 Bring here the beaker and horn,--not in there--!  Light the
 candles in the church!  Let the organ resound; prepare for a
 dance--not mournful psalms--fie, fie, no, a dance!
 
 [Thunder and lightning.]
 
 OLAF.  Ah, it is rumored in heaven that Olaf Liljekrans is
 celebrating his wedding!
 
 [Rushes out to the right.]
 
 ARNE.  Christ save me! his reason is gone!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Ah, have no fear; it will soon pass,--I know him.
 
 [Draws ARNE aside with her.]
 
 ARNE.  [Gently threatening HEMMING in passing.]  O, Hemming,
 Hemming!  You are a sly dog!
 
 [The GUESTS go quietly and gloomily out to the right; the
 SERVANTS to the left.]
 
 INGEBORG.  [Detains HEMMING.]  Hemming!  I will not go to church
 with Olaf Liljekrans!
 
 HEMMING.  Alas, what will prevent it?
 
 INGEBORG.  If it comes to that, I shall say no,--no before the
 very altar itself, in the presence of all!
 
 HEMMING.  Ingeborg!
 
 INGEBORG.  Hold my horse saddled and ready!
 
 HEMMING.  What!  You will--!
 
 INGEBORG.  I will!  Now I know for the first time how dear you
 are to me,--now when I stand in danger of losing you.  Go,--do as
 I say, and let me know when it is time.
 
 [She goes out to the right.]
 
 HEMMING.  Yes, now am I strong; now I dare venture whatever it
 be!
 
 [He goes out to the left.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE XI
 
 [ALFHILD.  Later HEMMING, INGEBORG, and others at
 various times.]
 
 ALFHILD.  [Remains lying motionless for a long time with her face
 concealed in her hands.  At length she half raises herself, looks
 about bewildered, rises, and speaks with quiet broken laughter.]
 One falcon the heavens with plenty may bless,
 Another must suffer great want and distress!
 One bird wears a coat of feathers so gay,
 Another must live contented with gray!
 I have known that tears are a balm to the soul,
 When the world is nothing but gall;
 But now I have suffered such sorrow and dole,
 I could laugh myself dead at the thought of it all!
 
 [It is now quite dark.  The windows of the church are being
 lighted up.  ALFHILD goes over to the house and listens while the
 following song is heard faintly within.]
 
 CHORUS OF WEDDING GUESTS.
 Hail to the bridegroom and hail to the bride!
 There's feasting and joy everywhere.
 Lord Olaf, all hail! a knight who can ride,
 And Ingeborg a lady so fair!
 
 HEMMING.  [Steals in from the left during the song.]  The horse
 stands saddled and ready!  Now a secret sign to Ingeborg and then
 away!
 
 [He goes out to the right to the rear of the house.]
 
 ALFHILD.  His health from the silvery cup they drink,
 The bride sits proudly enthroned at his side;
 The candles of wax on the altar now wink,
 Soon out to the church they will ride!
 Within at the banquet sit host and guest
 And laugh as they bandy the merry jest!
 But here I must wander alone in the night,
 Alas, they have all forsaken me quite!
 Olaf!  The storm is rending my hair!
 The rain beats against me wherever I fare!
 Olaf, Olaf!  Can you see me thus languish
 Beneath this unspeakable torture and anguish?
 
 [She laughs.]
 
 ALFHILD.  But rain or storm is a trifling thing,
 'Tis as nothing beside the poignant sting
 I suffer within my breast.--
 My home and my father and all the rest
 I left for Olaf, the friend I loved best!
 He swore to me then I should be his bride!
 And I came--God's love I felt in my soul;
 But he drove me away, he thrust me aside;
 So loudly he laughed when I writhed in dole!
 While they banquet within, like a dog I must stay
 Out here in the storm.  Hence,--hence I will go!
 
 [Starts to go, but stops.]
 
 ALFHILD.  But I have not the power, I cannot go away;
 Here must I stay and suffer my woe!
 'Tis little the flowers out there in the wood
 Can tear themselves up from the ground!
 And Olaf, whether he be false or good,--
 About him my roots I have wound.
 
 [Pause.--The HOUSE SERVANTS come with torches from the left.]
 
 ALFHILD.  [As if seized by an uneasy presentiment.]  Whither do
 you go?  Whither, whither?  What is going to happen?
 
 A SERVANT.  Why, see, see!  It is Alfhild; she is still here!
 
 ALFHILD.  O, tell me this!  What is going to happen,--why all
 these preparations?
 
 THE SERVANT.  The wedding!  Wouldn't you care to see it?
 
 ALFHILD.  [In feverish anxiety.]  The wedding!  O, no, no!  Put
 it off, only till tomorrow!  If the wedding is held, then is
 everything over with me, I well know!
 
 THE SERVANT.  Postpone it!  No, Alfhild!  'Tis not, I'm afraid,
 the wish of bridegroom or bride!
 
 ANOTHER.  Think for a moment!  Were you yourself but the bride,
 you surely would not want to wait.
 
 [Laughter.]
 
 THE FIRST SERVANT.  Now we go down to the gate at the church to
 light the way with red bridal lights when the procession starts
 from the house.
 
 THE SECOND SERVANT.  Come along with us, Alfhild!  You shall also
 have a torch to carry!
 
 SEVERAL.  Yes, yes, you must come!  It is Lord Olaf's day of
 glory!
 
 [Laughter.]
 
 ALFHILD.  [Takes one of the torches.]  Yes, yes, I will!  As the
 most humble in the row I shall stand down there, and then, when
 he sees me, when I ask of him, when I remind him of everything he
 has promised and sworn,--O, tell me, tell me, do you not think
 that he will be kind to me again?  Do you think so?  O, tell me
 you do!  Say that you think so!
 
 THE SERVANTS.  Aha,--for certain he will; now come!
 
 [They go out to the right to the rear of the house.]
 
 ALFHILD.  [Bursts into tears.]
 They mock at me, laugh at me,--one and all!
 So harsh is not even the mountain wall;
 The moss thereon is permitted to grow;
 There's no one so kind to me here!  I--I must go!
 
 [Thunder and lightning.]
 
 ALFHILD.  Ah, heaven itself is angry and grim,
 It pours out its wrath on my wretched head;
 But flash there is none to annihilate him
 Who craftily tricked me in all that he said!
 
 [The tones of the organ are heard from within the church.]
 
 ALFHILD.  O, listen!  I hear God's angel choir!
 'Tis Olaf to the altar they call!
 And I must stand here in my ragged attire
 And suffer outside the church-hall!
 
 [She swings the torch high in the air.]
 
 ALFHILD.  No, no, that I will not, thou all-highest God!
 O, tempt me no longer, forswear thee I may!
 
 [She is silent and listens to the organ music.]
 
 ALFHILD.  God's angels are singing!  From under the sod
 The dead they were able to carol away!
 O, my bosom is bursting with woe!
 
 [She kneels and faces the church.]
 
 ALFHILD.  Cease, cease your melodies tender and sweet!
 O, cease your singing; be kind, I entreat!
 Or Olaf to the altar will go!
 
 [Whispering and in the greatest apprehension.]
 
 ALFHILD.  Be still!  O, be still!  For a little while yet!
 He is lulled in a sleep that will make him forget!
 O, waken him not, else straight he will hie
 To the church--and then, alas, I must die!
 
 [The organ grows louder through the storm.  ALFHILD springs up,
 beside herself with despair.]
 
 The angels of God have forsaken me quite!
 They mock at my anguish and woe!
 They conjure him forth;--he is now in their might!
 Ah, if here in the dark, dark night I must go,
 Your bridal chamber at least shall be light!
 
 [She throws the torch in through the opening in the gable and
 falls down on the ground.--INGEBORG and HEMMING come hurriedly
 from behind the house.]
 
 HEMMING.  Now it is time.  The horse stands saddled behind the
 store house.
 
 INGEBORG.  And all the servants are down at the church, are they
 not?
 
 HEMMING.  Aye, rest you assured; and in the banquet house I have
 barred every shutter and door with heavy iron rings; no one can
 get out!
 
 INGEBORG.  Away, then!  Up to the valley which Alfhild has told
 of!
 
 HEMMING.  Yes, up there!  There no one will seek us!
 
 [They rush out to the left.--ALFHILD continues to lie motionless
 for some time.  Suddenly cries and commotion are hear in the
 bridal house; the flames break out through the roof.]
 
 ALFHILD.  [Jumps up in despair.]
 It burns!--Aha,--I remember!  'T was here
 Too dark for my soul--it filled me with fear!
 Olaf, before it was you who smiled,
 Now it is Alfhild, so gay and so wild!--
 In the bridal house there is anguish and gloom,
 The bride is burning on the arm of the groom!
 
 [The HOUSE SERVANTS rush in one by one without torches and stand
 as if turned to stone.  OLAF comes into view up in the opening,
 which he seeks to widen with desperate efforts.]
 
 OLAF.  Alfhild!  'Tis you!  So might I have known!
 If only from out of this danger you save me,
 'T is silver and gold you shall hereafter own!
 
 ALFHILD.  [With wild laughter.]
 Too well I remember the promise you gave me!
 Now ride to the church with minstrel and priest!
 Now hold your wedding,--forget all the rest!
 Alfhild has honored you as she knew best,--
 The torch she has swung at your bridal feast!
 
 [She rushes out at the back.  The SERVANTS hasten to lend their
 help; a part of the roof falls in; OLAF is seen high amidst the
 flames as the curtain falls.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 
 THIRD ACT
 
 [A sunny valley, rich in flowers, trees, and
 vegetation of all kinds, and surrounded by lofty
 snow-capped mountains.  In the center of the background
 a quiet mountain tarn; on the left side a rocky cliff
 which drops straight down to the water.  On the same
 side nearer the front of the stage a very old log hut,
 almost entirely hidden in the dense shrubbery.  The
 glow of dawn shines over the mountains; in the valley
 itself the day is only half begun; during the
 following scene's the sun rises.]
 
 
 
 SCENE I
 
 [ALFHILD lies sleeping and half concealed among the
 bushes beside the hut; soft music indicates her
 shifting dreams.  OLAF comes down the hillside to the
 right.  Over his wedding clothes he wears a coarse
 cloak.]
 
 OLAF.  Here it was; I know the green there this side of the tarn.
 It was yonder beneath the linden tree that I dreamed my strange
 dream.  On the slope of the mountain there I stood when Alfhild
 for the first time came to meet me; I placed my betrothal ring on
 the string of my bow and shot;--that shot has proved a magic
 shot; it struck the huntsman himself.
 
 OLAF.  It is strange that when I wander up here, far from the
 village below, it seems as if another atmosphere played around
 me, as if a more vigorous blood flowed in my veins, as if I had
 another mind, another soul.
 
 OLAF.  Where is she now?
 
 OLAF.  I shall,--I will find her again!  Up here she must come;
 she has no home out there in the cold wide world.  And I--am I
 not also a homeless fugitive?  Did I not become a stranger in my
 mother's house, a stranger among my kinsmen, the very first hour
 I met her?
 
 OLAF.  Is she then a witch,--has she power over secret arts as--?
 
 OLAF.  My mother!  Hm!  It seems to me it would scarcely be well
 for me to allow her to manage my life; she insinuates thoughts
 into my heart which do not belong there.  No, no, I will find
 Alfhild again and ask forgiveness for the wrong I have done, and
 then--
 
 [He stops and looks out to the left.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE II
 
 OLAF.  (Alfhild still sleeping.  Thorgjerd comes from
                 behind the hut on the left.)
 
 OLAF.  Well met, stranger!
 
 THORGJERD.  Thanks, the same to you.  You are early about!
 
 OLAF.  Or late; early in the morning, but late in the night.
 
 THORGJERD.  You belong in the village below, I take it.
 
 OLAF.  My family lives there.  And you?
 
 THORGJERD.  Wherever the mind is at rest, there is one at home;
 that is why I like best to wander in here;--my neighbors shall
 not do me any injustice.
 
 OLAF.  That I have noticed.
 
 THORGJERD.  Then you have been here before?
 
 OLAF.  I chased a hind this summer in here; but when I look
 closely I see 'tis a royal child that has been bewitched.
 
 THORGJERD.  [Looks at him sharply.]  That hunt is dangerous!
 
 OLAF.  For the hunter?
 
 [THORGJERD nods.]
 
 OLAF.  I was sitting and thinking the same thing myself; it seems
 to me that I was bewitched on that hunt.
 
 THORGJERD.  Farewell and good luck to you!
 
 OLAF.  Out upon you!  If you wish a huntsman good luck he will
 never come within shot of the prey.
 
 THORGJERD.  If the shot should strike the hunter himself, the
 best luck that could happen to him would be to have no luck at
 all.
 
 OLAF.  You speak wisely.
 
 THORGJERD.  Yes, yes; there is many a thing to be learned in
 here.
 
 OLAF.  Too true!  I have learned here the best that I know.
 
 THORGJERD.  Farewell!  I'll take greetings from you to your
 kinsmen.
 
 OLAF.  You mean to go down?
 
 THORGJERD.  Such was my purpose.  These are merry days down
 there, I am told.  A mighty knight is celebrating his wedding--
 
 OLAF.  Then you should have been there last night; now I fear the
 best part of the fun is past.
 
 THORGJERD.  I dare say I'll come in time even yet.
 
 OLAF.  Perhaps!  But still you should have been there last night;
 so bright and so warm a festive hall you never have seen before.
 
 THORGJERD.  It was well for him who was within.
 
 OLAF.  I know one who had to stand outside.
 
 THORGJERD.  Yes, yes, outside,--that is the poor man's place.
 
 OLAF.  I know one who had to stand outside and who nevertheless
 was both worse off and better off than those within.
 
 THORGJERD.  I must go down,--I see that clearly; I shall play for
 the guests.  Now I shall fetch my harp, and then--
 
 OLAF.  You are a minstrel?
 
 THORGJERD.  And not among the worst.  Now shall I fetch my harp
 from where it lies hidden near the waterfall; those strings you
 should hear.  With them I sat once on the edge of the bed and
 played the bride out of the festive hall over ridge and
 field.--Have you never heard little Ingrid's lay?  He who could
 play the bride out of the bridegroom's arms can surely play his
 child home to her father again.  Farewell!  If you linger here we
 may meet again when I get down there.
 
 [He goes out to the right by the tarn.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 SCENE III
 
 [OLAF.  ALFHILD.]
 
 OLAF.  Ah, if it were--for certain I cannot doubt it.  Alfhild
 herself said that her father played such music that no one who
 heard it could ever forget.  He mentioned Lady Ingrid who
 disappeared on the eve of her wedding many years ago,--there was
 a young minstrel named Thorgjerd who loved her, so went the
 story.  Many a strange tale was afterwards current about him; at
 times he stood right in the midst of the village and played so
 beautifully that all who heard it had to weep; but no one knew
 where he made his home.  Alfhild--yes, she is his child!  Here
 she has grown up, here in this desolate valley, which no one has
 known of by name for many a year; and Ingrid, who
 disappeared--indeed, he said--
 
 [Becomes aware of ALFHILD.]
 
 OLAF.  Alfhild!  There she is!  In her wedding garments she has
 fled up here.  Here then shall you awaken after the bridal night;
 so sorry a day to you was my day of honor.  You wished to go out
 into life, you said; you wanted to learn to know all the love in
 the world.  So sorry a journey you had, but I swear it shall all
 be well again.  She moves; it is as if she were writhing in
 sorrow and anguish;--when you awaken, it shall be to joy and
 delight!
 
 ALFHILD.  [Still half in dreams.]
 It burns!  Oh, save him,--he is within!
 He must not die!  Life anew he must win!
 
 [She jumps up in fright; the music ceases.]
 
 ALFHILD.  Where am I!  He stands here before me, it seems!
 
 Olaf Liljekrans! save me from my dreams!
 
 OLAF.  Alfhild! take heart, here you need fear no harm!
 
 ALFHILD.  [Moves away, fearfully and apprehensively.]
 You think with sweet words my soul to beguile?
 In your heart there is evil, though with lips you may smile,
 On me you shall nevermore practice your charm!
 
 OLAF.  Alfhild! be calm, do not start;
 'Tis Olaf I am, the friend of your heart!
 Unkind I have been, I have treated you ill;
 But deep in my heart I was faithful to you!
 I was blind and deluded and weak of will,--
 And thus I did wound you far more than I knew!
 O, can you forgive me?  Alfhild, you must,--
 I swear to you I shall be worthy your trust!
 I shall bear you aloft and smooth your way,
 And kiss from your cheek the tears of dole,
 The grief in your heart I shall try to allay,
 And heal the wound that burns in your soul!
 
 ALFHILD.  I know you too well and your cunning disguise.
 Since last I did see you I too have grown wise.
 You would have me believe with your wily speech
 It is you for whom I now suffer and languish.
 You would have me believe it was you that did teach
 Me to revel in joy and to writhe in anguish.
 'Twill profit you little, I know you too well,
 Whether early or late you come to my dell.
 I know you too well; for deceit on your brow
 I can read.  Not so was the other, I vow!
 
 OLAF.  The other?  Whom mean you?
 
 ALFHILD.  He that is dead!
 'Tis therefore I suffer so bitter a dread.
 You don't understand?  You must know there were two;
 And that is why peace I shall nevermore find!
 The one was all love, so good and so true,
 The other was evil, faithless, unkind;
 The one to me came on a late summer day,
 When my heart burst in flower and bloom;
 The other led me in the mountain astray,
 Where all things are shrouded in gloom!
 'Tis the evil one, you, that has come again;
 The other who loved me, so good and so kind,
 The one who will never be out of my mind,--
 Ah, him have I slain!
 
 [She sinks down on a stone near the house and busts into tears.]
 
 OLAF.  Has he stolen your peace, has he robbed you of rest,
 Then why let him longer dwell there in your breast!
 
 ALFHILD.  Alas, were I laid in the grave far below,
 With me, I am sure, my sorrow would go!
 I knew it not then,--to you do I swear,
 I thought it was little for him I did care;
 Now I see I must die of a grief-broken heart,
 Yet his image will never depart!
 
 [A short pause.]
 
 ALFHILD.  Have you chords in your bosom that you can command?
 It seems so; your voice sounds so pleasant and sweet;
 Pleasant--though blended it is with deceit.
 Have you chords in your breast, then go round in the land
 And sing of Alfhild a plaintive lay
 To the village girls you meet on the way:
 
   Only yesterday I was so little a roe,
   I roamed in the green groves around;
   They came to the forest with arrow and bow,
   And chased me with falcon and hound!
 
   Only yesterday I was a bird so forlorn,
   I sat 'neath the linden alone;
   They drove me away from the place I was born,
   And threw at me stone after stone.
 
   Only yesterday I was an untamed dove,
   Which nowhere finds peace or rest;
   They came from below, they came from above,
   And pierced with an arrow my breast!
 
 OLAF.  [Deeply moved.]
   Alas, that I lay in the grave below.
   Lulled in eternal rest!
   Your every word is a steel-made bow
   That strikes with an arrow my breast!
 
 ALFHILD.  [Jumps up with childlike joy.]
 Just so it shall be,--'tis rightfully so!
 Yes, truly, indeed, have you chords in your breast!
 So let it be sung; they easily show
 That you are yourself by my sorrow oppressed.
 They show that your own grief is just as strong
 As the one that you voice in your plaintive song!
 
 [She stops and looks sorrowfully at him.]
 
 ALFHILD.  Yet no,--you shall not sing of Alfhild's lament;
 What stranger is there whom my sorrow will move!
 From whence I came, and whither I went
 There is no one out there who shall question or prove!
 Sing rather of Olaf Liljekrans,
 Who wandered astray in the elf-maidens' dance!
 Sing of Alfhild, the false and unkind,
 Who drove his betrothed quite out of his mind;
 And sing of all the sorrow and fear,
 When dead Olaf Liljekrans lay on the bier.
 Sing of all the weeping below,
 When away they carried the three who had died!
 The one was Olaf, the other his bride!
 The third was his mother who perished of woe.
 
 OLAF.  Yes, Olaf is dead; it is just as you say;
 But I shall be now so faithful a friend;
 Wherever you dwell, wherever you wend,
 From your side I shall nevermore stray!
 May I suffer in full for the sin I committed,--
 Atonement to me shall be sweet.
 'Twill comfort me much if I be permitted
 To roam with you here in some far-off retreat!
 From early dawn till the end of day,
 Like a faithful hound I shall follow your lead!
 I shall clothe my remorse in so plaintive a lay
 Till finally you shall believe me indeed.
 Each moment we spent here in ecstasy
 I shall call up again to your memory!
 Each flower that blooms shall speak it anew,
 The cuckoo and swallow shall sing it to you!
 The trees that grow here in the forest so green
 Shall whisper thereof both soft and serene!
 
 ALFHILD.  Enough!  You would only beguile me anew;
 Far better were it for you now to depart!
 So fair is the falsehood I see within you,
 So faithless the thoughts that dwell in your heart!
 What would you up here?  What is it you want?
 You think that you know the place that you haunt?
 So pleasant a spot was this valley of yore,
 A curse lies upon it forevermore!
 In the past, when lone in the forest I went,
 The leaves on the trees had so fragrant a scent!
 The flowers bloomed forth on my every side,
 When you pressed me to you and called me your bride!
 But now--the whole valley is burned in the night;
 The trees are burned to the left and the right;
 The straw and the leaves are withered away,
 Each flower is turned to a dusty gray!--
 
 ALFHILD.  Yes, clearly I see,--in a single night
 Is the world become old!--When I wandered below
 All alone, and sank down 'neath my shame and my woe,
 Then faded the world and its golden delight.
 All things but deceit have vanished away;
 So much have I learned on my bridal day!
 My father lied; he was wrong when he said
 The dead are borne to the dwelling of God;
 But Olaf knew better the fate of the dead:
 The dead sink below, far under the sod!
 
 ALFHILD.  [She breaks out in deepest agony.]
 Ah, well do I see now you knew what you did;
 For low in the grave my body is hid.
 
 OLAF.  Alfhild!  Your words deal so crushing a blow!
 O, God! was your heart once so young and so bold--
 Forgive me my sin and forget all your woe!
 
 ALFHILD.  [With marked and increasing bewilderment.]
 Hush, do not speak to me!  Olaf, behold!
 A corpse they carry, to the grave they creep;
 But no mother is there, no children who weep,
 No pillows are there of blue or of red,--
 Alfhild on shavings and straw lies dead!
 I shall never ride now to the heaven above,
 And awake in the arms of the God of love.
 No mother have I whose heart will break,
 No one who follows and weeps for my sake;
 No person have I in the world so wide,
 Who weeps for me at the bier,--
 No angels to scatter on every side
 Blue pearls in the heavenly sphere;
 And ne'er shall I reach the dwelling of God,
 Where the dead dream only of mirth!
 
 OLAF.  Alfhild!
 
 ALFHILD.  They lower me under the sod!
 They cover me over with earth!
 And here must I lie with all my dread,
 Must live and suffer although I be dead:
 Must know there is nothing now left for me,
 Yet cannot forget, nor fight myself free;
 Must hear when he whom my love I gave
 Rides off to the church right over my grave;
 Must hear him forever suffer and languish,
 And yet can not lessen his anguish!
 O, how my bosom is filled with despair!
 The angels of God have forgotten my prayer!
 They heed no longer my weeping and woe--
 The portal is closed to the heavenly bliss--
 Dig me up again!  Let me not lie here below!
 
 [She rushes out to the left.]
 
 OLAF.  Alfhild!  Alfhild!  O, Christ, what is this?
 
 [He follows her quickly.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE IV
 
 [INGEBORG and HEMMING enter, after a pause, from the
 right.]
 
 INGEBORG.  Well, here we are up here!  How lovely and bright and
 peaceful it is!
 
 HEMMING.  Yes, here we shall live happily together!
 
 INGEBORG.  But mark you well that you are my servant, and nothing
 else,--until my father has given his consent.
 
 HEMMING.  That he will never do!
 
 INGEBORG.  Never you mind,--we'll find some means or other.--But
 now we must think about choosing a cabin to live in.
 
 HEMMING.  There are plenty of them around here.  Over the whole
 valley there are deserted huts; everything is just the same as it
 was when the last people died in the terrible plague many years
 ago.
 
 INGEBORG.  Here I like it very much!  Over there, too, there is
 just such an old hut; the water is near by, and the forest must
 surely be alive with game.  You can fish and hunt; aye, we shall
 live a wonderful life!
 
 HEMMING.  Yea, forsooth, a wonderful life!  I shall fish and hunt
 the while you gather berries and keep the house in order.
 
 INGEBORG.  Do I?  No, that you must take care of!
 
 HEMMING.  Yes, yes, as you please.  O, a delightful life we shall
 live!
 
 [Stops and adds somewhat dejectedly.]
 
 HEMMING.  But when I stop to think a bit;--I have neither bow nor
 fishing outfit.
 
 INGEBORG.  [Likewise with an expression of despondency.]  And it
 occurs to me there are no servants here who can help me.
 
 HEMMING.  That shall I willingly do!
 
 INGEBORG.  No, thanks.--And all my good clothes--I didn't bring
 anything along except my bridal gown which I am wearing.
 
 HEMMING.  That was thoughtless of you!
 
 INGEBORG.  True enough, Hemming!  And for that reason you shall
 steal down to Guldvik some night and bring me clothes and other
 things as much as I have need of.
 
 HEMMING.  And be hanged as a thief!
 
 INGEBORG.  No, you shall be careful and cautious,--that I warn
 you.  But when finally the long winter comes?  There are no
 people up here,--music and dancing we shall never have--Hemming!
 Shall we stay here or--
 
 HEMMING.  Well, where else is there we can go?
 
 INGEBORG.  [Impatiently.]  Yes, but human beings cannot live
 here!
 
 HEMMING.  Why, surely, they can!
 
 INGEBORG.  Well, you see yourself they are all of them dead!
 Hemming!  I think it best I go home to my father.
 
 HEMMING.  But what will become of me?
 
 INGEBORG.  You shall go to war!
 
 HEMMING.  To war!  And be killed!
 
 INGEBORG.  Not at all!  You shall perform some illustrious deed,
 and then will you be made a knight, and then will my father no
 longer be opposed to you.
 
 HEMMING.  Yes, but what if they kill me in the meantime?
 
 INGEBORG.  Well, we'll have plenty of time to think about that.
 Today and tomorrow we shall have to remain here, I suppose; so
 long will the guests sit in the festive house and celebrate,--if
 they look for us, it will probably be about in the village; up
 here we can be safe and--
 
 [She stops and listens.]
 
 CHORUS.  [Far away off the stage to the right.]
   Away,--away to find
   Alfhild, the false, unkind;
   For all our woe and strife
   She must pay with her life!
 
 HEMMING.  Ingeborg!  Ingeborg!  They are after us!
 
 INGEBORG.  Where shall we find refuge?
 
 HEMMING.  Well, how can I know--
 
 INGEBORG.  Go into the hut; lock the door so that it can be
 bolted from within.
 
 HEMMING.  Yes, but--
 
 INGEBORG.  Do as I say!  I shall go up on the hill the meanwhile
 and see if they are far away.
 
 [She goes out to the right.]
 
 HEMMING.  Yes, yes!  Alas, if only they don't get us!
 
 [He goes into the house.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE V
 
 [OLAF comes from the forest to the left.  Immediately
 afterwards INGEBORG from the right.]
 
 OLAF.  [Looks about and calls softly.]  Alfhild!  Alfhild!  She
 is nowhere to be seen!  Like a bird she disappeared from my view
 into the wood and I--
 
 INGEBORG.  They are right close and--
 
 [Stops, frightened.]
 
 INGEBORG.  Olaf Liljekrans!
 
 OLAF.  Ingeborg!
 
 HEMMING.  [Sticks his head out of the door and spies OLAF.]
 Lord Olaf!  So!  Now is it surely all up with me!
 
 [Withdraws hastily.]
 
 INGEBORG.  [Aside.]  He must have ridden in advance of the rest.
 
 OLAF.  [Aside.]  She must have come up here with her father to
 look for me.
 
 INGEBORG.  [Aside.]  But I will not go with him!
 
 OLAF.  [Aside.]  I will not stir from here!
 
 INGEBORG.  [Aloud, as she draws nearer.]  Olaf Liljekrans!  Now
 you have me; but you will do ill if you try to compel me.
 
 OLAF.  That is furthest from my mind!
 
 INGEBORG.  Why then come you here in company with my kinsmen?
 
 OLAF.  Do I?  On the contrary, it is you who--
 
 INGEBORG.  That invention won't fool me; only a moment ago I saw
 the whole crowd--
 
 OLAF.  Who?  Who?
 
 INGEBORG.  My father and our relatives!
 
 OLAF.  Up here?
 
 INGEBORG.  Why, yes, right close at hand!
 
 OLAF.  Ah, then is my mother with them.
 
 INGEBORG.  Of course, she is with them.  But how can that
 frighten you?
 
 OLAF.  You see,--it is I they seek!
 
 INGEBORG.  No, it is I!
 
 OLAF.  [Astonished.]  You!
 
 INGEBORG.  [Begins to grasp the connection.]  Or--wait a
 moment--Ha, ha, ha!  What an idea!  Come, shall we two be honest
 with each other?
 
 OLAF.  Yes, that is exactly what I had in mind!
 
 INGEBORG.  Well, then, tell me, at what hour came you up here?
 
 OLAF.  During the night!
 
 INGEBORG.  I, too!
 
 OLAF.  You!
 
 INGEBORG.  Yes, yes!  And you went away without any one's knowing
 it?
 
 OLAF.  Yes!
 
 INGEBORG.  I, too!
 
 OLAF.  But tell me--
 
 INGEBORG.  Hush, we have only a moment or two!  And you fled up
 here because you had but little desire to go to the altar with
 me?
 
 OLAF.  Aye, how can you think--
 
 INGEBORG.  Yes, that I can easily think.  Answer me now; we were
 to speak honestly.
 
 OLAF.  Well, then, it was therefore that I--
 
 INGEBORG.  Well and good, I did likewise!
 
 OLAF.  You, Ingeborg!
 
 INGEBORG.  And now you would rather not have any one come upon
 your tracks?
 
 OLAF.  Well, it can't be denied!
 
 INGEBORG.  I, too!  Aha,--'tis a jolly coincidence; I fled from
 you, and you from me!  We both fled up here, and now just as our
 relatives are after us we meet again!  Listen, Olaf Liljekrans!
 Say we promise not to betray one another!
 
 OLAF.  I promise.
 
 INGEBORG.  But now we must part!
 
 OLAF.  I understand!
 
 INGEBORG.  For, if they found us together, then--
 
 OLAF.  Yes, then it would be still more difficult for you to be
 rid of me!
 
 INGEBORG.  Farewell!  If ever I come to have a wedding you shall
 be my bride's man.
 
 OLAF.  And if anything like that should happen to me, you will, I
 am sure, accommodate me in the same way.
 
 INGEBORG.  Of course!  Farewell!  Farewell!  And do not think
 unkindly of me.
 
 OLAF.  Indeed not; I shall give you my hand wherever we meet!
 
 INGEBORG.  I, too!  Wherever we meet--only not at the altar.
 
 [She goes into the house.  OLAF goes into the forest on the right
 at the back.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE VI
 
 [LADY KIRSTEN, ARNE of Guldvik, WEDDING GUESTS,
 PEASANTS and SERVANTS from the right.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  See, here will we begin the hunt.  Our people must
 spread about and search all around the tarn;--she shall come
 forth and then--woe upon her! no mercy or pity is there in my
 soul.
 
 ARNE.  What will you do then?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Hold judgment upon her--right on the spot where
 she is found!  All the damage she has done on my dominions I have
 power and authority to punish in accordance with reason and
 justice.
 
 ARNE.  Yes, but what good is that?  What is lost can not thereby
 be won back again.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  No, but I shall get revenge, and that is no little
 gain.  Revenge,--revenge I must have, if I am to bear and live
 down my loss and all the shame she has brought upon me.  The
 storm last night ruined the whole of my year's crop; not a single
 uninjured straw is left in my fields; and in here, where she
 herself has said she has her home, here everything thrives and
 blossoms more luxuriantly than I have ever seen!  Is not that the
 operation of secret arts?  Olaf she has snared so securely in her
 devilish net that he fled out of the village in the wildest storm
 to follow her.  My house she burned clear to the ground; all the
 openings and doors she barred on the outside;--it was a miracle
 of God that the servants brought their timely help!
 
 ARNE.  Alas, alas; I am afraid if has cost two lives that I
 thought much of,--Ingeborg and my man Hemming!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Come, come, Lord Arne!  You must not completely
 despair of them yet.  Ingeborg may have escaped after all; the
 rest of us came out of it untouched in spite of the cunning of
 the cursed witch;--Ingeborg has been bewildered with fright and
 has sought refuge somewhere.
 
 ARNE.  Yes, yes, that may be the case with Ingeborg; but Hemming
 is past all hope,--of that I am sure!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  How so?
 
 ARNE.  O, he had become such a sly and contriving devil of late!
 He has let himself be shut in and burnt merely to get revenge
 over me; he knows I can't get along for a single day without him.
 O, I know him!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Well, however it is, Alfhild we must capture; she
 shall be tried, condemned, and punished; I have misdeeds a plenty
 to charge her with.
 
 ARNE.  And I can mention a few in case it is necessary; she has
 stolen my dapple-gray horse from the stable; this morning it was
 gone with saddle and bridle.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aside.]  Ingeborg and Hemming gone, and his horse
 likewise; were I in his place I should know what to think.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aloud.]  Now let us divide and go about in small
 groups; he who first gets his eye on Alfhild shall blow the
 trumpet or horn; let the rest listen and follow the sound till we
 are assembled again.
 
 [They go out at different sides.]
 
 ARNE.  [Who alone has remained.]  And I, who am not acquainted
 here,--how am I to find my way.
 
 ARNE.  [Calls.]  Hemming!  Hemming!
 
 [Stops.]
 
 ARNE.  I forgot,--he is--
 
 ARNE.  [Shaking his head.]  Hm!  It was a shameful trick he
 played.
 
 [He goes out to the right.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE VII
 
 [ALFHILD appears near the tarn to the left; she
 carries a little bundle.]
 
 ALFHILD.  I have wailed, I have wept, till my heart is sore;
 I am weary and tired, I can weep no more!
 
 [Sinks down on a stone in the foreground.]
 
 ALFHILD.  First to my father farewell I shall say!
 Then into the mountains I make my way!
 Down here I see Olaf wherever I go;
 I must up in the heights to steel my mind!
 I must deaden my grief, forget what I know,
 And leave all the memories dear behind!
 
 ALFHILD.  The life in my dream had so rosy a hue!
 'Tis nothing but fiction, nothing is true,--
 'Tis nothing but nonsense and shifting lies;
 Naught can be seized and held in the hand.
 Naught must be looked at with open eyes,
 Nothing stands proof when we understand!
 
 [The sound of trumpets is heard from the wood.]
 
 ALFHILD.  My mother's heirlooms I take with me;
 I shall bury them deep in the ground!
 I shall bury them deep 'neath the tall birch tree,
 Over yonder where Olaf I found!
 
 [She opens her bundle and takes out a bridal crown and other
 ornaments.]
 
 ALFHILD.  This crown did my mother once wear on her head;
 She too by the world then was tricked and misled,
 She too then in love and its power believed.
 Was she too so rudely deceived?
 Was it only in jest that my father did sing
 The pleasures that gladden the human breast?
 Ah, then he should never have said anything;
 His songs have robbed me of earthly rest;
 His songs built a home for the ecstasies
 Of life in my heart,--now in ruin it lies!
 
 [The trumpets are heard again.]
 
 ALFHILD.  Silver indeed is a metal of worth,
 'Twill never crumble like autumn hay.
 Were it hid for a thousand years in the earth,
 It would still glitter bright, it would never decay!
 The pleasures of life are like autumn hay,
 And sorrow like silver that glitters alway!
 
 [Ties the ornaments together in the bundle.]
 
 ALFHILD.  A magic treasure I often recall,
 From which dropped nine glorious pearls every night;
 But no matter how many the pearls it let fall,
 The treasure remained just as big and as bright!
 
 ALFHILD.  A treasure of magic, this sorrow of mine,
 And from it shall drip by night and by day,
 Not nine,--but ten thousand pearls that shine,--
 Yet the treasure shall never decay!--
 Yes, the world has made me so wise,--so wise!
 Once I followed the clouds in their flight,
 Flew dreaming with them on their path in the skies,
 And called them the swans of the light!
 I thought that the trees spread their branches so wide,
 That I might walk in the shade;
 I thought there was life in the mountain side.
 A sorry mistake I have made.
 Now I know better;--for man alone
 Can revel in joy, can suffer despair.
 In tree and in flower, friend there is none,--
 My sorrow alone I must bear.
 
 [She rises.]
 
 ALFHILD.  Away then!  Up midst the ice and the snow,--
 The grave is the only shelter below!
 
 [She starts to leave.]
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE VIII
 
 [ALFHILD, LADY KIRSTEN, ARNE, WEDDING GUESTS, PEASANTS
 and SERVANTS from various sides.  Later OLAF
 LILJEKRANS.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  There she is!  Stand still, Alfhild!  Do not try
 to escape,--else we shall shoot you.
 
 ALFHILD.  What do you want of me?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  That you shall learn soon enough.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Points to her bundle.]  What is this you are
 carrying?
 
 ALFHILD.  My mother's treasures!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Give it here!  See, see!  A crown of silver!
 Indeed, Alfhild!  If you are your mother's only daughter I am
 very much afraid the bridal crown will nevermore be needed in her
 family.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [To the Servants.]  Bind her!  She stands there
 and pretends to be sad; no one can know what she is scheming.
 
 [ALFHILD is bound.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aloud and with suppressed passion.]  The court is
 ready.  As you all know, I have a legal and prescriptive right to
 protect my dominions, to pass judgment in accordance with the law
 of the realm on every one who does me harm on my own lands.  This
 is what you, Alfhild, have presumed to do, and it is therefore
 that you now stand here accused before your judge.  Defend
 yourself if you can, but do not forget it is a matter of life and
 death.
 
 ARNE.  But listen, Lady Kirsten!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Excuse me, Lord Arne!  I am within my rights here,
 and I intend to insist on them.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [To ALFHILD.]  Come forward and answer me!
 
 ALFHILD.  Do you but question me,--I shall answer!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Many and grievous are the charges that are
 directed against you.  First and foremost I charge you here with
 having beguiled my son, Olaf Liljekrans, with your unholy arts,
 so that he turned heart and soul away from his betrothed to whom
 he was pledged,--so that he, sick in heart, never at any time
 found peace in his home, but came up here to this unknown valley
 where you have had your home.  All this could not have happened
 in any ordinary way; you are therefore accused of
 witchcraft,--defend yourself if you can.
 
 ALFHILD.  I have little to say in answer to this.  Witchcraft you
 call that strange power that drew Olaf up here.  Perhaps you are
 right; but this witchcraft was not of evil;--every hour that Olaf
 has been here God must surely have witnessed!  Each thought that
 I have had of Olaf the angels of God must have known!  And they
 had no occasion to blush.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Enough, enough!  You would add blasphemy to your
 transgression!  Woe upon you, Alfhild!  Your every word only adds
 weight to the scales.  Yet, that is your affair!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [To the rest.]  I crave you all as witnesses to
 her answer.
 
 [Turns to ALFHILD.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  I charge you next with having again, this very
 night, with the aid of these same secret powers, met Olaf up
 here, and furthermore that you keep him concealed in here!
 
 ALFHILD.  There you are right!  Secretly is he hidden here!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  You admit it?
 
 ALFHILD.  Yes, but however powerful you are, you will never be
 able to set him free.  Perhaps it would be best for me if you
 were able; but neither you nor the whole wide world have the
 power to set him free!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [In a violent outburst.]  Now death will certainly
 be your punishment!  Out with it,--where have you got him?
 
 ALFHILD.  [Presses her hands to her bosom.]  In here--in my
 heart!  If you can tear him out from it you can practice
 witchcraft better than I!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  That answer is nothing.  Out with it,--where is
 he?
 
 ALFHILD.  I have answered!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [With repressed irritation.]  Good!
 
 ARNE.  [To the spectators.]  Were Hemming alive he would have
 been able to get the truth out of her; he had become so crafty of
 late.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Now the third charge against you: last night you
 set fire to my house and burned it clear to the ground.  Perhaps
 human life has been lost,--that we not know as yet,--but whether
 or no, it will neither harm nor help your cause; for your
 intention to burn all of us is as clear as day.  Do you deny my
 charge that you set fire to my home last night?
 
 ALFHILD.  I do not deny it; I have destroyed your house!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  And how will you extenuate your action?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [With bitter mockery.]  You shall not be able to
 say that you acted over hastily.  Good opportunity you had, so
 far as I can remember, to stop and consider; you stood outside
 there, no one came near you, no one prevented you from
 deliberating as calmly as you could.  Nor shall you say that the
 merriment of the festive occasion went to your head, nor that the
 wine distracted you; for you were not on the inside at all; you
 stood on the outside, and it was cool enough there,--the biting
 wind should have made you sober.
 
 ALFHILD.  Yes, I destroyed your house last night; but you and
 Olaf and all the rest of you out there have done me a greater
 wrong.  The world was to me a festive hall which belonged to the
 Great Father.  The blue heaven was its roof, the stars were the
 lamps that shone from its ceiling.  I wandered happy and rich in
 all this; but you, you threw a brand right in the midst of this
 golden splendor; now is everything withered and dead!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Such talk will profit you little!  Still once more
 I ask, where is Olaf Liljekrans, my son?
 
 ALFHILD.  I have answered!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Then you have also passed your own sentence, and I
 shall confirm it.
 
 [OLAF appears on the rocky cliff among the trees, unnoticed by
 the rest.]
 
 OLAF.  [Aside.]  Alfhild!  God help me!  What is that?
 
 [Withdraws unseen.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  You have, in accordance with the law of the land,
 incurred the penalty of death as guilty of witchcraft and arson.
 This sentence is herewith pronounced upon you, and forthwith
 right here on the spot it shall be executed.
 
 ARNE.  But listen, Lady Kirsten!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Judgment is pronounced!  Alfhild shall die!
 
 ALFHILD.  Do as you please; little shall I be of hindrance to
 you.  When Olaf denied his love, then ceased my life,--I live no
 longer.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Take her up on the rocky ledge over there.
 
 [Two Servants take ALFHILD up.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  For the last time, Alfhild!  Give me back my son!
 
 ALFHILD.  I will answer no more!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Just as you please!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [To the Servants.]  Cast her down!  No, wait!  I
 have an idea!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [To ALFHILD.]  As you stand there, I remember you
 again as you yesterday came forward with the golden crown and
 thought you were worthy to be Olaf Liljekrans' bride.  Now we
 soon shall see how much you are worth; there are present here
 peasants and servants and many humble men;--perhaps your life can
 still be saved!  Yes, Alfhild!  You stare at me, but so it is; I
 will be merciful to you!
 
                 LADY KIRSTEN
                 (Turns to the rest.)
 You all know the old custom, that when a woman is sentenced to
 death for a capital offence, as she is, her life will be saved
 and she will be free if an irreproachable man comes forth and
 upholds her innocence and declares himself ready and willing to
 marry her.  That custom you know?
 
 ALL.  Yes, yes!
 
 ALFHILD.  [Bursting into tears.]  O, to be mocked,--mocked so
 terribly in my last hour!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Well then, Alfhild!  This custom you shall have
 the benefit of.  If the most humble man in my company comes forth
 and declares himself willing to marry you, then are you free.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Looks about.]  Is there no one who applies?
 
 [All are silent.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Give her the silver crown; that shall go in the
 bargain; perhaps, Alfhild, you will then rise in value!
 
 [The crown is placed on ALFHILD's head.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  For the second time I ask,--is any one willing to
 save her?
 
 [She looks about.  All are silent.]
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Now for it; I am afraid your moments are numbered.
 Hear me well, you servants up there!  Should no one answer my
 third call, then do you watch for a sign from me and cast her
 into the lake!  Use now your arts, Alfhild!  See if you can
 conjure yourself free from death.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [With a loud voice.]  For the last time!  There
 stands the witch and incendiary!  Who will save and marry her?
 
 [She looks about.  All are silent.--LADY KIRSTEN raises her hand
 quickly as a signal, the Servants seize ALFHILD; in the same
 moment OLAF rushes out on the ledge in full wedding garb.]
 
 OLAF.  I will save and marry her!
 
 [He thrusts the SERVANTS aside and unbinds her.  ALFHILD sinks
 with a cry on his bosom; he puts his left arm around her and
 raises his right arm threateningly in the air.]
 
 ALL.  [Stand as if turned to stone.]  Olaf Liljekrans!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Olaf Liljekrans, my son!  What have you done?
 Disgraced yourself for all time!
 
 OLAF.  No, I blot out the shame and disgrace which I brought on
 myself by my treatment of her!  My sin I shall expiate and make
 myself happy the while!
 
 OLAF.  [Brings ALFHILD forward.]  Yes, before all of you I
 solemnly proclaim this young woman my bride!  She is innocent of
 all that has been charged against her; I only have transgressed.
 
 [Kneels before her.]
 
 OLAF.  And at your feet I beg you to forget and forgive--
 
 ALFHILD.  [Raises him.]  Ah, Olaf!  You have given me back all
 the glory of the world!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  You will marry her!  Well and good; then am I no
 longer a mother to you!
 
 OLAF.  You will cause me great sorrow, although it is now long
 since that you were a real mother to me.  You used me merely to
 build aloft your own pride, and I was weak and acquiesced.  But
 now have I won power and will; now I stand firmly on my own feet
 and lay the foundation of my own happiness!
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  But do you stop to consider--
 
 OLAF.  Nothing will I now consider,--I know what I want.  Now
 first I understand my strange dream.  It was prophesied of me
 that I was to find the fairest of flowers,--that I was to tear it
 asunder and strew it to all the winds.  O, thus it has happened!
 A woman's heart is the fairest flower in the world; all its rich
 and golden leaves I have torn asunder and scattered to the winds.
 But be of good cheer, my Alfhild!  Many a seed has gone too, and
 sorrow has ripened it, and from it shall grow a rich life for us
 here in the valley; for here shall we live and be happy!
 
 ALFHILD.  O, now I am happy as in the first hour we met.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aside.]  Ingeborg is gone; this rich valley
 belongs to Alfhild,--no one else has a claim to it--
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  [Aloud.]  Well, Olaf!  I shall not stand in the
 way of your happiness.  If you think you will find it in this
 way, then--well, then you have my consent!
 
 OLAF.  Thanks, mother, thanks!  Now I lack nothing more!
 
 ALFHILD.  [To LADY KIRSTEN.]  And me you forgive all my sin?
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  Yes, yes!  Perhaps I too was wrong,--let us not
 say any more of that!
 
 ARNE.  But I, then?  And my daughter, whom Olaf had pledged--Yet,
 it is true, perhaps she is no longer alive!
 
 OLAF.  Of course she's alive!
 
 ARNE.  She lives!  Where is she?  Where?
 
 OLAF.  That I can not say; but I may say that we both in all
 friendliness have broken our pledge.
 
 LADY KIRSTEN.  You see, Lord Arne! that I--
 
 ARNE.  Well, my daughter shall not be forced upon any one.
 Alfhild was fated to marry a knight; the same may happen to
 Ingeborg.
 
 ARNE.  [With dignity.]  Noble lords and honorable men, hear me!
 It has come to my ear that many of you hold me to be little
 skilled in courtly manners and customs.  I will show you now you
 are completely mistaken.  In the old chronicles it is frequently
 told that when a noble king loses his daughter he promises her
 hand and half his kingdom to him who may find her; he who finds
 Ingeborg shall receive her hand in marriage and in addition half
 of all that I own and possess.  Are you with me on that?
 
 THE YOUNG MEN.  Yes, yes!
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE IX
 
 [The Preceding.  INGEBORG comes hurriedly out of the
 hut and pulls HEMMING behind her.]
 
 INGEBORG.  Here I am!  Hemming has found me!
 
 ALL.  [ASTONISHED]  Ingeborg and Hemming!  Up here!
 
 ARNE.  [Irritated.]  Ah, then shall--
 
 INGEBORG.  [Throws herself about his neck.]  O father, father!
 It will not avail you; you have given your word!
 
 ARNE.  But that did not apply to him!  Now I see it all right; he
 has taken you away himself.
 
 INGEBORG.  No, to the contrary, father!  It was I who took him
 away!
 
 ARNE.  [Frightened.]  Will you be silent with such words!  Are
 you out of your head?
 
 INGEBORG.  [Softly.]  Then say "yes" right here on the spot!
 Otherwise I shall proclaim to all people that it was I who--
 
 ARNE.  Hush, hush!  I am saying "yes"!
 
 [Steps between them and looks sternly at HEMMING.]
 
 ARNE.  It was you then who stole my dapple-gray horse with saddle
 and bridle?
 
 HEMMING.  Alas, Lord Arne!--
 
 ARNE.  O Hemming!  Hemming!  You are a--
 
 [Stops to consider.]
 
 ARNE.  Well, you are my daughter's betrothed; let it all be
 forgotten.
 
 HEMMING AND INGEBORG.  O, thanks, thanks!
 
                 *       *       *       *       *
 
 
 
 SCENE X
 
 [The Preceding.  THORGJERD with a harp in his hand has
 during the foregoing mingled with the people.]
 
 THORGJERD.  Aye, see, see!  A multitude of people in the valley
 today!
 
 THE PEASANTS.  Thorgjerd, the fiddler!
 
 ALFHILD.  [Throws herself in his arms.]  My father!
 
 ALL.  Her father!
 
 OLAF.  Yes, yes, old man!  There are people and merriment in here
 today, and hereafter it shall always be thus.  It is your
 daughter's wedding we are celebrating; for love has she chosen
 her betrothed, of love have you sung for her,--you will not stand
 in our way!
 
 THORGJERD.  May all good spirits guard you well!
 
 ALFHILD.  And you will remain with us!
 
 THORGJERD.  No, no, Alfhild!
 A minstrel has never a place to rest,
 His soul fares afar, he forever must roam!
 For he who has music deep down in his breast,
 Is never in mountains or lowlands at home;
 In the meadows green, in the sheltering bower,
 He must touch the strings and sing every hour,
 He must watch for the life that lives in the shower,
 Beneath the wild fjord, in the rushing stream,
 Must watch for the life that beats in the soul,
 And clothe in music what people but dream,
 And give voice to its sorrow and dole!
 
 OLAF.  But sometime you will surely visit us here!
 Now shall 'mid the birches a hall be erected;
 Here, my Alfhild! shall you be protected.
 I and my love will always be near,
 No more shall your eye be dimmed with a tear!
 
 ALFHILD.  Yes, now I see,--life is precious and kind!
 Rich as the fairest dream of the mind!
 So dreary and black is never our sorrow,--
 'Tis followed sometime by a bright sunny morrow!
 
 ALFHILD.  [Kneels.]  O angels of God! you have led me aright,
 Again you have granted me solace and bliss!
 You guided my wandering past the abyss,
 You steadied my foot that was weak and slight!
 O, if with my mind I cannot understand,--
 With my heart I'll believe to the last!
 Yes, heavenly powers!  You still watch o'er the land!
 Clear is the sun when the dark storm is passed;--
 From death and destruction my love did you save:
 So now then let happen what may!
 For now I am cheerful, now am I brave,
 Ready for life and its motley affray!
 
 ALFHILD.  [With a glance at OLAF.]  And when we at length--
 
 [She pauses and stretches her arms above her head.]
 
 ALFHILD.  by the angels of love
 Are borne to our home in the heavens above!
 
 [The rest have formed a group around her; the curtain falls.]

 LITTLE EYOLF
 
 By Henrik Ibsen
 
 Translated, With an Introduction, by William Archer
 
 
 
 
 INTRODUCTION.
 
 Little Eyolf was written in Christiania during 1894, and published
 in Copenhagen on December 11 in that year. By this time Ibsen's
 correspondence has become so scanty as to afford us no clue to what may
 be called the biographical antecedents of the play. Even of anecdotic
 history very little attaches to it. For only one of the characters has a
 definite model been suggested. Ibsen himself told his French translator,
 Count Prozor, that the original of the Rat-Wife was "a little old woman
 who came to kill rats at the school where he was educated. She carried
 a little dog in a bag, and it was said that children had been drowned
 through following her." This means that Ibsen did not himself adapt
 to his uses the legend so familiar to us in Browning's _Pied Piper of
 Hamelin_, but found it ready adapted by the popular imagination of his
 native place, Skien. "This idea," Ibsen continued to Count Prozor, "was
 just what I wanted for bringing about the disappearance of Little Eyolf,
 in whom the infatuation [Note: The French word used by Count Prozor is
 "infatuation." I can think of no other rendering for it; but I do not
 quite know what it means as applied to Allmers and Eyolf.] and the
 feebleness of his father reproduced, but concentrated, exaggerated, as
 one often sees them in the son of such a father." Dr. Elias tells us
 that a well-known lady-artist, who in middle life suggested to him the
 figure of Lona Hessel, was in later years the model for the Rat-Wife.
 There is no inconsistency between these two accounts of the matter. The
 idea was doubtless suggested by his recollection of the rat-catcher of
 Skien, while traits of manner and physiognomy might be borrowed from the
 lady in question.
 
 The verse quoted on pp. 52 and 53 [Transcriber's Note: "There stood the
 champagne," etc., in ACT I] is the last line of a very well-known poem
 by Johan Sebastian Welhaven, entitled _Republikanerne_, written in 1839.
 An unknown guest in a Paris restaurant has been challenged by a noisy
 party of young Frenchmen to join them in drinking a health to Poland. He
 refuses; they denounce him as a craven and a slave; he bares his breast
 and shows the scars of wounds received in fighting for the country whose
 lost cause has become a subject for conventional enthusiasm and windy
 rhetoric.
 
    "De saae pas hverandre. Han vandred sin vei.
     De havde champagne, men roerte den ei."
 
 "They looked at each other. He went on his way. There stood their
 champagne, but they did not touch it." The champagne incident leads me
 to wonder whether the relation between Rita and Allmers may not have
 been partly suggested to Ibsen by the relation between Charlotte
 Stieglitz and her weakling of a husband. Their story must have been
 known to him through George Brandes's _Young Germany_, if not more
 directly. "From time to time," says Dr. Brandes, "there came over her
 what she calls her champagne-mood; she grieves that this is no longer
 the case with him." [Note: _Main Currents of Nineteenth Century
 Literature_, vol. vi. p. 299] Did the germ of the incident lie in these
 words?
 
 The first performance of the play in Norway took place at the
 Christiania Theatre on January 15, 1895, Fru Wettergren playing Rita And
 Fru Dybwad, Asta. In Copenhagen (March 13, 1895) Fru Oda Nielsen and Fru
 Hennings played Rita and Asta respectively, while Emil Poulsen played
 Allmers. The first German Rita (Deutsches Theater, Berlin, January 12,
 1895) was Frau Agnes Sorma, with Reicher as Allmers. Six weeks later
 Frl. Sandrock played Rita at the Burgtheater, Vienna. In May 1895 the
 play was acted by M. Lugne-Poe's company in Paris. The first performance
 in English took place at the Avenue Theatre, London, on the afternoon
 of November 23, 1896, with Miss Janet Achurch as Rita, Miss Elizabeth
 Robins as Asta, and Mrs. Patrick Campbell as the Rat-Wife. Miss
 Achurch's Rita made a profound impression. Mrs. Patrick Campbell
 afterwards played the part in a short series of evening performances.
 In the spring of 1895 the play was acted in Chicago by a company of
 Scandinavian amateurs, presumably in Norwegian. Fru Oda Nielsen has
 recently (I understand) given some performances of it in New York, and
 Madame Alla Nazimova has announced it for production during the coming
 season (1907-1908).
 
 As the external history of _Little Eyolf_ is so short. I am tempted to
 depart from my usual practice, and say a few words as to its matter and
 meaning.
 
 George Brandes, writing of this play, has rightly observed that "a kind
 of dualism has always been perceptible in Ibsen; he pleads the cause of
 Nature, and he castigates Nature with mystic morality; only sometimes
 Nature is allowed the first voice, sometimes morality. In _The Master
 Builder_ and in _Ghosts_ the lover of Nature in Ibsen was predominant;
 here, as in _Brand_ and _The Wild Duck_, the castigator is in the
 ascendant." So clearly is this the case in _Little Eyolf_ that Ibsen
 seems almost to fall into line with Mr. Thomas Hardy. To say nothing of
 analogies of detail between _Little Eyolf_ and _Jude the Obscure_, there
 is this radical analogy, that they are both utterances of a profound
 pessimism, both indictments of Nature.
 
 But while Mr. Hardy's pessimism is plaintive and passive, Ibsen's is
 stoical and almost bracing. It is true that in this play he is no
 longer the mere "indignation pessimist" whom Dr. Brandes quite justly
 recognised in his earlier works. His analysis has gone deeper into the
 heart of things, and he has put off the satirist and the iconoclast. But
 there is in his thought an incompressible energy of revolt. A pessimist
 in contemplation, he remains a meliorist in action. He is not, like Mr.
 Hardy, content to let the flag droop half-mast high; his protagonist
 still runs it up to the mast-head, and looks forward steadily to the
 "heavy day of work" before him. But although the note of the conclusion
 is resolute, almost serene, the play remains none the less an indictment
 of Nature, or at least of that egoism of passion which is one of her
 most potent subtleties. In this view, Allmers becomes a type of what
 we may roughly call the "free moral agent"; Eyolf, a type of humanity
 conceived as passive and suffering, thrust will-less into existence,
 with boundless aspirations and cruelly limited powers; Rita, a type of
 the egoistic instinct which is "a consuming fire"; and Asta, a type of
 the beneficent love which is possible only so long as it is exempt from
 "the law of change." Allmers, then, is self-conscious egoism, egoism
 which can now and then break its chains, look in its own visage, realise
 and shrink from itself; while Rita, until she has passed through
 the awful crisis which forms the matter of the play, is unconscious,
 reckless, and ruthless egoism, exigent and jealous, "holding to its
 rights," and incapable even of rising into the secondary stage of
 maternal love. The offspring and the victim of these egoisms is Eyolf,
 "little wounded warrior," who longs to scale the heights and dive into
 the depths, but must remain for ever chained to the crutch of human
 infirmity. For years Allmers has been a restless and half-reluctant
 slave to Rita's imperious temperament. He has dreamed and theorised
 about "responsibility," and has kept Eyolf poring over his books, in the
 hope that, despite his misfortune, he may one day minister to parental
 vanity. Finally he breaks away from Rita, for the first time "in all
 these ten years," goes up "into the infinite solitudes," looks Death in
 the face, and returns shrinking from passion, yearning towards selfless
 love, and filled with a profound and remorseful pity for the lot of poor
 maimed humanity. He will "help Eyolf to bring his desires into harmony
 with what lies attainable before him." He will "create a conscious
 happiness in his mind." And here the drama opens.
 
 Before the Rat-Wife enters, let me pause for a moment to point out that
 here again Ibsen adopts that characteristic method which, in writing of
 _The Lady from the Sea_ and _The Master Builder_, I have compared to
 the method of Hawthorne. The story he tells is not really, or rather not
 inevitably, supernatural. Everything is explicable within this limits
 of nature; but supernatural agency is also vaguely suggested, and the
 reader's imagination is stimulated, without any absolute violence to his
 sense of reality. On the plane of everyday life, then, the Rat-Wife is a
 crazy and uncanny old woman, fabled by the peasants to be a were-wolf in
 her leisure moments, who goes about the country killing vermin. Coming
 across an impressionable child, she tells him a preposterous tale,
 adapted from the old "Pied Piper" legends, of her method of fascinating
 her victims. The child, whose imagination has long dwelt on this
 personage, is in fact hypnotised by her, follows her down to the sea,
 and, watching her row away, turns dizzy, falls in, and is drowned. There
 is nothing impossible, nothing even improbable, in this. At the same
 time, there cannot be the least doubt, I think, that in the poet's mind
 the Rat-Wife is the symbol of Death, of the "still, soft darkness" that
 is at once so fearful and so fascinating to humanity. This is clear not
 only in the text of her single scene, but in the fact that Allmers, in
 the last act, treats her and his "fellow-traveller" of that night among
 the mountains, not precisely as identical, but as interchangeable,
 ideas. To tell the truth, I have even my own suspicions as to who is
 meant by "her sweetheart," whom she "lured" long ago, and who is now
 "down where all the rats are." This theory I shall keep to myself; it
 may be purely fantastic, and is at best inessential. What is certain is
 that death carries off Little Eyolf, and that, of all he was, only the
 crutch is left, mute witness to his hapless lot.
 
 He is gone; there was so little to bind him to life that he made not
 even a moment's struggle against the allurement of the "long, sweet
 sleep." Then, for the first time, the depth of the egoism which had
 created and conditioned his little life bursts upon his parents'
 horror-stricken gaze. Like accomplices in crime, they turn upon and
 accuse each other--"sorrow makes them wicked and hateful." Allmers, as
 the one whose eyes were already half opened, is the first to carry war
 into the enemy's country; but Rita is not slow to retort, and presently
 they both have to admit that their recriminations are only a vain
 attempt to drown the voice of self-reproach. In a sort of fierce frenzy
 they tear away veil after veil from their souls, until they realise that
 Eyolf never existed at all, so to speak, for his own sake, but only for
 the sake of their passions and vanities. "Isn't it curious," says Rita,
 summing up the matter, "that we should grieve like this over a little
 stranger boy?"
 
 In blind self-absorption they have played with life and death, and now
 "the great open eyes" of the stranger boy will be for ever upon them.
 Allmers would fain take refuge in a love untainted by the egoism, and
 unexposed to the revulsions, of passion. But not only is Asta's pity
 for Rita too strong to let her countenance this desertion: she has
 discovered that her relation to Allmers is _not_ "exempt from the law of
 change," and she "takes flight from him--and from herself." Meanwhile
 it appears that the agony which Allmers and Rita have endured in
 probing their wounds has been, as Halvard Solness would say, "salutary
 self-torture." The consuming fire of passion is now quenched, but "it,
 has left an empty place within them," and they feel it common need "to
 fill it up with something that is a little like love." They come to
 remember that there are other children in the world on whom reckless
 instinct has thrust the gift, of life--neglected children, stunted and
 maimed in mind if not in body. And now that her egoism is seared to the
 quick, the mother-instinct asserts itself in Rita. She will take these
 children to her--these children to whom her hand and her heart have
 hitherto been closed. They shall be outwardly in Eyolf's place, and
 perhaps in time they may fill the place in her heart that should have
 been Eyolf's. Thus she will try to "make her peace with the great open
 eyes." For now, at last, she has divined the secret of the unwritten
 book on "human responsibility" and has realised that motherhood
 means--atonement.
 
 So I read this terrible and beautiful work of art. This, I think, is _a_
 meaning inherent in it--not perhaps _the_ meaning, and still less all
 the meanings. Indeed, its peculiar fascination for me, among all Ibsen's
 works, lies in the fact that it seems to touch life at so many different
 points. But I must not be understood as implying that Ibsen constructed
 the play with any such definitely allegoric design as is here set forth.
 I do not believe that this creator of men and women ever started from an
 abstract conception. He did not first compose his philosophic tune and
 then set his puppets dancing to it. The germ in his mind was dramatic,
 not ethical; it was only as the drama developed that its meanings dawned
 upon him; and he left them implicit and fragmentary, like the symbolism
 of life itself, seldom formulated, never worked out with schematic
 precision. He simply took a cutting from the tree of life, and, planting
 it in the rich soil of his imagination, let it ramify and burgeon as it
 would.
 
 Even if one did not know the date of _Little Eyolf_, one could
 confidently assign it to the latest period of Ibsen's career, on
 noting a certain difference of scale between its foundations and its
 superstructure. In his earlier plays, down to and including _Hedda
 Gabler_, we feel his invention at work to the very last moment, often
 with more intensity in the last act than in the first; in his later
 plays he seems to be in haste to pass as early as possible from
 invention to pure analysis. In this play, after the death of Eyolf
 (surely one of the most inspired "situations" in all drama) there is
 practically no external action whatsoever. Nothing happens save in the
 souls of the characters; there is no further invention, but rather what
 one may perhaps call inquisition. This does not prevent the second act
 from being quite the most poignant or the third act from being one of
 the most moving that Ibsen ever wrote. Far from wishing to depreciate
 the play, I rate it more highly, perhaps, than most critics--among the
 very greatest of Ibsen's achievements. I merely note as a characteristic
 of the poet's latest manner this disparity of scale between the work
 foreshadowed, so to speak, and the work completed. We shall find it
 still more evident in the case of _John Gabriel Borkman_.

 PLAY IN THREE ACTS
 
 
 
 
 ACT FIRST
 
 [A pretty and richly-decorated garden-room, full of furniture, flowers,
 and plants. At the back, open glass doors, leading out to a verandah. An
 extensive view over the fiord. In the distance, wooded hillsides. A door
 in each of the side walls, the one on the right a folding door, placed
 far back. In front on the right, a sofa, with cushions and rugs. Beside
 the sofa, a small table, and chairs. In front, on the left, a larger
 table, with arm-chairs around it. On the table stands an open hand-bag.
 It is an early summer morning, with warm sunshine.]
 
 [Mrs. RITA ALLMERS stands beside the table, facing towards the
 left, engaged in unpacking the bag. She is a handsome, rather tall,
 well-developed blonde, about thirty years of age, dressed in a
 light-coloured morning-gown.]
 
 [Shortly after, Miss ASTA ALLMERS enters by the door on the right,
 wearing a light brown summer dress, with hat, jacket, and parasol. Under

 is slim, of middle height, with dark hair, and deep, earnest eyes.
 Twenty-five years old.]
 
 ASTA. [As she enters.] Good-morning, my dear Rita.
 
 RITA. [Turns her head, and nods to her.] What! is that you, Asta? Come
 all the way from town so early?
 
 ASTA. [Takes of her things, and lays them on a chair beside the door.]
 Yes, such a restless feeling came over me. I felt I must come out
 to-day, and see how little Eyolf was getting on--and you too. [Lays the
 portfolio on the table beside the sofa.] So I took the steamer, and here
 I am.
 
 RITA. [Smiling to her.] And I daresay you met one or other of your
 friends on board? Quite by chance, of course.
 
 ASTA. [Quietly.] No, I did not meet a soul I knew. [Sees the bag.] Why,
 Rita, what have you got there?
 
 RITA. [Still unpacking.] Alfred's travelling-bag. Don't you recognise
 it?
 
 ASTA. [Joyfully, approaching her.] What! Has Alfred come home?
 
 RITA. Yes, only think--he came quite unexpectedly by the late train last
 night.
 
 ASTA. Oh, then that was what my feeling meant! It was that that drew
 me out here! And he hadn't written a line to let you know? Not even a
 post-card?
 
 RITA. Not a single word.
 
 ASTA. Did he not even telegraph?
 
 RITA. Yes, an hour before he arrived--quite curtly and coldly. [Laughs.]
 Don't you think that was like him, Asta?
 
 ASTA. Yes; he goes so quietly about everything.
 
 RITA. But that made it all the more delightful to have him again.
 
 ASTA. Yes, I am sure it would.
 
 RITA. A whole fortnight before I expected him!
 
 ASTA. And is he quite well? Not in low spirits?
 
 RITA. [Closes the bag with a snap, and smiles at her.] He looked quite
 transfigured as he stood in the doorway.
 
 ASTA. And was he not the least bit tired either?
 
 RITA. Oh, yes, he seemed to be tired enough--very tired, in fact. But,
 poor fellow, he had come on foot the greater part of the way.
 
 ASTA. And then perhaps the high mountain air may have been rather too
 keen for him.
 
 RITA. Oh, no; I don't think so at all. I haven't heard him cough once.
 
 ASTA. Ah, there you see now! It was a good thing, after all, that the
 doctor talked him into taking this tour.
 
 RITA. Yes, now that it is safely over.--But I can tell you it has been a
 terrible time for me, Asta. I have never cared to talk about it--and you
 so seldom came out to see me, too--
 
 ASTA. Yes, I daresay that wasn't very nice of me--but--
 
 RITA. Well, well, well, of course you had your school to attend to in
 town. [Smiling.] And then our road-maker friend--of course he was away
 too.
 
 ASTA. Oh, don't talk like that, Rita.
 
 RITA. Very well, then; we will leave the road-maker out of the
 question.--You can't think how I have been longing for Alfred! How empty
 the place seemed! How desolate! Ugh, it felt as if there had been a
 funeral in the house!
 
 ASTA. Why, dear me, only six or seven weeks--
 
 RITA. Yes; but you must remember that Alfred has never been away from
 me before--never so much as twenty-four hours. Not once in all these ten
 years.
 
 ASTA. No; but that is just why I really think it was high time he should
 have a little outing this year. He ought to have gone for a tramp in the
 mountains every summer--he really ought.
 
 RITA. [Half smiling.] Oh yes, it's all very well fair you to talk. If
 I were as--as reasonable its you, I suppose I should have let him go
 before--perhaps. But I positively could not, Asta! It seemed to me I
 should never get him back again. Surely you can understand that?
 
 ASTA. No. But I daresay that is because I have no one to lose.
 
 RITA. [With a teasing smile.] Really? No one at all?
 
 ASTA. Not that _I_ know of. [Changing the subject.] But tell me, Rita,
 where is Alfred? Is he still asleep?
 
 RITA. Oh, not at all. He got up as early as ever to-day.
 
 ASTA. Then he can't have been so very tired after all.
 
 RITA. Yes, he was last night--when he arrived. But now he has had little
 Eyolf with him in his room for a whole hour and more.
 
 ASTA. Poor little white-faced boy! Has he to be for ever at his lessons
 again?
 
 RITA. [With a slight shrug.] Alfred will have it so, you know.
 
 ASTA. Yes; but I think you ought to put down your foot about it, Rita.
 
 RITA. [Somewhat impatiently.] Oh no; come now, I really cannot meddle
 with that. Alfred knows so much better about these things than I do. And
 what would you have Eyolf do? He can't run about and play, you see--like
 other children.
 
 ASTA. [With decision.] I will talk to Alfred about this.
 
 RITA. Yes, do; I wish you would.--Oh! here he is.
 
 [ALFRED ALLMERS, dressed in light summer clothes, enters by the door on
 the left, leading EYOLF by the hand. He is a slim, lightly-built man of
 about thirty-six or thirty-seven, with gentle eyes, and thin brown hair
 and beard. His expression is serious and thoughtful. EYOLF wears a suit
 cut like a uniform, with gold braid and gilt military buttons. He is
 lame, and walks with a crutch under his left arm. His leg is shrunken.
 He is undersized, and looks delicate, but has beautiful intelligent
 eyes.]
 
 ALLMERS. [Drops EYOLF's hand, goes up to ASTA with an expression of
 marked pleasure, and holds out both his hands to her.] Asta! My dearest
 Asta! To think of your coming! To think of my seeing you so soon!
 
 ASTA. I felt I must--. Welcome home again!
 
 ALLMERS. [Shaking her hands.] Thank you for coming.
 
 RITA. Doesn't he look well?
 
 ASTA. [Gazes fixedly at him.] Splendid! Quite splendid! His eyes are so
 much brighter! And I suppose you have done a great deal of writing on
 your travels? [With an outburst of joy.] I shouldn't wonder if you had
 finished the whole book, Alfred?
 
 ALLMERS. [Shrugging his shoulders.] The book? Oh, the book--
 
 ASTA. Yes, I was sure you would find it go so easily when once you got
 away.
 
 ALLMERS. So I thought too. But, do you know, I didn't find it so at all.
 The truth is, I have not written a line of the book.
 
 ASTA. Not a line?
 
 RITA. Oho! I wondered when I found all the paper lying untouched in your
 bag.
 
 ASTA. But, my dear Alfred, what have you been doing all this time?
 
 ALLMERS. [Smiling.] Only thinking and thinking and thinking.
 
 RITA. [Putting her arm round his neck.] And thinking a little, too, of
 those you had left at home?
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, you may be sure of that. I have thought a great deal of
 you--every single day.
 
 RITA. [Taking her arm away.] Ah, that is all I care about.
 
 ASTA. But you haven't even touched the book! And yet you can look so
 happy and contented! That is not what you generally do--I mean when your
 work is going badly.
 
 ALLMERS. You are right there. You see, I have been such a fool hitherto.
 All the best that is in you goes into thinking. What you put on paper is
 worth very little.
 
 ASTA. [Exclaiming.] Worth very little!
 
 RITA. [Laughing.] What an absurd thing to say, Alfred.
 
 EYOLF. [Looks confidingly up at him.] Oh yes, Papa, what you write is
 worth a great deal!
 
 ALLMERS. [Smiling and stroking his hair.] Well, well, since you say
 so.--But I can tell you, some one is coming after me who will do it
 better.
 
 EYOLF. Who can that be? Oh, tell me!
 
 ALLMERS. Only wait--you may be sure he will come, and let us hear of
 him.
 
 EYOLF. And what will you do then?
 
 ALLMERS. [Seriously.] Then I will go to the mountains again--
 
 RITA. Fie, Alfred! For shame!
 
 ALLMERS.--up to the peaks and the great waste places.
 
 EYOLF. Papa, don't you think I shall soon be well enough for you to take
 me with you?
 
 ALLMERS. [With painful emotion.] Oh, yes, perhaps, my little boy.
 
 EYOLF. It would be so splendid, you know, if I could climb the
 mountains, like you.
 
 ASTA. [Changing the subject.] Why, how beautifully you are dressed
 to-day, Eyolf!
 
 EYOLF. Yes, don't you think so, Auntie?
 
 ASTA. Yes, indeed. Is it in honour of Papa that you have got your new
 clothes on?
 
 EYOLF. Yes, I asked Mama to let me. I wanted so to let Papa see me in
 them.
 
 ALLMERS. [In a low voice, to RITA.] You shouldn't have given him clothes
 like that.
 
 RITA. [In a low voice.] Oh, he has teased me so long about them--he had
 set his heart on them. He gave me no peace.
 
 EYOLF. And I forgot to tell you, Papa--Borgheim has bought me a new bow.
 And he has taught me how to shoot with it too.
 
 ALLMERS. Ah, there now--that's just the sort of thing for you, Eyolf.
 
 EYOLF. And next time he comes, I shall ask him to teach me to swim, too.
 
 ALLMERS. To swim! Oh, what makes you want to learn swimming?
 
 EYOLF. Well, you know, all the boys down at the beach can swim. I am the
 only one that can't.
 
 ALLMERS. [With emotion, taking him in his arms.] You shall learn
 whatever you like--everything you really want to.
 
 EYOLF. Then do you know what I want most of all, Papa?
 
 ALLMERS. No; tell me.
 
 EYOLF. I want most of all to be a soldier.
 
 ALLMERS. Oh, little Eyolf, there are many, many other things that are
 better than that.
 
 EYOLF. Ah, but when I grow big, then I shall have to be a soldier. You
 know that, don't you?
 
 ALLMERS. [Clenching his hands together.] Well, well, well: we shall
 see--
 
 ASTA. [Seating herself at the table on the left.] Eyolf! Come here to
 me, and I will tell you something.
 
 EYOLF. [Goes up to her.] What is it, Auntie?
 
 ASTA. What do you think, Eyolf--I have seen the Rat-Wife.
 
 EYOLF. What! Seen the Rat-Wife! Oh, you're only making a fool of me!
 
 ASTA. No; it's quite true. I saw her yesterday.
 
 EYOLF. Where did you see her?
 
 ASTA. I saw her on the road, outside the town.
 
 ALLMERS. I saw her, too, somewhere up in the country.
 
 RITA. [Who is sitting on the sofa.] Perhaps it will be out turn to see
 her next, Eyolf.
 
 EYOLF. Auntie, isn't it strange that she should be called the Rat-Wife?
 
 ASTA. Oh, people just give her that name because she wanders round the
 country driving away all the rats.
 
 ALLMERS. I have heard that her real name is Varg.
 
 EYOLF. Varg! That means a wolf, doesn't it?
 
 ALLMERS. [Patting him on the head.] So you know that, do you?
 
 EYOLF. [Cautiously.] Then perhaps it may be true, after all, that she is
 a were-wolf at night. Do you believe that, Papa?
 
 ALLMERS. Oh, no; I don't believe it. Now you ought to go and play a
 little in the garden.
 
 EYOLF. Should I not take some books with me?
 
 ALLMERS. No, no books after this. You had better go down to the beach to
 the other boys.
 
 EYOLF. [Shyly.] No, Papa, I won't go down to the boys to-day.
 
 ALLMERS. Why not?
 
 EYOLF. Oh, because I have these clothes on.
 
 ALLMERS. [Knitting his brows.] Do you mean that they make fun of--of
 your pretty clothes?
 
 EYOLF. [Evasively.] No, they daren't--for then I would thrash them.
 
 ALLMERS. Aha!--then why--?
 
 EYOLF. You see, they are so naughty, these boys. And then they say I can
 never be a soldier.
 
 ALLMERS. [With suppressed indignation.] Why do they say that, do you
 think?
 
 EYOLF. I suppose they are jealous of me. For you know, Papa, they are so
 poor, they have to go about barefoot.
 
 ALLMERS. [Softly, with choking voice.] Oh, Rita--how it wrings my heart!
 
 RITA. [Soothingly, rising.] There, there, there!
 
 ALLMERS. [Threateningly.] But these rascals shall soon find out who is
 the master down at the beach!
 
 ASTA. [Listening.] There is some one knocking.
 
 EYOLF. Oh, I'm sure it's Borgheim!
 
 RITA. Come in.
 
 [The RAT-WIFE comes softly and noiselessly in by the door on the right.
 She is a thin little shrunken figure, old and grey-haired, with keen,
 piercing eyes, dressed in an old-fashioned flowered gown, with a black
 hood and cloak. She has in her hand a large red umbrella, and carries a
 black bag by a loop over her arm.]
 
 EYOLF. [Softly, taking hold of ASTA's dress.] Auntie! That must surely
 be her!
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. [Curtseying at the door.] I humbly beg pardon--but are
 your worships troubled with any gnawing things in the house?
 
 ALLMERS. Here? No, I don't think so.
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. For it would be such a pleasure to me to rid your
 worships' house of them.
 
 RITA. Yes, yes; we understand. But we have nothing of the sort here.
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. That's very unlucky, that is; for I just happened to be
 on my rounds now, and goodness knows when I may be in these parts
 again.--Oh, how tired I am!
 
 ALLMERS. [Pointing to a chair.] Yes, you look tired.
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. I know one ought never to get tired of doing good to the
 poor little things that are hated and persecuted so cruelly. But it
 takes your strength out of you, it does.
 
 RITA. Won't you sit down and rest a little?
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. I thank your ladyship with all my heart. [Seats herself on
 a chair between the door and the sofa.] I have been out all night at my
 work.
 
 ALLMERS. Have you indeed?
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. Yes, over on the islands. [With a chuckling laugh.] The
 people sent for me, I can assure you. They didn't like it a bit; but
 there was nothing else to be done. They had to put a good face on it,
 and bite the sour apple. [Looks at EYOLF, and nods.] The sour apple,
 little master, the sour apple.
 
 EYOLF. [Involuntarily, a little timidly.] Why did they have to--?
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. What?
 
 EYOLF. To bite it?
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. Why, because they couldn't keep body and soul together
 on account of the rats and all the little rat-children, you see, young
 master.
 
 RITA. Ugh! Poor people! Have they so many of them?
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. Yes, it was all alive and swarming with them. [Laughs with
 quiet glee.] They came creepy-crawly up into the beds all night long.
 They plumped into the milk-cans, and they went pittering and pattering
 all over the floor, backwards and forwards, and up and down.
 
 EYOLF. [Softly, to ASTA.] I shall never go there, Auntie.
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. But then I came--I, and another along with me. And we took
 them with us, every one--the sweet little creatures! We made an end of
 every one of them.
 
 EYOLF. [With a shriek.] Papa--look! look!
 
 RITA. Good Heavens, Eyolf!
 
 ALLMERS. What's the matter?
 
 EYOLF. [Pointing.] There's something wriggling in the bag!
 
 RITA. [At the extreme left, shrieks.] Ugh! Send her away, Alfred.
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. [Laughing.] Oh, dearest lady, you needn't be frightened of
 such a little mannikin.
 
 ALLMERS. But what is the thing?
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. Why, it's only little Mopseman. [Loosening the string of
 the bag.] Come up out of the dark, my own little darling friend.
 
 [A little dog with a broad black snout pokes its head out of the bag.]
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. [Nodding and beckoning to EYOLF.] Come along, don't be
 afraid, my little wounded warrior! He won't bite. Come here! Come here!
 
 EYOLF. [Clinging to ASTA.] No, I dare not.
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. Don't you think he has a gentle, lovable countenance, my
 young master?
 
 EYOLF. [Astonished, pointing.] That thing there?
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. Yes, this thing here.
 
 EYOLF. [Almost under his breath, staring fixedly at the dog.] I think he
 has the horriblest--countenance I ever saw.
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. [Closing the bag.] Oh, it will come--it will come, right
 enough.
 
 EYOLF. [Involuntarily drawing nearer, at last goes right up to her, and
 strokes the bag.] But he is lovely--lovely all the same.
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. [In a tone of caution.] But now he is so tired and weary,
 poor thing. He's utterly tired out, he is. [Looks at ALLMERS.] For it
 takes the strength out of you, that sort of game, I can tell you, sir.
 
 ALLMERS. What sort of game do you mean?
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. The luring game.
 
 ALLMERS. Do you mean that it is the dog that lures the rats?
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. [Nodding.] Mopseman and I--we two do it together. And it
 goes so smoothly--for all you can see, at any rate. I just slip a string
 through his collar, and then I lead him three times round the house, and
 play on my Pan's-pipes. When they hear that, they have got to come up
 from the cellars, and down from the garrets, and out of flour boles, all
 the blessed little creatures.
 
 EYOLF. And does he bite them to death then?
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. Oh, not at all! No, we go down to the boat, he and I
 do--and then they follow after us, both the big ones and the little
 ratikins.
 
 EYOLF. [Eagerly.] And what then--tell me!
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. Then we push out from the land, and I scull with one
 oar, and play on my Pan's-pipes. And Mopseman, he swims behind. [With
 glittering eyes.] And all the creepers and crawlers, they follow and
 follow us out into the deep, deep waters. Ay, for they have to.
 
 EYOLF. Why do they have to?
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. Just because they want not to--just because they are so
 deadly afraid of the water. That is why they have got to plunge into it.
 
 EYOLF. Are they drowned, then?
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. Every blessed one. [More softly.] And there it is all as
 still, and soft, and dark as their hearts can desire, the lovely little
 things. Down there they sleep a long, sweet sleep, with no one to hate
 them or persecute them any more. [Rises.] In the old days, I can tell
 you, I didn't need any Mopseman. Then I did the luring myself--I alone.
 
 EYOLF. And what did you lure then?
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. Men. One most of all.
 
 EYOLF. [With eagerness.] Oh, who was that one? Tell me!
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. [Laughing.] It was my own sweetheart, it was, little
 heart-breaker!
 
 EYOLF. And where is he now, then?
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. [Harshly.] Down where all the rats are. [Resuming her
 milder tone.] But now I must be off and get to business again. Always on
 the move. [To RITA.] So your ladyship has no sort of use for me to-day?
 I could finish it all off while I am about it.
 
 RITA. No, thank you; I don't think we require anything.
 
 THE RAT-WIFE. Well, well, your sweet ladyship, you can never tell.
 If your ladyship should find that there is anything lure that keeps
 nibbling and gnawing, and creeping and crawling, then just see and get
 hold of me and Mopseman.--Good-bye, good-bye, a kind good-bye to you
 all. [She goes out by the door on the right.]
 
 EYOLF. [Softly and triumphantly, to ASTA.] Only think, Auntie, now I
 have seen the Rat-Wife too!
 
 [RITA goes out upon the verandah, and fans herself with her
 pocket-handkerchief. Shortly afterwards, EYOLF slips cautiously and
 unnoticed out to the right.]
 
 ALLMERS. [Takes up the portfolio from the table by the sofa.] Is this
 your portfolio, Asta?
 
 ASTA. Yes. I have some of the old letters in it.
 
 ALLMERS. Ah, the family letters--
 
 ASTA. You know you asked me to arrange them for you while you were away.
 
 ALLMERS. [Pats her on the head.] And you have actually found time to do
 that, dear?
 
 ASTA. Oh, yes. I have done it partly out here and partly at my own rooms
 in town.
 
 ALLMERS. Thanks, dear. Did you find anything particular in them?
 
 ASTA. [Lightly.] Oh, you know you always find something or other in such
 old papers. [Speaking lower and seriously.] It is the letters to mother
 that are in this portfolio.
 
 ALLMERS. Those, of course, you must keep yourself.
 
 ASTA. [With an effort.] No; I am determined that you shall look through
 them, too, Alfred. Some time--later on in life. I haven't the key of the
 portfolio with me just now.
 
 ALLMERS. It doesn't matter, my dear Asta, for I shall never read your
 mother's letters in any case.
 
 ASTA. [Fixing her eyes on him.] Then some time or other--some quiet
 evening--I will tell you a little of what is in them.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, that will be much better. But do you keep your mother's
 letters--you haven't so many mementos of her.
 
 [He hands ASTA the portfolio. She takes it, and lays it on the chair
 under her outdoor things. RITA comes into the room again.]
 
 RITA. Ugh! I feel as if that horrible old woman had brought a sort of
 graveyard smell with her.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, she was rather horrible.
 
 RITA. I felt almost sick while she was in the room.
 
 ALLMERS. However, I can very well understand the sort of spellbound
 fascination that she talked about. The loneliness of the mountain-peaks
 and of the great waste places has something of the same magic about it.
 
 ASTA. [Looks attentively at him.] What is it that has happened to you,
 Alfred?
 
 ALLMERS. [Smiling.] To me?
 
 ASTA. Yes, something has happened--something seems almost to have
 transformed you. Rita noticed it too.
 
 RITA. Yes, I saw it the moment you came. A change for the better, I
 hope, Alfred?
 
 ALLMERS. It ought to be for the better. And it must and shall come to
 good.
 
 RITA. [With an outburst.] You have had some adventure on your journey!
 Don't deny it! I can see it in your face!
 
 ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] No adventure in the world--outwardly at
 least. But--
 
 RITA. [Eagerly.] But--?
 
 ALLMERS. It is true that within me there has been something of a
 revolution.
 
 RITA. Oh Heavens--!
 
 ALLMERS. [Soothingly, patting her hand.] Only for the better, my dear
 Rita. You may be perfectly certain of that.
 
 RITA. [Seats herself on the sofa.] You must tell us all about it, at
 once--tell us everything!
 
 ALLMERS. [Turning to ASTA.] Yes, let us sit down, too, Asta. Then I will
 try to tell you as well as I can.
 
 [He seats himself on the sofa at RITA's side. ASTA moves a chair
 forward, and places herself near him.]
 
 RITA. [Looking at him expectantly.] Well--?
 
 ALLMERS. [Gazing straight before him.] When I look back over my
 life--and my fortunes--for the last ten or eleven years, it seems to me
 almost like a fairy-tale or a dream. Don't you think so too, Asta?
 
 ASTA. Yes, in many ways I think so.
 
 ALLMERS. [Continuing.] When I remember what we two used to be, Asta--we
 two poor orphan children--
 
 RITA. [Impatiently.] Oh, that is such an old, old story.
 
 ALLMERS. [Not listening to her.] And now here I am in comfort and
 luxury. I have been able to follow my vocation. I have been able to work
 and study--just as I had always longed to. [Holds out his hand.] And all
 this great--this fabulous good fortune we owe to you, my dearest Rita.
 
 RITA. [Half playfully, half angrily, slaps his hand.] Oh, I do wish you
 would stop talking like that.
 
 ALLMERS. I speak of it only as a sort of introduction.
 
 RITA. Then do skip the introduction!
 
 ALLMERS. Rita,--you must not think it was the doctor's advice that drove
 me up to the mountains.
 
 ASTA. Was it not, Alfred?
 
 RITA. What was it, then?
 
 ALLMERS. It was this: I found there was no more peace for me, there in
 my study.
 
 RITA. No peace! Why, who disturbed you?
 
 ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] No one from without. But I felt as though
 I were positively abusing--or, say rather, wasting--my best
 powers--frittering away the time.
 
 ASTA. [With wide eyes.] When you were writing at your book?
 
 ALLMERS. [Nodding.] For I cannot think that my powers are confined to
 that alone. I must surely have it in me to do one or two other things as
 well.
 
 RITA. Was that what you sat there brooding over?
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, mainly that.
 
 RITA. And so that is what has made you so discontented with yourself
 of late; and with the rest of us as well. For you know you were
 discontented, Alfred.
 
 ALLMERS. [Gazing straight before him.] There I sat bent over my table,
 day after day, and often half the night too--writing and writing at the
 great thick book on "Human Responsibility." H'm!
 
 ASTA. [Laying her hand upon his arm.] But, Alfred--that book is to be
 your life-work.
 
 RITA. Yes, you have said so often enough.
 
 ALLMERS. I thought so. Ever since I grew up, I have thought so. [With an
 affectionate expression in his eyes.] And it was you that enabled me to
 devote myself to it, my dear Rita--
 
 RITA. Oh, nonsense!
 
 ALLMERS. [Smiling to her.]--you, with your gold, and your green
 forests--
 
 RITA. [Half laughing, half vexed.] If you begin all that rubbish again,
 I shall beat you.
 
 ASTA. [Looking sorrowfully at him.] But the book, Alfred?
 
 ALLMERS. It began, as it were, to drift away from me. But I was more and
 more beset by the thought of the higher duties that laid their claims
 upon me.
 
 RITA. [Beaming, seizes his hand.] Alfred!
 
 ALLMERS. The thought of Eyolf, my dear Rita.
 
 RITA. [Disappointed, drops his hand.] Ah--of Eyolf!
 
 ALLMERS. Poor little Eyolf has taken deeper and deeper hold of me. After
 that unlucky fall from the table--and especially since we have been
 assured that the injury is incurable--
 
 RITA. [Insistently.] But you take all the care you possibly can of him,
 Alfred!
 
 ALLMERS. As a schoolmaster, yes; but not as a father. And it is a father
 that I want henceforth to be to Eyolf.
 
 RITA. [Looking at him and shaking her head.] I don't think I quite
 understand you.
 
 ALLMERS. I mean that I will try with all my might to make his misfortune
 as painless and easy to him as it can possibly be.
 
 RITA. Oh, but, dear--thank Heaven, I don't think he feels it so deeply.
 
 ASTA. [With emotion.] Yes, Rita, he does.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, you may be sure he feels it deeply.
 
 RITA. [Impatiently.] But, Alfred, what more can you do for him?
 
 ALLMERS. I will try to perfect all the rich possibilities that are
 dawning in his childish soul. I will foster all the germs of good in his
 nature--make them blossom and bear fruit. [With more and more warmth,
 rising.] And I will do more than that! I will help him to bring his
 desires into harmony with what lies attainable before him. That is just
 what at present they are not. All his longings are for things that
 must for ever remain unattainable to him. But I will create a conscious
 happiness in his mind. [He goes once or twice up and down the room. ASTA
 and RITA follow him with their eyes.]
 
 RITA. You should take these things more quietly, Alfred!
 
 ALLMERS. [Stops beside the table on the left, and looks at them.] Eyolf
 shall carry on my life-work--if he wants to. Or he shall choose one
 that is altogether his own. Perhaps that would be best. At all events, I
 shall let mine rest as it is.
 
 RITA. [Rising.] But, Alfred dear, can you not work both for yourself and
 for Eyolf?
 
 ALLMERS. No, I cannot. It is impossible! I cannot divide myself in this
 matter--and therefore I efface myself. Eyolf shall be the complete man
 of our race. And it shall be my new life-work to make him the complete
 man.
 
 ASTA. [Has risen and now goes up to him.] This must have cost you a
 terribly hard struggle, Alfred?
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, it has. At home here, I should never have conquered
 myself, never brought myself to the point of renunciation. Never at
 home!
 
 RITA. Then that was why you went away this summer?
 
 ALLMERS. [With shining eyes.] Yes! I went up into the infinite
 solitudes. I saw the sunrise gleaming on the mountain peaks. I felt
 myself nearer the stars--I seemed almost to be in sympathy and communion
 with them. And then I found the strength for it.
 
 ASTA. [Looking sadly at him.] But you will never write any more of your
 book on "Human Responsibility"?
 
 ALLMERS. No, never, Asta. I tell you I cannot split up my life between
 two vocations. But I will act out my "human responsibility"--in my own
 life.
 
 RITA. [With a smile.] Do you think you can live up to such high resolves
 at home here?
 
 ALLMERS. [Taking her hand.] With you to help me, I can. [Holds out the
 other hand.] And with you too, Asta.
 
 RITA. [Drawing her hand away.] Ah--with both of us! So, after all, you
 can divide yourself.
 
 ALLMERS. Why, my dearest Rita--!
 
 [RITA moves away from him and stands in the garden doorway. A light and
 rapid knock is heard at the door on the right. Engineer BORGHEIM enters
 quickly. He is a young man of a little over thirty. His expression is
 bright and cheerful, and he holds himself erect.]
 
 BORGHEIM. Good morning, Mrs. Allmers. [Stops with an expression of
 pleasure on seeing ALLMERS.] Why, what's this? Home again already, Mr.
 Allmers?
 
 ALLMERS. [Shaking hands with him.] Yes, I arrived list night.
 
 RITA. [Gaily.] His leave was up, Mr. Borgheim.
 
 ALLMERS. No, you know it wasn't, Rita--
 
 RITA. [Approaching.] Oh yes, but it was, though. His furlough had run
 out.
 
 BORGHEIM. I see you hold your husband well in hand, Mrs. Allmers.
 
 RITA. I hold to my rights. And besides, everything must have an end.
 
 BORGHEIM. Oh, not everything--I hope. Good morning, Miss Allmers!
 
 ASTA. [Holding aloof from him.] Good morning.
 
 RITA. [Looking at BORGHEIM.] Not everything, you say?
 
 BORGHEIM. Oh, I am firmly convinced that there are some things in the
 world that will never come to an end.
 
 RITA. I suppose you are thinking of love--and that sort of thing.
 
 BORGHEIM. [Warmly.] I am thinking of all that is lovely!
 
 RITA. And that never comes to an end. Yes, let us think of that, hope
 for that, all of us.
 
 ALLMERS. [Coming up to them.] I suppose you will soon have finished your
 road-work out here?
 
 BORGHEIM. I have finished it already--finished it yesterday. It has been
 a long business, but, thank Heaven, that has come to an end.
 
 RITA. And you are beaming with joy over that?
 
 BORGHEIM. Yes, I am indeed!
 
 RITA. Well, I must say--
 
 BORGHEIM. What, Mrs. Allmers?
 
 RITA. I don't think it is particularly nice of you, Mr. Borgheim.
 
 BORGHEIM. Indeed! Why not?
 
 RITA. Well, I suppose we sha'n't often see you in these parts after
 this.
 
 BORGHEIM. No, that is true. I hadn't thought of that.
 
 RITA. Oh well, I suppose you will be able to look in upon us now and
 then all the same.
 
 BORGHEIM. No, unfortunately that will be out of my power for a very long
 time.
 
 ALLMERS. Indeed! How so?
 
 BORGHEIM. The fact is, I have got a big piece of new work that I must
 set about at once.
 
 ALLMERS. Have you indeed?--[Pressing his hand.]--I am heartily glad to
 hear it.
 
 RITA. I congratulate you, Mr. Borgheim!
 
 BORGHEIM. Hush, hush--I really ought not to talk openly of it as
 yet! But I can't help coming out with it! It is a great piece of
 road-making--up in the north--with mountain ranges to cross, and
 the most tremendous difficulties to overcome!--[With an outburst of
 gladness.]--Oh, what a glorious world this is--and what a joy it is to
 be a road-maker in it!
 
 RITA. [Smiling, and looking teasingly at him.] Is it road-making
 business that has brought you out here to-day in such wild spirits?
 
 BORGHEIM. No, not that alone. I am thinking of all the bright and
 hopeful prospects that are opening out before me.
 
 RITA. Aha, then perhaps you have something still more exquisite in
 reserve!
 
 BORGHEIM. [Glancing towards ASTA.] Who knows! When once happiness comes
 to us, it is apt to come like it spring flood. [Turns to ASTA.] Miss
 Allmers, would you not like to take a little walk with me? As we used
 to?
 
 ASTA. [Quickly.] No--no, thank you. Not now. Not to-day.
 
 BORGHEIM. Oh, do come! Only a little bit of a walk! I have so much I
 want to talk to you about before I go.
 
 RITA. Something else, perhaps, that you must not talk openly about as
 yet?
 
 BORGHEIM. H'm, that depends--
 
 RITA. But there is nothing to prevent your whispering, you know. [Half
 aside.] Asta, you must really go with him.
 
 ASTA. But, my dear Rita--
 
 BORGHEIM. [Imploringly.] Miss Asta--remember it is to be a farewell
 walk--the last for many a day.
 
 ASTA. [Takes her hat and parasol.] Very well, suppose we take a stroll
 in the garden, then.
 
 BORGHEIM. Oh, thank you, thank you!
 
 ALLMERS. And while you are there you can see what Eyolf is doing.
 
 BORGHEIM. Ah, Eyolf, by the bye! Where is Eyolf to-day? I've got
 something for him.
 
 ALLMERS. He is out playing somewhere.
 
 BORGHEIM. Is he really! Then he has begun to play now? He used always to
 be sitting indoors over his books.
 
 ALLMERS. There is to be an end of that now. I am going to make a regular
 open-air boy of him.
 
 BORGHEIM. Ah, now, that's right! Out into the open air with him, poor
 little fellow! Good Lord, what can we possibly do better than play
 in this blessed world? For my part, I think all life is one long
 playtime!--Come, Miss Asta!
 
 [BORGHEIM and ASTA go out on the verandah and down through the garden.]
 
 ALLMERS. [Stands looking after them.] Rita--do you think there is
 anything between those two?
 
 RITA. I don't know what to say. I used to think there was. But Asta has
 grown so strange to me--so utterly incomprehensible of late.
 
 ALLMERS. Indeed! Has she? While I have been away?
 
 RITA. Yes, within the last week or two.
 
 ALLMERS. And you think she doesn't care very much about him now?
 
 RITA. Not, seriously; not utterly and entirely; not unreservedly--I am
 sure she doesn't. [Looks searchingly at him.] Would it displease you if
 she did?
 
 ALLMERS. It would not exactly displease me. But it would certainly be a
 disquieting thought--
 
 RITA. Disquieting?
 
 ALLMERS. Yes; you must remember that I am responsible for Asta--for her
 life's happiness.
 
 RITA. Oh, come--responsible! Surely Asta has come to years of
 discretion? I should say she was capable of choosing for herself.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, we must hope so, Rita.
 
 RITA. For my part, I don't think at all ill of Borgheim.
 
 ALLMERS. No, dear--no more do I--quite the contrary. But all the same--
 
 RITA. [Continuing.] And I should be very glad indeed if he and Asta were
 to make a match of it.
 
 ALLMERS. [Annoyed.] Oh, why should you be?
 
 RITA. [With increasing excitement.] Why, for then she would have to go
 far, far away with him! Anal she could never come out here to us, as she
 does now.
 
 ALLMERS. [Stares at her in astonishment.] What! Can you really wish Asta
 to go away?
 
 RITA. Yes, yes, Alfred!
 
 ALLMERS. Why in all the world--?
 
 RITA. [Throwing her arms passionately round his neck.] For then, at
 last, I should have you to myself alone! And yet--not even then!
 Not wholly to myself! [Bursts into convulsive weeping.] Oh, Alfred,
 Alfred--I cannot give you up!
 
 ALLMERS. [Gently releasing himself.] My dearest Rita, do be reasonable!
 
 RITA. I don't care a bit about being reasonable! I care only for you!
 Only for you in all the world! [Again throwing her arms round his neck.]
 For you, for you, for you!
 
 ALLMERS. Let me go, let me go--you are strangling me!
 
 RITA. [Letting him go.] How I wish I could! [Looking at him with
 flashing eyes.] Oh, if you knew how I have hated you--!
 
 ALLMERS. Hated me--!
 
 RITA. Yes--when you shut yourself up in your room and brooded over your
 work--till long, long into the night. [Plaintively.] So long, so late,
 Alfred. Oh, how I hated your work!
 
 ALLMERS. But now I have done with that.
 
 RITA. [With a cutting laugh.] Oh yes! Now you have given yourself up to
 something worse.
 
 ALLMERS. [Shocked.] Worse! Do you call our child something worse?
 
 RITA. [Vehemently.] Yes, I do. As he comes between you and me, I call
 him so. For the book--the book was not a living being, as the child is.
 [With increasing impetuosity.] But I won't endure it, Alfred! I will not
 endure it--I tell you so plainly!
 
 ALLMERS. [Looks steadily at her, and says in a low voice.] I am often
 almost afraid of you, Rita.
 
 RITA. [Gloomily.] I am often afraid of myself. And for that very reason
 you must not awake the evil in me.
 
 ALLMERS. Why, good Heavens, do I do that?
 
 RITA. Yes, you do--when you tear to shreds the holiest bonds between us.
 
 ALLMERS. [Urgently.] Think what you're saying, Rita. It is your own
 child--our only child, that you are speaking of.
 
 RITA. The child is only half mine. [With another outburst.] But you
 shall be mine alone! You shall be wholly mine! That I have a right to
 demand of you!
 
 ALLMERS. [Shrugging his shoulders.] Oh, my dear Rita, it is of no use
 demanding anything. Everything must be freely given.
 
 RITA. [Looks anxiously at him.] And that you cannot do henceforth?
 
 ALLMERS. No, I cannot. I must divide myself between Eyolf and you.
 
 RITA. But if Eyolf had never been born? What then?
 
 ALLMERS. [Evasively.] Oh, that would be another matter. Then I should
 have only you to care for.
 
 RITA. [Softly, her voice quivering.] Then I wish he had never been born.
 
 ALLMERS. [Flashing out.] Rita! You don't know what you are saying!
 
 RITA. [Trembling with emotion.] It was in pain unspeakable that I
 brought him into the world. But I bore it all with joy and rapture for
 your sake.
 
 ALLMERS. [Warmly.] Oh yes, I know, I know.
 
 RITA. [With decision.] But there it must end. I will live my
 life--together with you--wholly with you. I cannot go on being only
 Eyolf's mother--only his mother and nothing more. I will not, I tell
 you! I cannot! I will be all in all to you! To you, Alfred!
 
 ALLMERS. But that is just what you are, Rita. Through our child--
 
 RITA. Oh--vapid, nauseous phrases--nothing else! No, Alfred, I am not to
 be put off like that. I was fitted to become the child's mother, but not
 to be a mother to him. You must take me as I am, Alfred.
 
 ALLMERS. And yet you used to be so fond of Eyolf.
 
 RITA. I was so sorry for him--because you troubled yourself so little
 about him. You kept him reading and grinding at books. You scarcely even
 saw him.
 
 ALLMERS. [Nodding slowly.] No; I was blind. The time had not yet come
 for me--
 
 RITA. [Looking in his face.] But now, I suppose, it has come?
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, at, last. Now I see that the highest task I can have in
 the world is to be a true father to Eyolf.
 
 RITA. And to me?--what will you be to me?
 
 ALLMERS. [Gently.] I will always go on caring for you--with calm, deep
 tenderness. [ He tries to take her hands.]
 
 RITA. [Evading him.] I don't care a bit for your calm, deep tenderness.
 I want you utterly and entirely--and alone! Just as I had you in the
 first rich, beautiful days. [Vehemently and harshly.] Never, never will
 I consent to be put off with scraps and leavings, Alfred!
 
 ALLMERS. [In a conciliatory tone.] I should have thought there was
 happiness in plenty for all three of us, Rita.
 
 RITA. [Scornfully.] Then you are easy to please. [Seats herself at the
 table on the left.] Now listen to me.
 
 ALLMERS. [Approaching.] Well, what is it?
 
 RITA. [Looking up at him with a veiled glow in her eyes.] When I got
 your telegram yesterday evening--
 
 ALLMERS. Yes? What then?
 
 RITA.--then I dressed myself in white--
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, I noticed you were in white when I arrived.
 
 RITA. I had let down my hair--
 
 ALLMERS. Your sweet masses of hair--
 
 RITA.--so that it flowed down my neck and shoulders--
 
 ALLMERS. I saw it, I saw it. Oh, how lovely you were, Rita!
 
 RITA. There were rose-tinted shades over both the lamps. And we were
 alone, we two--the only waking beings in the whole house. And there was
 champagne on the table.
 
 ALLMERS. I did not drink any of it.
 
 RITA. [Looking bitterly at him.] No, that is true. [Laughs harshly.]
 "There stood the champagne, but you tasted it not"--as the poet says.
 
 [She rises from the armchair, goes with an air of weariness over to the
 sofa, and seats herself, half reclining, upon it.]
 
 ALLMERS. [Crosses the room and stands before her.] I was so taken up
 with serious thoughts. I had made up my mind to talk to you of our
 future, Rita--and first and foremost of Eyolf.
 
 RITA. [Smiling.] And so you did--
 
 ALLMERS. No, I had not time to--for you began to undress.
 
 RITA. Yes, and meanwhile you talked about Eyolf. Don't you remember? You
 wanted to know all about little Eyolf's digestion.
 
 ALLMERS. [Looking reproachfully at her.] Rita--!
 
 RITA. And then you got into your bed, and slept the sleep of the just.
 
 ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] Rita--Rita!
 
 RITA. [Lying at full length and looking up at him.] Alfred?
 
 ALLMERS. Yes?
 
 RITA. "There stood your champagne, but you tasted it not."
 
 ALLMERS. [Almost harshly.] No. I did not taste it.
 
 [He goes away from her and stands in the garden doorway. RITA lies for
 some time motionless, with closed eyes.]
 
 RITA. [Suddenly springing up.] But let me tell you one thing, Alfred.
 
 ALLMERS. [Turning in the doorway.] Well?
 
 RITA. You ought not to feel quite so secure as you do!
 
 ALLMERS. Not secure?
 
 RITA. No, you ought not to be so indifferent! Not certain of your
 property in me!
 
 ALLMERS. [Drawing nearer.] What do you mean by that?
 
 RITA. [With trembling lips.] Never in a single thought have I been
 untrue to you, Alfred! Never for an instant.
 
 ALLMERS. No, Rita, I know that--I, who know you so well.
 
 RITA. [With sparkling eyes.] But if you disdain me--!
 
 ALLMERS. Disdain! I don't understand what you mean!
 
 RITA. Oh, you don't know all that might rise up within me, if--
 
 ALLMERS. If?
 
 RITA. If I should ever see that you did not care for me--that you did
 not love me as you used to.
 
 ALLMERS. But, my dearest Rita--years bring a certain change with
 them--and that must one day occur even in us--as in every one else.
 
 RITA. Never in me! And I will not hear of any change in you either--I
 could not bear it, Alfred. I want to keep you to myself alone.
 
 ALLMERS. [Looking at her with concern.] You have a terribly jealous
 nature--
 
 RITA. I can't make myself different from what I am. [Threateningly.] If
 you go and divide yourself between me and any one else--
 
 ALLMERS. What then--?
 
 RITA. Then I will take my revenge on you, Alfred!
 
 ALLMERS. How "take your revenge"?
 
 RITA. I don't know how.--Oh yes, I do know, well enough!
 
 ALLMERS. Well?
 
 RITA. I will go and throw myself away--
 
 ALLMERS. Throw yourself away, do you say?
 
 RITA. Yes, that I will. I'll throw myself straight into the arms of of
 the first man that comes in my way--
 
 ALLMERS. [Looking tenderly at her and shaking his head.] That you will
 never do--my loyal, proud, true-hearted Rita!
 
 RITA. [Putting her arms round his neck.] Oh, you don't know what I might
 come to be if you--if you did not love me any more.
 
 ALLMERS. Did not love you, Rita? How can you say such a thing!
 
 RITA. [Half laughing, lets him go.] Why should I not spread my nets for
 that--that road-maker man that hangs about here?
 
 ALLMERS. [Relieved.] Oh, thank goodness--you are only joking.
 
 RITA. Not at all. He would do as well as any one else.
 
 ALLMERS. Ah, but I suspect he is more or less taken up already.
 
 RITA. So much the better! For then I should take him away from some one
 else; and that is just what Eyolf has done to me.
 
 ALLMERS. Can you say that our little Eyolf has done that?
 
 RITA. [Pointing with her forefinger.] There, you see! You see! The
 moment you mention Eyolf's name, you grow tender and your voice quivers!
 [Threateningly, clenching her hands.] Oh, you almost tempt we to wish--
 
 ALLMERS. [Looking at her anxiously.] What do I tempt you to wish,
 Rita?--
 
 RITA. [Vehemently, going away from him.] No, no, no--I won't tell you
 that! Never!
 
 ALLMERS. [Drawing nearer to her.] Rita! I implore you--for my sake and
 for your own--do not let yourself he tempted into evil.
 
 [BORGHEIM and ASTA come up from the garden. They both show signs of
 restrained emotion. They look serious and dejected. ASTA remains out on
 the verandah. BORGHEIM comes into the room.]
 
 BORGHEIM. So that is over--Miss Allmers and I have had our last walk
 together.
 
 RITA. [Looks at him with surprise.] Ah! And there is no longer journey
 to follow the walk?
 
 BORGHEIM. Yes, for me.
 
 RITA. For you alone?
 
 BORGHEIM. Yes, for me alone.
 
 RITA. [Glances darkly at ALLMERS.] Do you hear that? [Turns to
 BORGHEIM.] I'll wager it is some one with the evil eye that has played
 you this trick.
 
 BORGHEIM. [Looks at her.] The evil eye?
 
 RITA. [Nodding.] Yes, the evil eye.
 
 BORGHEIM. Do you believe in the evil eye, Mrs. Allmers?
 
 RITA. Yes. I have begun to believe in the evil eye. Especially in a
 child's evil eye.
 
 ALLMERS. [Shocked, whispers.] Rita--how can you--?
 
 RITA. [Speaking low.] It is you that make me so wicked and hateful,
 Alfred.
 
 [Confused cries and shrieks are heard in the distance, from the
 direction of the fiord.]
 
 BORGHEIM. [Going to the glass door.] What noise is that?
 
 ASTA. [In the doorway.] Look at all those people running down to the
 pier!
 
 ALLMERS. What can it be? [Looks out for a moment.] No doubt it's those
 street urchins at some mischief again.
 
 BORGHEIM. [Calls, leaning over the verandah railings.] I say, you boys
 down there! What's the matter?
 
 [Several voices are heard answering indistinctly and confusedly.]
 
 RITA. What do they say?
 
 BORGHEIM. They say it's a child that's drowned.
 
 ALLMERS. A child drowned?
 
 ASTA. [Uneasily.] A little boy, they say.
 
 ALLMERS. Oh, they can all swim, every one of them.
 
 RITA. [Shrieks in terror.] Where is Eyolf?
 
 ALLMERS. Keep quiet--quiet. Eyolf is down in the garden, playing.
 
 ASTA. No, he wasn't in the garden.
 
 RITA. [With upstretched arms.] Oh, if only it isn't he!
 
 BORGHEIM. [Listens, and calls down.] Whose child is it, do you say?
 
 [Indistinct voices are heard. BORGHEIM and ASTA utter a suppressed cry,
 and rush out through the garden.]
 
 ALLMERS. [In an agony of dread.] It isn't Eyolf! It isn't Eyolf, Rita!
 
 RITA. [On the verandah, listening.] Hush! Be quiet! Let me hear what
 they are saying!
 
 [RITA rushes back with a piercing shriek, into the room.]
 
 ALLMERS. [Following her.] What did they say?
 
 RITA. [Sinking down beside the armchair on the left.] They said: "The
 crutch is floating!"
 
 ALLMERS. [Almost paralysed.] No! No! No!
 
 RITA. [Hoarsely.] Eyolf! Eyolf! Oh, but they must save him!
 
 ALLMERS. [Half distracted.] They must, they must! So precious a life!
 
 [He rushes down through the garden.]
 
 
 
 
 ACT SECOND
 
 [A little narrow glen by the side of the fiord, on ALLMERS'S property.
 On the left, lofty old trees overarch the spot. Down the slope in the
 background a brook comes leaping, and loses itself among the stones on
 the margin of the wood. A path winds along by the brook-side. To the
 right there are only a few single trees, between which the fiord is
 visible. In front is seen the corner of a boat-shed with a boat drawn
 up. Under the old trees on the left stands a table with a bench and one
 or two chairs, all made of thin birch-staves. It is a heavy, damp day,
 with driving mist wreaths.]
 
 [ALFRED ALLMERS, dressed as before, sits on the bench, leaning his arms
 on the table. His hat lies before him. He gazes absently and immovably
 out over the water.]
 
 [Presently ASTA ALLMERS comes down the woodpath. She is carrying an open
 umbrella.]
 
 ASTA. [Goes quietly and cautiously up to him.] You ought not to sit down
 here in this gloomy weather, Alfred.
 
 ALLMERS. [Nods slowly without answering.]
 
 ASTA. [Closing her umbrella.] I have been searching for you such a long
 time.
 
 ALLMERS. [Without expression.] Thank you.
 
 ASTA. [Moves a chair and seats herself close to him.] Have you been
 sitting here long? All the time?
 
 ALLMERS. [Does not answer at first. Presently he says.] No, I cannot
 grasp it. It seems so utterly impossible.
 
 ASTA. [Laying her hand compassionately on his arm.] Poor Alfred!
 
 ALLMERS. [Gazing at her.] Is it really true then, Asta? Or have I gone
 mad? Or am I only dreaming? Oh, if it were only a dream! Just think, if
 I were to waken now!
 
 ASTA. Oh, if I could only waken you!
 
 ALLMERS. [Looking out over the water.] How pitiless the fiord looks
 to-day, lying so heavy and drowsy--leaden-grey--with splashes of
 yellow--and reflecting the rain-clouds.
 
 ASTA. [Imploringly.] Oh, Alfred, don't sit staring out over the fiord!
 
 ALLMERS. [Not heeding her.] Over the surface, yes. But in the
 depths--there sweeps the rushing undertow--
 
 ASTA. [In terror.] Oh, for God's sake don't think of the depths!
 
 ALLMERS. [Looking gently at her.] I suppose you think he is lying close
 outside here? But he is not, Asta. You must not think that. You must
 remember how fiercely the current sweeps gut here straight to the open
 sea.
 
 ASTA. [Throws herself forward against the table, and, sobbing, buries
 her face in her hands.] Oh, God! Oh, God!
 
 ALLMERS. [Heavily.] So you see, little Eyolf has passed so far--far away
 from us now.
 
 ASTA. [Looks imploringly up at him.] Oh, Alfred, don't say such things!
 
 ALLMERS. Why, you can reckon it out for yourself--you that are so
 clever. In eight-and-twenty hours--nine-and-twenty hours--Let me see--!
 Let me see--!
 
 ASTA. [Shrieking and stopping her ears.] Alfred!
 
 ALLMERS. [Clenching his hand firmly upon the table.] Can you conceive
 the meaning of a thing like this?
 
 ASTA. [Looks at him.] Of what?
 
 ALLMERS. Of this that has been done to Rita and me.
 
 ASTA. The meaning of it?
 
 ALLMERS. [Impatiently.] Yes, the meaning, I say. For, after all, there
 must be a meaning in it. Life, existence--destiny, cannot be so utterly
 meaningless.
 
 ASTA. Oh, who can say anything with certainty about these things, my
 dear Alfred?
 
 ALLMERS. [Laughs bitterly.] No, no; I believe you are right there.
 Perhaps the whole thing goes simply by hap-hazard--taking its own
 course, like a drifting wreck without a rudder. I daresay that is how it
 is. At least, it seems very like it.
 
 ASTA. [Thoughtfully.] What if it only seems--?
 
 ALLMERS. [Vehemently.] Ah? Perhaps you can unravel the mystery for me?
 I certainly cannot. [More gently.] Here is Eyolf, just entering
 upon conscious life: full of such infinite possibilities--splendid
 possibilities perhaps: he would have filled my life with pride and
 gladness. And then a crazy old woman has only to come this way--and show
 a cur in a bag--
 
 ASTA. But we don't in the least know how it really happened.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, we do. The boys saw her row out over the fiord. They saw
 Eyolf standing alone at the very end of the pier. They saw him gazing
 after her--and then he seemed to turn giddy. [Quivering.] And that was
 how he fell over--and disappeared.
 
 ASTA. Yes, yes. But all the same--
 
 ALLMERS. She has drawn him down into the depths--that you may be sure
 of, dear.
 
 ASTA. But, Alfred, why should she?
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, that is just the question! Why should she? There is no
 retribution behind it all--no atonement, I mean. Eyolf never did her any
 harm. He never called names after her; he never threw stones at her dog.
 Why, he had never set eyes either on her or her dog till yesterday.
 So there is no retribution; the whole thing is utterly groundless and
 meaningless, Asta.--And yet the order of the world requires it.
 
 ASTA. Have you spoken to Rita of these things?
 
 ALLMERS. [Shakes his head.] I feel as if I can talk better to you about
 them. [Drawing a deep breath.] And about everything else as well.
 
 [ASTA takes serving-materials and a little paper parcel out of her
 pocket. ALLMERS sits looking on absently.]
 
 ALLMERS. What leave you got there, Asta?
 
 ASTA. [Taking his hat.] Some black crap.
 
 ALLMERS. Oh, whet is the use of that?
 
 ASTA. Rita asked me to put it on. May I?
 
 ALLMERS. Oh, yes; as far as I'm concerned--[She sews the crape on his
 hat.]
 
 ALLMERS. [Sitting and looking at her.] Where is Rita?
 
 ASTA. She is walking about the garden a little, I think. Borgheim is
 with her.
 
 ALLMERS. [Slightly surprised.] Indeed! Is Borgheim out here to-day
 again?
 
 ASTA. Yes. He came out by the mid-day train.
 
 ALLMERS. I didn't expect that.
 
 ASTA. [Serving.] He was so fond of Eyolf.
 
 ALLMERS. Borgheim is a faithful soul, Asta.
 
 ASTA. [With quiet warmth.] Yes, faithful he is, indeed. That is certain.
 
 ALLMERS. [Fixing his eyes upon her.] You are really fond of him?
 
 ASTA. Yes, I am.
 
 ALLMERS. And yet you cannot make up your mind to--?
 
 ASTA. [Interrupting.] Oh, my dear Alfred, don't talk of that!
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, yes; tell me why you cannot?
 
 ASTA. Oh, no! Please! You really must not ask me. You see, it's so
 painful for me.--There now! The hat is done.
 
 ALLMERS. Thank you.
 
 ASTA. And now for the left arm.
 
 ALLMERS. Am I to have crape on it too?
 
 ASTA. Yes, that is the custom.
 
 ALLMERS. Well--as you please.
 
 [She moves close up to him and begins to sew.]
 
 ASTA. Keep your arm still--then I won't prick you.
 
 ALLMERS. [With a half-smile.] This is like the old days.
 
 ASTA. Yes, don't you think so?
 
 ALLMERS. When you were a little girl you used to sit just like this,
 mending my clothes. The first thing you ever sewed for me--that was
 black crape, too.
 
 ASTA. Was it?
 
 ALLMERS. Round my student's cap--at the time of father's death.
 
 ASTA. Could I sew then? Fancy, I have forgotten it.
 
 ALLMERS. Oh, you were such a little thing then.
 
 ASTA. Yes, I was little then.
 
 ALLMERS. And then, two years afterwards--when we lost your mother--then
 again you sewed a big crape band on my sleeve.
 
 ASTA. I thought it was the right thing to do.
 
 ALLMERS. [Patting her hand.] Yes, yes, it was the right thing to do,
 Asta. And then when we were left alone in the world, we two--. Are you
 done already?
 
 ASTA. Yes. [Putting together her sewing-materials.] It was really a
 beautiful time for us, Alfred. We two alone.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, it was--though we had to toil so hard.
 
 ASTA. You toiled.
 
 ALLMERS. [With more life.] Oh, you toiled too, in your way, I can assure
 you--[smiling]--my dear, faithful--Eyolf.
 
 ASTA. Oh--you mustn't remind me of that stupid nonsense about the name.
 
 ALLMERS. Well, if you had been a boy, you would have been called Eyolf.
 
 ASTA. Yes, if! But when you began to go to college--. [Smiling
 involuntarily.] I wonder how you could be so childish.
 
 ALLMERS. Was it I that was childish?
 
 ASTA. Yes, indeed, I think it was, as I look back upon it all. You were
 ashamed of having no brother--only a sister.
 
 ALLMERS. No, no, it was you, dear--you were ashamed.
 
 ASTA. Oh yes, I too, perhaps--a little. And somehow or other I was sorry
 for you--
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, I believe you were. And then you hunted up some of my old
 boy's clothes--
 
 ASTA. Your fine Sunday clothes--yes. Do you remember the blue blouse and
 knickerbockers?
 
 ALLMERS. [His eyes dwelling upon her.] I remember so well how you looked
 when you used to wear them.
 
 ASTA. Only when we were at home, alone, though.
 
 ALLMERS. And how serious we were, dear, and how mightily pleased with
 ourselves. I always called you Eyolf.
 
 ASTA. Oh, Alfred, I hope you have never told Rita this?
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, I believe I did once tell her.
 
 ASTA. Oh, Alfred, how could you do that?
 
 ALLMERS. Well, you see--one tells one's wife everything--very nearly.
 
 ASTA. Yes, I suppose one does.
 
 ALLMERS. [As if awakening, clutches at his forehead and starts up.] Oh,
 how can I sit here and--
 
 ASTA. [Rising, looks sorrowfully at him.] What is the matter?
 
 ALLMERS. He had almost passed away from me. He had passed quite away.
 
 ASTA. Eyolf!
 
 ALLMERS. Here I sat, living in these recollections--and he had no part
 in them.
 
 ASTA. Yes, Alfred--little Eyolf was behind it all.
 
 ALLMERS. No, he was not. He slipped out of my memory--out of my
 thoughts. I did not see him for a moment as we sat here talking. I
 utterly forgot him all that time.
 
 ASTA. But surely you must take some rest in your sorrow.
 
 ALLMERS. No, no, no; that is just what I will not do! I must not--I
 have no right--and no heart for it, either. [Going in great excitement
 towards the right.] All my thoughts must be out there, where he lies
 drifting in the depths!
 
 ASTA. [Following him and holding him back.] Alfred--Alfred! Don't go to
 the fiord.
 
 ALLMERS. I must go out to him! Let me go, Asta! I will take the boat.
 
 ASTA. [In terror.] Don't go to the fiord, I say!
 
 ALLMERS. [Yielding.] No, no--I will not. Only let me alone.
 
 ASTA. [Leading him back to the table.] You must rest from your thoughts,
 Alfred. Come here and sit down.
 
 ALLMERS. [Making as if to seat himself on the bench.] Well, well--as you
 please.
 
 ASTA. No, I won't let you sit there.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, let me.
 
 ASTA. No, don't. For then you will only sit looking out--[Forces him
 down upon a chair, with his back to the right.] There now. Now that's
 right. [Seats herself upon the bench.] And now we can talk a little
 again.
 
 ALLMERS. [Drawing a deep breath audibly.] It was good to deaden the
 sorrow and heartache for a moment.
 
 ASTA. You insist do so, Alfred.
 
 ALLMERS. But don't you think it is terribly weak and unfeeling of me--to
 be able to do so?
 
 ASTA. Oh, no--I am sure it is impossible to keep circling for ever round
 one fixed thought.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, for me it is impossible. Before you came to me, here I
 sat, torturing myself unspeakably with this crushing, gnawing sorrow--
 
 ASTA. Yes?
 
 ALLMERS. And would you believe it, Asta--? H'm--
 
 ASTA. Well?
 
 ALLMERS. In the midst of all the agony, I found myself speculating what
 we should have for dinner to-day.
 
 ASTA. [Soothingly.] Well, well, if only it rests you to--
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, just fancy, dear--it seemed as if it did give me rest.
 [Holds out, his hand to her across the table.] How good it is, Asta,
 that I have you with me. I am so glad of that. Glad, glad--even in my
 sorrow.
 
 ASTA. [Looking earnestly at him.] You ought most of all to be glad that
 you have Rita.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, of course I should. But Rita is no kin to me--it isn't
 like having a sister.
 
 ASTA. [Eagerly.] Do you say that, Alfred?
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, our family is a thing apart. [Half jestingly.] We have
 always had vowels for our initials. Don't you remember how often we used
 to speak of that? And all our relations--all equally poor. And we have
 all the same colour of eyes.
 
 ASTA. Do you think I have--?
 
 ALLMERS. No, you take entirely after your mother. You are not in the
 least like the rest of us--not even like father. But all the same--
 
 ASTA. All the same--?
 
 ALLMERS. Well, I believe that living together has, as it were, stamped
 us in each other's image--mentally, I mean.
 
 ASTA. [With warm emotion.] Oh, you must never say that, Alfred. It is
 only I that have taken my stamp from you; and it is to you that I owe
 everything--every good thing in the world.
 
 ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] You owe me nothing, Asta. On the contrary--
 
 ASTA. I owe you everything! You must never doubt that. No sacrifice has
 been too great for you--
 
 ALLMERS. [Interrupting.] Oh, nonsense--sacrifice! Don't talk of such a
 thing.--I have only loved you, Asta, ever since you were a little child.
 [After a short pause.] And then it always seemed to me that I had so
 much injustice to make up to you for.
 
 ASTA. [Astonished.] Injustice? You?
 
 ALLMERS. Not precisely on my own account. But--
 
 ASTA. [Eagerly.] But--?
 
 ALLMERS. On father's.
 
 ASTA. [Half rising from the bench.] On--father's! [Sitting down again.]
 What do you mean by that, Alfred?
 
 ALLMERS. Father was never really kind to you.
 
 ASTA. [Vehemently.] Oh, don't say that!
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, it is true. He did not love you--not as he ought to have.
 
 ASTA. [Evasively.] No, perhaps not as he loved you. That was only
 natural.
 
 ALLMERS. [Continuing.] And he was often hard to your mother, too--at
 least in the last years.
 
 ASTA. [Softly.] Mother was so much, much younger than he--remember that.
 
 ALLMERS. Do you think they were not quite suited to each other?
 
 ASTA. Perhaps not.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, but still--. Father, who in other ways was so gentle and
 warm-hearted--so kindly towards every one--
 
 ASTA. [Quietly.] Mother, too, was not always as she ought to have been.
 
 ALLMERS. Your mother was not!
 
 ASTA. Perhaps not always.
 
 ALLMERS. Towards father, do you mean?
 
 ASTA. Yes.
 
 ALLMERS. I never noticed that.
 
 ASTA. [Struggling with her tears, rises.] Oh, my dear Alfred--let them
 rest--those who are gone. [She goes towards the right.]
 
 ALLMERS. [Rising.] Yes, let them rest. [Wringing his hands.] But those
 who are gone--it is they that won't let us rest, Asta. Neither day nor
 night.
 
 ASTA. [Looks warmly at him.] Time will make it all seem easier, Alfred.
 
 ALLMERS. [Looking helplessly at her.] Yes, don't you think it will?--But
 how I am to get over these terrible first days [Hoarsely.]--that is what
 I cannot imagine.
 
 ASTA. [Imploringly, laying her hands on his shoulders.] Go up to Rita.
 Oh, please do--
 
 ALLMERS. [Vehemently, withdrawing from her.] No, no, no--don't talk to
 me of that! I cannot, I tell you. [More calmly.] Let me remain here,
 with you.
 
 ASTA. Well, I will not leave you.
 
 ALLMERS. [Seizing her hand and holding it fast.] Thank you for that!
 [Looks out for a time over the fiord.] Where is my little Eyolf now?
 [Smiling sadly to her.] Can you tell me that my big, wise Eyolf?
 [Shaking his head.] No one in all the world can tell me that. I know
 only this one terrible thing--that he is gone from me.
 
 ASTA. [Looking up to the left, and withdrawing her hand.] Here they are
 coming.
 
 [MRS. ALLMERS and Engineer BORGHEIM come down by the wood-path, she
 leading the way. She wears a dark dress and a black veil over her head.
 He has an umbrella under his arm.]
 
 ALLMERS. [Going to meet her.] How is it with you, Rita?
 
 RITA. [Passing him.] Oh, don't ask.
 
 ALLMERS. Why do you come here?
 
 RITA. Only to look for you. What are you doing?
 
 ALLMERS. Nothing. Asta came down to me.
 
 RITA. Yes, but before Asta came? You have been away from me all the
 morning.
 
 ALLMERS. I have been sitting here looking out over the water.
 
 RITA. Ugh,--how can you?
 
 ALLMERS. [Impatiently.] I like best to be alone now.
 
 RITA. [Moving restlessly about.] And then to sit still! To stay in one
 place!
 
 ALLMERS. I have nothing in the world to move for.
 
 RITA. I cannot bear to be anywhere long. Least of all here--with the
 fiord at my very feet.
 
 ALLMERS. It is just the nearness of the fiord--
 
 RITA. [To BORGHEIM.] Don't you think he should come back with the rest
 of us?
 
 BORGHEIM. [To ALLMERS.] I believe it would be better for you.
 
 ALLMERS. No, no; let me stay where I am.
 
 RITA. Then I will stay with you, Alfred.
 
 ALLMERS. Very well; do so, then. You remain too, Asta.
 
 ASTA. [Whispers to BORGHEIM.] Let us leave them alone!
 
 BORGHEIM. [With a glance of comprehension.] Miss Allmers, shall we go a
 little further--along the shore? For the very last time?
 
 ASTA. [Taking her umbrella.] Yes, come. Let us go a little further.
 
 [ASTA and BORGHEIM go out together behind the boat-shed. ALLMERS wanders
 about for a little. Then he seats himself on a stone under the trees on
 the left.]
 
 RITA. [Comes up and stands before him, her hands folded and hanging
 down.] Can you think the thought, Alfred--that we have lost Eyolf?
 
 ALLMERS. [Looking sadly at the ground.] We must accustom ourselves to
 think it.
 
 RITA. I cannot. I cannot. And then that horrible sight that will haunt
 me all my life long.
 
 ALLMERS. [Looking up.] What sight? What have you seen?
 
 RITA. I have seen nothing myself. I have only heard it told. Oh--!
 
 ALLMERS. You may as well tell me at once.
 
 RITA. I got Borgheim to go down with me to the pier--
 
 ALLMERS. What did you want there?
 
 RITA. To question the boys as to how it happened.
 
 ALLMERS. But we know that.
 
 RITA. We got to know more.
 
 ALLMERS. Well?
 
 RITA. It is not true that he disappeared all at once.
 
 ALLMERS. Do they say that now?
 
 RITA. Yes. They say they saw him lying down on the bottom. Deep down in
 the clear water.
 
 ALLMERS. [Grinding his teeth.] And they didn't save him!
 
 RITA. I suppose they could not.
 
 ALLMERS. They could swim--every one of them. Did they tell you how he
 was lying whilst they could see him?
 
 RITA. Yes. They said he was lying on his back. And with great, open
 eyes.
 
 ALLMERS. Open eyes. But quite still?
 
 RITA. Yes, quite still. And then something came and swept him away. They
 called it the undertow.
 
 ALLMERS. [Nodding slowly.] So that was the last they saw of him.
 
 RITA. [Suffocated with tears.] Yes.
 
 ALLMERS. [In a dull voice.] And never--never will any one see him again.
 
 RITA. [Wailing.] I shall see him day and night, as he lay down there.
 
 ALLMERS. With great, open eyes.
 
 RITA. [Shuddering.] Yes, with great, open eyes. I see them! I see them
 now!
 
 ALLMERS. [Rises slowly and looks with quiet menace at her.] Were they
 evil, those eyes, Rita?
 
 RITA. [Turning pale.] Evil--!
 
 ALLMERS. [Going close up to her.] Were they evil eyes that stared up? Up
 from the depths?
 
 RITA. [Shrinking from him.] Alfred--!
 
 ALLMERS. [Following her.] Answer me! Were they a child's evil eyes?
 
 RITA. [Shrieks.] Alfred! Alfred!
 
 ALLMERS. Now things have come about--just as you wished, Rita.
 
 RITA. I! What did I wish?
 
 ALLMERS. That Eyolf were not here.
 
 RITA. Never for a moment have I wished that! That Eyolf should not stand
 between us--that was what I wished.
 
 ALLMERS. Well, well--he does not stand between us any more.
 
 RITA. [Softly, gazing straight before her.] Perhaps now more than ever.
 [With a sudden shudder.] Oh, that horrible sight!
 
 ALLMERS. [Nods.] The child's evil eyes.
 
 RITA. [In dread, recoiling from him.] Let me be, Alfred! I am afraid of
 you. I have never seen you like this before.
 
 ALLMERS. [Looks harshly and coldly at her.] Sorrow makes us wicked and
 hateful.
 
 RITA. [Terrified, and yet defiant.] That is what I feel, too.
 
 [ALLMERS goes towards the right and looks out over the fiord. RITA seats
 herself at the table. A short pause.]
 
 ALLMERS. [Turning his head towards her.] You never really and truly
 loved him--never!
 
 RITA. [With cold self-control.] Eyolf would never let me take him really
 and truly to my heart.
 
 ALLMERS. Because you did not want to.
 
 RITA. Oh yes, I did. I did want to. But some one stood in the way--even
 from the first.
 
 ALLMERS. [Turning right round.] Do you mean that _I_ stood in the way?
 
 RITA. Oh, no--not at first.
 
 ALLMERS. [Coming nearer her.] Who, then?
 
 RITA. His aunt.
 
 ALLMERS. Asta?
 
 RITA. Yes. Asta stood and barred the way for me.
 
 ALLMERS. Can you say that, Rita?
 
 RITA. Yes. Asta--she took him to her heart--from the moment that
 happened--that miserable fall.
 
 ALLMERS. If she did so, she did it in love.
 
 RITA. [Vehemently.] That is just it! I cannot endure to share anything
 with any one! Not in love.
 
 ALLMERS. We two should have shared him between us in love.
 
 RITA. [Looking scornfully at him.] We? Oh, the truth is you have never
 had any real love for him either.
 
 ALLMERS. [Looks at her in astonishment.] _I_ have not--!
 
 RITA. No, you have not. At first you were so utterly taken up by that
 book of yours--about Responsibility.
 
 ALLMERS. [Forcibly.] Yes, I was. But my very book--I sacrificed for
 Eyolf's sake.
 
 RITA. Not out of love for him.
 
 ALLMERS. Why then, do you suppose?
 
 RITA. Because you were consumed with mistrust of yourself. Because you
 had begun to doubt whether you had any great vocation to live for in the
 world.
 
 ALLMERS. [Observing her closely.] Could you see that in me?
 
 RITA. Oh, yes--little by little. And then you needed something new to
 fill up your life.--It seems _I_ was not enough for you any longer.
 
 ALLMERS. That is the law of change, Rita.
 
 RITA. And that was why you wanted to make a prodigy of poor little
 Eyolf.
 
 ALLMERS. That was not what I wanted. I wanted to make a happy human
 being of him.--That, and nothing more.
 
 RITA. But not out of love for him. Look into yourself! [With a certain
 shyness of expression.] Search out all that lies under--and behind your
 action.
 
 ALLMERS. [Avoiding her eyes.] There is something you shrink from saying.
 
 RITA. And you too.
 
 ALLMERS. [Looks thoughtfully at her.] If it is as you say, then we two
 have never really possessed our own child.
 
 RITA. No. Not in perfect love.
 
 ALLMERS. And yet we are sorrowing so bitterly for him.
 
 RITA. [With sarcasm.] Yes, isn't it curious that we should grieve like
 this over a little stranger boy?
 
 ALLMERS. [With an outburst.] Oh, don't call him a stranger!
 
 RITA. [Sadly shaking her head.] We never won the boy, Alfred. Not I--nor
 you either.
 
 ALLMERS. [Wringing his hands.] And now it is too late! Too late!
 
 RITA. And no consolation anywhere--in anything.
 
 ALLMERS. [With sudden passion.] You are the guilty one in this!
 
 RITA. [Rising.] I!
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, you! It was your fault that he became--what he was! It was
 your fault that he could not save himself when he fell into the water.
 
 RITA. [With a gesture of repulsion.] Alfred--you shall not throw the
 blame upon me!
 
 ALLMERS. [More and more beside himself.] Yes, yes, I do! It was you that
 left the helpless child unwatched upon the table.
 
 RITA. He was lying so comfortably among the cushions, and sleeping so
 soundly. And you had promised to look after him.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, I had. [Lowering his voice.] But then you came--you, you,
 you--and lured me to you.
 
 RITA. [Looking defiantly at him.] Oh, better own at once that you forgot
 the child and everything else.
 
 ALLMERS. [In suppressed desperation.] Yes, that is true. [Lower.] I
 forgot the child--in your arms!
 
 RITA. [Exasperated.] Alfred! Alfred--this is intolerable of you!
 
 ALLMERS. [In a low voice, clenching his fists before her face.] In that
 hour you condemned little Eyolf to death.
 
 RITA. [Wildly.] You, too! You, too--if it is as you say!
 
 ALLMERS. Oh yes--call me to account, too--if you will. We have sinned,
 both of us. And so, after all, there was retribution in Eyolf's death.
 
 RITA. Retribution?
 
 ALLMERS. [With more self-control.] Yes. Judgment upon you and me. Now,
 as we stand here, we have our deserts. While he lived, we let ourselves
 shrink away from him in secret, abject remorse. We could not bear to see
 it--the thing he had to drag with him--
 
 RITA. [Whispers.] The crutch.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, that. And now, what we now call sorrow and heartache--is
 really the gnawing of conscience, Rita. Nothing else.
 
 RITA. [Gazing helplessly at him.] I feel as if all this must end in
 despair--in madness for both of us. For we can never--never make it good
 again.
 
 ALLMERS. [Passing into a calmer mood.] I dreamed about Eyolf last night.
 I thought I saw him coming up from the pier. He could run like other
 boys. So nothing had happened to him--neither the one thing nor the
 other. And the torturing reality was nothing but a dream, I thought. Oh,
 how I thanked and blessed--[Checking himself.] H'm!
 
 RITA. [Looking at him.] Whom?
 
 ALLMERS. [Evasively.] Whom--?
 
 RITA. Yes; whom did you thank and bless?
 
 ALLMERS. [Putting aside the question.] I was only dreaming, you know--
 
 RITA. One whom you yourself do not believe in?
 
 ALLMERS. That was how I felt, all the same. Of course, I was sleeping--
 
 RITA. [Reproachfully.] You should not have taught me to doubt, Alfred.
 
 ALLMERS. Would it leave been right of me to let you go through life with
 your mind full of empty fictions?
 
 RITA. It would have been better for me; for then I should have had
 something to take refuge in. Now I am utterly at sea.
 
 ALLMERS. [Observing her closely.] If you had the choice now--. If you
 could follow Eyolf to where he is--?
 
 RITA. Yes? What then?
 
 ALLMERS. If you were fully assured that you would find him again--know
 him--understand him--?
 
 RITA. Yes, yes; what then?
 
 ALLMERS. Would you, of your own free will, take the leap over to him?
 Of your own free will leave everything behind you? Renounce your whole
 earthly life? Would you, Rita?
 
 RITA. [Softly.] Now, at once?
 
 ALLMERS. Yes; to-day. This very hour. Answer me--would you?
 
 RITA. [Hesitating.] Oh, I don't know, Alfred. No! I think I should have
 to stay here with you, a little while.
 
 ALLMERS. For my sake?
 
 RITA. Yes. Only for your sake.
 
 ALLMERS. And afterwards? Would you then--? Answer!
 
 RITA. Oh, what can I answer? I could not go away from you. Never! Never!
 
 ALLMERS. But suppose now _I_ went to Eyolf? And you had the fullest
 assurance that you would meet both him and me there. Then would you come
 over to us?
 
 RITA. I should want to--so much! so much! But--
 
 ALLMERS. Well? I I?
 
 RITA. [Moaning softly.] I could not--I feel it. No, no, I never could!
 Not for all the glory of heaven!
 
 ALLMERS. Nor I.
 
 RITA. No, you feel it so, too, don't you, Alfred! You could not either,
 could you?
 
 ALLMERS. No. For it is here, in the life of earth, that we living beings
 are at home.
 
 RITA. Yes, here lies the kind of happiness that we can understand.
 
 ALLMERS. [Darkly.] Oh, happiness--happiness--
 
 RITA. You mean that happiness--that we can never find it again? [Looks
 inquiringly at him.] But if--? [Vehemently.] No, no; I dare not say it!
 Nor even think it!
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, say it--say it, Rita.
 
 RITA. [Hesitatingly.] Could we not try to--? Would it not be possible to
 forget him?
 
 ALLMERS. Forget Eyolf?
 
 RITA. Forget the anguish and remorse, I mean.
 
 ALLMERS. Can you wish it?
 
 RITA. Yes,--if it were possible. [With an outburst.] For this--I cannot
 bear this for ever! Oh, can we not think of something that will bring
 its forgetfulness!
 
 ALLMERS. [Shakes his head.] What could that be?
 
 RITA. Could we not see what travelling would do--far away from here?
 
 ALLMERS. From home? When you know you are never really well anywhere but
 here.
 
 RITA. Well, then, let us have crowds of people about us! Keep open
 house! Plunge into something that can deaden and dull our thoughts!
 
 ALLMERS. Such it life would be impossible for me.--No,--rather than
 that, I would try to take up my work again.
 
 RITA. [Bitingly.] Your work--the work that has always stood like a dead
 wall between us!
 
 ALLMERS. [Slowly, looking fixedly at her.] There must always be a dead
 wall between us two, from this time forth.
 
 RITA. Why must there--?
 
 ALLMERS. Who knows but that a child's great, open eyes are watching us
 day and night.
 
 RITA. [Softly, shuddering.] Alfred--how terrible to think of!
 
 ALLMERS. Our love has been like a consuming fire. Now it must be
 quenched--
 
 RITA. [With a movement towards him.] Quenched!
 
 ALLMERS. [Hardly.] It is quenched--in one of us.
 
 RITA. [As if petrified.] And you dare say that to me!
 
 ALLMERS. [More gently.] It is dead, Rita. But in what I now feel for
 you--in our common guilt and need of atonement--I seem to foresee a sort
 of resurrection--
 
 RITA. [Vehemently.] I don't care a bit about any resurrection!
 
 ALLMERS. Rita!
 
 RITA. I am a warm-blooded being! I don't go drowsing about--with fishes'
 blood in my veins. [Wringing her hands.] And now to be imprisoned for
 life--in anguish and remorse! Imprisoned with one who is no longer mine,
 mine, mine!
 
 ALLMERS. It must have ended so, sometime, Rita.
 
 RITA. Must have ended so! The love that in the beginning rushed forth so
 eagerly to meet with love!
 
 ALLMERS. My love did not rush forth to you in the beginning.
 
 RITA. What did you feel for me, first of all?
 
 ALLMERS. Dread.
 
 RITA. That I can understand. How was it, then, that I won you after all?
 
 ALLMERS. [In a low voice.] You were so entrancingly beautiful, Rita.
 
 RITA. [Looks searchingly at him.] Then that was the only reason? Say it,
 Alfred! The only reason?
 
 ALLMERS. [Conquering himself.] No, there was another as well.
 
 RITA. [With an outburst.] I can guess what that was! It was "my gold,
 and my green forests," as you call it. Was it not so, Alfred?
 
 ALLMERS. Yes.
 
 RITA. [Looks at him with deep reproach.] How could you--how could you!
 
 ALLMERS. I had Asta to think of.
 
 RITA. [Angrily.] Yes, Asta! [Bitterly.] Then it was really Asta that
 brought us two together?
 
 ALLMERS. She knew nothing about it. She has no suspicion of it, even to
 this day.
 
 RITA. [Rejecting the plea.] It was Asta, nevertheless! [Smiling, with a
 sidelong glance of scorn. ] Or, no--it was little Eyolf. Little Eyolf,
 my dear!
 
 ALLMERS. Eyolf--?
 
 RITA. Yes, you used to call her Eyolf, did you not? I seem to remember
 your telling me so--once, in a moment of confidence. [Coming up to him.]
 Do you remember it--that entrancingly beautiful hour, Alfred?
 
 ALLMERS. [Recoiling, as if in horror.] I remember nothing! I will not
 remember!
 
 RITA. [Following him.] It was in that hour--when your other little Eyolf
 was crippled for life!
 
 ALLMERS. [In a hollow voice, supporting himself against the table.]
 Retribution!
 
 RITA. [Menacingly.] Yes, retribution!
 
 [ASTA and BORGHEIM return by way of the boat-shed. She is carrying some
 water-lilies in her hand.]
 
 RITA. [With self-control.] Well, Asta, have you and Mr. Borgheim talked
 things thoroughly over?
 
 ASTA. Oh, yes--pretty well.
 
 [She puts down her umbrella and lays the flowers upon a chair.]
 
 BORGHEIM. Miss Allmers has been very silent during our walk.
 
 RITA. Indeed, has she? Well, Alfred and I have talked things out
 thoroughly enough--
 
 ASTA. [Looking eagerly at both of them.] What is this--?
 
 RITA. Enough to last all our lifetime, I say. [Breaking off.] Come now,
 let us go up to the house, all four of us. We must have company about us
 in future. It will never do for Alfred and me to be alone.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, do you go ahead, you two. [Turning.] I must speak a word
 to you before we go, Asta.
 
 RITA. [Looking at him.] Indeed? Well then, you come with me, Mr.
 Borgheim.
 
 [RITA and BORGHEIM go up the wood-path.]
 
 ASTA. [Anxiously.] Alfred, what is the matter?
 
 ALLMERS. [Darkly.] Only that I cannot endure to be here any more.
 
 ASTA. Here! With Rita, do you mean?
 
 ALLMERS. Yes. Rita and I cannot go on living together.
 
 ASTA. [Seizes his arm and shakes it.] Oh, Alfred--don't say anything so
 terrible!
 
 ALLMERS. It is the truth. I am telling you. We are making each other
 wicked and hateful.
 
 ASTA. [With painful emotion.] I had never--never dreamt of anything like
 this!
 
 ALLMERS. I did not realise it either, till to-day.
 
 ASTA. And now you want to--! What is it you really want, Alfred?
 
 ALLMERS. I want to get away from everything here--far, far away from it
 all.
 
 ASTA. And to stand quite alone in the world?
 
 ALLMERS. [Nods.] As I used to, before, yes.
 
 ASTA. But you are not fitted for living alone!
 
 ALLMERS. Oh, yes. I was so in the old days, at any rate.
 
 ASTA. In the old days, yes; for then you had me with you.
 
 ALLMERS. [Trying to take her hand.] Yes. And it is to you, Asta, that I
 now want to come home again.
 
 ASTA. [Eluding him.] To me! No, no, Alfred! That is quite impossible.
 
 ALLMERS. [Looks sadly at her.] Then Borgheim stands in the way after
 all?
 
 ASTA. [Earnestly.] No, no; he does not! That is quite a mistake!
 
 ALLMERS. Good. Then I will come to you--my dear, dear sister. I must
 come to you again--home to you, to be purified and ennobled after my
 life with--
 
 ASTA. [Shocked.] Alfred,--you are doing Rita a great wrong!
 
 ALLMERS. I have done her a great wrong. But not in this. Oh, think of
 it, Asta--think of our life together, yours and mine. Was it not like
 one long holy-day from first to last?
 
 ASTA. Yes, it was, Alfred. But we can never live it over again.
 
 ALLMERS. [Bitterly.] Do you mean that marriage has so irreparably ruined
 me?
 
 ASTA. [Quietly.] No, that is not what I mean.
 
 ALLMERS. Well, then we two will live our old life over again.
 
 ASTA. [With decision.] We cannot, Alfred.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, we can. For the love of a brother and sister--
 
 ASTA. [Eagerly.] What of it?
 
 ALLMERS. That is the only relation in life that is not subject to the
 law of change.
 
 ASTA. [Softly and tremblingly.] But if that relation were not--
 
 ALLMERS. Not--?
 
 ASTA.--not our relation?
 
 ALLMERS. [Stares at her in astonishment.] Not ours? Why, what can you
 mean by that?
 
 ASTA. It is best I should tell you at once, Alfred.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, yes; tell me!
 
 ASTA. The letters to mother--. Those in my portfolio--
 
 ALLMERS. Well?
 
 ASTA. You must read them--when I am gone.
 
 ALLMERS. Why must I?
 
 ASTA. [Struggling with herself.] For then you will see that--
 
 ALLMERS. Well?
 
 ASTA.--that I have no right to bear your father's name.
 
 ALLMERS. [Staggering backwards.] Asta! What is this you say!
 
 ASTA. Read the letters. Then you will see--and understand. And perhaps
 have some forgiveness--for mother, too.
 
 ALLMERS. [Clutching at his forehead.] I cannot grasp this--I cannot
 realise the thought. You, Asta--you are not--
 
 ASTA. You are not my brother, Alfred.
 
 ALLMERS. [Quickly, half defiantly, looking at her.] Well, but what
 difference does that really make in our relation? Practically none at
 all.
 
 ASTA. [Shaking her head.] It makes all the difference, Alfred. Our
 relation is not that of brother and sister.
 
 ALLMERS. No, no. But it is none the less sacred for that--it will always
 be equally sacred.
 
 ASTA. Do not forget--that it is subject to the law of change, as you
 said just now.
 
 ALLMERS. [Looks inquiringly at her.] Do you mean that--
 
 ASTA. [Quietly, but with rearm emotion.] Not a word more--my dear,
 dear Alfred. [Takes up the flowers from the chair.] Do you see these
 water-lilies?
 
 ALLMERS. [Nodding slowly.] They are the sort that shoot up--from the
 very depth.
 
 ASTA. I pulled them in the tarn--where it flows out into the fiord.
 [Holds them out to him.] Will you take them, Alfred?
 
 ALLMERS. [Taking them.] Thanks.
 
 ASTA. [With tears in her eyes.] They are a last greeting to you,
 from--from little Eyolf.
 
 ALLMERS. [Looking at her.] From Eyolf out yonder? Or from you?
 
 ASTA. [Softly.] From both of us. [Taking up her umbrella.] Now come with
 me to Rita.
 
 [She goes up the wood-path.]
 
 ALLMERS. [Takes up his hat from the table, and whispers sadly.] Asta.
 Eyolf. Little Eyolf--!
 
 [He follows her up the path.]
 
 
 
 
 ACT THIRD
 
 [An elevation, overgrown with shrubs, in ALLMERS'S garden. At the back
 a sheer cliff, with a railing along its edge, and with steps on the left
 leading downwards. An extensive view over the fiord, which lies deep
 below. A flagstaff with lines, but no flag, stands by the railing. In
 front, on the right, a summer-house, covered with creepers and wild
 vines. Outside it, a bench. It is a late summer evening, with clear sky.
 Deepening twilight.]
 
 [ASTA is sitting on the bench, with her hands in her lap. She is wearing
 her outdoor dress and a hat, has her parasol at her side, and a little
 travelling-bag on a strap over her shoulder.]
 
 [BORGHEIM comes up from the back on the left. He, too, has a
 travelling-bag over his shoulder. He is carrying a rolled-up flag.]
 
 BORGHEIM. [Catching sight of ASTA.] Oh, so you are up here!
 
 ASTA. Yes, I am taking my last look out over the fiord.
 
 BORGHEIM. Then I am glad I happened to come up.
 
 ASTA. Have you been searching for me?
 
 BORGHEIM. Yes, I have. I wanted to say good-bye to you for the present.
 Not for good and all, I hope.
 
 ASTA. [With a faint smile.] You are persevering.
 
 BORGHEIM. A road-maker has got to be.
 
 ASTA. Have you seen anything of Alfred? Or of Rita?
 
 BORGHEIM. Yes, I saw them both.
 
 ASTA. Together?
 
 BORGHEIM. No--apart.
 
 ASTA. What are you going to do with that flag?
 
 BORGHEIM. Mrs. Allmers asked me to come up and hoist it.
 
 ASTA. Hoist a flag just now?
 
 BORGHEIM. Half-mast high. She wants it to fly both night and day, she
 says.
 
 ASTA. [Sighing.] Poor Rita! And poor Alfred!
 
 BORGHEIM. [Busied with the flag.] Have you the heart to leave them? I
 ask, because I see you are in travelling-dress.
 
 ASTA. [In a low voice.] I must go.
 
 BORGHEIM. Well, if you must, then--
 
 ASTA. And you are going, too, to-night?
 
 BORGHEIM. I must, too. I am going by the train. Are you going that way?
 
 ASTA. No. I shall take the steamer.
 
 BORGHEIM. [Glancing at her.] We each take our own way, then?
 
 ASTA. Yes.
 
 [She sits and looks on while he hoists the flag half-mast high. When he
 has done he goes up to her.]
 
 BORGHEIM. Miss Asta--you can't think how grieved I am about little
 Eyolf.
 
 ASTA. [Looks up at him.] Yes, I am sure you feel it deeply.
 
 BORGHEIM. And the feeling tortures me. For the fact is, grief is not
 much in my way.
 
 ASTA. [Raising her eyes to the flag.] It will pass over in time--all of
 it. All our sorrow.
 
 BORGHEIM. All? Do you believe that?
 
 ASTA. Like a squall at sea. When once you have got far away from here,
 then--
 
 BORGHEIM. It will have to be very far away indeed.
 
 ASTA. And then you have this great new road-work, too.
 
 BORGHEIM. But no one to help me in it.
 
 ASTA. Oh yes, surely you have.
 
 BORGHEIM. [Shaking his head.] No one. No one to share the gladness with.
 For it is gladness that most needs sharing.
 
 ASTA. Not the labour and trouble?
 
 BORGHEIM. Pooh--that sort of thing one can always get through alone.
 
 ASTA. But the gladness--that must be shared with some one, you think?
 
 BORGHEIM. Yes; for if not, where would be the pleasure in being glad?
 
 ASTA. Ah yes--perhaps there is something in that.
 
 BORGHEIM. Oh, of course, for a certain time you can go on feeling glad
 in your own heart. But it won't do in the long run. No, it takes two to
 be glad.
 
 ASTA. Always two? Never more? Never many?
 
 BORGHEIM. Well, you see--then it becomes a quite different matter. Miss
 Asta--are you sure you can never make up your mind to share gladness and
 success and--and labour and trouble, with one--with one alone in all the
 world?
 
 ASTA. I have tried it--once.
 
 BORGHEIM. Have you?
 
 ASTA. Yes, all the time that my brother--that Alfred and I lived
 together.
 
 BORGHEIM. Oh, with your brother, yes. But that is altogether different.
 That ought rather to be called peace than happiness, I should say.
 
 ASTA. It was delightful, all the same.
 
 BORGHEIM. There now--you see even that seemed to you delightful. But
 just think now--if he had not been your brother!
 
 ASTA. [Makes a movement to rise, but remains sitting.] Then we should
 never have been together. For I was a child then--and he wasn't much
 more.
 
 BORGHEIM. [After a pause.] Was it so delightful--that time?
 
 ASTA. Oh yes, indeed it was.
 
 BORGHEIM. Was there much that was really bright and happy in your life
 then?
 
 ASTA. Oh yes, so much. You cannot think how much.
 
 BORGHEIM. Tell me a little about it, Miss Asta.
 
 ASTA. Oh, there are only trifles to tell.
 
 BORGHEIM. Such as--? Well?
 
 ASTA. Such as the time when Alfred had passed his examination--and had
 distinguished himself. And then, from time, to time, when he got a post
 in some school or other. Or when he would sit at home working at an
 article--and would read it aloud to me. And then when it would appear in
 some magazine.
 
 BORGHEIM. Yes, I can quite see that it must have been a peaceful,
 delightful life--a brother and sister sharing all their joys. [Shaking
 his head.] What I cannot understand is that your brother could ever give
 you up, Asta.
 
 ASTA. [With suppressed emotion.] Alfred married, you know.
 
 BORGHEIM. Was not that very hard for you?
 
 ASTA. Yes, at first. It seemed as though I had utterly lost him all at
 once.
 
 BORGHEIM. Well, luckily it was not so bad as that.
 
 ASTA. No.
 
 BORGHEIM. But, all the same--how could he! Go and marry, I mean--when he
 could have kept you with him, alone!
 
 ASTA. [Looking straight in front of her.] He was subject to the law of
 change, I suppose.
 
 BORGHEIM. The law of change?
 
 ASTA. So Alfred calls it.
 
 BORGHEIM. Pooh--what a stupid law that must be! I don't believe a bit in
 that law.
 
 ASTA. [Rising.] You may come to believe in it, in time.
 
 BORGHEIM. Never in all my life! [Insistently.] But listen now, Miss
 Asta! Do be reasonable for once in a way--in this matter, I mean--
 
 ASTA. [Interrupting him.] Oh, no, no--don't let us begin upon that
 again!
 
 BORGHEIM. [Continuing as before.] Yes, Asta--I can't possibly give you
 up so easily. Now your brother has everything as he wishes it. He can
 live his life quite contentedly without you. He doesn't require you at
 all. Then this--this--that at one blow has changed your whole position
 here--
 
 ASTA. [With a start.] What do you mean by that?
 
 BORGHEIM. The loss of the child. What else should I mean?
 
 ASTA. [Recovering her self-control.] Little Eyolf is gone, yes.
 
 BORGHEIM. And what more does that leave you to do here? You have not the
 poor little boy to take care of now. You have no duties--no claims upon
 you of any sort.
 
 ASTA. Oh, please, Mr. Borgheim--don't make it so hard for me.
 
 BORGHEIM. I must; I should be mad if I did not try my uttermost. I
 shall be leaving town before very long, rind perhaps I shall have no
 opportunity of meeting you there. Perhaps I shall not see you again for
 a long, long time. And who knows what may happen in the meanwhile?
 
 ASTA. [With a grave smile.] So you are afraid of the law of change,
 after all?
 
 BORGHEIM. No, not in the least. [Laughing bitterly.] And there is
 nothing to be changed, either--not in you. I mean. For I can see you
 don't care much about me.
 
 ASTA. You know very well that I do.
 
 BORGHEIM. Perhaps, but not nearly enough. Not as I want you to. [More
 forcibly.] By Heaven, Asta--Miss Asta--I cannot tell you how strongly I
 feel that you are wrong in this! A little onward, perhaps, from to-day
 and to-morrow, all life's happiness may be awaiting us. And we must
 needs pass it by! Do you think we will not come to repent of it, Asta?
 
 ASTA. [Quietly.] I don't know. I only know that they are not for us--all
 these bright possibilities.
 
 BORGHEIM. [Looks at her with self-control.] Then I must make my roads
 alone?
 
 ASTA. [Warmly.] Oh, how I wish I could stand by you in it all! Help you
 in the labour--share the gladness with you--
 
 BORGHEIM. Would you--if you could?
 
 ASTA. Yes, that I would.
 
 BORGHEIM. But you cannot?
 
 ASTA. [Looking down.] Would you be content to have only half of me?
 
 BORGHEIM. No. You must be utterly and entirely mine.
 
 ASTA. [Looks at him, and says quietly.] Then I cannot.
 
 BORGHEIM. Good-bye then, Miss Asta.
 
 [He is on the point of going. ALLMERS comes up from the left at the
 back. BORGHEIM stops.]
 
 ALLMERS. [The moment he has reached the top of the steps, points, and
 says in a low voice.] Is Rita in there--in the summer-house?
 
 BORGHEIM. No; there is no one here but Miss Asta.
 
 [ALLMERS comes forward.]
 
 ASTA. [Going towards him.] Shall I go down and look for her? Shall I get
 her to come up here?
 
 ALLMERS. [With a negative gesture.] No, no, no--let it alone. [To
 BORGHEIM.] Is it you that have hoisted the flag?
 
 BORGHEIM. Yes. Mrs. Allmers asked me to. That was what brought me up
 here.
 
 ALLMERS. And you are going to start to-night?
 
 BORGHEIM. Yes. To-night I go away in good earnest.
 
 ALLMERS. [With a glance at ASTA.] And you have made sure of pleasant
 company, I daresay.
 
 BORGHEIM. [Shaking his head.] I am going alone.
 
 ALLMERS. [With surprise.] Alone!
 
 BORGHEIM. Utterly alone.
 
 ALLMERS. [Absently.] Indeed?
 
 BORGHEIM. And I shall have to remain alone, too.
 
 ALLMERS. There is something horrible in being alone. The thought of it
 runs like ice through my blood--
 
 ASTA. Oh, but, Alfred, you are not alone.
 
 ALLMERS. There may be something horrible in that too, Asta.
 
 ASTA. [Oppressed.] Oh, don't talk like that! Don't think like that!
 
 ALLMERS. [Not listening to her.] But since you are not going with him--?
 Since there is nothing to bind you--? Why will you not remain out here
 with me--and with Rita?
 
 ASTA. [Uneasily.] No, no, I cannot. I must go back to town now.
 
 ALLMERS. But only in to town, Asta. Do you hear!
 
 ASTA. Yes.
 
 ALLMERS. And you must promise me that you will soon come out again.
 
 ASTA. [Quickly.] No, no, I dare not promise you that, for the present.
 
 ALLMERS. Well as you will. We shall soon meet in town, then.
 
 ASTA. [Imploringly.] But, Alfred, you must stay at home here with Rita
 now.
 
 ALLMERS. [Without answering, turns to BORGHEIM.] You may find it a good
 thing, after all, that you have to take your journey alone.
 
 BORGHEIM. [Annoyed.] Oh, how can you say such a thing?
 
 ALLMERS. You see, you can never tell whom you might happen to meet
 afterwards--on the way.
 
 ASTA. [Involuntarily.] Alfred!
 
 ALLMERS. The right fellow-traveller--when it is too late--too late.
 
 ASTA. [Softly, quivering.] Alfred! Alfred!
 
 BORGHEIM. [Looking front one to the other.] What is the meaning of this?
 I don't understand--
 
 [RITA comes up from the left at the back.]
 
 RITA. [Plaintively.] Oh, don't go away from me, all of you!
 
 ASTA. [Going towards her.] You said you preferred to be alone.
 
 RITA. Yes, but I dare not. It is getting so horribly dark. I seem to see
 great, open eyes fixed upon me!
 
 ASTA. [Tenderly and sympathetically.] What if it were so, Rita? You
 ought not to be afraid of those eyes.
 
 RITA. How can you say so! Not afraid!
 
 ALLMERS. [Insistently.] Asta, I beg you--for Heaven's sake--remain here
 with Rita!
 
 RITA. Yes! And with Alfred, too. Do! Do, Asta!
 
 ASTA. [Struggling with herself.] Oh, I want to so much--
 
 RITA. Well, then, do it! For Alfred and I cannot go alone through the
 sorrow and heartache.
 
 ALLMERS. [Darkly.] Say, rather--through the ranklings of remorse.
 
 RITA. Oh, whatever you like to call it--we cannot bear it alone, we two.
 Oh, Asta, I beg and implore you! Stay here and help us! Take Eyolf's
 place for us--
 
 ASTA. [Shrinking.] Eyolf's--
 
 RITA. Yes, would you not have it so, Alfred?
 
 ALLMERS. If she can and will.
 
 RITA. You used to call her your little Eyolf. [Seizes her hand.]
 Henceforth you shall be our Eyolf, Asta! Eyolf, as you were before.
 
 ALLMERS. [With concealed emotion.] Remain--and share our life with us,
 Asta. With Rita. With me. With me--your brother!
 
 ASTA. [With decision, snatches her hand away.] No. I cannot. [Turning.]
 Mr. Borgheim--what time does the steamer start?
 
 BORGHEIM. Now--at once.
 
 ASTA. Then I must go on board. Will you go with me?
 
 BORGHEIM. [With a suppressed outburst of joy.] Will I? Yes, yes!
 
 ASTA. Then come!
 
 RITA. [Slowly.] Ah! That is how it is. Well, then, you cannot stay with
 us.
 
 ASTA. [Throwing her arms round her neck.] Thanks for everything, Rita!
 (Goes up to ALLMERS and grasps his hand.) Alfred-good-bye! A thousand
 times, good-bye!
 
 ALLMERS. [Softly and eagerly.] What is this, Asta? It seems as though you
 were taking flight.
 
 ASTA. [In subdued anguish.] Yes, Alfred--I am taking flight.
 
 ALLMERS. Flight--from me!
 
 ASTA. [Whispering.] From you--and from myself.
 
 ALLMERS. [Shrinking back.] Ah--!
 
 [ASTA rushes down the steps at the back. BORGHEIM waves his hat and
 follows her. RITA leans against the entrance to the summer-house.
 ALLMERS goes, in strong inward emotion, up to the railing, and stands
 there gazing downwards. A pause.]
 
 ALLMERS. [Turns, and says with hard-won composure.] There comes the
 steamer. Look, Rita.
 
 RITA. I dare not look at it.
 
 ALLMERS. You dare not?
 
 RITA. No. For it has a red eye--and a green one, too. Great, glowing
 eyes.
 
 ALLMERS. Oh, those are only the lights, you know.
 
 RITA. Henceforth they are eyes--for me. They stare and stare out of the
 darkness--and into the darkness.
 
 ALLMERS. Now she is putting in to shore.
 
 RITA. Where are they mooring her this evening, then?
 
 ALLMERS. [Coming forward.] At the pier, as usual--
 
 RITA. [Drawing herself up.] How can they moor her there!
 
 ALLMERS. They must.
 
 RITA. But it was there that Eyolf--! How can they moor her there!
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, life is pitiless, Rita.
 
 RITA. Men are heartless. They take no thought--whether for the living or
 for the dead.
 
 ALLMERS. There you are right. Life goes its own way--just as if nothing
 in the world had happened.
 
 RITA. [Gazing straight before her.] And nothing has happened, either.
 Not to others. Only to us two.
 
 ALLMERS. [The pain re-awakening.] Yes, Rita--so it was to no purpose
 that you bore him in sorrow and anguish. For now he is gone again--and
 has left no trace behind him.
 
 RITA. Only the crutch was saved.
 
 ALLMERS. [Angrily.] Be silent! Do not let me hear that word!
 
 RITA. [Plaintively.] Oh, I cannot bear the thought that he is gone from
 us.
 
 ALLMERS. [Coldly and bitterly.] You could very well do without him while
 he was with us. Half the day would often pass without your setting eyes
 on him.
 
 RITA. Yes, for I knew that I could see him whenever I wanted to.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, that is how we have gone and squandered the short time we
 had with Little Eyolf.
 
 RITA. [Listening, in dread.] Do you hear, Alfred! Now it is ringing
 again!
 
 ALLMERS. [Looking over the fiord.] It is the steamer's bell that is
 ringing. She is just starting.
 
 RITA. Oh, it's not that bell I mean. All day I have heard it ringing in
 my ears.--Now it is ringing again!
 
 ALLMERS. [Going up to her.] You are mistaken, Rita.
 
 RITA. No, I hear it so plainly. It sounds like a knell. Slow. Slow. And
 always the same words.
 
 ALLMERS. Words? What words?
 
 RITA. [Nodding her head in the rhythm.] "The crutch is--floating. The
 crutch is--floating." Oh, surely you must hear it, too!
 
 ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] I hear nothing. And there is nothing to
 hear.
 
 RITA. Oh, you may say what you will--I hear it so plainly.
 
 ALLMERS. [Looking out over the railing.] Now they are on board, Rita.
 Now the steamer is on her way to the town.
 
 RITA. Is it possible you do not hear it? "The crutch is--floating. The
 crutch is ------"
 
 ALLMERS. [Coming forward.] You shall not stand there listening to a
 sound that does not exist. I tell You, Asta and Borgheim are on board.
 They have started already. Asta is gone.
 
 RITA. [Looks timidly at him.] Then I suppose you will soon be gone, too,
 Alfred?
 
 ALLMERS. [Quickly.] What do you mean by that?
 
 RITA. That you will follow your sister.
 
 ALLMERS. Has Asta told you anything?
 
 RITA. No. But you said yourself it was for Asta's sake that--that we
 came together.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes, but you, you yourself, have bound me to you--by our life
 together.
 
 RITA. Oh, in your eyes I am not--I am not--entrancingly beautiful any
 more.
 
 ALLMERS. The law of change may perhaps keep us together, none the less.
 
 RITA. [Nodding slowly.] There is a change in me now--I feel the anguish
 of it.
 
 ALLMERS. Anguish?
 
 RITA. Yes, for change, too, is a sort of birth.
 
 ALLMERS. It is--or a resurrection. Transition to a higher life.
 
 RITA. [Gazing sadly before her.] Yes--with the loss of all, all life's
 happiness.
 
 ALLMERS. That loss is just the gain.
 
 RITA. [Vehemently.] Oh, phrases! Good God, we are creatures of earth
 after all.
 
 ALLMERS. But something akin to the sea and the heavens too, Rita.
 
 RITA. You perhaps. Not I.
 
 ALLMERS. Oh, yes--you too, more than you yourself suspect.
 
 RITA. [Advancing a pace towards him.] Tell me, Alfred--could you think
 of taking up your work again?
 
 ALLMERS. The work that you have hated so?
 
 RITA. I am easier to please now. I am willing to share you with the
 book.
 
 ALLMERS. Why?
 
 RITA. Only to keep you here with me--to have you near me.
 
 ALLMERS. Oh, it is so little I can do to help you, Rita.
 
 RITA. But perhaps I could help you.
 
 ALLMERS. With my book, do you mean?
 
 RITA. No; but to live your life.
 
 ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] I seem to have no life to live.
 
 RITA. Well then, to endure your life.
 
 ALLMERS. [Darkly, looking away from her.] I think it would be best for
 both of us that we should part.
 
 RITA. [Looking curiously at him.] Then where would you go? Perhaps to
 Asta, after all?
 
 ALLMERS. No--never again to Asta.
 
 RITA. Where then?
 
 ALLMERS. Up into the solitudes.
 
 RITA. Up among the mountains? Is that what you mean?
 
 ALLMERS. Yes.
 
 RITA. But all that is mere dreaming, Alfred! You could not live up
 there.
 
 ALLMERS. And yet I feel myself drawn to them.
 
 RITA. Why? Tell me!
 
 ALLMERS. Sit down--and I will tell you something.
 
 RITA. Something that happened to you up there?
 
 ALLMERS. Yes.
 
 RITA. And that you never told Asta and me?
 
 ALLMERS. Yes.
 
 RITA. Oh, you are so silent about everything. You ought not to be.
 
 ALLMERS. Sit down there--and I will tell you about it.
 
 RITA. Yes, yes--tell me!
 
 [She sits on the bench beside the summer-house.]
 
 ALLMERS. I was alone up there, in the heart of the great mountains. I
 came to a wide, dreary mountain lake; and that lake I had to cross. But
 I could not--for there was neither a boat nor any one there.
 
 RITA. Well? And then?
 
 ALLMERS. Then I went without any guidance into a side valley. I thought
 that by that way I could push on over the heights and between the
 peaks--and then down again on the other side of the lake.
 
 RITA. Oh, and you lost yourself, Alfred!
 
 ALLMERS. Yes; I mistook the direction--for there was no path or track.
 And all day I went on--and all the next night. And at last I thought I
 should never see the face of man again.
 
 RITA. Not come home to us? Oh, then, I am sure your thoughts were with
 us here.
 
 ALLMERS. No--they were not.
 
 RITA. Not?
 
 ALLMERS. No. It was so strange. Both you and Eyolf seemed to have
 drifted far, far away from me--and Asta, too.
 
 RITA. Then what did you think of?
 
 ALLMERS. I did not think. I dragged myself along among the
 precipices--and revelled in the peace and luxury of death.
 
 RITA. [Springing up.] Oh, don't speak in that way of that horror!
 
 ALLMERS. I did not feel it so. I had no fear. Here went death and I,
 it seemed to me, like two good fellow-travellers. It all seemed so
 natural--so simple, I thought. In my family, we don't live to be old--
 
 RITA. Oh, don't say such things, Alfred! You see you came safely out of
 it, after all.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes; all of a sudden, I found myself where I wanted to be--on
 the other side of the lake.
 
 RITA. It must have been a night of terror for you, Alfred. But now that
 it is over, you will not admit it to yourself.
 
 ALLMERS. That night sealed my resolution. And it was then that I turned
 about and came straight homewards. To Eyolf.
 
 RITA. [Softly.] Too late.
 
 ALLMERS. Yes. And then when--my fellow-traveller came and took him--then
 I felt the horror of it; of it all; of all that, in spite of everything,
 we dare not tear ourselves away from. So earthbound are we, both of us,
 Rita.
 
 RITA. [With a gleam of joy.] Yes, you are, too, are you not! [Coming
 close to him.] Oh, let us live our life together as long as we can!
 
 ALLMERS. [Shrugging his shoulders.] Live our life, yes! And have nothing
 to fill life with. An empty void on all sides--wherever I look.
 
 RITA. [In fear.] Oh, sooner or later you will go away from me, Alfred! I
 feel it! I can see it in your face! You will go away from me.
 
 ALLMERS. With my fellow-traveller, do you mean?
 
 RITA. No, I mean worse than that. Of your own free will--you will leave
 me--for you think it's only here, with me, that you have nothing to live
 for. Is not that what is in your thoughts?
 
 ALLMERS. [Looking steadfastly at her.] What if it were--?
 
 [A disturbance, and the noise of angry, quarrelling voices is heard from
 down below, in the distance. ALLMERS goes to the railing.]
 
 RITA. What is that? [With an outburst.] Oh, you'll see, they have found
 him!
 
 ALLMERS. He will never be found.
 
 RITA. But what is it then?
 
 ALLMERS. [Coming forward.] Only fighting--as usual.
 
 RITA. Down on the beach?
 
 ALLMERS. Yes. The whole village down there ought to be swept away. Now
 the men have come home--drunk, as they always are. They are beating the
 children--do you hear the boys crying! The women are shrieking for help
 for them--
 
 RITA. Should we not get some one to go down and help them?
 
 ALLMERS. [Harshly and angrily.] Help them, who did not help Eyolf! Let
 them go--as they let Eyolf go.
 
 RITA. Oh, you must not talk like that, Alfred! Nor think like that!
 
 ALLMERS. I cannot think otherwise. All the old hovels ought to be torn
 down.
 
 RITA. And then what is to become of all the poor people?
 
 ALLMERS. They must go somewhere else.
 
 RITA. And the children, too?
 
 ALLMERS. Does it make much difference where they go to the dogs?
 
 RITA. [Quietly and reproachfully.] You are forcing yourself into this
 harshness, Alfred.
 
 ALLMERS. [Vehemently.] I have a right to be harsh now! It is my duty.
 
 RITA. Your duty?
 
 ALLMERS. My duty to Eyolf. He must not lie unavenged. Once for all,
 Rita--it is as I tell you! Think it over! Have the whole place down
 there razed to the ground--when I am gone.
 
 RITA. [Looks intently at him.] When you are gone?
 
 ALLMERS. Yes. For that will at least give you something to fill your
 life with--and something you must have.
 
 RITA. [Firmly and decidedly.] There you are right---I must. But can you
 guess what I will set about--when you are gone?
 
 ALLMERS. Well, what?
 
 RITA. [Slowly and with resolution.] As soon as you are gone from me,
 I will go down to the beach, and bring all the poor neglected children
 home with me. All the mischievous boys--
 
 ALLMERS. What will you do with them here?
 
 RITA. I will take them to my heart.
 
 ALLMERS. You!
 
 RITA. Yes, I will. From the day you leave me, they shall all be here,
 all of them, as if they were mine.
 
 ALLMERS. [Shocked.] In our little Eyolf's place!
 
 RITA. Yes, in our little Eyolf's place. They shall live in Eyolf's
 rooms. They shall read his books. They shall play with his toys. They
 shall take it in turns to sit in his chair at table.
 
 ALLMERS. But this is sheer madness in you! I do not know a creature in
 the world that is less fitted than you for anything of that sort.
 
 RITA. Then I shall have to educate myself for it; to train myself; to
 discipline myself.
 
 ALLMERS. If you are really in earnest about this--about all you
 say--then there must indeed be a change in you.
 
 RITA. Yes, there is, Alfred--and for that I have you to thank. You
 have made an empty place within me; and I must try to fill it up with
 something--with something that is a little like love.
 
 ALLMERS. [Stands for a moment lost in thought; then looks at her.] The
 truth is, we have not done much for the poor people down there.
 
 RITA. We have done nothing for them.
 
 ALLMERS. Scarcely even thought of them.
 
 RITA. Never thought of them in sympathy.
 
 ALLMERS. We, who had "the gold, and the green forests"--
 
 RITA. Our hands were closed to them. And our hearts too.
 
 ALLMERS. [Nods.] Then it was perhaps natural enough, after all, that
 they should not risk their lives to save little Eyolf.
 
 RITA. [Softly.] Think, Alfred! Are you so certain that--that we would
 have risked ours?
 
 ALLMERS. [With an uneasy gesture of repulsion.] You must never doubt
 that.
 
 RITA. Oh, we are children of earth.
 
 ALLMERS. What do you really think you can do with all these neglected
 children?
 
 RITA. I suppose I must try if I cannot lighten and--and ennoble their
 lot in life.
 
 ALLMERS. If you can do that--then Eyolf was not born in vain.
 
 RITA. Nor taken from us in vain, either.
 
 ALLMERS. [Looking steadfastly at her.] Be quite clear about one thing,
 Rita--it is not love that is driving you to this.
 
 RITA. No, it is not--at any rate, not yet.
 
 ALLMERS. Well, then what is it?
 
 RITA. [Half-evasively.] You have so often talked to Asta of human
 responsibility--
 
 ALLMERS. Of the book that you hated.
 
 RITA. I hate that book still. But I used to sit and listen to what you
 told her. And now I will try to continue it--in my own way.
 
 ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] It is not for the sake of that unfinished
 book--
 
 RITA. No, I have another reason as well.
 
 ALLMERS. What is that?
 
 RITA. [Softly, with a melancholy smile.] I want to make my peace with
 the great, open eyes, you see.
 
 ALLMERS. [Struck, fixing his eyes upon her.] Perhaps, I could join you
 in that? And help you, Rita?
 
 RITA. Would you?
 
 ALLMERS. Yes--if I were only sure I could.
 
 RITA. [Hesitatingly.] But then you would have to remain here.
 
 ALLMERS. [Softly.] Let us try if it could not be so.
 
 RITA. [Almost inaudibly.] Yes, let us, Alfred.
 
 [Both are silent. Then ALLMERS goes up to the flagstaff and hoists the
 flag to the top. RITA stands beside the summer-house and looks at him in
 silence.]
 
 ALLMERS. [Coming forward again.] We have a heavy day of work before us,
 Rita.
 
 RITA. You will see--that now and then a Sabbath peace will descend on
 us.
 
 ALLMERS. [Quietly, with emotion.] Then, perhaps, we shall know that the
 spirits are with us.
 
 RITA. [Whispering.] The spirits?
 
 ALLMERS. [As before.] Yes, they will perhaps be around us--those whom we
 have lost.
 
 RITA. [Nods slowly.] Our little Eyolf. And your big Eyolf, too.
 
 ALLMERS. [Gazing straight before him.] Now and then, perhaps, we may
 still--on the way through life--have a little, passing glimpse of them.
 
 RITA. When, shall we look for them, Alfred?
 
 ALLMERS. [Fixing his eyes upon her.] Upwards.
 
 RITA. [Nods in approval.] Yes, yes--upwards.
 
 ALLMERS. Upwards--towards the peaks. Towards the stars. And towards the
 great silence.
 
 RITA. [Giving him her hand.] Thanks!

 GHOSTS
 
 By Henrik Ibsen
 
 Translated, with an Introduction, by William Archer
 
 
 
 
 INTRODUCTION.
 
 The winter of 1879-80 Ibsen spent in Munich, and the greater part of the
 summer of 1880 at Berchtesgaden. November 1880 saw him back in Rome, and
 he passed the summer of 1881 at Sorrento. There, fourteen years earlier,
 he had written the last acts of _Peer Gynt_; there he now wrote, or at
 any rate completed, _Gengangere_. It was published in December 1881,
 after he had returned to Rome. On December 22 he wrote to Ludwig
 Passarge, one of his German translators, "My new play has now appeared,
 and has occasioned a terrible uproar in the Scandinavian press; every
 day I receive letters and newspaper articles decrying or praising it....
 I consider it utterly impossible that any German theatre will accept the
 play at present. I hardly believe that they will dare to play it in the
 Scandinavian countries for some time to come." How rightly he judged we
 shall see anon.
 
 In the newspapers there was far more obloquy than praise. Two men,
 however, stood by him from the first: Bjoernson, from whom he had been
 practically estranged ever since _The League of Youth_, and Georg
 Brandes. The latter published an article in which he declared (I quote
 from memory) that the play might or might not be Ibsen's greatest
 work, but that it was certainly his noblest deed. It was, doubtless, in
 acknowledgment of this article that Ibsen wrote to Brandes on January 3,
 1882: "Yesterday I had the great pleasure of receiving your brilliantly
 clear and so warmly appreciative review of _Ghosts_.... All who read
 your article must, it seems to me, have their eyes opened to what I
 meant by my new book--assuming, that is, that they have any _wish_ to
 see. For I cannot get rid of the impression that a very large number of
 the false interpretations which have appeared in the newspapers are
 the work of people who know better. In Norway, however, I am willing to
 believe that the stultification has in most cases been unintentional;
 and the reason is not far to seek. In that country a great many of the
 critics are theologians, more or less disguised; and these gentlemen
 are, as a rule, quite unable to write rationally about creative
 literature. That enfeeblement of judgment which, at least in the case
 of the average man, is an inevitable consequence of prolonged occupation
 with theological studies, betrays itself more especially in the judging
 of human character, human actions, and human motives. Practical business
 judgment, on the other hand, does not suffer so much from studies of
 this order. Therefore the reverend gentlemen are very often excellent
 members of local boards; but they are unquestionably our worst critics."
 This passage is interesting as showing clearly the point of view from
 which Ibsen conceived the character of Manders. In the next paragraph
 of the same letter he discusses the attitude of "the so-called Liberal
 press"; but as the paragraph contains the germ of _An Enemy of the
 People_, it may most fittingly be quoted in the introduction to that
 play.
 
 Three days later (January 6) Ibsen wrote to Schandorph, the Danish
 novelist: "I was quite prepared for the hubbub. If certain of our
 Scandinavian reviewers have no talent for anything else, they have
 an unquestionable talent for thoroughly misunderstanding and
 misinterpreting those authors whose books they undertake to judge....
 They endeavour to make me responsible for the opinions which certain of
 the personages of my drama express. And yet there is not in the whole
 book a single opinion, a single utterance, which can be laid to the
 account of the author. I took good care to avoid this. The very method,
 the order of technique which imposes its form upon the play, forbids
 the author to appear in the speeches of his characters. My object was
 to make the reader feel that he was going through a piece of real
 experience; and nothing could more effectually prevent such an
 impression than the intrusion of the author's private opinions into the
 dialogue. Do they imagine at home that I am so inexpert in the theory of
 drama as not to know this? Of course I know it, and act accordingly.
 In no other play that I have written is the author so external to the
 action, so entirely absent from it, as in this last one."
 
 "They say," he continued, "that the book preaches Nihilism. Not at all.
 It is not concerned to preach anything whatsoever. It merely points
 to the ferment of Nihilism going on under the surface, at home as
 elsewhere. A Pastor Manders will always goad one or other Mrs. Alving
 to revolt. And just because she is a woman, she will, when once she has
 begun, go to the utmost extremes."
 
 Towards the end of January Ibsen wrote from Rome to Olaf Skavlan:
 "These last weeks have brought me a wealth of experiences, lessons, and
 discoveries. I, of course, foresaw that my new play would call forth a
 howl from the camp of the stagnationists; and for; this I care no more
 than for the barking of a pack of chained dogs. But the pusillanimity
 which I have observed among the so-called Liberals has given me cause
 for reflection. The very day after my play was published the _Dagblad_
 rushed out a hurriedly-written article, evidently designed to purge
 itself of all suspicion of complicity in my work. This was entirely
 unnecessary. I myself am responsible for what I write, I and no one
 else. I cannot possibly embarrass any party, for to no party do I
 belong. I stand like a solitary franc-tireur at the outposts, and
 fight for my own hand. The only man in Norway who has stood up freely,
 frankly, and courageously for me is Bjoernson. It is just like him. He
 has in truth a great, kingly soul, and I shall never forget his action
 in this matter."
 
 One more quotation completes the history of these stirring January
 days, as written by Ibsen himself. It occurs in a letter to a Danish
 journalist, Otto Borchsenius. "It may well be," the poet writes, "that
 the play is in several respects rather daring. But it seemed to me
 that the time had come for moving some boundary-posts. And this was an
 undertaking for which a man of the older generation, like myself, was
 better fitted than the many younger authors who might desire to do
 something of the kind. I was prepared for a storm; but such storms one
 must not shrink from encountering. That would be cowardice."
 
 It happened that, just in these days, the present writer had frequent
 opportunities of conversing with Ibsen, and of hearing from his own lips
 almost all the views expressed in the above extracts. He was especially
 emphatic, I remember, in protesting against the notion that the opinions
 expressed by Mrs. Alving or Oswald were to be attributed to himself. He
 insisted, on the contrary, that Mrs. Alving's views were merely typical
 of the moral chaos inevitably produced by re-action from the narrow
 conventionalism represented by Manders.
 
 With one consent, the leading theatres of the three Scandinavian
 capitals declined to have anything to do with the play. It was more
 than eighteen months old before it found its way to the stage at all. In
 August 1883 it was acted for the first time at Helsingborg, Sweden, by
 a travelling company under the direction of an eminent Swedish actor,
 August Lindberg, who himself played Oswald. He took it on tour round the
 principal cities of Scandinavia, playing it, among the rest, at a minor
 theatre in Christiania. It happened that the boards of the Christiania
 Theatre were at the same time occupied by a French farce; and public
 demonstrations of protest were made against the managerial policy which
 gave _Tete de Linotte_ the preference over _Gengangere_. Gradually the
 prejudice against the play broke down. Already in the autumn of 1883 it
 was produced at the Royal (Dramatiska) Theatre in Stockholm. When the
 new National Theatre was opened in Christiania in 1899, _Gengangere_
 found an early place in its repertory; and even the Royal Theatre in
 Copenhagen has since opened its doors to the tragedy.
 
 Not until April 1886 was _Gespenster_ acted in Germany, and then only at
 a private performance, at the Stadttheater, Augsburg, the poet himself
 being present. In the following winter it was acted at the famous Court
 Theatre at Meiningen, again in the presence of the poet. The first
 (private) performance in Berlin took place on January 9, 1887, at the
 Residenz Theater; and when the Freie Buehne, founded on the model of the
 Paris Theatre Libre, began its operations two years later (September 29,
 1889), _Gespenster_ was the first play that it produced. The Freie Buehne
 gave the initial impulse to the whole modern movement which has given
 Germany a new dramatic literature; and the leaders of the movement,
 whether authors or critics, were one and all ardent disciples of Ibsen,
 who regarded _Gespenster_ as his typical masterpiece. In Germany,
 then, the play certainly did, in Ibsen's own words, "move some
 boundary-posts." The Prussian censorship presently withdrew its veto,
 and on, November 27, 1894, the two leading literary theatres of Berlin,
 the Deutsches Theater and the Lessing Theater, gave simultaneous
 performances of the tragedy. Everywhere in Germany and Austria it is
 now freely performed; but it is naturally one of the least popular of
 Ibsen's plays.
 
 It was with _Les Revenants_ that Ibsen made his first appearance on the
 French stage. The play was produced by the Theatre Libre (at the
 Theatre des Menus-Plaisirs) on May 29, 1890. Here, again, it became the
 watchword of the new school of authors and critics, and aroused a good
 deal of opposition among the old school. But the most hostile French
 criticisms were moderation itself compared with the torrents of abuse
 which were poured upon _Ghosts_ by the journalists of London when, on
 March 13, 1891, the Independent Theatre, under the direction of Mr. J.
 T. Grein, gave a private performance of the play at the Royalty Theatre,
 Soho. I have elsewhere [Note: See "The Mausoleum of Ibsen," _Fortnightly
 Review_, August 1893. See also Mr. Bernard Shaw's _Quintessence of
 Ibsenism_, p. 89, and my introduction to Ghosts in the single-volume
 edition.] placed upon record some of the amazing feats of vituperation
 achieved of the critics, and will not here recall them. It is sufficient
 to say that if the play had been a tenth part as nauseous as the
 epithets hurled at it and its author, the Censor's veto would have been
 amply justified. That veto is still (1906) in force. England enjoys the
 proud distinction of being the one country in the world where _Ghosts_
 may not be publicly acted. In the United States, the first performance
 of the play in English took place at the Berkeley Lyceum, New York City,
 on January 5, 1894. The production was described by Mr. W. D. Howells as
 "a great theatrical event--the very greatest I have ever known." Other
 leading men of letters were equally impressed by it. Five years later, a
 second production took place at the Carnegie Lyceum; and an adventurous
 manager has even taken the play on tour in the United States. The
 Italian version of the tragedy, _Gli Spettri_, has ever since 1892
 taken a prominent place in the repertory of the great actors Zaccone and
 Novelli, who have acted it, not only throughout Italy, but in Austria,
 Germany, Russia, Spain, and South America.
 
 In an interview, published immediately after Ibsen's death, Bjoernstjerne
 Bjoernson, questioned as to what he held to be his brother-poet's
 greatest work, replied, without a moment's hesitation, _Gengangere_.
 This dictum can scarcely, I think, be accepted without some
 qualification. Even confining our attention to the modern plays, and
 leaving out of comparison _The Pretenders_, _Brand_, and _Peer Gynt_,
 we can scarcely call _Ghosts_ Ibsen's richest or most human play, and
 certainly not his profoundest or most poetical. If some omnipotent
 Censorship decreed the annihilation of all his works save one, few
 people, I imagine, would vote that that one should be _Ghosts_. Even if
 half a dozen works were to be saved from the wreck, I doubt whether I,
 for my part, would include _Ghosts_ in the list. It is, in my judgment,
 a little bare, hard, austere. It is the first work in which Ibsen
 applies his new technical method--evolved, as I have suggested, during
 the composition of _A Doll's House_--and he applies it with something
 of fanaticism. He is under the sway of a prosaic ideal--confessed in the
 phrase, "My object was to make the reader feel that he was going through
 a piece of real experience"--and he is putting some constraint upon
 the poet within him. The action moves a little stiffly, and all in one
 rhythm. It lacks variety and suppleness. Moreover, the play affords some
 slight excuse for the criticism which persists in regarding Ibsen as a
 preacher rather than as a creator--an author who cares more for ideas
 and doctrines than for human beings. Though Mrs. Alving, Engstrand and
 Regina are rounded and breathing characters, it cannot be denied that
 Manders strikes one as a clerical type rather than an individual, while
 even Oswald might not quite unfairly be described as simply and solely
 his father's son, an object-lesson in heredity. We cannot be said to
 know him, individually and intimately, as we know Helmer or Stockmann,
 Hialmar Ekdal or Gregors Werle. Then, again, there are one or two
 curious flaws in the play. The question whether Oswald's "case" is one
 which actually presents itself in the medical books seems to me of very
 trifling moment. It is typically true, even if it be not true in detail.
 The suddenness of the catastrophe may possibly be exaggerated, its
 premonitions and even its essential nature may be misdescribed. On the
 other hand, I conceive it, probable that the poet had documents to found
 upon, which may be unknown to his critics. I have never taken any pains
 to satisfy myself upon the point, which seems to me quite immaterial.
 There is not the slightest doubt that the life-history of a Captain
 Alving may, and often does, entail upon posterity consequences quite
 as tragic as those which ensue in Oswald's case, and far more
 wide-spreading. That being so, the artistic justification of the poet's
 presentment of the case is certainly not dependent on its absolute
 scientific accuracy. The flaws above alluded to are of another nature.
 One of them is the prominence given to the fact that the Asylum
 is uninsured. No doubt there is some symbolical purport in the
 circumstance; but I cannot think that it is either sufficiently clear or
 sufficiently important to justify the emphasis thrown upon it at the
 end of the second act. Another dubious point is Oswald's argument in
 the first act as to the expensiveness of marriage as compared with free
 union. Since the parties to free union, as he describes it, accept all
 the responsibilities of marriage, and only pretermit the ceremony, the
 difference of expense, one would suppose, must be neither more nor less
 than the actual marriage fee. I have never seen this remark of Oswald's
 adequately explained, either as a matter of economic fact, or as a
 trait of character. Another blemish, of somewhat greater moment, is the
 inconceivable facility with which, in the third act, Manders suffers
 himself to be victimised by Engstrand. All these little things, taken
 together, detract, as it seems to me, from the artistic completeness of
 the play, and impair its claim to rank as the poet's masterpiece. Even
 in prose drama, his greatest and most consummate achievements were yet
 to come.
 
 Must we, then, wholly dissent from Bjoernson's judgment? I think not. In
 a historical, if not in an aesthetic, sense, _Ghosts_ may well rank as
 Ibsen's greatest work. It was the play which first gave the full measure
 of his technical and spiritual originality and daring. It has done
 far more than any other of his plays to "move boundary-posts." It has
 advanced the frontiers of dramatic art and implanted new ideals, both
 technical and intellectual, in the minds of a whole generation of
 playwrights. It ranks with _Hernani_ and _La Dame aux Camelias_ among
 the epoch-making plays of the nineteenth century, while in point of
 essential originality it towers above them. We cannot, I think, get
 nearer to the truth than Georg Brandes did in the above-quoted phrase
 from his first notice of the play, describing it as not, perhaps, the
 poet's greatest work, but certainly his noblest deed. In another essay,
 Brandes has pointed to it, with equal justice, as marking Ibsen's final
 breach with his early-one might almost say his hereditary romanticism.
 He here becomes, at last, "the most modern of the moderns." "This, I am
 convinced," says the Danish critic, "is his imperishable glory, and will
 give lasting life to his works."

 The action takes place at Mrs. Alving's country house, beside one of the
 large fjords in Western Norway.
 
 
 
 
 ACT FIRST.
 
 [A spacious garden-room, with one door to the left, and two doors to the
 right. In the middle of the room a round table, with chairs about it. On
 the table lie books, periodicals, and newspapers. In the foreground to
 the left a window, and by it a small sofa, with a worktable in front of
 it. In the background, the room is continued into a somewhat narrower
 conservatory, the walls of which are formed by large panes of glass. In
 the right-hand wall of the conservatory is a door leading down into
 the garden. Through the glass wall a gloomy fjord landscape is faintly
 visible, veiled by steady rain.]
 
 [ENGSTRAND, the carpenter, stands by the garden door. His left leg
 is somewhat bent; he has a clump of wood under the sole of his boot.
 REGINA, with an empty garden syringe in her hand, hinders him from
 advancing.]
 
 REGINA. [In a low voice.] What do you want? Stop where you are. You're
 positively dripping.
 
 ENGSTRAND. It's the Lord's own rain, my girl.
 
 REGINA. It's the devil's rain, _I_ say.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Lord, how you talk, Regina. [Limps a step or two forward into
 the room.] It's just this as I wanted to say--
 
 REGINA. Don't clatter so with that foot of yours, I tell you! The young
 master's asleep upstairs.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Asleep? In the middle of the day?
 
 REGINA. It's no business of yours.
 
 ENGSTRAND. I was out on the loose last night--
 
 REGINA. I can quite believe that.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Yes, we're weak vessels, we poor mortals, my girl--
 
 REGINA. So it seems.
 
 ENGSTRAND.--and temptations are manifold in this world, you see. But all
 the same, I was hard at work, God knows, at half-past five this morning.
 
 REGINA. Very well; only be off now. I won't stop here and have
 _rendezvous's_ [Note: This and other French words by Regina are in that
 language in the original] with you.
 
 ENGSTRAND. What do you say you won't have?
 
 REGINA. I won't have any one find you here; so just you go about your
 business.
 
 ENGSTRAND. [Advances a step or two.] Blest if I go before I've had
 a talk with you. This afternoon I shall have finished my work at the
 school house, and then I shall take to-night's boat and be off home to
 the town.
 
 REGINA. [Mutters.] Pleasant journey to you!
 
 ENGSTRAND. Thank you, my child. To-morrow the Orphanage is to be opened,
 and then there'll be fine doings, no doubt, and plenty of intoxicating
 drink going, you know. And nobody shall say of Jacob Engstrand that he
 can't keep out of temptation's way.
 
 REGINA. Oh!
 
 ENGSTRAND. You see, there's to be heaps of grand folks here to-morrow.
 Pastor Manders is expected from town, too.
 
 REGINA. He's coming to-day.
 
 ENGSTRAND. There, you see! And I should be cursedly sorry if he found
 out anything against me, don't you understand?
 
 REGINA. Oho! is that your game?
 
 ENGSTRAND. Is what my game?
 
 REGINA. [Looking hard at him.] What are you going to fool Pastor Manders
 into doing, this time?
 
 ENGSTRAND. Sh! sh! Are you crazy? Do _I_ want to fool Pastor Manders? Oh
 no! Pastor Manders has been far too good a friend to me for that. But I
 just wanted to say, you know--that I mean to be off home again to-night.
 
 REGINA. The sooner the better, say I.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Yes, but I want you with me, Regina.
 
 REGINA. [Open-mouthed.] You want me--? What are you talking about?
 
 ENGSTRAND. I want you to come home with me, I say.
 
 REGINA. [Scornfully.] Never in this world shall you get me home with
 you.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Oh, we'll see about that.
 
 REGINA. Yes, you may be sure we'll see about it! Me, that have been
 brought up by a lady like Mrs Alving! Me, that am treated almost as a
 daughter here! Is it me you want to go home with you?--to a house like
 yours? For shame!
 
 ENGSTRAND. What the devil do you mean? Do you set yourself up against
 your father, you hussy?
 
 REGINA. [Mutters without looking at him.] You've said often enough I was
 no concern of yours.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Pooh! Why should you bother about that--
 
 REGINA. Haven't you many a time sworn at me and called me a--? _Fi
 donc_!
 
 ENGSTRAND. Curse me, now, if ever I used such an ugly word.
 
 REGINA. Oh, I remember very well what word you used.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Well, but that was only when I was a bit on, don't you know?
 Temptations are manifold in this world, Regina.
 
 REGINA. Ugh!
 
 ENGSTRAND. And besides, it was when your mother was that aggravating--I
 had to find something to twit her with, my child. She was always setting
 up for a fine lady. [Mimics.] "Let me go, Engstrand; let me be.
 Remember I was three years in Chamberlain Alving's family at Rosenvold."
 [Laughs.] Mercy on us! She could never forget that the Captain was made
 a Chamberlain while she was in service here.
 
 REGINA. Poor mother! you very soon tormented her into her grave.
 
 ENGSTRAND. [With a twist of his shoulders.] Oh, of course! I'm to have
 the blame for everything.
 
 REGINA. [Turns away; half aloud.] Ugh--! And that leg too!
 
 ENGSTRAND. What do you say, my child?
 
 REGINA. _Pied de mouton_.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Is that English, eh?
 
 REGINA. Yes.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Ay, ay; you've picked up some learning out here; and that may
 come in useful now, Regina.
 
 REGINA. [After a short silence.] What do you want with me in town?
 
 ENGSTRAND. Can you ask what a father wants with his only child? A'n't I
 a lonely, forlorn widower?
 
 REGINA. Oh, don't try on any nonsense like that with me! Why do you want
 me?
 
 ENGSTRAND. Well, let me tell you, I've been thinking of setting up in a
 new line of business.
 
 REGINA. [Contemptuously.] You've tried that often enough, and much good
 you've done with it.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Yes, but this time you shall see, Regina! Devil take me--
 
 REGINA. [Stamps.] Stop your swearing!
 
 ENGSTRAND. Hush, hush; you're right enough there, my girl. What I wanted
 to say was just this--I've laid by a very tidy pile from this Orphanage
 job.
 
 REGINA. Have you? That's a good thing for you.
 
 ENGSTRAND. What can a man spend his ha'pence on here in this country
 hole?
 
 REGINA. Well, what then?
 
 ENGSTRAND. Why, you see, I thought of putting the money into some paying
 speculation. I thought of a sort of a sailor's tavern--
 
 REGINA. Pah!
 
 ENGSTRAND. A regular high-class affair, of course; not any sort of
 pig-sty for common sailors. No! damn it! it would be for captains and
 mates, and--and--regular swells, you know.
 
 REGINA. And I was to--?
 
 ENGSTRAND. You were to help, to be sure. Only for the look of the thing,
 you understand. Devil a bit of hard work shall you have, my girl. You
 shall do exactly what you like.
 
 REGINA. Oh, indeed!
 
 ENGSTRAND. But there must be a petticoat in the house; that's as clear
 as daylight. For I want to have it a bit lively like in the evenings,
 with singing and dancing, and so on. You must remember they're weary
 wanderers on the ocean of life. [Nearer.] Now don't be a fool and
 stand in your own light, Regina. What's to become of you out here? Your
 mistress has given you a lot of learning; but what good is that to you?
 You're to look after the children at the new Orphanage, I hear. Is that
 the sort of thing for you, eh? Are you so dead set on wearing your life
 out for a pack of dirty brats?
 
 REGINA. No; if things go as I want them to--Well there's no
 saying--there's no saying.
 
 ENGSTRAND. What do you mean by "there's no saying"?
 
 REGINA. Never you mind.--How much money have you saved?
 
 ENGSTRAND. What with one thing and another, a matter of seven or
 eight hundred crowns. [A "krone" is equal to one shilling and
 three-halfpence.]
 
 REGINA. That's not so bad.
 
 ENGSTRAND. It's enough to make a start with, my girl.
 
 REGINA. Aren't you thinking of giving me any?
 
 ENGSTRAND. No, I'm blest if I am!
 
 REGINA. Not even of sending me a scrap of stuff for a new dress?
 
 ENGSTRAND. Come to town with me, my lass, and you'll soon get dresses
 enough.
 
 REGINA. Pooh! I can do that on my own account, if I want to.
 
 ENGSTRAND. No, a father's guiding hand is what you want, Regina. Now,
 I've got my eye on a capital house in Little Harbour Street. They don't
 want much ready-money; and it could be a sort of a Sailors' Home, you
 know.
 
 REGINA. But I will not live with you! I have nothing whatever to do with
 you. Be off!
 
 ENGSTRAND. You wouldn't stop long with me, my girl. No such luck! If
 you knew how to play your cards, such a fine figure of a girl as you've
 grown in the last year or two--
 
 REGINA. Well?
 
 ENGSTRAND. You'd soon get hold of some mate--or maybe even a captain--
 
 REGINA. I won't marry any one of that sort. Sailors have no _savoir
 vivre_.
 
 ENGSTRAND. What's that they haven't got?
 
 REGINA. I know what sailors are, I tell you. They're not the sort of
 people to marry.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Then never mind about marrying them. You can make it pay all
 the same. [More confidentially.] He--the Englishman--the man with the
 yacht--he came down with three hundred dollars, he did; and she wasn't a
 bit handsomer than you.
 
 REGINA. [Making for him.] Out you go!
 
 ENGSTRAND. [Falling back.] Come, come! You're not going to hit me, I
 hope.
 
 REGINA. Yes, if you begin talking about mother I shall hit you. Get away
 with you, I say! [Drives him back towards the garden door.] And don't
 slam the doors. Young Mr. Alving--
 
 ENGSTRAND. He's asleep; I know. You're mightily taken up about young Mr.
 Alving--[More softly.] Oho! you don't mean to say it's him as--?
 
 REGINA. Be off this minute! You're crazy, I tell you! No, not that way.
 There comes Pastor Manders. Down the kitchen stairs with you.
 
 ENGSTRAND. [Towards the right.] Yes, yes, I'm going. But just you talk
 to him as is coming there. He's the man to tell you what a child owes
 its father. For I am your father all the same, you know. I can prove it
 from the church register.
 
 [He goes out through the second door to the right, which REGINA has
 opened, and closes again after him. REGINA glances hastily at herself in
 the mirror, dusts herself with her pocket handkerchief; and settles her
 necktie; then she busies herself with the flowers.]
 
 [PASTOR MANDERS, wearing an overcoat, carrying an umbrella, and with
 a small travelling-bag on a strap over his shoulder, comes through the
 garden door into the conservatory.]
 
 MANDERS. Good-morning, Miss Engstrand.
 
 REGINA. [Turning round, surprised and pleased.] No, really! Good
 morning, Pastor Manders. Is the steamer in already?
 
 MANDERS. It is just in. [Enters the sitting-room.] Terrible weather we
 have been having lately.
 
 REGINA. [Follows him.] It's such blessed weather for the country, sir.
 
 MANDERS. No doubt; you are quite right. We townspeople give too little
 thought to that. [He begins to take of his overcoat.]
 
 REGINA. Oh, mayn't I help you?--There! Why, how wet it is? I'll just
 hang it up in the hall. And your umbrella, too--I'll open it and let it
 dry.
 
 [She goes out with the things through the second door on the right.
 PASTOR MANDERS takes off his travelling bag and lays it and his hat on a
 chair. Meanwhile REGINA comes in again.]
 
 MANDERS. Ah, it's a comfort to get safe under cover. I hope everything
 is going on well here?
 
 REGINA. Yes, thank you, sir.
 
 MANDERS. You have your hands full, I suppose, in preparation for
 to-morrow?
 
 REGINA. Yes, there's plenty to do, of course.
 
 MANDERS. And Mrs. Alving is at home, I trust?
 
 REGINA. Oh dear, yes. She's just upstairs, looking after the young
 master's chocolate.
 
 MANDERS. Yes, by-the-bye--I heard down at the pier that Oswald had
 arrived.
 
 REGINA. Yes, he came the day before yesterday. We didn't expect him
 before to-day.
 
 MANDERS. Quite strong and well, I hope?
 
 REGINA. Yes, thank you, quite; but dreadfully tired with the journey. He
 has made one rush right through from Paris--the whole way in one train,
 I believe. He's sleeping a little now, I think; so perhaps we'd better
 talk a little quietly.
 
 MANDERS. Sh!--as quietly as you please.
 
 REGINA. [Arranging an arm-chair beside the table.] Now, do sit down,
 Pastor Manders, and make yourself comfortable. [He sits down; she places
 a footstool under his feet.] There! Are you comfortable now, sir?
 
 MANDERS. Thanks, thanks, extremely so. [Looks at her.] Do you know, Miss
 Engstrand, I positively believe you have grown since I last saw you.
 
 REGINA. Do you think so, Sir? Mrs. Alving says I've filled out too.
 
 MANDERS. Filled out? Well, perhaps a little; just enough.
 
 [Short pause.]
 
 REGINA. Shall I tell Mrs. Alving you are here?
 
 MANDERS. Thanks, thanks, there is no hurry, my dear child.--By-the-bye,
 Regina, my good girl, tell me: how is your father getting on out here?
 
 REGINA. Oh, thank you, sir, he's getting on well enough.
 
 MANDERS. He called upon me last time he was in town.
 
 REGINA. Did he, indeed? He's always so glad of a chance of talking to
 you, sir.
 
 MANDERS. And you often look in upon him at his work, I daresay?
 
 REGINA. I? Oh, of course, when I have time, I--
 
 MANDERS. Your father is not a man of strong character, Miss Engstrand.
 He stands terribly in need of a guiding hand.
 
 REGINA. Oh, yes; I daresay he does.
 
 MANDERS. He requires some one near him whom he cares for, and whose
 judgment he respects. He frankly admitted as much when he last came to
 see me.
 
 REGINA. Yes, he mentioned something of the sort to me. But I don't know
 whether Mrs. Alving can spare me; especially now that we've got the
 new Orphanage to attend to. And then I should be so sorry to leave Mrs.
 Alving; she has always been so kind to me.
 
 MANDERS. But a daughter's duty, my good girl--Of course, we should first
 have to get your mistress's consent.
 
 REGINA. But I don't know whether it would be quite proper for me, at my
 age, to keep house for a single man.
 
 MANDERS. What! My dear Miss Engstrand! When the man is your own father!
 
 REGINA. Yes, that may be; but all the same--Now, if it were in a
 thoroughly nice house, and with a real gentleman--
 
 MANDERS. Why, my dear Regina--
 
 REGINA.--one I could love and respect, and be a daughter to--
 
 MANDERS. Yes, but my dear, good child--
 
 REGINA. Then I should be glad to go to town. It's very lonely out here;
 you know yourself, sir, what it is to be alone in the world. And I can
 assure you I'm both quick and willing. Don't you know of any such place
 for me, sir?
 
 MANDERS. I? No, certainly not.
 
 REGINA. But, dear, dear Sir, do remember me if--
 
 MANDERS. [Rising.] Yes, yes, certainly, Miss Engstrand.
 
 REGINA. For if I--
 
 MANDERS. Will you be so good as to tell your mistress I am here?
 
 REGINA. I will, at once, sir. [She goes out to the left.]
 
 MANDERS. [Paces the room two or three times, stands a moment in the
 background with his hands behind his back, and looks out over the
 garden. Then he returns to the table, takes up a book, and looks at the
 title-page; starts, and looks at several books.] Ha--indeed!
 
 [MRS. ALVING enters by the door on the left; she is followed by REGINA,
 who immediately goes out by the first door on the right.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Holds out her hand.] Welcome, my dear Pastor.
 
 MANDERS. How do you do, Mrs. Alving? Here I am as I promised.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Always punctual to the minute.
 
 MANDERS. You may believe it was not so easy for me to get away. With all
 the Boards and Committees I belong to--
 
 MRS. ALVING. That makes it all the kinder of you to come so early.
 Now we can get through our business before dinner. But where is your
 portmanteau?
 
 MANDERS. [Quickly.] I left it down at the inn. I shall sleep there
 to-night.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Suppressing a smile.] Are you really not to be persuaded,
 even now, to pass the night under my roof?
 
 MANDERS. No, no, Mrs. Alving; many thanks. I shall stay at the inn, as
 usual. It is so conveniently near the landing-stage.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Well, you must have your own way. But I really should have
 thought we two old people--
 
 MANDERS. Now you are making fun of me. Ah, you're naturally in great
 spirits to-day--what with to-morrow's festival and Oswald's return.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes; you can think what a delight it is to me! It's more
 than two years since he was home last. And now he has promised to stay
 with me all the winter.
 
 MANDERS. Has he really? That is very nice and dutiful of him. For I can
 well believe that life in Rome and Paris has very different attractions
 from any we can offer here.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Ah, but here he has his mother, you see. My own darling
 boy--he hasn't forgotten his old mother!
 
 MANDERS. It would be grievous indeed, if absence and absorption in art
 and that sort of thing were to blunt his natural feelings.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, you may well say so. But there's nothing of that sort
 to fear with him. I'm quite curious to see whether you know him again.
 He'll be down presently; he's upstairs just now, resting a little on the
 sofa. But do sit down, my dear Pastor.
 
 MANDERS. Thank you. Are you quite at liberty--?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Certainly. [She sits by the table.]
 
 MANDERS. Very well. Then let me show you--[He goes to the chair where
 his travelling-bag lies, takes out a packet of papers, sits down on
 the opposite side of the table, and tries to find a clear space for
 the papers.] Now, to begin with, here is--[Breaking off.] Tell me, Mrs.
 Alving, how do these books come to be here?
 
 MRS. ALVING. These books? They are books I am reading.
 
 MANDERS. Do you read this sort of literature?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Certainly I do.
 
 MANDERS. Do you feel better or happier for such reading?
 
 MRS. ALVING. I feel, so to speak, more secure.
 
 MANDERS. That is strange. How do you mean?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Well, I seem to find explanation and confirmation of all
 sorts of things I myself have been thinking. For that is the wonderful
 part of it, Pastor Manders--there is really nothing new in these books,
 nothing but what most people think and believe. Only most people either
 don't formulate it to themselves, or else keep quiet about it.
 
 MANDERS. Great heavens! Do you really believe that most people--?
 
 MRS. ALVING. I do, indeed.
 
 MANDERS. But surely not in this country? Not here among us?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, certainly; here as elsewhere.
 
 MANDERS. Well, I really must say--!
 
 MRS. ALVING. For the rest, what do you object to in these books?
 
 MANDERS. Object to in them? You surely do not suppose that I have
 nothing better to do than to study such publications as these?
 
 MRS. ALVING. That is to say, you know nothing of what you are
 condemning?
 
 MANDERS. I have read enough about these writings to disapprove of them.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes; but your own judgment--
 
 MANDERS. My dear Mrs. Alving, there are many occasions in life when one
 must rely upon others. Things are so ordered in this world; and it is
 well that they are. Otherwise, what would become of society?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Well, well, I daresay you're right there.
 
 MANDERS. Besides, I of course do not deny that there may be much that
 is attractive in such books. Nor can I blame you for wishing to keep
 up with the intellectual movements that are said to be going on in the
 great world-where you have let your son pass so much of his life. But--
 
 MRS. ALVING. But?
 
 MANDERS. [Lowering his voice.] But one should not talk about it, Mrs.
 Alving. One is certainly not bound to account to everybody for what one
 reads and thinks within one's own four walls.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Of course not; I quite agree with you.
 
 MANDERS. Only think, now, how you are bound to consider the interests
 of this Orphanage, which you decided on founding at a time when--if
 I understand you rightly--you thought very differently on spiritual
 matters.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oh, yes; I quite admit that. But it was about the
 Orphanage--
 
 MANDERS. It was about the Orphanage we were to speak; yes. All I say
 is: prudence, my dear lady! And now let us get to business. [Opens the
 packet, and takes out a number of papers.] Do you see these?
 
 MRS. ALVING. The documents?
 
 MANDERS. All--and in perfect order. I can tell you it was hard work to
 get them in time. I had to put on strong pressure. The authorities are
 almost morbidly scrupulous when there is any decisive step to be taken.
 But here they are at last. [Looks through the bundle.] See! here is the
 formal deed of gift of the parcel of ground known as Solvik in the Manor
 of Rosenvold, with all the newly constructed buildings, schoolrooms,
 master's house, and chapel. And here is the legal fiat for the endowment
 and for the Bye-laws of the Institution. Will you look at them? [Reads.]
 "Bye-laws for the Children's Home to be known as 'Captain Alving's
 Foundation.'"
 
 MRS. ALVING. (Looks long at the paper.) So there it is.
 
 MANDERS. I have chosen the designation "Captain" rather than
 "Chamberlain." "Captain" looks less pretentious.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oh, yes; just as you think best.
 
 MANDERS. And here you have the Bank Account of the capital lying at
 interest to cover the current expenses of the Orphanage.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Thank you; but please keep it--it will be more convenient.
 
 MANDERS. With pleasure. I think we will leave the money in the Bank for
 the present. The interest is certainly not what we could wish--four per
 cent. and six months' notice of withdrawal. If a good mortgage could
 be found later on--of course it must be a first mortgage and an
 unimpeachable security--then we could consider the matter.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Certainly, my dear Pastor Manders. You are the best judge
 in these things.
 
 MANDERS. I will keep my eyes open at any rate.--But now there is one
 thing more which I have several times been intending to ask you.
 
 MRS. ALVING. And what is that?
 
 MANDERS. Shall the Orphanage buildings be insured or not?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Of course they must be insured.
 
 MANDERS. Well, wait a moment, Mrs. Alving. Let us look into the matter a
 little more closely.
 
 MRS. ALVING. I have everything insured; buildings and movables and stock
 and crops.
 
 MANDERS. Of course you have--on your own estate. And so have I--of
 course. But here, you see, it is quite another matter. The Orphanage is
 to be consecrated, as it were, to a higher purpose.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, but that's no reason--
 
 MANDERS. For my own part, I should certainly not see the smallest
 impropriety in guarding against all contingencies--
 
 MRS. ALVING. No, I should think not.
 
 MANDERS. But what is the general feeling in the neighbourhood? You, of
 course, know better than I.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Well--the general feeling--
 
 MANDERS. Is there any considerable number of people--really responsible
 people--who might be scandalised?
 
 MRS. ALVING. What do you mean by "really responsible people"?
 
 MANDERS. Well, I mean people in such independent and influential
 positions that one cannot help attaching some weight to their opinions.
 
 MRS. ALVING. There are several people of that sort here, who would very
 likely be shocked if--
 
 MANDERS. There, you see! In town we have many such people. Think of all
 my colleague's adherents! People would be only too ready to interpret
 our action as a sign that neither you nor I had the right faith in a
 Higher Providence.
 
 MRS. ALVING. But for your own part, my dear Pastor, you can at least
 tell yourself that--
 
 MANDERS. Yes, I know--I know; my conscience would be quite easy, that
 is true enough. But nevertheless we should not escape grave
 misinterpretation; and that might very likely react unfavourably upon
 the Orphanage.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Well, in that case--
 
 MANDERS. Nor can I entirely lose sight of the difficult--I may even say
 painful--position in which _I_ might perhaps be placed. In the leading
 circles of the town, people take a lively interest in this Orphanage. It
 is, of course, founded partly for the benefit of the town, as well;
 and it is to be hoped it will, to a considerable extent, result in
 lightening our Poor Rates. Now, as I have been your adviser, and have
 had the business arrangements in my hands, I cannot but fear that I may
 have to bear the brunt of fanaticism--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oh, you mustn't run the risk of that.
 
 MANDERS. To say nothing of the attacks that would assuredly be made upon
 me in certain papers and periodicals, which--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Enough, my dear Pastor Manders. That consideration is quite
 decisive.
 
 MANDERS. Then you do not wish the Orphanage to be insured?
 
 MRS. ALVING. No. We will let it alone.
 
 MANDERS. [Leaning hack in his chair.] But if, now, a disaster were to
 happen? One can never tell--Should you be able to make good the damage?
 
 MRS. ALVING. No; I tell you plainly I should do nothing of the kind.
 
 MANDERS. Then I must tell you, Mrs. Alving--we are taking no small
 responsibility upon ourselves.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Do you think we can do otherwise?
 
 MANDERS. No, that is just the point; we really cannot do otherwise. We
 ought not to expose ourselves to misinterpretation; and we have no right
 whatever to give offence to the weaker brethren.
 
 MRS. ALVING. You, as a clergyman, certainly should not.
 
 MANDERS. I really think, too, we may trust that such an institution has
 fortune on its side; in fact, that it stands under a special providence.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Let us hope so, Pastor Manders.
 
 MANDERS. Then we will let it take its chance?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, certainly.
 
 MANDERS. Very well. So be it. [Makes a note.] Then--no insurance.
 
 MRS. ALVING. It's odd that you should just happen to mention the matter
 to-day--
 
 MANDERS. I have often thought of asking you about it--
 
 MRS. ALVING.--for we very nearly had a fire down there yesterday.
 
 MANDERS. You don't say so!
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oh, it was a trifling matter. A heap of shavings had caught
 fire in the carpenter's workshop.
 
 MANDERS. Where Engstrand works?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes. They say he's often very careless with matches.
 
 MANDERS. He has so much on his mind, that man--so many things to fight
 against. Thank God, he is now striving to lead a decent life, I hear.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Indeed! Who says so?
 
 MANDERS. He himself assures me of it. And he is certainly a capital
 workman.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oh, yes; so long as he's sober--
 
 MANDERS. Ah, that melancholy weakness! But, a is often driven to it
 by his injured leg, lie says,' Last time he was in town I was really
 touched by him. He came and thanked me so warmly for having got him work
 here, so that he might be near Regina.
 
 MRS. ALVING. He doesn't see much of her.
 
 MANDERS. Oh, yes; he has a talk with her every day. He told me so
 himself.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Well, it may be so.
 
 MANDERS. He feels so acutely that he needs some one to keep a firm hold
 on him when temptation comes. That is what I cannot help liking about
 Jacob Engstrand: he comes to you so helplessly, accusing himself and
 confessing his own weakness. The last time he was talking to me--Believe
 me, Mrs. Alving, supposing it were a real necessity for him to have
 Regina home again--
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Rising hastily.] Regina!
 
 MANDERS.--you must not set yourself against it.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Indeed I shall set myself against it. And besides--Regina
 is to have a position in the Orphanage.
 
 MANDERS. But, after all, remember he is her father--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oh, I know very well what sort of a father he has been to
 her. No! She shall never go to him with my goodwill.
 
 MANDERS. [Rising.] My dear lady, don't take the matter so warmly. You
 sadly misjudge poor Engstrand. You seem to be quite terrified--
 
 MRS. ALVING. [More quietly.] It makes no difference. I have taken Regina
 into my house, and there she shall stay. [Listens.] Hush, my dear Mr.
 Manders; say no more about it. [Her face lights up with gladness.]
 Listen! there is Oswald coming downstairs. Now we'll think of no one but
 him.
 
 [OSWALD ALVING, in a light overcoat, hat in hand, and smoking a large
 meerschaum, enters by the door on the left; he stops in the doorway.]
 
 OSWALD. Oh, I beg your pardon; I thought you were in the study. [Comes
 forward.] Good-morning, Pastor Manders.
 
 MANDERS. [Staring.] Ah--! How strange--!
 
 MRS. ALVING. Well now, what do you think of him, Mr. Manders?
 
 MANDERS. I--I--can it really be--?
 
 OSWALD. Yes, it's really the Prodigal Son, sir.
 
 MANDERS. [Protesting.] My dear young friend--
 
 OSWALD. Well, then, the Lost Sheep Found.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oswald is thinking of the time when you were so much
 opposed to his becoming a painter.
 
 MANDERS. To our human eyes many a step seems dubious, which afterwards
 proves--[Wrings his hand.] But first of all, welcome, welcome home! Do
 not think, my dear Oswald--I suppose I may call you by your Christian
 name?
 
 OSWALD. What else should you call me?
 
 MANDERS. Very good. What I wanted to say was this, my dear Oswald you
 must not think that I utterly condemn the artist's calling. I have no
 doubt there are many who can keep their inner self unharmed in that
 profession, as in any other.
 
 OSWALD. Let us hope so.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Beaming with delight.] I know one who has kept both his
 inner and his outer self unharmed. Just look at him, Mr. Manders.
 
 OSWALD. [Moves restlessly about the room.] Yes, yes, my dear mother;
 let's say no more about it.
 
 MANDERS. Why, certainly--that is undeniable. And you have begun to make
 a name for yourself already. The newspapers have often spoken of you,
 most favourably. Just lately, by-the-bye, I fancy I haven't seen your
 name quite so often.
 
 OSWALD. [Up in the conservatory.] I haven't been able to paint so much
 lately.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Even a painter needs a little rest now and then.
 
 MANDERS. No doubt, no doubt. And meanwhile he can be preparing himself
 and mustering his forces for some great work.
 
 OSWALD. Yes.--Mother, will dinner soon be ready?
 
 MRS. ALVING. In less than half an hour. He has a capital appetite, thank
 God.
 
 MANDERS. And a taste for tobacco, too.
 
 OSWALD. I found my father's pipe in my room--
 
 MANDERS. Aha--then that accounts for it!
 
 MRS. ALVING. For what?
 
 MANDERS. When Oswald appeared there, in the doorway, with the pipe in
 his mouth, I could have sworn I saw his father, large as life.
 
 OSWALD. No, really?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oh, how can you say so? Oswald takes after me.
 
 MANDERS. Yes, but there is an expression about the corners of the
 mouth--something about the lips--that reminds one exactly of Alving: at
 any rate, now that he is smoking.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Not in the least. Oswald has rather a clerical curve about
 his mouth, I think.
 
 MANDERS. Yes, yes; some of my colleagues have much the same expression.
 
 MRS. ALVING. But put your pipe away, my dear boy; I won't have smoking
 in here.
 
 OSWALD. [Does so.] By all means. I only wanted to try it; for I once
 smoked it when I was a child.
 
 MRS. ALVING. You?
 
 OSWALD. Yes. I was quite small at the time. I recollect I came up to
 father's room one evening when he was in great spirits.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oh, you can't recollect anything of those times.
 
 OSWALD. Yes, I recollect it distinctly. He took me on his knee, and gave
 me the pipe. "Smoke, boy," he said; "smoke away, boy!" And I smoked
 as hard as I could, until I felt I was growing quite pale, and the
 perspiration stood in great drops on my forehead. Then he burst out
 laughing heartily--
 
 MANDERS. That was most extraordinary.
 
 MRS. ALVING. My dear friend, it's only something Oswald has dreamt.
 
 OSWALD. No, mother, I assure you I didn't dream it. For--don't you
 remember this?--you came and carried me out into the nursery. Then I
 was sick, and I saw that you were crying.--Did father often play such
 practical jokes?
 
 MANDERS. In his youth he overflowed with the joy of life--
 
 OSWALD. And yet he managed to do so much in the world; so much that was
 good and useful; although he died so early.
 
 MANDERS. Yes, you have inherited the name of an energetic and admirable
 man, my dear Oswald Alving. No doubt it will be an incentive to you--
 
 OSWALD. It ought to, indeed.
 
 MANDERS. It was good of you to come home for the ceremony in his honour.
 
 OSWALD. I could do no less for my father.
 
 MRS. ALVING. And I am to keep him so long! That is the best of all.
 
 MANDERS. You are going to pass the winter at home, I hear.
 
 OSWALD. My stay is indefinite, sir.-But, ah! it is good to be at home!
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Beaming.] Yes, isn't it, dear?
 
 MANDERS. [Looking sympathetically at him.] You went out into the world
 early, my dear Oswald.
 
 OSWALD. I did. I sometimes wonder whether it wasn't too early.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oh, not at all. A healthy lad is all the better for it;
 especially when he's an only child. He oughtn't to hang on at home with
 his mother and father, and get spoilt.
 
 MANDERS. That is a very disputable point, Mrs. Alving. A child's proper
 place is, and must be, the home of his fathers.
 
 OSWALD. There I quite agree with you, Pastor Manders.
 
 MANDERS. Only look at your own son--there is no reason why we should not
 say it in his presence--what has the consequence been for him? He is six
 or seven and twenty, and has never had the opportunity of learning what
 a well-ordered home really is.
 
 OSWALD. I beg your pardon, Pastor; there you're quite mistaken.
 
 MANDERS. Indeed? I thought you had lived almost exclusively in artistic
 circles.
 
 OSWALD. So I have.
 
 MANDERS. And chiefly among the younger artists?
 
 OSWALD. Yes, certainly.
 
 MANDERS. But I thought few of those young fellows could afford to set up
 house and support a family.
 
 OSWALD. There are many who cannot afford to marry, sir.
 
 MANDERS. Yes, that is just what I say.
 
 OSWALD. But they may have a home for all that. And several of them have,
 as a matter of fact; and very pleasant, well-ordered homes they are,
 too.
 
 [MRS. ALVING follows with breathless interest; nods, but says nothing.]
 
 MANDERS. But I'm not talking of bachelors' quarters. By a "home" I
 understand the home of a family, where a man lives with his wife and
 children.
 
 OSWALD. Yes; or with his children and his children's mother.
 
 MANDERS. [Starts; clasps his hands.] But, good heavens--
 
 OSWALD. Well?
 
 MANDERS. Lives with--his children's mother!
 
 OSWALD. Yes. Would you have him turn his children's mother out of doors?
 
 MANDERS. Then it is illicit relations you are talking of! Irregular
 marriages, as people call them!
 
 OSWALD. I have never noticed anything particularly irregular about the
 life these people lead.
 
 MANDERS. But how is it possible that a--a young man or young woman with
 any decency of feeling can endure to live in that way?--in the eyes of
 all the world!
 
 OSWALD. What are they to do? A poor young artist--a poor girl--marriage
 costs a great deal. What are they to do?
 
 MANDERS. What are they to do? Let me tell you, Mr. Alving, what they
 ought to do. They ought to exercise self-restraint from the first; that
 is what they ought to do.
 
 OSWALD. That doctrine will scarcely go down with warm-blooded young
 people who love each other.
 
 MRS. ALVING. No, scarcely!
 
 MANDERS. [Continuing.] How can the authorities tolerate such things!
 Allow them to go on in the light of day! [Confronting MRS. ALVING.] Had
 I not cause to be deeply concerned about your son? In circles where open
 immorality prevails, and has even a sort of recognised position--!
 
 OSWALD. Let me tell you, sir, that I have been in the habit of spending
 nearly all my Sundays in one or two such irregular homes--
 
 MANDERS. Sunday of all days!
 
 OSWALD. Isn't that the day to enjoy one's self? Well, never have I heard
 an offensive word, and still less have I witnessed anything that could
 be called immoral. No; do you know when and where I have come across
 immorality in artistic circles?
 
 MANDERS. No, thank heaven, I don't!
 
 OSWALD. Well, then, allow me to inform you. I have met with it when one
 or other of our pattern husbands and fathers has come to Paris to have
 a look round on his own account, and has done the artists the honour of
 visiting their humble haunts. They knew what was what. These gentlemen
 could tell us all about places and things we had never dreamt of.
 
 MANDERS. What! Do you mean to say that respectable men from home here
 would--?
 
 OSWALD. Have you never heard these respectable men, when they got home
 again, talking about the way in which immorality runs rampant abroad?
 
 MANDERS. Yes, no doubt--
 
 MRS. ALVING. I have too.
 
 OSWALD. Well, you may take their word for it. They know what they are
 talking about! [Presses has hands to his head.] Oh! that that great,
 free, glorious life out there should be defiled in such a way!
 
 MRS. ALVING. You mustn't get excited, Oswald. It's not good for you.
 
 OSWALD. Yes; you're quite right, mother. It's bad for me, I know.
 You see, I'm wretchedly worn out. I shall go for a little turn before
 dinner. Excuse me, Pastor: I know you can't take my point of view; but
 I couldn't help speaking out. [He goes out by the second door to the
 right.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. My poor boy!
 
 MANDERS. You may well say so. Then this is what he has come to!
 
 [MRS. ALVING looks at him silently.]
 
 MANDERS. [Walking up and down.] He called himself the Prodigal Son.
 Alas! alas!
 
 [MRS. ALVING continues looking at him.]
 
 MANDERS. And what do you say to all this?
 
 MRS. ALVING. I say that Oswald was right in every word.
 
 MANDERS. [Stands still.] Right? Right! In such principles?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Here, in my loneliness, I have come to the same way of
 thinking, Pastor Manders. But I have never dared to say anything. Well!
 now my boy shall speak for me.
 
 MANDERS. You are greatly to be pitied, Mrs. Alving. But now I must speak
 seriously to you. And now it is no longer your business manager and
 adviser, your own and your husband's early friend, who stands before
 you. It is the priest--the priest who stood before you in the moment of
 your life when you had gone farthest astray.
 
 MRS. ALVING. And what has the priest to say to me?
 
 MANDERS. I will first stir up your memory a little. The moment is well
 chosen. To-morrow will be the tenth anniversary of your husband's death.
 To-morrow the memorial in his honour will be unveiled. To-morrow I shall
 have to speak to the whole assembled multitude. But to-day I will speak
 to you alone.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Very well, Pastor Manders. Speak.
 
 MANDERS. Do you remember that after less than a year of married life you
 stood on the verge of an abyss? That you forsook your house and home?
 That you fled from your husband? Yes, Mrs. Alving--fled, fled, and
 refused to return to him, however much he begged and prayed you?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Have you forgotten how infinitely miserable I was in that
 first year?
 
 MANDERS. It is the very mark of the spirit of rebellion to crave for
 happiness in this life. What right have we human beings to happiness?
 We have simply to do our duty, Mrs. Alving! And your duty was to hold
 firmly to the man you had once chosen, and to whom you were bound by the
 holiest ties.
 
 MRS. ALVING. You know very well what sort of life Alving was
 leading--what excesses he was guilty of.
 
 MANDERS. I know very well what rumours there were about him; and I am
 the last to approve the life he led in his young days, if report did not
 wrong him. But a wife is not appointed to be her husband's judge. It was
 your duty to bear with humility the cross which a Higher Power had, in
 its wisdom, laid upon you. But instead of that you rebelliously throw
 away the cross, desert the backslider whom you should have supported, go
 and risk your good name and reputation, and--nearly succeed in ruining
 other people's reputation into the bargain.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Other people's? One other person's, you mean.
 
 MANDERS. It was incredibly reckless of you to seek refuge with me.
 
 MRS. ALVING. With our clergyman? With our intimate friend?
 
 MANDERS. Just on that account. Yes, you may thank God that I possessed
 the necessary firmness; that I succeeded in dissuading you from your
 wild designs; and that it was vouchsafed me to lead you back to the path
 of duty, and home to your lawful husband.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, Pastor Manders, that was certainly your work.
 
 MANDERS. I was but a poor instrument in a Higher Hand. And what a
 blessing has it not proved to you, all the days of your life, that I
 induced you to resume the yoke of duty and obedience! Did not everything
 happen as I foretold? Did not Alving turn his back on his errors, as
 a man should? Did he not live with you from that time, lovingly and
 blamelessly, all his days? Did he not become a benefactor to the whole
 district? And did he not help you to rise to his own level, so that you,
 little by little, became his assistant in all his undertakings? And a
 capital assistant, too--oh, I know, Mrs. Alving, that praise is due to
 you.--But now I come to the next great error in your life.
 
 MRS. ALVING. What do you mean?
 
 MANDERS. Just as you once disowned a wife's duty, so you have since
 disowned a mother's.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Ah--!
 
 MANDERS. You have been all your life under the dominion of a pestilent
 spirit of self-will. The whole bias of your mind has been towards
 insubordination and lawlessness. You have never known how to endure any
 bond. Everything that has weighed upon you in life you have cast away
 without care or conscience, like a burden you were free to throw off at
 will. It did not please you to be a wife any longer, and you left your
 husband. You found it troublesome to be a mother, and you sent your
 child forth among strangers.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, that is true. I did so.
 
 MANDERS. And thus you have become a stranger to him.
 
 MRS. ALVING. No! no! I am not.
 
 MANDERS. Yes, you are; you must be. And in what state of mind has he
 returned to you? Bethink yourself well, Mrs. Alving. You sinned greatly
 against your husband;--that you recognise by raising yonder memorial to
 him. Recognise now, also, how you have sinned against your son--there
 may yet be time to lead him back from the paths of error. Turn back
 yourself, and save what may yet be saved in him. For [With uplifted
 forefinger] verily, Mrs. Alving, you are a guilt-laden mother! This I
 have thought it my duty to say to you.
 
 [Silence.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Slowly and with self-control.] You have now spoken out,
 Pastor Manders; and to-morrow you are to speak publicly in memory of my
 husband. I shall not speak to-morrow. But now I will speak frankly to
 you, as you have spoken to me.
 
 MANDERS. To be sure; you will plead excuses for your conduct--
 
 MRS. ALVING. No. I will only tell you a story.
 
 MANDERS. Well--?
 
 MRS. ALVING. All that you have just said about my husband and me, and
 our life after you had brought me back to the path of duty--as you
 called it--about all that you know nothing from personal observation.
 From that moment you, who had been our intimate friend, never set foot
 in our house gain.
 
 MANDERS. You and your husband left the town immediately after.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes; and in my husband's lifetime you never came to see
 us. It was business that forced you to visit me when you undertook the
 affairs of the Orphanage.
 
 MANDERS. [Softly and hesitatingly.] Helen--if that is meant as a
 reproach, I would beg you to bear in mind--
 
 MRS. ALVING.--the regard you owed to your position, yes; and that I was
 a runaway wife. One can never be too cautious with such unprincipled
 creatures.
 
 MANDERS. My dear--Mrs. Alving, you know that is an absurd exaggeration--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Well well, suppose it is. My point is that your judgment
 as to my married life is founded upon nothing but common knowledge and
 report.
 
 MANDERS. I admit that. What then?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Well, then, Pastor Manders--I will tell you the truth. I
 have sworn to myself that one day you should know it--you alone!
 
 MANDERS. What is the truth, then?
 
 MRS. ALVING. The truth is that my husband died just as dissolute as he
 had lived all his days.
 
 MANDERS. [Feeling after a chair.] What do you say?
 
 MRS. ALVING. After nineteen years of marriage, as dissolute--in his
 desires at any rate--as he was before you married us.
 
 MANDERS. And those-those wild oats--those irregularities--those
 excesses, if you like--you call "a dissolute life"?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Our doctor used the expression.
 
 MANDERS. I do not understand you.
 
 MRS. ALVING. You need not.
 
 MANDERS. It almost makes me dizzy. Your whole married life, the seeming
 union of all these years, was nothing more than a hidden abyss!
 
 MRS. ALVING. Neither more nor less. Now you know it.
 
 MANDERS. This is--this is inconceivable to me. I cannot grasp it! I
 cannot realise it! But how was it possible to--? How could such a state
 of things be kept secret?
 
 MRS. ALVING. That has been my ceaseless struggle, day after day. After
 Oswald's birth, I thought Alving seemed to be a little better. But it
 did not last long. And then I had to struggle twice as hard, fighting as
 though for life or death, so that nobody should know what sort of man
 my child's father was. And you know what power Alving had of winning
 people's hearts. Nobody seemed able to believe anything but good of
 him. He was one of those people whose life does not bite upon their
 reputation. But at last, Mr. Manders--for you must know the whole
 story--the most repulsive thing of all happened.
 
 MANDERS. More repulsive than what you have told me?
 
 MRS. ALVING. I had gone on bearing with him, although I knew very well
 the secrets of his life out of doors. But when he brought the scandal
 within our own walls--
 
 MANDERS. Impossible! Here!
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes; here in our own home. It was there [Pointing towards
 the first door on the right], in the dining-room, that I first came
 to know of it. I was busy with something in there, and the door was
 standing ajar. I heard our housemaid come up from the garden, with water
 for those flowers.
 
 MANDERS. Well--?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Soon after, I heard Alving come in too. I heard him say
 something softly to her. And then I heard--[With a short laugh]--oh! it
 still sounds in my ears, so hateful and yet so ludicrous--I heard my own
 servant-maid whisper, "Let me go, Mr. Alving! Let me be!"
 
 MANDERS. What unseemly levity on his part'! But it cannot have been more
 than levity, Mrs. Alving; believe me, it cannot.
 
 MRS. ALVING. I soon knew what to believe. Mr. Alving had his way with
 the girl; and that connection had consequences, Mr. Manders.
 
 MANDERS. [As though petrified.] Such things in this house--in this
 house!
 
 MRS. ALVING. I had borne a great deal in this house. To keep him at home
 in the evenings, and at night, I had to make myself his boon companion
 in his secret orgies up in his room. There I have had to sit alone with
 him, to clink glasses and drink with him, and to listen to his ribald,
 silly talk. I have had to fight with him to get him dragged to bed--
 
 MANDERS. [Moved.] And you were able to bear all this!
 
 MRS. ALVING. I had to bear it for my little boy's sake. But when the
 last insult was added; when my own servant-maid--; then I swore to
 myself: This shall come to an end! And so I took the reins into my own
 hand--the whole control--over him and everything else. For now I had a
 weapon against him, you see; he dared not oppose me. It was then I sent
 Oswald away from home. He was nearly seven years old, and was beginning
 to observe and ask questions, as children do. That I could not bear. It
 seemed to me the child must be poisoned by merely breathing the air of
 this polluted home. That was why I sent him away. And now you can see,
 too, why he was never allowed to set foot inside his home so long as his
 father lived. No one knows what that cost me.
 
 MANDERS. You have indeed had a life of trial.
 
 MRS. ALVING. I could never have borne it if I had not had my work. For
 I may truly say that I have worked! All the additions to the estate--all
 the improvements--all the labour-saving appliances, that Alving was so
 much praised for having introduced--do you suppose he had energy for
 anything of the sort?--he, who lay all day on the sofa, reading an old
 Court Guide! No; but I may tell you this too: when he had his better
 intervals, it was I who urged him on; it was I who had to drag the
 whole load when he relapsed into his evil ways, or sank into querulous
 wretchedness.
 
 MANDERS. And it is to this man that you raise a memorial?
 
 MRS. ALVING. There you see the power of an evil conscience.
 
 MANDERS. Evil--? What do you mean?
 
 MRS. ALVING. It always seemed to me impossible but that the truth must
 come out and be believed. So the Orphanage was to deaden all rumours and
 set every doubt at rest.
 
 MANDERS. In that you have certainly not missed your aim, Mrs. Alving.
 
 MRS. ALVING. And besides, I had one other reason. I was determined that
 Oswald, my own boy, should inherit nothing whatever from his father.
 
 MANDERS. Then it is Alving's fortune that--?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes. The sums I have spent upon the Orphanage, year by
 year, make up the amount--I have reckoned it up precisely--the amount
 which made Lieutenant Alving "a good match" in his day.
 
 MANDERS. I don't understand--
 
 MRS. ALVING. It was my purchase-money. I do not choose that that money
 should pass into Oswald's hands. My son shall have everything from
 me--everything.
 
 [OSWALD ALVING enters through the second door to the right; he has taken
 of his hat and overcoat in the hall.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Going towards him.] Are you back again already? My dear,
 dear boy!
 
 OSWALD. Yes. What can a fellow do out of doors in this eternal rain? But
 I hear dinner is ready. That's capital!
 
 REGINA. [With a parcel, from the dining-room.] A parcel has come for
 you, Mrs. Alving. [Hands it to her.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. [With a glance at MR. MANDERS.] No doubt copies of the ode
 for to-morrow's ceremony.
 
 MANDERS. H'm--
 
 REGINA. And dinner is ready.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Very well. We will come directly. I will just--[Begins to
 open the parcel.]
 
 REGINA. [To OSWALD.] Would Mr. Alving like red or white wine?
 
 OSWALD. Both, if you please.
 
 REGINA. _Bien_. Very well, sir. [She goes into the dining-room.]
 
 OSWALD. I may as well help to uncork it. [He also goes into the dining
 room, the door of which swings half open behind him.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Who has opened the parcel.] Yes, I thought so. Here is the
 Ceremonial Ode, Pastor Manders.
 
 MANDERS. [With folded hands.] With what countenance I am to deliver my
 discourse to-morrow--!
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oh, you will get through it somehow.
 
 MANDERS. [Softly, so as not to be heard in the dining-room.] Yes; it
 would not do to provoke scandal.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Under her breath, but firmly.] No. But then this long,
 hateful comedy will be ended. From the day after to-morrow, I shall act
 in every way as though he who is dead had never lived in this house.
 There shall be no one here but my boy and his mother.
 
 [From the dining-room comes the noise of a chair overturned, and at the
 same moment is heard:]
 
 REGINA. [Sharply, but in a whisper.] Oswald! take care! are you mad? Let
 me go!
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Starts in terror.] Ah--!
 
 [She stares wildly towards the half-open door. OSWALD is heard laughing
 and humming. A bottle is uncorked.]
 
 MANDERS. [Agitated.] What can be the matter? What is it, Mrs. Alving?
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Hoarsely.] Ghosts! The couple from the conservatory--risen
 again!
 
 MANDERS. Is it possible! Regina--? Is she--?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes. Come. Not a word--!
 
 [She seizes PASTOR MANDERS by the arm, and walks unsteadily towards the
 dining-room.]
 
 
 
 
 ACT SECOND.
 
 [The same room. The mist still lies heavy over the landscape.]
 
 [MANDERS and MRS. ALVING enter from the dining-room.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Still in the doorway.] _Velbekomme_ [Note: A phrase
 equivalent to the German _Prosit die Mahlzeit_--May good digestion wait
 on appetite.], Mr. Manders. [Turns back towards the dining-room.] Aren't
 you coming too, Oswald?
 
 OSWALD. [From within.] No, thank you. I think I shall go out a little.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, do. The weather seems a little brighter now. [She
 shuts the dining-room door, goes to the hall door, and calls:] Regina!
 
 REGINA. [Outside.] Yes, Mrs. Alving?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Go down to the laundry, and help with the garlands.
 
 REGINA. Yes, Mrs. Alving.
 
 [MRS. ALVING assures herself that REGINA goes; then shuts the door.]
 
 MANDERS. I suppose he cannot overhear us in there?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Not when the door is shut. Besides, he's just going out.
 
 MANDERS. I am still quite upset. I don't know how I could swallow a
 morsel of dinner.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Controlling her nervousness, walks up and down.] Nor I.
 But what is to be done now?
 
 MANDERS. Yes; what is to be done? I am really quite at a loss. I am so
 utterly without experience in matters of this sort.
 
 MRS. ALVING. I feel sure that, so far, no mischief has been done.
 
 MANDERS. No; heaven forbid! But it is an unseemly state of things,
 nevertheless.
 
 MRS. ALVING. It is only an idle fancy on Oswald's part; you may be sure
 of that.
 
 MANDERS. Well, as I say, I am not accustomed to affairs of the kind. But
 I should certainly think--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Out of the house she must go, and that immediately. That is
 as clear as daylight--
 
 MANDERS. Yes, of course she must.
 
 MRS. ALVING. But where to? It would not be right to--
 
 MANDERS. Where to? Home to her father, of course.
 
 MRS. ALVING. To whom did you say?
 
 MANDERS. To her--But then, Engstrand is not--? Good God, Mrs. Alving,
 it's impossible! You must be mistaken after all.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Unfortunately there is no possibility of mistake. Johanna
 confessed everything to me; and Alving could not deny it. So there was
 nothing to be done but to get the matter hushed up.
 
 MANDERS. No, you could do nothing else.
 
 MRS. ALVING. The girl left our service at once, and got a good sum of
 money to hold her tongue for the time. The rest she managed for herself
 when she got to town. She renewed her old acquaintance with Engstrand,
 no doubt let him see that she had money in her purse, and told him some
 tale about a foreigner who put in here with a yacht that summer. So she
 and Engstrand got married in hot haste. Why, you married them yourself.
 
 MANDERS. But then how to account for--? I recollect distinctly Engstrand
 coming to give notice of the marriage. He was quite overwhelmed with
 contrition, and bitterly reproached himself for the misbehaviour he and
 his sweetheart had been guilty of.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes; of course he had to take the blame upon himself.
 
 MANDERS. But such a piece of duplicity on his part! And towards me too!
 I never could have believed it of Jacob Engstrand. I shall not fail
 to take him seriously to task; he may be sure of that.--And then the
 immorality of such a connection! For money--! How much did the girl
 receive?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Three hundred dollars.
 
 MANDERS. Just think of it--for a miserable three hundred dollars, to go
 and marry a fallen woman!
 
 MRS. ALVING. Then what have you to say of me? I went and married a
 fallen man.
 
 MANDERS. Why--good heavens!--what are you talking about! A fallen man!
 
 MRS. ALVING. Do you think Alving was any purer when I went with him to
 the altar than Johanna was when Engstrand married her?
 
 MANDERS. Well, but there is a world of difference between the two
 cases--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Not so much difference after all--except in the price:--a
 miserable three hundred dollars and a whole fortune.
 
 MANDERS. How can you compare such absolutely dissimilar cases? You had
 taken counsel with your own heart and with your natural advisers.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Without looking at him.] I thought you understood where
 what you call my heart had strayed to at the time.
 
 MANDERS. [Distantly.] Had I understood anything of the kind, I should
 not have been a daily guest in your husband's house.
 
 MRS. ALVING. At any rate, the fact remains that with myself I took no
 counsel whatever.
 
 MANDERS. Well then, with your nearest relatives--as your duty bade
 you--with your mother and your two aunts.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, that is true. Those three cast up the account for me.
 Oh, it's marvellous how clearly they made out that it would be downright
 madness to refuse such an offer. If mother could only see me now, and
 know what all that grandeur has come to!
 
 MANDERS. Nobody can be held responsible for the result. This, at least,
 remains clear: your marriage was in full accordance with law and order.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [At the window.] Oh, that perpetual law and order! I often
 think that is what does all the mischief in this world of ours.
 
 MANDERS. Mrs. Alving, that is a sinful way of talking.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Well, I can't help it; I must have done with all this
 constraint and insincerity. I can endure it no longer. I must work my
 way out to freedom.
 
 MANDERS. What do you mean by that?
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Drumming on the window frame.] I ought never to have
 concealed the facts of Alving's life. But at that time I dared not
 do anything else-I was afraid, partly on my own account. I was such a
 coward.
 
 MANDERS. A coward?
 
 MRS. ALVING. If people had come to know anything, they would have
 said--"Poor man! with a runaway wife, no wonder he kicks over the
 traces."
 
 MANDERS. Such remarks might have been made with a certain show of right.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Looking steadily at him.] If I were what I ought to be, I
 should go to Oswald and say, "Listen, my boy: your father led a vicious
 life--"
 
 MANDERS. Merciful heavens--!
 
 MRS. ALVING.--and then I should tell him all I have told you--every word
 of it.
 
 MANDERS. You shock me unspeakably, Mrs. Alving.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes; I know that. I know that very well. I myself am
 shocked at the idea. [Goes away from the window.] I am such a coward.
 
 MANDERS. You call it "cowardice" to do your plain duty? Have you
 forgotten that a son ought to love and honour his father and mother?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Do not let us talk in such general terms. Let us ask: Ought
 Oswald to love and honour Chamberlain Alving?
 
 MANDERS. Is there no voice in your mother's heart that forbids you to
 destroy your son's ideals?
 
 MRS. ALVING. But what about the truth?
 
 MANDERS. But what about the ideals?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oh--ideals, ideals! If only I were not such a coward!
 
 MANDERS. Do not despise ideals, Mrs. Alving; they will avenge themselves
 cruelly. Take Oswald's case: he, unfortunately, seems to have few enough
 ideals as it is; but I can see that his father stands before him as an
 ideal.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, that is true.
 
 MANDERS. And this habit of mind you have yourself implanted and fostered
 by your letters.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes; in my superstitious awe for duty and the proprieties,
 I lied to my boy, year after year. Oh, what a coward--what a coward I
 have been!
 
 MANDERS. You have established a happy illusion in your son's heart, Mrs.
 Alving; and assuredly you ought not to undervalue it.
 
 MRS. ALVING. H'm; who knows whether it is so happy after all--? But, at
 any rate, I will not have any tampering wide Regina. He shall not go and
 wreck the poor girl's life.
 
 MANDERS. No; good God--that would be terrible!
 
 MRS. ALVING. If I knew he was in earnest, and that it would be for his
 happiness--
 
 MANDERS. What? What then?
 
 MRS. ALVING. But it couldn't be; for unfortunately Regina is not the
 right sort of woman.
 
 MANDERS. Well, what then? What do you mean?
 
 MRS. ALVING. If I weren't such a pitiful coward, I should say to him,
 "Marry her, or make what arrangement you please, only let us have
 nothing underhand about it."
 
 MANDERS. Merciful heavens, would you let them marry! Anything so
 dreadful--! so unheard of--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Do you really mean "unheard of"? Frankly, Pastor Manders,
 do you suppose that throughout the country there are not plenty of
 married couples as closely akin as they?
 
 MANDERS. I don't in the least understand you.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oh yes, indeed you do.
 
 MANDERS. Ah, you are thinking of the possibility that--Alas! yes, family
 life is certainly not always so pure as it ought to be. But in such a
 case as you point to, one can never know--at least with any certainty.
 Here, on the other hand--that you, a mother, can think of letting your
 son--
 
 MRS. ALVING. But I cannot--I wouldn't for anything in the world; that is
 precisely what I am saying.
 
 MANDERS. No, because you are a "coward," as you put it. But if you were
 not a "coward," then--? Good God! a connection so shocking!
 
 MRS. ALVING. So far as that goes, they say we are all sprung from
 connections of that sort. And who is it that arranged the world so,
 Pastor Manders?
 
 MANDERS. Questions of that kind I must decline to discuss with you, Mrs.
 Alving; you are far from being in the right frame of mind for them. But
 that you dare to call your scruples "cowardly"--!
 
 MRS. ALVING. Let me tell you what I mean. I am timid and faint-hearted
 because of the ghosts that hang about me, and that I can never quite
 shake off.
 
 MANDERS. What do you say hangs about you?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Ghosts! When I heard Regina and Oswald in there, it was
 as though ghosts rose up before me. But I almost think we are all of us
 ghosts, Pastor Manders. It is not only what we have inherited from our
 father and mother that "walks" in us. It is all sorts of dead ideas,
 and lifeless old beliefs, and so forth. They have no vitality, but they
 cling to us all the same, and we cannot shake them off. Whenever I take
 up a newspaper, I seem to see ghosts gliding between the lines. There
 must be ghosts all the country over, as thick as the sands of the sea.
 And then we are, one and all, so pitifully afraid of the light.
 
 MANDERS. Aha--here we have the fruits of your reading. And pretty fruits
 they are, upon my word! Oh, those horrible, revolutionary, free-thinking
 books!
 
 MRS. ALVING. You are mistaken, my dear Pastor. It was you yourself who
 set me thinking; and I thank you for it with all my heart.
 
 MANDERS. I!
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes--when you forced me under the yoke of what you called
 duty and obligation; when you lauded as right and proper what my whole
 soul rebelled against as something loathsome. It was then that I began
 to look into the seams of your doctrines. I wanted only to pick at a
 single knot; but when I had got that undone, the whole thing ravelled
 out. And then I understood that it was all machine-sewn.
 
 MANDERS. [Softly, with emotion.] And was that the upshot of my life's
 hardest battle?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Call it rather your most pitiful defeat.
 
 MANDERS. It was my greatest victory, Helen--the victory over myself.
 
 MRS. ALVING. It was a crime against us both.
 
 MANDERS. When you went astray, and came to me crying, "Here I am; take
 me!" I commanded you, saying, "Woman, go home to your lawful husband."
 Was that a crime?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, I think so.
 
 MANDERS. We two do not understand each other.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Not now, at any rate.
 
 MANDERS. Never--never in my most secret thoughts have I regarded you
 otherwise than as another's wife.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oh--indeed?
 
 MANDERS. Helen--!
 
 MRS. ALVING. People so easily forget their past selves.
 
 MANDERS. I do not. I am what I always was.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Changing the subject.] Well well well; don't let us talk
 of old times any longer. You are now over head and ears in Boards and
 Committees, and I am fighting my battle with ghosts, both within me and
 without.
 
 MANDERS. Those without I shall help you to lay. After all the terrible
 things I have heard from you today, I cannot in conscience permit an
 unprotected girl to remain in your house.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Don't you think the best plan would be to get her provided
 for?--I mean, by a good marriage.
 
 MANDERS. No doubt. I think it would be desirable for her in every
 respect. Regina is now at the age when--Of course I don't know much
 about these things, but--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Regina matured very early.
 
 MANDERS. Yes, I thought so. I have an impression that she was remarkably
 well developed, physically, when I prepared her for confirmation. But in
 the meantime, she ought to be at home, under her father's eye--Ah! but
 Engstrand is not--That he--that he--could so hide the truth from me! [A
 knock at the door into the hall.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. Who can this be? Come in!
 
 ENGSTRAND. [In his Sunday clothes, in the doorway.] I humbly beg your
 pardon, but--
 
 MANDERS. Aha! H'm--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Is that you, Engstrand?
 
 ENGSTRAND.--there was none of the servants about, so I took the great
 liberty of just knocking.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oh, very well. Come in. Do you want to speak to me?
 
 ENGSTRAND. [Comes in.] No, I'm obliged to you, ma'am; it was with his
 Reverence I wanted to have a word or two.
 
 MANDERS. [Walking up and down the room.] Ah--indeed! You want to speak
 to me, do you?
 
 ENGSTRAND. Yes, I'd like so terrible much to--
 
 MANDERS. [Stops in front of him.] Well; may I ask what you want?
 
 ENGSTRAND. Well, it was just this, your Reverence: we've been paid off
 down yonder--my grateful thanks to you, ma'am,--and now everything's
 finished, I've been thinking it would be but right and proper if we,
 that have been working so honestly together all this time--well, I was
 thinking we ought to end up with a little prayer-meeting to-night.
 
 MANDERS. A prayer-meeting? Down at the Orphanage?
 
 ENGSTRAND. Oh, if your Reverence doesn't think it proper--
 
 MANDERS. Oh yes, I do; but--h'm--
 
 ENGSTRAND. I've been in the habit of offering up a little prayer in the
 evenings, myself--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Have you?
 
 ENGSTRAND. Yes, every now and then just a little edification, in a
 manner of speaking. But I'm a poor, common man, and have little enough
 gift, God help me!--and so I thought, as the Reverend Mr. Manders
 happened to be here, I'd--
 
 MANDERS. Well, you see, Engstrand, I have a question to put to you
 first. Are you in the right frame of mind for such a meeting! Do you
 feel your conscience clear and at ease?
 
 ENGSTRAND. Oh, God help us, your Reverence! we'd better not talk about
 conscience.
 
 MANDERS. Yes, that is just what we must talk about. What have you to
 answer?
 
 ENGSTRAND. Why--a man's conscience--it can be bad enough now and then.
 
 MANDERS. Ah, you admit that. Then perhaps you will make a clean breast
 of it, and tell me--the real truth about Regina?
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Quickly.] Mr. Manders!
 
 MANDERS. [Reassuringly.] Please allow me--
 
 ENGSTRAND. About Regina! Lord, what a turn you gave me! [Looks at MRS.
 ALVING.] There's nothing wrong about Regina, is there?
 
 MANDERS. We will hope not. But I mean, what is the truth about you and
 Regina? You pass for her father, eh!
 
 ENGSTRAND. [Uncertain.] Well--h'm--your Reverence knows all about me and
 poor Johanna.
 
 MANDERS. Come now, no more prevarication! Your wife told Mrs. Alving the
 whole story before quitting her service.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Well, then, may--! Now, did she really?
 
 MANDERS. You see we know you now, Engstrand.
 
 ENGSTRAND. And she swore and took her Bible oath--
 
 MANDERS. Did she take her Bible oath?
 
 ENGSTRAND. No; she only swore; but she did it that solemn-like.
 
 MANDERS. And you have hidden the truth from me all these years? Hidden
 it from me, who have trusted you without reserve, in everything.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Well, I can't deny it.
 
 MANDERS. Have I deserved this of you, Engstrand? Have I not always been
 ready to help you in word and deed, so far as it lay in my power? Answer
 me. Have I not?
 
 ENGSTRAND. It would have been a poor look-out for me many a time but for
 the Reverend Mr. Manders.
 
 MANDERS. And this is how you reward me! You cause me to enter falsehoods
 in the Church Register, and you withhold from me, year after year, the
 explanations you owed alike to me and to the truth. Your conduct has
 been wholly inexcusable, Engstrand; and from this time forward I have
 done with you!
 
 ENGSTRAND. [With a sigh.] Yes! I suppose there's no help for it.
 
 MANDERS. How can you possibly justify yourself?
 
 ENGSTRAND. Who could ever have thought she'd have gone and made bad
 worse by talking about it? Will your Reverence just fancy yourself in
 the same trouble as poor Johanna--
 
 MANDERS. I!
 
 ENGSTRAND. Lord bless you, I don't mean just exactly the same. But I
 mean, if your Reverence had anything to be ashamed of in the eyes of the
 world, as the saying goes. We menfolk oughtn't to judge a poor woman too
 hardly, your Reverence.
 
 MANDERS. I am not doing so. It is you I am reproaching.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Might I make so bold as to ask your Reverence a bit of a
 question?
 
 MANDERS. Yes, if you want to.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Isn't it right and proper for a man to raise up the fallen?
 
 MANDERS. Most certainly it is.
 
 ENGSTRAND. And isn't a man bound to keep his sacred word?
 
 MANDERS. Why, of course he is; but--
 
 ENGSTRAND. When Johanna had got into trouble through that Englishman--or
 it might have been an American or a Russian, as they call them--well,
 you see, she came down into the town. Poor thing, she'd sent me about
 my business once or twice before: for she couldn't bear the sight of
 anything as wasn't handsome; and I'd got this damaged leg of mine. Your
 Reverence recollects how I ventured up into a dancing saloon, where
 seafaring men was carrying on with drink and devilry, as the saying
 goes. And then, when I was for giving them a bit of an admonition to
 lead a new life--
 
 MRS. ALVING. [At the window.] H'm--
 
 MANDERS. I know all about that, Engstrand; the ruffians threw you
 downstairs. You have told me of the affair already. Your infirmity is an
 honour to you.
 
 ENGSTRAND. I'm not puffed up about it, your Reverence. But what I wanted
 to say was, that when she came and confessed all to me, with weeping and
 gnashing of teeth, I can tell your Reverence I was sore at heart to hear
 it.
 
 MANDERS. Were you indeed, Engstrand? Well, go on.
 
 ENGSTRAND. So I says to her, "The American, he's sailing about on the
 boundless sea. And as for you, Johanna," says I, "you've committed a
 grievous sin, and you're a fallen creature. But Jacob Engstrand,"
 says I, "he's got two good legs to stand upon, he has--" You see, your
 Reverence, I was speaking figurative-like.
 
 MANDERS. I understand quite well. Go on.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Well, that was how I raised her up and made an honest woman
 of her, so as folks shouldn't get to know how as she'd gone astray with
 foreigners.
 
 MANDERS. In all that you acted very well. Only I cannot approve of your
 stooping to take money--
 
 ENGSTRAND. Money? I? Not a farthing!
 
 MANDERS. [Inquiringly to MRS. ALVING.] But--
 
 ENGSTRAND. Oh, wait a minute!--now I recollect. Johanna did have a
 trifle of money. But I would have nothing to do with that. "No," says I,
 "that's mammon; that's the wages of sin. This dirty gold--or notes, or
 whatever it was--we'll just flint, that back in the American's face,"
 says I. But he was off and away, over the stormy sea, your Reverence.
 
 MANDERS. Was he really, my good fellow?
 
 ENGSTRAND. He was indeed, sir. So Johanna and I, we agreed that the
 money should go to the child's education; and so it did, and I can
 account for every blessed farthing of it.
 
 MANDERS. Why, this alters the case considerably.
 
 ENGSTRAND. That's just how it stands, your Reverence. And I make so bold
 as to say as I've been an honest father to Regina, so far as my poor
 strength went; for I'm but a weak vessel, worse luck!
 
 MANDERS. Well, well, my good fellow--
 
 ENGSTRAND. All the same, I bear myself witness as I've brought up the
 child, and lived kindly with poor Johanna, and ruled over my own house,
 as the Scripture has it. But it couldn't never enter my head to go to
 your Reverence and puff myself up and boast because even the likes of
 me had done some good in the world. No, sir; when anything of that
 sort happens to Jacob Engstrand, he holds his tongue about it. It don't
 happen so terrible often, I daresay. And when I do come to see your
 Reverence, I find a mortal deal that's wicked and weak to talk about.
 For I said it before, and I says it again--a man's conscience isn't
 always as clean as it might be.
 
 MANDERS. Give me your hand, Jacob Engstrand.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Oh, Lord! your Reverence--
 
 MANDERS. Come, no nonsense [wrings his hand]. There we are!
 
 ENGSTRAND. And if I might humbly beg your Reverence's pardon--
 
 MANDERS. You? On the contrary, it is I who ought to beg your pardon--
 
 ENGSTRAND. Lord, no, Sir!
 
 MANDERS. Yes, assuredly. And I do it with all my heart. Forgive me for
 misunderstanding you. I only wish I could give you some proof of my
 hearty regret, and of my good-will towards you--
 
 ENGSTRAND. Would your Reverence do it?
 
 MANDERS. With the greatest pleasure.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Well then, here's the very chance. With the bit of money I've
 saved here, I was thinking I might set up a Sailors' Home down in the
 town.
 
 MRS. ALVING. You?
 
 ENGSTRAND. Yes; it might be a sort of Orphanage, too, in a manner of
 speaking. There's such a many temptations for seafaring folk ashore. But
 in this Home of mine, a man might feel like as he was under a father's
 eye, I was thinking.
 
 MANDERS. What do you say to this, Mrs. Alving?
 
 ENGSTRAND. It isn't much as I've got to start with, Lord help me! But if
 I could only find a helping hand, why--
 
 MANDERS. Yes, yes; we will look into the matter more closely. I entirely
 approve of your plan. But now, go before me and make everything
 ready, and get the candles lighted, so as to give the place an air of
 festivity. And then we will pass an edifying hour together, my good
 fellow; for now I quite believe you are in the right frame of mind.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Yes, I trust I am. And so I'll say good-bye, ma'am, and thank
 you kindly; and take good care of Regina for me--[Wipes a tear from his
 eye]--poor Johanna's child. Well, it's a queer thing, now; but it's just
 like as if she'd growd into the very apple of my eye. It is, indeed. [He
 bows and goes out through the hall.]
 
 MANDERS. Well, what do you say of that man now, Mrs. Alving? That was a
 very different account of matters, was it not?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, it certainly was.
 
 MANDERS. It only shows how excessively careful one ought to be in
 judging one's fellow creatures. But what a heartfelt joy it is to
 ascertain that one has been mistaken! Don't you think so?
 
 MRS. ALVING. I think you are, and will always be, a great baby, Manders.
 
 MANDERS. I?
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Laying her two hands upon his shoulders.] And I say that I
 have half a mind to put my arms round your neck, and kiss you.
 
 MANDERS. [Stepping hastily back.] No, no! God bless me! What an idea!
 
 MRS. ALVING. [With a smile.] Oh, you needn't be afraid of me.
 
 MANDERS. [By the table.] You have sometimes such an exaggerated way of
 expressing yourself. Now, let me just collect all the documents, and put
 them in my bag. [He does so.] There, that's all right. And now, good-bye
 for the present. Keep your eyes open when Oswald comes back. I shall
 look in again later. [He takes his hat and goes out through the hall
 door.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Sighs, looks for a moment out of the window, sets the room
 in order a little, and is about to go into the dining-room, but stops at
 the door with a half-suppressed cry.] Oswald, are you still at table?
 
 OSWALD. [In the dining room.] I'm only finishing my cigar.
 
 MRS. ALVING. I thought you had gone for a little walk.
 
 OSWALD. In such weather as this?
 
 [A glass clinks. MRS. ALVING leaves the door open, and sits down with
 her knitting on the sofa by the window.]
 
 OSWALD. Wasn't that Pastor Manders that went out just now?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes; he went down to the Orphanage.
 
 OSWALD. H'm. [The glass and decanter clink again.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. [With a troubled glance.] Dear Oswald, you should take care
 of that liqueur. It is strong.
 
 OSWALD. It keeps out the damp.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Wouldn't you rather come in here, to me?
 
 OSWALD. I mayn't smoke in there.
 
 MRS. ALVING. You know quite well you may smoke cigars.
 
 OSWALD. Oh, all right then; I'll come in. Just a tiny drop more first.
 There! [He comes into the room with his cigar, and shuts the door after
 him. A short silence.] Where has the pastor gone to?
 
 MRS. ALVING. I have just told you; he went down to the Orphanage.
 
 OSWALD. Oh, yes; so you did.
 
 MRS. ALVING. You shouldn't sit so long at table, Oswald.
 
 OSWALD. [Holding his cigar behind him.] But I find it so pleasant,
 mother. [Strokes and caresses her.] Just think what it is for me to come
 home and sit at mother's own table, in mother's room, and eat mother's
 delicious dishes.
 
 MRS. ALVING. My dear, dear boy!
 
 OSWALD. [Somewhat impatiently, walks about and smokes.] And what else
 can I do with myself here? I can't set to work at anything.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Why can't you?
 
 OSWALD. In such weather as this? Without a single ray of sunshine the
 whole day? [Walks up the room.] Oh, not to be able to work--!
 
 MRS. ALVING. Perhaps it was not quite wise of you to come home?
 
 OSWALD. Oh, yes, mother; I had to.
 
 MRS. ALVING. You know I would ten times rather forgo the joy of having
 you here, than let you--
 
 OSWALD. [Stops beside the table.] Now just tell me, mother: does it
 really make you so very happy to have me home again?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Does it make me happy!
 
 OSWALD. [Crumpling up a newspaper.] I should have thought it must be
 pretty much the same to you whether I was in existence or not.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Have you the heart to say that to your mother, Oswald?
 
 OSWALD. But you've got on very well without me all this time.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes; I have got on without you. That is true.
 
 [A silence. Twilight slowly begins to fall. OSWALD paces to and fro
 across the room. He has laid his cigar down.]
 
 OSWALD. [Stops beside MRS. ALVING.] Mother, may I sit on the sofa beside
 you?
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Makes room for him.] Yes, do, my dear boy.
 
 OSWALD. [Sits down.] There is something I must tell you, mother.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Anxiously.] Well?
 
 OSWALD. [Looks fixedly before him.] For I can't go on hiding it any
 longer.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Hiding what? What is it?
 
 OSWALD. [As before.] I could never bring myself to write to you about
 it; and since I've come home--
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Seizes him by the arm.] Oswald, what is the matter?
 
 OSWALD. Both yesterday and to-day I have tried to put the thoughts away
 from me--to cast them off; but it's no use.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Rising.] Now you must tell me everything, Oswald!
 
 OSWALD. [Draws her down to the sofa again.] Sit still; and then I will
 try to tell you.--I complained of fatigue after my journey--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Well? What then?
 
 OSWALD. But it isn't that that is the matter with me; not any ordinary
 fatigue--
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Tries to jump up.] You are not ill, Oswald?
 
 OSWALD. [Draws her down again.] Sit still, mother. Do take it quietly.
 I'm not downright ill, either; not what is commonly called "ill."
 [Clasps his hands above his head.] Mother, my mind is broken
 down--ruined--I shall never be able to work again! [With his hands
 before his face, he buries his head in her lap, and breaks into bitter
 sobbing.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. [White and trembling.] Oswald! Look at me! No, no; it's not
 true.
 
 OSWALD. [Looks up with despair in his eyes.] Never to be able to work
 again! Never!--never! A living death! Mother, can you imagine anything
 so horrible?
 
 MRS. ALVING. My poor boy! How has this horrible thing come upon you?
 
 OSWALD. [Sitting upright again.] That's just what I cannot possibly
 grasp or understand. I have never led a dissipated life never, in any
 respect. You mustn't believe that of me, mother! I've never done that.
 
 MRS. ALVING. I am sure you haven't, Oswald.
 
 OSWALD. And yet this has come upon me just the same--this awful
 misfortune!
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oh, but it will pass over, my dear, blessed boy. It's
 nothing but over-work. Trust me, I am right.
 
 OSWALD. [Sadly.] I thought so too, at first; but it isn't so.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Tell me everything, from beginning to end.
 
 OSWALD. Yes, I will.
 
 MRS. ALVING. When did you first notice it?
 
 OSWALD. It was directly after I had been home last time, and had got
 back to Paris again. I began to feel the most violent pains in my
 head--chiefly in the back of my head, they seemed to come. It was as
 though a tight iron ring was being screwed round my neck and upwards.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Well, and then?
 
 OSWALD. At first I thought it was nothing but the ordinary headache I
 had been so plagued with while I was growing up--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, yes--
 
 OSWALD. But it wasn't that. I soon found that out. I couldn't work any
 more. I wanted to begin upon a big new picture, but my powers seemed to
 fail me; all my strength was crippled; I could form no definite images;
 everything swam before me--whirling round and round. Oh, it was an awful
 state! At last I sent for a doctor--and from him I learned the truth.
 
 MRS. ALVING. How do you mean?
 
 OSWALD. He was one of the first doctors in Paris. I told him my
 symptoms; and then he set to work asking me a string of questions which
 I thought had nothing to do with the matter. I couldn't imagine what the
 man was after--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Well?
 
 OSWALD. At last he said: "There has been something worm-eaten in you
 from your birth." He used that very word--_vermoulu_.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Breathlessly.] What did he mean by that?
 
 OSWALD. I didn't understand either, and begged him to explain himself
 more clearly. And then the old cynic said--[Clenching his fist] Oh--!
 
 MRS. ALVING. What did he say?
 
 OSWALD. He said, "The sins of the fathers are visited upon the
 children."
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Rising slowly.] The sins of the fathers--!
 
 OSWALD. I very nearly struck him in the face--
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Walks away across the room.] The sins of the fathers--
 
 OSWALD. [Smiles sadly.] Yes; what do you think of that? Of course I
 assured him that such a thing was out of the question. But do you think
 he gave in? No, he stuck to it; and it was only when I produced your
 letters and translated the passages relating to father--
 
 MRS. ALVING. But then--?
 
 OSWALD. Then of course he had to admit that he was on the wrong track;
 and so I learned the truth--the incomprehensible truth! I ought not to
 have taken part with my comrades in that lighthearted, glorious life of
 theirs. It had been too much for my strength. So I had brought it upon
 myself!
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oswald! No, no; do not believe it!
 
 OSWALD. No other explanation was possible, he said. That's the awful
 part of it. Incurably ruined for life--by my own heedlessness! All that
 I meant to have done in the world--I never dare think of it again--I'm
 not able to think of it. Oh! if I could only live over again, and undo
 all I have done! [He buries his face in the sofa.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Wrings her hands and walks, in silent struggle, backwards
 and forwards.]
 
 OSWALD. [After a while, looks up and remains resting upon his elbow.] If
 it had only been something inherited--something one wasn't responsible
 for! But this! To have thrown away so shamefully, thoughtlessly,
 recklessly, one's own happiness, one's own health, everything in the
 world--one's future, one's very life--!
 
 MRS. ALVING. No, no, my dear, darling boy; this is impossible! [Bends
 over him.] Things are not so desperate as you think.
 
 OSWALD. Oh, you don't know--[Springs up.] And then, mother, to cause
 you all this sorrow! Many a time I have almost wished and hoped that at
 bottom you didn't care so very much about me.
 
 MRS. ALVING. I, Oswald? My only boy! You are all I have in the world!
 The only thing I care about!
 
 OSWALD. [Seizes both her hands and kisses them.] Yes, yes, I see it.
 When I'm at home, I see it, of course; and that's almost the hardest
 part for me.--But now you know the whole story and now we won't talk any
 more about it to-day. I daren't think of it for long together. [Goes up
 the room.] Get me something to drink, mother.
 
 MRS. ALVING. To drink? What do you want to drink now?
 
 OSWALD. Oh, anything you like. You have some cold punch in the house.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, but my dear Oswald--
 
 OSWALD. Don't refuse me, mother. Do be kind, now! I must have something
 to wash down all these gnawing thoughts. [Goes into the conservatory.]
 And then--it's so dark here! [MRS. ALVING pulls a bell-rope on the
 right.] And this ceaseless rain! It may go on week after week, for
 months together. Never to get a glimpse of the sun! I can't recollect
 ever having seen the sun shine all the times I've been at home.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oswald--you are thinking of going away from me.
 
 OSWALD. H'm--[Drawing a heavy breath.]--I'm not thinking of anything. I
 cannot think of anything! [In a low voice.] I let thinking alone.
 
 REGINA. [From the dining-room.] Did you ring, ma'am?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes; let us have the lamp in.
 
 REGINA. Yes, ma'am. It's ready lighted. [Goes out.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Goes across to OSWALD.] Oswald, be frank with me.
 
 OSWALD. Well, so I am, mother. [Goes to the table.] I think I have told
 you enough.
 
 [REGINA brings the lamp and sets it upon the table.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. Regina, you may bring us a small bottle of champagne.
 
 REGINA. Very well, ma'am. [Goes out.]
 
 OSWALD. [Puts his arm round MRS. ALVING's neck.] That's just what I
 wanted. I knew mother wouldn't let her boy go thirsty.
 
 MRS. ALVING. My own, poor, darling Oswald; how could I deny you anything
 now?
 
 OSWALD. [Eagerly.] Is that true, mother? Do you mean it?
 
 MRS. ALVING. How? What?
 
 OSWALD. That you couldn't deny me anything.
 
 MRS. ALVING. My dear Oswald--
 
 OSWALD. Hush!
 
 REGINA. [Brings a tray with a half-bottle of champagne and two glasses,
 which she sets on the table.] Shall I open it?
 
 OSWALD. No, thanks. I will do it myself.
 
 [REGINA goes out again.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Sits down by the table.] What was it you meant--that I
 musn't deny you?
 
 OSWALD. [Busy opening the bottle.] First let us have a glass--or two.
 
 [The cork pops; he pours wine into one glass, and is about to pour it
 into the other.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Holding her hand over it.] Thanks; not for me.
 
 OSWALD. Oh! won't you? Then I will!
 
 [He empties the glass, fells, and empties it again; then he sits down by
 the table.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. [In expectancy.] Well?
 
 OSWALD. [Without looking at her.] Tell me--I thought you and Pastor
 Manders seemed so odd--so quiet--at dinner to-day.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Did you notice it?
 
 OSWALD. Yes. H'm--[After a short silence.] Tell me: what do you think of
 Regina?
 
 MRS. ALVING. What do I think?
 
 OSWALD. Yes; isn't she splendid?
 
 MRS. ALVING. My dear Oswald, you don't know her as I do--
 
 OSWALD. Well?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Regina, unfortunately, was allowed to stay at home too
 long. I ought to have taken her earlier into my house.
 
 OSWALD. Yes, but isn't she splendid to look at, mother? [He fills his
 glass.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. Regina has many serious faults--
 
 OSWALD. Oh, what does that matter? [He drinks again.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. But I am fond of her, nevertheless, and I am responsible
 for her. I wouldn't for all the world have any harm happen to her.
 
 OSWALD. [Springs up.] Mother, Regina is my only salvation!
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Rising.] What do you mean by that?
 
 OSWALD. I cannot go on bearing all this anguish of soul alone.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Have you not your mother to share it with you?
 
 OSWALD. Yes; that's what I thought; and so I came home to you. But that
 will not do. I see it won't do. I cannot endure my life here.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oswald!
 
 OSWALD. I must live differently, mother. That is why I must leave you. I
 will not have you looking on at it.
 
 MRS. ALVING. My unhappy boy! But, Oswald, while you are so ill as this--
 
 OSWALD. If it were only the illness, I should stay with you, mother, you
 may be sure; for you are the best friend I have in the world.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, indeed I am, Oswald; am I not?
 
 OSWALD. [Wanders restlessly about.] But it's all the torment, the
 gnawing remorse--and then, the great, killing dread. Oh--that awful
 dread!
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Walking after him.] Dread? What dread? What do you mean?
 
 OSWALD. Oh, you mustn't ask me any more. I don't know. I can't describe
 it.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Goes over to the right and pulls the bell.]
 
 OSWALD. What is it you want?
 
 MRS. ALVING. I want my boy to be happy--that is what I want. He sha'n't
 go on brooding over things [To REGINA, who appears at the door:] More
 champagne--a large bottle. [REGINA goes.]
 
 OSWALD. Mother!
 
 MRS. ALVING. Do you think we don't know how to live here at home?
 
 OSWALD. Isn't she splendid to look at? How beautifully she's built! And
 so thoroughly healthy!
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Sits by the table.] Sit down, Oswald; let us talk quietly
 together.
 
 OSWALD. [Sits.] I daresay you don't know, mother, that I owe Regina some
 reparation.
 
 MRS. ALVING. You!
 
 OSWALD. For a bit of thoughtlessness, or whatever you like to call
 it--very innocent, at any rate. When I was home last time--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Well?
 
 OSWALD. She used often to ask me about Paris, and I used to tell her one
 thing and another. Then I recollect I happened to say to her one day,
 "Shouldn't you like to go there yourself?"
 
 MRS. ALVING. Well?
 
 OSWALD. I saw her face flush, and then she said, "Yes, I should like it
 of all things." "Ah, well," I replied, "it might perhaps be managed"--or
 something like that.
 
 MRS. ALVING. And then?
 
 OSWALD. Of course I had forgotten all about it; but the day before
 yesterday I happened to ask her whether she was glad I was to stay at
 home so long--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes?
 
 OSWALD. And then she gave me such a strange look, and asked, "But what's
 to become of my trip to Paris?"
 
 MRS. ALVING. Her trip!
 
 OSWALD. And so it came out that she had taken the thing seriously; that
 she had been thinking of me the whole time, and had set to work to learn
 French--
 
 MRS. ALVING. So that was why--!
 
 OSWALD. Mother--when I saw that fresh, lovely, splendid girl standing
 there before me--till then I had hardly noticed her--but when she stood
 there as though with open arms ready to receive me--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oswald!
 
 OSWALD.--then it flashed upon me that in her lay my salvation; for I saw
 that she was full of the joy of life.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Starts.] The joy of life? Can there be salvation in that?
 
 REGINA. [From the dining room, with a bottle of champagne.] I'm sorry to
 have been so long, but I had to go to the cellar. [Places the bottle on
 the table.]
 
 OSWALD. And now bring another glass.
 
 REGINA. [Looks at him in surprise.] There is Mrs. Alving's glass, Mr.
 Alving.
 
 OSWALD. Yes, but bring one for yourself, Regina. [REGINA starts and
 gives a lightning-like side glance at MRS. ALVING.] Why do you wait?
 
 REGINA. [Softly and hesitatingly.] Is it Mrs. Alving's wish?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Bring the glass, Regina.
 
 [REGINA goes out into the dining-room.]
 
 OSWALD. [Follows her with his eyes.] Have you noticed how she walks?--so
 firmly and lightly!
 
 MRS. ALVING. This can never be, Oswald!
 
 OSWALD. It's a settled thing. Can't you see that? It's no use saying
 anything against it.
 
 [REGINA enters with an empty glass, which she keeps in her hand.]
 
 OSWALD. Sit down, Regina.
 
 [REGINA looks inquiringly at MRS. ALVING.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. Sit down. [REGINA sits on a chair by the dining room door,
 still holding the empty glass in her hand.] Oswald--what were you saying
 about the joy of life?
 
 OSWALD. Ah, the joy of life, mother--that's a thing you don't know much
 about in these parts. I have never felt it here.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Not when you are with me?
 
 OSWALD. Not when I'm at home. But you don't understand that.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, yes; I think I almost understand it--now.
 
 OSWALD. And then, too, the joy of work! At bottom, it's the same thing.
 But that, too, you know nothing about.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Perhaps you are right. Tell me more about it, Oswald.
 
 OSWALD. I only mean that here people are brought up to believe that
 work is a curse and a punishment for sin, and that life is something
 miserable, something; it would be best to have done with, the sooner the
 better.
 
 MRS. ALVING. "A vale of tears," yes; and we certainly do our best to
 make it one.
 
 OSWALD. But in the great world people won't hear of such things. There,
 nobody really believes such doctrines any longer. There, you feel it a
 positive bliss and ecstasy merely to draw the breath of life. Mother,
 have you noticed that everything I have painted has turned upon the joy
 of life?--always, always upon the joy of life?--light and sunshine and
 glorious air-and faces radiant with happiness. That is why I'm afraid of
 remaining at home with you.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Afraid? What are you afraid of here, with me?
 
 OSWALD. I'm afraid lest all my instincts should be warped into ugliness.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Looks steadily at him.] Do you think that is what would
 happen?
 
 OSWALD. I know it. You may live the same life here as there, and yet it
 won't be the same life.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Who has been listening eagerly, rises, her eyes big with
 thought, and says:] Now I see the sequence of things.
 
 OSWALD. What is it you see?
 
 MRS. ALVING. I see it now for the first time. And now I can speak.
 
 OSWALD. [Rising.] Mother, I don't understand you.
 
 REGINA. [Who has also risen.] Perhaps I ought to go?
 
 MRS. ALVING. No. Stay here. Now I can speak. Now, my boy, you shall know
 the whole truth. And then you can choose. Oswald! Regina!
 
 OSWALD. Hush! The Pastor--
 
 MANDERS. [Enters by the hall door.] There! We have had a most edifying
 time down there.
 
 OSWALD. So have we.
 
 MANDERS. We must stand by Engstrand and his Sailors' Home. Regina must
 go to him and help him--
 
 REGINA. No thank you, sir.
 
 MANDERS. [Noticing her for the first tine.] What--? You here? And with a
 glass in your hand!
 
 REGINA. [Hastily putting the glass down.] Pardon!
 
 OSWALD. Regina is going with me, Mr. Manders.
 
 MANDERS. Going! With you!
 
 OSWALD. Yes; as my wife--if she wishes it.
 
 MANDERS. But, merciful God--!
 
 REGINA. I can't help it, sir.
 
 OSWALD. Or she'll stay here, if I stay.
 
 REGINA. [Involuntarily.] Here!
 
 MANDERS. I am thunderstruck at your conduct, Mrs. Alving.
 
 MRS. ALVING. They will do neither one thing nor the other; for now I can
 speak out plainly.
 
 MANDERS. You surely will not do that! No, no, no!
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, I can speak and I will. And no ideals shall suffer
 after all.
 
 OSWALD. Mother--what is it you are hiding from me?
 
 REGINA. [Listening.] Oh, ma'am, listen! Don't you hear shouts outside.
 [She goes into the conservatory and looks out.]
 
 OSWALD. [At the window on the left.] What's going on? Where does that
 light come from?
 
 REGINA. [Cries out.] The Orphanage is on fire!
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Rushing to the window.] On fire!
 
 MANDERS. On fire! Impossible! I've just come from there.
 
 OSWALD. Where's my hat? Oh, never mind it--Father's Orphanage--! [He
 rushes out through the garden door.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. My shawl, Regina! The whole place is in a blaze!
 
 MANDERS. Terrible! Mrs. Alving, it is a judgment upon this abode of
 lawlessness.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, of course. Come, Regina. [She and REGINA hasten out
 through the hall.]
 
 MANDERS. [Clasps his hands together.] And we left it uninsured! [He goes
 out the same way.]
 
 
 
 
 ACT THIRD.
 
 [The room as before. All the doors stand open. The lamp is still burning
 on the table. It is dark out of doors; there is only a faint glow from
 the conflagration in the background to the left.]
 
 [MRS. ALVING, with a shawl over her head, stands in the conservatory,
 looking out. REGINA, also with a shawl on, stands a little behind her.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. The whole thing burnt!--burnt to the ground!
 
 REGINA. The basement is still burning.
 
 MRS. ALVING. How is it Oswald doesn't come home? There's nothing to be
 saved.
 
 REGINA. Should you like me to take down his hat to him?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Has he not even got his hat on?
 
 REGINA. [Pointing to the hall.] No; there it hangs.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Let it be. He must come up now. I shall go and look for him
 myself. [She goes out through the garden door.]
 
 MANDERS. [Comes in from the hall.] Is not Mrs. Alving here?
 
 REGINA. She has just gone down the garden.
 
 MANDERS. This is the most terrible night I ever went through.
 
 REGINA. Yes; isn't it a dreadful misfortune, sir?
 
 MANDERS. Oh, don't talk about it! I can hardly bear to think of it.
 
 REGINA. How can it have happened--?
 
 MANDERS. Don't ask me, Miss Engstrand! How should _I_ know? Do you,
 too--? Is it not enough that your father--?
 
 REGINA. What about him?
 
 MANDERS. Oh, he has driven me distracted--
 
 ENGSTRAND. [Enters through the hall.] Your Reverence--
 
 MANDERS. [Turns round in terror.] Are you after me here, too?
 
 ENGSTRAND. Yes, strike me dead, but I must--! Oh, Lord! what am I
 saying? But this is a terrible ugly business, your Reverence.
 
 MANDERS. [Walks to and fro.] Alas! alas!
 
 REGINA. What's the matter?
 
 ENGSTRAND. Why, it all came of this here prayer-meeting, you see.
 [Softly.] The bird's limed, my girl. [Aloud.] And to think it should be
 my doing that such a thing should be his Reverence's doing!
 
 MANDERS. But I assure you, Engstrand--
 
 ENGSTRAND. There wasn't another soul except your Reverence as ever laid
 a finger on the candles down there.
 
 MANDERS. [Stops.] So you declare. But I certainly cannot recollect that
 I ever had a candle in my hand.
 
 ENGSTRAND. And I saw as clear as daylight how your Reverence took the
 candle and snuffed it with your fingers, and threw away the snuff among
 the shavings.
 
 MANDERS. And you stood and looked on?
 
 ENGSTRAND. Yes; I saw it as plain as a pike-staff, I did.
 
 MANDERS. It's quite beyond my comprehension. Besides, it has never been
 my habit to snuff candles with my fingers.
 
 ENGSTRAND. And terrible risky it looked, too, that it did! But is there
 such a deal of harm done after all, your Reverence?
 
 MANDERS. [Walks restlessly to and fro.] Oh, don't ask me!
 
 ENGSTRAND. [Walks with him.] And your Reverence hadn't insured it,
 neither?
 
 MANDERS. [Continuing to walk up and down.] No, no, no; I have told you
 so.
 
 ENGSTRAND. [Following him.] Not insured! And then to go straight away
 down and set light to the whole thing! Lord, Lord, what a misfortune!
 
 MANDERS. [Wipes the sweat from his forehead.] Ay, you may well say that,
 Engstrand.
 
 ENGSTRAND. And to think that such a thing should happen to a benevolent
 Institution, that was to have been a blessing both to town and country,
 as the saying goes! The newspapers won't be for handling your Reverence
 very gently, I expect.
 
 MANDERS. No; that is just what I am thinking of. That is almost the
 worst of the whole matter. All the malignant attacks and imputations--!
 Oh, it makes me shudder to think of it!
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Comes in from the garden.] He is not to be persuaded to
 leave the fire.
 
 MANDERS. Ah, there you are, Mrs. Alving.
 
 MRS. ALVING. So you have escaped your Inaugural Address, Pastor Manders.
 
 MANDERS. Oh, I should so gladly--
 
 MRS. ALVING. [In an undertone.] It is all for the best. That Orphanage
 would have done no one any good.
 
 MANDERS. Do you think not?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Do you think it would?
 
 MANDERS. It is a terrible misfortune, all the same.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Let us speak of it plainly, as a matter of business.--Are
 you waiting for Mr. Manders, Engstrand?
 
 ENGSTRAND. [At the hall door.] That's just what I'm a-doing of, ma'am.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Then sit down meanwhile.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Thank you, ma'am; I'd as soon stand.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [To MANDERS.] I suppose you are going by the steamer?
 
 MANDERS. Yes; it starts in an hour.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Then be so good as to take all the papers with you. I won't
 hear another word about this affair. I have other things to think of--
 
 MANDERS. Mrs. Alving--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Later on I shall send you a Power of Attorney to settle
 everything as you please.
 
 MANDERS. That I will very readily undertake. The original destination of
 the endowment must now be completely changed, alas!
 
 MRS. ALVING. Of course it must.
 
 MANDERS. I think, first of all, I shall arrange that the Solvik property
 shall pass to the parish. The land is by no means without value. It can
 always be turned to account for some purpose or other. And the interest
 of the money in the Bank I could, perhaps, best apply for the benefit of
 some undertaking of acknowledged value to the town.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Do just as you please. The whole matter is now completely
 indifferent to me.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Give a thought to my Sailors' Home, your Reverence.
 
 MANDERS. Upon my word, that is not a bad suggestion. That must be
 considered.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Oh, devil take considering--Lord forgive me!
 
 MANDERS. [With a sigh.] And unfortunately I cannot tell how long I shall
 be able to retain control of these things--whether public opinion may
 not compel me to retire. It entirely depends upon the result of the
 official inquiry into the fire--
 
 MRS. ALVING. What are you talking about?
 
 MANDERS. And the result can by no means be foretold.
 
 ENGSTRAND. [Comes close to him.] Ay, but it can though. For here stands
 old Jacob Engstrand.
 
 MANDERS. Well well, but--?
 
 ENGSTRAND. [More softy.] And Jacob Engstrand isn't the man to desert a
 noble benefactor in the hour of need, as the saying goes.
 
 MANDERS. Yes, but my good fellow--how--?
 
 ENGSTRAND. Jacob Engstrand may be likened to a sort of a guardian angel,
 he may, your Reverence.
 
 MANDERS. No, no; I really cannot accept that.
 
 ENGSTRAND. Oh, that'll be the way of it, all the same. I know a man as
 has taken others' sins upon himself before now, I do.
 
 MANDERS. Jacob! [Wrings his hand.] Yours is a rare nature. Well,
 you shall be helped with your Sailors' Home. That you may rely upon.
 [ENGSTRAND tries to thank him, but cannot for emotion.]
 
 MANDERS. [Hangs his travelling-bag over his shoulder.] And now let us
 set out. We two will go together.
 
 ENGSTRAND. [At the dining-room door, softly to REGINA.] You come along
 too, my lass. You shall live as snug as the yolk in an egg.
 
 REGINA. [Tosses her head.] _Merci_! [She goes out into the hall and
 fetches MANDERS' overcoat.]
 
 MANDERS. Good-bye, Mrs. Alving! and may the spirit of Law and Order
 descend upon this house, and that quickly.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Good-bye, Pastor Manders. [She goes up towards the
 conservatory, as she sees OSWALD coming in through the garden door.]
 
 ENGSTRAND. [While he and REGINA help MANDERS to get his coat on.]
 Good-bye, my child. And if any trouble should come to you, you know
 where Jacob Engstrand is to be found. [Softly.] Little Harbour Street,
 h'm--! [To MRS. ALVING and OSWALD.] And the refuge for wandering
 mariners shall be called "Chamberlain Alving's Home," that it shall! And
 if so be as I'm spared to carry on that house in my own way, I make so
 bold as to promise that it shall be worthy of the Chamberlain's memory.
 
 MANDERS. [In the doorway.] H'm--h'm!--Come along, my dear Enstrand.
 Good-bye! Good-bye! [He and ENGSTRAND go out through the hall.]
 
 OSWALD. [Goes towards the table.] What house was he talking about?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oh, a kind of Home that he and Pastor Manders want to set
 up.
 
 OSWALD. It will burn down like the other.
 
 MRS. ALVING. What makes you think so?
 
 OSWALD. Everything will burn. All that recalls father's memory is
 doomed. Here am I, too, burning down. [REGINA starts and looks at him.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oswald! You oughtn't to have remained so long down there,
 my poor boy.
 
 OSWALD. [Sits down by the table.] I almost think you are right.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Let me dry your face, Oswald; you are quite wet. [She dries
 his face with her pocket-handkerchief.]
 
 OSWALD. [Stares indifferently in front of him.] Thanks, mother.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Are you not tired, Oswald? Should you like to sleep?
 
 OSWALD. [Nervously.] No, no--not to sleep! I never sleep. I only pretend
 to. [Sadly.] That will come soon enough.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Looking sorrowfully at him.] Yes, you really are ill, my
 blessed boy.
 
 REGINA. [Eagerly.] Is Mr. Alving ill?
 
 OSWALD. [Impatiently.] Oh, do shut all the doors! This killing dread--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Close the doors, Regina.
 
 [REGINA shuts them and remains standing by the hall door. MRS. ALVING
 takes her shawl off: REGINA does the same. MRS. ALVING draws a chair
 across to OSWALD'S, and sits by him.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. There now! I am going to sit beside you--
 
 OSWALD. Yes, do. And Regina shall stay here too. Regina shall be with me
 always. You will come to the rescue, Regina, won't you?
 
 REGINA. I don't understand--
 
 MRS. ALVING. To the rescue?
 
 OSWALD. Yes--when the need comes.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oswald, have you not your mother to come to the rescue?
 
 OSWALD. You? [Smiles.] No, mother; that rescue you will never bring me.
 [Laughs sadly.] You! ha ha! [Looks earnestly at her.] Though, after all,
 who ought to do it if not you? [Impetuously.] Why can't you say "thou"
 to me, Regina? [Note: "Sige du" = Fr. _tutoyer_] Why do'n't you call me
 "Oswald"?
 
 REGINA. [Softly.] I don't think Mrs. Alving would like it.
 
 MRS. ALVING. You shall have leave to, presently. And meanwhile sit over
 here beside us.
 
 [REGINA seats herself demurely and hesitatingly at the other side of the
 table.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. And now, my poor suffering boy, I am going to take the
 burden off your mind--
 
 OSWALD. You, mother?
 
 MRS. ALVING.--all the gnawing remorse and self-reproach you speak of.
 
 OSWALD. And you think you can do that?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, now I can, Oswald. A little while ago you spoke of the
 joy of life; and at that word a new light burst for me over my life and
 everything connected with it.
 
 OSWALD. [Shakes his head.] I don't understand you.
 
 MRS. ALVING. You ought to have known your father when he was a young
 lieutenant. He was brimming over with the joy of life!
 
 OSWALD. Yes, I know he was.
 
 MRS. ALVING. It was like a breezy day only to look at him. And what
 exuberant strength and vitality there was in him!
 
 OSWALD. Well--?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Well then, child of joy as he was--for he was like a child
 in those days--he had to live at home here in a half-grown town,
 which had no joys to offer him--only dissipations. He had no object
 in life--only an official position. He had no work into which he could
 throw himself heart and soul; he had only business. He had not a single
 comrade that could realise what the joy of life meant--only loungers and
 boon-companions--
 
 OSWALD. Mother--!
 
 MRS. ALVING. So the inevitable happened.
 
 OSWALD. The inevitable?
 
 MRS. ALVING. You told me yourself, this evening, what would become of
 you if you stayed at home.
 
 OSWALD. Do you mean to say that father--?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Your poor father found no outlet for the overpowering joy
 of life that was in him. And I brought no brightness into his home.
 
 OSWALD. Not even you?
 
 MRS. ALVING. They had taught me a great deal about duties and so forth,
 which I went on obstinately believing in. Everything was marked out into
 duties--into my duties, and his duties, and--I am afraid I made his home
 intolerable for your poor father, Oswald.
 
 OSWALD. Why have you never spoken of this in writing to me?
 
 MRS. ALVING. I have never before seen it in such a light that I could
 speak of it to you, his son.
 
 OSWALD. In what light did you see it, then?
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Slowly.] I saw only this one thing: that your father was a
 broken-down man before you were born.
 
 OSWALD. [Softly.] Ah--! [He rises and walks away to the window.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. And then; day after day, I dwelt on the one thought that by
 rights Regina should be at home in this house--just like my own boy.
 
 OSWALD. [Turning round quickly.] Regina--!
 
 REGINA. [Springs up and asks, with bated breath.] I--?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, now you know it, both of you.
 
 OSWALD. Regina!
 
 REGINA. [To herself.] So mother was that kind of woman.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Your mother had many good qualities, Regina.
 
 REGINA. Yes, but she was one of that sort, all the same. Oh, I've often
 suspected it; but--And now, if you please, ma'am, may I be allowed to go
 away at once?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Do you really wish it, Regina?
 
 REGINA. Yes, indeed I do.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Of course you can do as you like; but--
 
 OSWALD. [Goes towards REGINA.] Go away now? Your place is here.
 
 REGINA. _Merci_, Mr. Alving!--or now, I suppose, I may say Oswald. But I
 can tell you this wasn't at all what I expected.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Regina, I have not been frank with you--
 
 REGINA. No, that you haven't indeed. If I'd known that Oswald was an
 invalid, why--And now, too, that it can never come to anything serious
 between us--I really can't stop out here in the country and wear myself
 out nursing sick people.
 
 OSWALD. Not even one who is so near to you?
 
 REGINA. No, that I can't. A poor girl must make the best of her young
 days, or she'll be left out in the cold before she knows where she is.
 And I, too, have the joy of life in me, Mrs. Alving!
 
 MRS. ALVING. Unfortunately, you leave. But don't throw yourself away,
 Regina.
 
 REGINA. Oh, what must be, must be. If Oswald takes after his father, I
 take after my mother, I daresay.--May I ask, ma'am, if Pastor Manders
 knows all this about me?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Pastor Manders knows all about it.
 
 REGINA. [Busied in putting on her shawl.] Well then, I'd better make
 haste and get away by this steamer. The Pastor is such a nice man to
 deal with; and I certainly think I've as much right to a little of that
 money as he has--that brute of a carpenter.
 
 MRS. ALVING. You are heartily welcome to it, Regina.
 
 REGINA. [Looks hard at her.] I think you might have brought me up as a
 gentleman's daughter, ma'am; it would have suited me better. [Tosses her
 head.] But pooh--what does it matter! [With a bitter side glance at the
 corked bottle.] I may come to drink champagne with gentlefolks yet.
 
 MRS. ALVING. And if you ever need a home, Regina, come to me.
 
 REGINA. No, thank you, ma'am. Pastor Manders will look after me, I know.
 And if the worst comes to the worst, I know of one house where I've
 every right to a place.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Where is that?
 
 REGINA. "Chamberlain Alving's Home."
 
 MRS. ALVING. Regina--now I see it--you are going to your ruin.
 
 REGINA. Oh, stuff! Good-bye. [She nods and goes out through the hall.]
 
 OSWALD. [Stands at the window and looks out.] Is she gone?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes.
 
 OSWALD. [Murmuring aside to himself.] I think it was a mistake, this.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Goes up behind him and lays her hands on his shoulders.]
 Oswald, my dear boy--has it shaken you very much?
 
 OSWALD. [Turns his face towards her.] All that about father, do you
 mean?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, about your unhappy father. I am so afraid it may have
 been too much for you.
 
 OSWALD. Why should you fancy that? Of course it came upon me as a great
 surprise; but it can make no real difference to me.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Draws her hands away.] No difference! That your father was
 so infinitely unhappy!
 
 OSWALD. Of course I can pity him, as I would anybody else; but--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Nothing more! Your own father!
 
 OSWALD. [Impatiently.]Oh, "father,"--"father"! I never knew anything of
 father. I remember nothing about him, except that he once made me sick.
 
 MRS. ALVING. This is terrible to think of! Ought not a son to love his
 father, whatever happens?
 
 OSWALD. When a son has nothing to thank his father for? has never known
 him? Do you really cling to that old superstition?--you who are so
 enlightened in other ways?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Can it be only a superstition--?
 
 OSWALD. Yes; surely you can see that, mother. It's one of those notions
 that are current in the world, and so--
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Deeply moved.] Ghosts!
 
 OSWALD. [Crossing the room.] Yes; you may call them ghosts.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Wildly.] Oswald--then you don't love me, either!
 
 OSWALD. You I know, at any rate--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, you know me; but is that all!
 
 OSWALD. And, of course, I know how fond you are of me, and I can't but
 be grateful to you. And then you can be so useful to me, now that I am
 ill.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, cannot I, Oswald? Oh, I could almost bless the illness
 that has driven you home to me. For I see very plainly that you are not
 mine: I have to win you.
 
 OSWALD. [Impatiently.] Yes yes yes; all these are just so many phrases.
 You must remember that I am a sick man, mother. I can't be much taken up
 with other people; I have enough to do thinking about myself.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [In a low voice.] I shall be patient and easily satisfied.
 
 OSWALD. And cheerful too, mother!
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, my dear boy, you are quite right. [Goes towards him.]
 Have I relieved you of all remorse and self-reproach now?
 
 OSWALD. Yes, you have. But now who will relieve me of the dread?
 
 MRS. ALVING. The dread?
 
 OSWALD. [Walks across the room.] Regina could have been got to do it.
 
 MRS. ALVING. I don't understand you. What is this about dread--and
 Regina?
 
 OSWALD. Is it very late, mother?
 
 MRS. ALVING. It is early morning. [She looks out through the
 conservatory.] The day is dawning over the mountains. And the weather is
 clearing, Oswald. In a little while you shall see the sun.
 
 OSWALD. I'm glad of that. Oh, I may still have much to rejoice in and
 live for--
 
 MRS. ALVING. I should think so, indeed!
 
 OSWALD. Even if I can't work--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oh, you'll soon be able to work again, my dear boy--now
 that you haven't got all those gnawing and depressing thoughts to brood
 over any longer.
 
 OSWALD. Yes, I'm glad you were able to rid me of all those fancies. And
 when I've got over this one thing more--[Sits on the sofa.] Now we will
 have a little talk, mother--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, let us. [She pushes an arm-chair towards the sofa, and
 sits down close to him.]
 
 OSWALD. And meantime the sun will be rising. And then you will know all.
 And then I shall not feel this dread any longer.
 
 MRS. ALVING. What is it that I am to know?
 
 OSWALD. [Not listening to her.] Mother, did you not say a little while
 ago, that there was nothing in the world you would not do for me, if I
 asked you?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, indeed I said so!
 
 OSWALD. And you'll stick to it, mother?
 
 MRS. ALVING. You may rely on that, my dear and only boy! I have nothing
 in the world to live for but you alone.
 
 OSWALD. Very well, then; now you shall hear--Mother, you have a strong,
 steadfast mind, I know. Now you're to sit quite still when you hear it.
 
 MRS. ALVING. What dreadful thing can it be--?
 
 OSWALD. You're not to scream out. Do you hear? Do you promise me that?
 We will sit and talk about it quietly. Do you promise me, mother?
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, yes; I promise. Only speak!
 
 OSWALD. Well, you must know that all this fatigue--and my inability to
 think of work--all that is not the illness itself--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Then what is the illness itself?
 
 OSWALD. The disease I have as my birthright--[He points to his forehead
 and adds very softly]--is seated here.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Almost voiceless.] Oswald! No--no!
 
 OSWALD. Don't scream. I can't bear it. Yes, mother, it is seated here
 waiting. And it may break out any day--at any moment.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Oh, what horror--!
 
 OSWALD. Now, quiet, quiet. That is how it stands with me--
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Springs up.] It's not true, Oswald! It's impossible! It
 cannot be so!
 
 OSWALD. I have had one attack down there already. It was soon over. But
 when I came to know the state I had been in, then the dread descended
 upon me, raging and ravening; and so I set off home to you as fast as I
 could.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Then this is the dread--!
 
 OSWALD. Yes--it's so indescribably loathsome, you know. Oh, if it
 had only been an ordinary mortal disease--! For I'm not so afraid of
 death--though I should like to live as long as I can.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Yes, yes, Oswald, you must!
 
 OSWALD. But this is so unutterably loathsome. To become a little baby
 again! To hive to be fed! To have to--Oh, it's not to be spoken of!
 
 MRS. ALVING. The child has his mother to nurse him.
 
 OSWALD. [Springs up.] No, never that! That is just what I will not have.
 I can't endure to think that perhaps I should lie in that state for many
 years--and get old and grey. And in the meantime you might die and
 leave me. [Sits in MRS. ALVING'S chair.] For the doctor said it wouldn't
 necessarily prove fatal at once. He called it a sort of softening of the
 brain--or something like that. [Smiles sadly.] I think that expression
 sounds so nice. It always sets me thinking of cherry-coloured
 velvet--something soft and delicate to stroke.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Shrieks.] Oswald!
 
 OSWALD. [Springs up and paces the room.] And now you have taken Regina
 from me. If I could only have had her! She would have come to the
 rescue, I know.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Goes to him.] What do you mean by that, my darling boy? Is
 there any help in the world that I would not give you?
 
 OSWALD. When I got over my attack in Paris, the doctor told me that when
 it comes again--and it will come--there will be no more hope.
 
 MRS. ALVING. He was heartless enough to--
 
 OSWALD. I demanded it of him. I told him I had preparations to make--[He
 smiles cunningly.] And so I had. [He takes a little box from his inner
 breast pocket and opens it.] Mother, do you see this?
 
 MRS. ALVING. What is it?
 
 OSWALD. Morphia.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Looks at him horror-struck.] Oswald--my boy!
 
 OSWALD. I've scraped together twelve pilules--
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Snatches at it.] Give me the box, Oswald.
 
 OSWALD. Not yet, mother. [He hides the box again in his pocket.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. I shall never survive this!
 
 OSWALD. It must be survived. Now if I'd had Regina here, I should have
 told her how things stood with me--and begged her to come to the rescue
 at the last. She would have done it. I know she would.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Never!
 
 OSWALD. When the horror had come upon me, and she saw me lying there
 helpless, like a little new-born baby, impotent, lost, hopeless--past
 all saving--
 
 MRS. ALVING. Never in all the world would Regina have done this!
 
 OSWALD. Regina would have done it. Regina was so splendidly
 light-hearted. And she would soon have wearied of nursing an invalid
 like me.
 
 MRS. ALVING. Then heaven be praised that Regina is not here.
 
 OSWALD. Well then, it is you that must come to the rescue, mother.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Shrieks aloud.] I!
 
 OSWALD. Who should do it if not you?
 
 MRS. ALVING. I! your mother!
 
 OSWALD. For that very reason.
 
 MRS. ALVING. I, who gave you life!
 
 OSWALD. I never asked you for life. And what sort of a life have you
 given me? I will not have it! You shall take it back again!
 
 MRS. ALVING. Help! Help! [She runs out into the hall.]
 
 OSWALD. [Going after her.] Do not leave me! Where are you going?
 
 MRS. ALVING. [In the hall.] To fetch the doctor, Oswald! Let me pass!
 
 OSWALD. [Also outside.] You shall not go out. And no one shall come in.
 [The locking of a door is heard.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Comes in again.] Oswald! Oswald--my child!
 
 OSWALD. [Follows her.] Have you a mother's heart for me--and yet can see
 me suffer from this unutterable dread?
 
 MRS. ALVING. [After a moment's silence, commands herself, and says:]
 Here is my hand upon it.
 
 OSWALD. Will you--?
 
 MRS. ALVING. If it should ever be necessary. But it will never be
 necessary. No, no; it is impossible.
 
 OSWALD. Well, let us hope so. And let us live together as long as we
 can. Thank you, mother. [He seats himself in the arm-chair which MRS.
 ALVING has moved to the sofa. Day is breaking. The lamp is still burning
 on the table.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Drawing near cautiously.] Do you feel calm now?
 
 OSWALD. Yes.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Bending over him.] It has been a dreadful fancy of yours,
 Oswald--nothing but a fancy. All this excitement has been too much for
 you. But now you shall have along rest; at home with your mother, my own
 blessed boy. Everything you point to you shall have, just as when you
 were a little child.--There now. The crisis is over. You see how easily
 it passed! Oh, I was sure it would.--And do you see, Oswald, what a
 lovely day we are going to have? Brilliant sunshine! Now you can really
 see your home. [She goes to the table and puts out the lamp. Sunrise.
 The glacier and the snow-peaks in the background glow in the morning
 light.]
 
 OSWALD. [Sits in the arm-chair with his back towards the landscape,
 without moving. Suddenly he says:] Mother, give me the sun.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [By the table, starts and looks at him.] What do you say?
 
 OSWALD. [Repeats, in a dull, toneless voice.] The sun. The sun.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Goes to him.] Oswald, what is the matter with you?
 
 OSWALD. [Seems to shrink together to the chair; all his muscles relax;
 his face is expressionless, his eyes have a glassy stare.]
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Quivering with terror.] What is this? [Shrieks.] Oswald!
 what is the matter with you? [Falls on her knees beside him and shakes
 him.] Oswald! Oswald! look at me! Don't you know me?
 
 OSWALD. [Tonelessly as before.] The sun.--The sun.
 
 MRS. ALVING. [Springs up in despair, entwines her hands in her hair and
 shrieks.] I cannot bear it! [Whispers, as though petrified]; I cannot
 bear it! Never! [Suddenly.] Where has he got them? [Fumbles hastily
 in his breast.] Here! [Shrinks back a few steps and screams:] No! No;
 no!--Yes!--No; no!
 
 [She stands a few steps away from him with her hands twisted in her
 hair, and stares at him in speechless horror.]
 
 OSWALD. [Sits motionless as before and says.] The sun.--The sun.
 
 
 THE END
