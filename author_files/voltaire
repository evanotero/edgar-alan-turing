        A TREATISE ON TOLERATION.
        [In 1762 Jean Calas, a Protestant of Toulouse, was
        done to death by torture on the wheel on the false
        charge of having slain his son, a suicide. His widow
        and children were put to the torture to extort a
        confession, in utter lack of evidence. Voltaire
        devoted years of unremitting labor to agitating the
        terrible crime and raising money compensation for the
        victims. His pamphlets aroused substantial sympathy
        and protests in England and over the Continent. His
        efforts led to the writing of over one hundred plays,
        poems, and pamphlets on the case. Voltaire had the
        satisfaction of witnessing the triumph of his long
        struggle. He narrates the facts in this Treatise,
        which expands into a sweeping exposure of the
        cruelties committed in the name of religion, in all
        ages and countries.]

  ANDRÉ DES TOUCHES IN SIAM.
 
 
 André Des Touches was a very agreeable musician in the brilliant
 reign of Louis XIV., before the science of music was perfected by
 Rameau, and before it was corrupted by those who prefer the art of
 surmounting difficulties to nature and the real graces of composition.
 
 Before he had recourse to these talents he had been a musketeer, and
 before that, in 1688, he went into Siam with the Jesuit Tachard, who
 gave him many marks of his affection, for the amusement he afforded
 on board the ship; and Des Touches spoke with admiration of Father
 Tachard for the rest of his life.
 
 In Siam he became acquainted with the first commissary of Barcalon,
 whose name was Croutef, and he committed to writing most of those
 questions which he asked of Croutef, and the answers of that Siamese.
 They are as follows:
 
 DES TOUCHES.—How many soldiers have you?
 
 CROUTEF.—Fourscore thousand, very indifferently paid.
 
 DES TOUCHES.—And how many talapoins?
 
 CROUTEF.—A hundred and twenty thousand, very idle and very rich. It
 is true that in the last war we were beaten, but our talapoins have
 lived sumptuously and built fine houses.
 
 DES TOUCHES.—Nothing could have discovered more judgment. And your
 finances, in what state are they?
 
 CROUTEF.—In a very bad state. We have, however, about ninety thousand
 men employed to render them prosperous, and if they have not
 succeeded, it has not been their fault, for there is not one of them
 who does not honorably seize all that he can get possession of, and
 strip and plunder those who cultivate the ground for the good of the
 state.
 
 DES TOUCHES.—Bravo! And is not your jurisprudence as perfect as the
 rest of your administration?
 
 CROUTEF.—It is much superior. We have no laws, but we have five or
 six thousand volumes on the laws. We are governed in general by
 customs; for it is known that a custom, having been established by
 chance, is the wisest principle that can be imagined. Besides, all
 customs being necessarily different in different provinces, the
 judges may choose at their pleasure a custom which prevailed four
 hundred years ago or one which prevailed last year. It occasions a
 variety in our legislation which our neighbors are forever admiring.
 This yields a certain fortune to practitioners. It is a resource for
 all pleaders who are destitute of honor, and a pastime of infinite
 amusement for the judges, who can, with safe consciences, decide
 causes without understanding them.
 
 DES TOUCHES.—But in criminal cases—you have laws which may be
 depended upon?
 
 CROUTEF.—God forbid! We can condemn men to exile, to the galleys, to
 be hanged; or we can discharge them, according to our own fancy. We
 sometimes complain of the arbitrary power of the Barcalon, but we
 choose that all our decisions should be arbitrary.
 
 DES TOUCHES.—That is very just. And the torture—do you put people to
 the torture?
 
 CROUTEF.—It is our greatest pleasure. We have found it an infallible
 secret to save a guilty person, who has vigorous muscles, strong
 and supple hamstrings, nervous arms, and firm loins, and we gayly
 break on the wheel all those innocent persons to whom nature has
 given feeble organs. It is thus we conduct ourselves with wonderful
 wisdom and prudence. As there are half proofs, I mean half truths,
 it is certain there are persons who are half innocent and half
 guilty. We commence, therefore, by rendering them half dead; we then
 go to breakfast; afterwards ensues entire death, which gives us
 great consideration in the world, which is one of the most valuable
 advantages of our offices.
 
 DES TOUCHES.—It must be allowed that nothing can be more prudent and
 humane. Pray tell me what becomes of the property of the condemned?
 
 CROUTEF.—The children are deprived of it. For you know that nothing
 can be more equitable than to punish the single fault of a parent on
 all his descendants.
 
 DES TOUCHES.—Yes. It is a great while since I have heard of this
 jurisprudence.
 
 CROUTEF.—The people of Laos, our neighbors, admit neither the
 torture, nor arbitrary punishments, nor the different customs,
 nor the horrible deaths which are in use among us; but we regard
 them as barbarians who have no idea of good government. All Asia
 is agreed that we dance the best of all its inhabitants, and
 that, consequently, it is impossible they should come near us in
 jurisprudence, in commerce, in finance, and, above all, in the
 military art.
 
 DES TOUCHES.—Tell me, I beseech you, by what steps men arrive at the
 magistracy in Siam.
 
 CROUTEF.—By ready money. You perceive that it may be impossible to be
 a good judge if a man has not by him thirty or forty thousand pieces
 of silver. It is in vain a man may be perfectly acquainted with all
 our customs; it is to no purpose that he has pleaded five hundred
 causes with success—that he has a mind which is the seat of judgment,
 and a heart replete with justice; no man can become a magistrate
 without money. This, I say, is the circumstance which distinguishes
 us from all Asia, and particularly from the barbarous inhabitants of
 Laos, who have the madness to recompense all kinds of talents, and
 not to sell any employment.
 
 André Des Touches, who was a little off his guard, said to the
 Siamese that most of the airs which he had just sung sounded
 discordant to him, and wished to receive information concerning real
 Siamese music. But Croutef, full of his subject, and enthusiastic for
 his country, continued in these words:
 
 “What does it signify that our neighbors, who live beyond our
 mountains, have better music than we have, or better pictures,
 provided we have always wise and humane laws? It is in that
 circumstance we excel. For example:
 
 “If a man has adroitly stolen three or four hundred thousand pieces
 of gold we respect him, and we go and dine with him. But if a poor
 servant gets awkwardly into his possession three or four pieces
 of copper out of his mistress’ box we never fail of putting that
 servant to a public death; first, lest he should not correct himself;
 secondly, that he may not have it in his power to produce a great
 number of children for the state, one or two of whom might possibly
 steal a few little pieces of copper, or become great men; thirdly,
 because it is just to proportion the punishment to the crime, and
 that it would be ridiculous to give any useful employment in a prison
 to a person guilty of so enormous a crime.
 
 “But we are still more just, more merciful, more reasonable in the
 chastisements which we inflict on those who have the audacity to
 make use of their legs to go wherever they choose. We treat those
 warriors so well who sell us their lives, we give them so prodigious
 a salary, they have so considerable a part in our conquests, that
 they must be the most criminal of all men to wish to return to their
 parents on the recovery of their reason, because they had been
 enlisted in a state of intoxication. To oblige them to remain in one
 place, we lodge about a dozen leaden balls in their heads, after
 which they become infinitely useful to their country.
 
 “I will not speak of a great number of excellent institutions which
 do not go so far as to shed the blood of men, but which render life
 so pleasant and agreeable that it is impossible the guilty should
 avoid becoming virtuous. If a farmer has not been able to pay
 promptly a tax which exceeds his ability, we sell the pot in which he
 dresses his food; we sell his bed in order that, being relieved of
 all his superfluities, he may be in a better condition to cultivate
 the earth.”
 
 DES TOUCHES.—That is extremely harmonious!
 
 CROUTEF.—To comprehend our profound wisdom you must know that our
 fundamental principle is to acknowledge in many places as our
 sovereign a shaven-headed foreigner who lives at the distance of nine
 hundred miles from us. When we assign some of our best territories
 to any of our talapoins, which it is very prudent in us to do, that
 Siamese talapoin must pay the revenue of his first year to that
 shaven-headed Tartar, without which it is clear our lands would be
 unfruitful.
 
 But the time, the happy time, is no more when that tonsured priest
 induced one-half of the nation to cut the throats of the other half
 in order to decide whether Sammonocodom had played at leap-frog or
 at some other game; whether he had been disguised in an elephant or
 in a cow; if he had slept three hundred and ninety days on the right
 side or on the left. Those grand questions, which so essentially
 affect morality, agitated all minds; they shook the world; blood
 flowed plentifully for it; women were massacred on the bodies of
 their husbands; they dashed out the brains of their little infants
 on the stones with a devotion, with a grace, with a contrition truly
 angelic. Woe to us! degenerate offspring of pious ancestors, who
 never offer such holy sacrifices! But, heaven be praised, there are
 yet among us at least a few good souls who would imitate them if they
 were permitted.
 
 DES TOUCHES.—Tell me, I beseech you, sir, if in Siam you divide the
 tone major into two commas, or into two semi-commas, and if the
 progress of the fundamental sounds are made by one, three, and nine?
 
 CROUTEF.—By Sammonocodom, you are laughing at me. You observe no
 bounds. You have interrogated me on the form of our government, and
 you speak to me of music!
 
 DES TOUCHES.—Music is everything. It was at the foundation of all
 the politics of the Greeks. But I beg your pardon; you have not a
 good ear, and we will return to our subject. You said that in order
 to produce a perfect harmony—
 
 CROUTEF.—I was telling you that formerly the tonsured Tartar
 pretended to dispose of all the kingdoms of Asia, which occasioned
 something very different from perfect harmony. But a very
 considerable benefit resulted from it; for people were then more
 devout toward Sammonocodom and his elephant than they are now, for,
 at the present time, all the world pretends to common sense, with an
 indiscretion truly pitiable. However, all things go on; people divert
 themselves, they dance, they play, they dine, they sup, they make
 love; this makes every man shudder who entertains good intentions.
 
 DES TOUCHES.—And what would you have more? You only want good music.
 If you had good music you might call your nation the happiest in the
 world.
 
 
 
 
  THE BLIND AS JUDGES OF COLOR.
 
 
 When the hospital of the Quinze Vingt was first founded the
 pensioners were all equal, and their little affairs were concluded
 upon by a majority of votes. They distinguished perfectly by the
 touch between copper and silver coin; they never mistook the wine
 of Brie for that of Burgundy. Their sense of smell was finer than
 that of their neighbors who had the use of two eyes. They reasoned
 very well on the four senses; that is, they knew everything they
 were permitted to know, and they lived as peaceably and as happily
 as blind people could be supposed to do. But, unfortunately, one
 of their professors pretended to have clear ideas in respect to
 the sense of seeing; he drew attention; he intrigued; he formed
 enthusiasts, and at last he was acknowledged chief of the community.
 He pretended to be a judge of colors, and everything was lost.
 
 This dictator of the Quinze Vingt chose at first a little council by
 the assistance of which he got possession of all the alms. On this
 account no person had the resolution to oppose him. He decreed that
 all the inhabitants of the Quinze Vingt were clothed in white. The
 blind pensioners believed him, and nothing was to be heard but their
 talk of white garments, though, in fact, they possessed not one of
 that color. All their acquaintances laughed at them. They made their
 complaints to the dictator, who received them very ill; he rebuked
 them as innovators, freethinkers, rebels, who had suffered themselves
 to be seduced by the errors of those who had eyes, and who presumed
 to doubt that their chief was infallible. This contention gave rise
 to two parties.
 
 To appease the tumult, the dictator issued a decree declaring that
 all their vestments were red. There was not one vestment of that
 color in the Quinze Vingt. The poor men were laughed at more than
 ever. Complaints were again made by the community. The dictator
 rushed furiously in, and the other blind men were as much enraged.
 They fought a long time, and peace was not restored until the members
 of the Quinze Vingt were permitted to suspend their judgments in
 regard to the color of their dress.
 
 A deaf man, reading this little history, allowed that these people,
 being blind, were to blame in pretending to judge of colors, but he
 remained steady to his own opinion that those persons who were deaf
 were the only proper judges of music.
 
 
 
 
  THE CLERGYMAN AND HIS SOUL.
 
 
  CHAPTER I.
 
 There can be no doubt that everything in the world is governed by
 fatality. My own life is a convincing proof of this doctrine. The
 earl of Chesterfield, with whom I was a great favorite, had promised
 me that I should have the first living that fell to his gift. An old
 incumbent of eighty happened to die, and I immediately travelled post
 to London to remind the earl of his promise. I was honored with an
 immediate interview, and was received with the greatest kindness. I
 informed his lordship of the death of the rector, and of the hope I
 cherished relative to the disposal of the vacant living. He replied
 that I really looked very ill. I answered that, thanks to God, my
 greatest affliction was poverty. “I am sorry for you,” said his
 lordship, and he politely dismissed me with a letter of introduction
 to a Mr. Sidrac, who dwelt in the vicinity of Guildhall. I ran as
 fast as I could to this gentleman’s house, not doubting but that he
 would immediately install me in the wished-for living. I delivered
 the earl’s letter, and Mr. Sidrac, who had the honor to be my lord’s
 surgeon, asked me to sit down, and, producing a case of surgical
 instruments, began to assure me that he would perform an operation
 which he trusted would very soon relieve me.
 
 You must know that his lordship had understood that I was suffering
 from some dreadful complaint, and that he generously intended to have
 me cured at his own expense. The earl had the misfortune to be as
 deaf as a post, a fact with which I, alas! had not been previously
 acquainted.
 
 During the time which I lost in defending myself against the attacks
 of Mr. Sidrac, who insisted positively upon curing me, whether I
 would or no, one out of the fifty candidates who were all on the
 lookout, came to town, flew to my lord, begged the vacant living and
 obtained it.
 
 I was deeply in love with an interesting girl, a Miss Fidler, who
 had promised to marry me upon condition of my being made rector. My
 fortunate rival not only got the living, but also my mistress into
 the bargain!
 
 My patron, upon being told of his mistake, promised to make me ample
 amends, but alas! he died two days afterwards.
 
 Mr. Sidrac demonstrated to me that, according to his organic
 structure, my good patron could not have lived one hour longer. He
 also clearly proved that the earl’s deafness proceeded entirely from
 the extreme dryness of the drums of his ears, and kindly offered, by
 an application of spirits of wine, to harden both of my ears to such
 a degree that I should, in one month only, become as deaf as any peer
 of the realm.
 
 I discovered Mr. Sidrac to be a man of profound knowledge. He
 inspired me with a taste for the study of nature, and I could not but
 be sensible of the valuable acquisition I had made in acquiring the
 friendship of a man who was capable of relieving me, should I need
 his services. Following his advice, I applied myself closely to the
 study of nature, to console myself for the loss of the rectory and of
 my enchanting Miss Fidler.
 
 
  CHAPTER II.
  THE STUDY OF NATURE.
 
 After making many profound observations upon nature (having employed
 in the research my five senses, my spectacles, and a very large
 telescope), I said one day to Mr. Sidrac: “Unless I am much deceived,
 philosophy laughs at us. I cannot discover any trace of what the
 world calls nature; on the contrary, everything seems to me to be
 the result of art. By art the planets are made to revolve around the
 sun, while the sun revolves on its own axis. I am convinced that some
 genius has arranged things in such a manner that the square of the
 revolutions of the planets is always in proportion to the cubic root
 from their distance to their centre, and one had need be a magician
 to find out how this is accomplished. The tides of the sea are the
 result of art no less profound and no less difficult to explain.
 
 “All animals, vegetables, and minerals are arranged with due
 regard to weight and measure, number and motion. All is performed
 by springs, levers, pulleys, hydraulic machines, and chemical
 combinations, from the insignificant flea to the being called man,
 from the grass of the field to the far-spreading oak, from a grain of
 sand to a cloud in the firmament of heaven. Assuredly, everything is
 governed by art, and the word nature is but a chimera.”
 
 “What you say,” answered Mr. Sidrac, “has been said many years ago,
 and so much the better, for the probability is greater that your
 remark is true. I am always astonished when I reflect that a grain
 of wheat cast into the earth will produce in a short time above a
 handful of the same corn.” “Stop,” said I, foolishly, “you forget
 that wheat must die before it can spring up again, at least so
 they say at college.” My friend Sidrac, laughing heartily at this
 interruption, replied: “That assertion went down very well a few
 years ago, when it was first published by an apostle called Paul, but
 in our more enlightened age the meanest laborer knows that the thing
 is altogether too ridiculous even for argument.”
 
 “My dear friend,” said I, “excuse the absurdity of my remarks; I
 have hitherto been a theologian, and one cannot divest one’s self in
 a moment of every silly opinion.”
 
 
  CHAPTER III.
  GOOD ADVICE.
 
 Some time after this conversation between the disconsolate person,
 whom we shall call Goodman, and the clever anatomist, Mr. Sidrac, the
 latter, one fine morning, observed his friend in St. James’s Park,
 standing in an attitude of deep thought. “What is the matter?” said
 the surgeon. “Is there anything amiss?” “No,” replied Goodman, “but I
 am left without a patron in the world since the death of my friend,
 who had the misfortune to be so deaf. Now, supposing there be only
 ten thousand clergymen in England, and granting these ten thousand
 have each two patrons, the odds against my obtaining a bishopric are
 twenty thousand to one; a reflection quite sufficient to give any
 man the blue-devils. I remember, it was once proposed to me to go
 out as cabin-boy to the East Indies. I was told that I should make
 my fortune. But as I did not think I should make a good admiral,
 whenever I should arrive at the distinction, I declined; and so,
 after turning my attention to every profession under the sun, I am
 fixed for life as a poor clergyman, good for nothing.”
 
 “Then be a clergyman no longer!” cried Sidrac, “and turn
 philosopher. What is your income?” “Only thirty guineas a year,”
 replied Goodman, “although at the death of my mother it will be
 increased to fifty.” “Well, my dear Goodman,” continued Sidrac, “that
 sum is quite sufficient to support you in comfort. Thirty guineas
 are six hundred and thirty shillings, almost two shillings a day.
 With this fixed income a man need do nothing to increase it, but is
 at perfect liberty to say all he thinks of the East India Company,
 the House of Commons, the king, and all the royal family, of man
 generally and individually, and lastly, of God and His attributes;
 and the liberty we enjoy of expressing our thoughts upon these most
 interesting topics is certainly very agreeable and amusing.”
 
 “Come and dine at my table every day. That will save you some little
 money. We will afterwards amuse ourselves with conversation, and
 your thinking faculty will have the pleasure of communicating with
 mine by means of speech, which is certainly a very wonderful thing,
 though its advantages are not duly appreciated by the greater part of
 mankind.”
 
 
  CHAPTER IV.
  DIALOGUE UPON THE SOUL
  AND OTHER TOPICS.
 
 GOODMAN.—But my dear Sidrac, why do you always say _my thinking
 faculty_ and not _my soul_? If you used the latter term I should
 understand you much better.
 
 SIDRAC.—And for my part, I freely confess I should not understand
 myself. I _feel_, I _know_, that God has endowed me with the
 faculties of thinking and speaking, but I can neither _feel_ nor
 _know_ that God has given me a thing called a soul.
 
 GOODMAN.—Truly, upon reflection, I perceive that I know as little
 about the matter as you do, though I own that I have all my life been
 bold enough to believe that I knew. I have often remarked that the
 eastern nations apply to the soul the same word they use to express
 life. After their example, the Latins understood the word _anima_
 to signify the life of the animal. The Greeks called the breath the
 soul. The Romans translated the word breath by _spiritus_, and thence
 it is that the word spirit or soul is found in every modern nation.
 As it happens that no one has ever seen this spirit or breath, our
 imagination has converted it into a being which it is impossible to
 see or touch. The learned tell us that the soul inhabits the body
 without having any place in it, that it has the power of setting our
 different organs in motion without being able to reach and touch
 them; indeed, what has not been said upon the subject? The great
 Locke knew into what a chaos these absurdities had plunged the human
 understanding. In writing the only reasonable book upon metaphysics
 that has yet appeared in the world, he did not compose a single
 chapter on the soul, and if by chance he now and then makes use of
 the word, he only introduces it to stand for intellect or mind.
 
 In fact, every human being, in spite of Bishop Berkeley, is sensible
 that he has a mind, and that this mind or intellect is capable of
 receiving ideas; but no one can feel that there is another being—a
 soul—within him, which gives him motion, feeling, and thought. It
 is, in fact, ridiculous to use words we do not understand, and to
 admit the existence of beings of whom we cannot have the slightest
 knowledge.
 
 SIDRAC.—We are then agreed upon a subject which, for so many
 centuries, has been a matter of dispute.
 
 GOODMAN.—And I must observe that I am surprised we should have agreed
 upon it so soon.
 
 SIDRAC.—Oh! that is not so astonishing. We really wish to know what
 is truth. If we were among the academies we should argue like the
 characters in Rabelais. If we had lived in those ages of darkness,
 the clouds of which so long enveloped Great Britain, one of us would
 very likely have burned the other. We are so fortunate as to be born
 in an age comparatively reasonable; we easily discover what appears
 to us to be truth, and we are not afraid to proclaim it.
 
 GOODMAN.—You are right, but I fear that, after all, the truth we have
 discovered is not worth much. In mathematics, indeed, we have done
 wonders; from the most simple causes we have produced effects that
 would have astonished Apollonius or Archimedes; but what have we
 proved in metaphysics? Absolutely nothing but our own ignorance.
 
 SIDRAC.—And do you call that nothing? You grant the Supreme Being
 has given you the faculties of feeling and thinking; He has in the
 same manner given your feet the faculty of walking, your hands their
 wonderful dexterity, your stomach the capability of digesting food,
 and your heart the power of throwing arterial blood into all parts
 of your body. Everything we enjoy is derived from God, and yet we
 are totally ignorant of the means by which He governs and conducts
 the universe. For my own part, as Shakespeare says, I thank Him for
 having taught me that of the principles of things I know absolutely
 nothing. It has always been a question in what manner the soul acted
 upon the body. Before attempting to answer this question, I must be
 convinced that I have a soul. Either God has given us this wonderful
 spark of intellect, or He has gifted us with some principle that
 answers equally well. In either case, we are still the creatures of
 His divine will and goodness, and that is all I know about the matter.
 
 GOODMAN.—But if you do not know, tell me at least what you are
 inclined to think upon the subject. You have opened skulls, and
 dissected the human fœtus. Have you ever, in these dissections,
 discovered any appearance of a soul?
 
 SIDRAC.—Not the least, and I have not been able to understand how an
 immortal and spiritual essence could dwell for months together in a
 membrane. It appears to me difficult to conceive that this pretended
 soul existed before the foundation of the body; for in what could it
 have been employed during the many ages previous to its mysterious
 union with flesh? Again! how can we imagine a spiritual principle
 waiting patiently in idleness during a whole eternity, in order to
 animate a mass of matter for a space of time which, compared with
 eternity, is less than a moment?
 
 It is worse still when I am told that God forms immortal souls out
 of nothing, and then cruelly dooms them to an eternity of flames and
 torments. What? burn a spirit, in which there can be nothing capable
 of burning; how can He burn the sound of a voice, or the wind that
 blows? though both the sound and wind were material during the short
 time of their existence; but a pure spirit—a thought—a doubt—I am
 lost in the labyrinth; on whichever side I turn, I find nothing but
 obscurity and absurdity, impossibility and contradiction. But I
 am quite at ease when I say to myself God is Master of all. He who
 can cause each star to hold its particular course through the broad
 expanse of the firmament can easily give to us sentiments and ideas
 without the aid of this atom called the soul. It is certain that God
 has endowed all animals, in a greater or lesser degree, with thought,
 memory, and judgment; He has given them life; it is demonstrated that
 they have feeling, since they possess all the organs of feeling; if
 then they have all this without a soul, why is it improbable that we
 have none? and why do mankind flatter themselves that they alone are
 gifted with a spiritual and immortal principle?
 
 GOODMAN.—Perhaps this idea arises from their inordinate vanity. I am
 persuaded that if the peacock could speak he would boast of his soul,
 and would affirm that it inhabited his magnificent tail. I am very
 much inclined to believe with you that God has created us thinking
 creatures, with the faculties of eating, drinking, feeling, etc.,
 without telling us one word about the matter. We are as ignorant as
 the peacock I just mentioned, and he who said that we live and die
 without knowing how, why, or wherefore, spoke nothing but the truth.
 
 SIDRAC.—A celebrated author, whose name I forget, calls us nothing
 more than the puppets of Providence, and this seems to me to be a
 very good definition. An infinity of movements are necessary to our
 existence, but we did not ourselves invent and produce motion. There
 is a Being who has created light, caused it to move from the sun
 to our eyes in about seven minutes. It is only by means of motion
 that my five senses are put in action, and it is only by means of my
 senses that I have ideas, hence it follows that my ideas are derived
 from the great author of motion, and when He informs me how He
 communicates these ideas to me, I will most sincerely thank Him.
 
 GOODMAN.—And so will I. As it is I constantly thank Him for having
 permitted me, as Epictetus says, to contemplate for a period of some
 years this beautiful and glorious world. It is true that He could
 have made me happier by putting me in possession of Miss Fidler and a
 good rectory, but still, such as I am, I consider myself as under a
 great obligation to God’s parental kindness and care.
 
 _Sidrac._—You say that it is in the power of God to give you a good
 living, and to make you still happier than you are at present. There
 are many persons who would not scruple flatly to contradict this
 proposition of yours. Do you forget that you yourself sometimes
 complain of fatality? A man, and particularly a priest, ought never
 to contradict one day an assertion he has perhaps made the day
 before. All is but a succession of links, and God is wiser than to
 break the eternal chain of events, even for the sake of my dear
 friend Goodman.
 
 GOODMAN.—I did not foresee this argument when I was speaking of
 fatality, but to come at once to the point, if it be so, God is as
 much a slave as myself.
 
 SIDRAC.—He is the slave of His will, of His wisdom, and of the laws
 which He has Himself instituted; and it is impossible that He can
 infringe upon any of them, because it is impossible that He can
 become either weak or inconsistent.
 
 GOODMAN.—But, my friend, what you say would tend to make us
 irreligious, for, if God cannot change any of the affairs of the
 world, what is the use of teasing Him with prayers, or of singing
 hymns to His praise?
 
 SIDRAC.—Well! who bids you worship or pray to God? We praise a man
 because we think him vain; we entreat of him when we think him weak
 and likely to change his purpose on account of our petitions. Let us
 do our duty to God, by being just and true to each other. In that
 consists our real prayers, and our most heartfelt praises.
 
 
 
 
  A CONVERSATION WITH A CHINESE.
 
 
 In the year 1723 there was a Chinese in Holland who was both a
 learned man and a merchant, two things that ought by no means to be
 incompatible; but which, thanks to the profound respect that is shown
 to money, and the little regard that the human species pay to merit,
 have become so among us.
 
 This Chinese, who spoke a little Dutch, happened to be in a
 bookseller’s shop at the same time that some literati were assembled
 there. He asked for a book; they offered him Bossuet’s “Universal
 History,” badly translated. At the title “Universal History”—
 
 “How pleased am I,” cried the Oriental, “to have met with this
 book. I shall now see what is said of our great empire, of a nation
 that has subsisted for upwards of fifty thousand years; of that long
 dynasty of emperors who have governed us for such a number of ages. I
 shall see what these Europeans think of the religion of our literati,
 and of that pure and simple worship we pay to the Supreme Being. What
 a pleasure will it be for me to find how they speak of our arts, many
 of which are of a more ancient date with us than the eras of all the
 kingdoms of Europe! I fancy the author will be greatly mistaken in
 relation to the war we had about twenty-two thousand five hundred and
 fifty-two years ago with the martial people of Tonquin and Japan,
 as well as the solemn embassy that the powerful emperor of Mogul
 sent to request a body of laws from us in the year of the world
 500000000000079123450000.”
 
 “Lord bless you,” said one of the literati, “there is hardly any
 mention made of that nation in this world. The only nation considered
 is that marvellous people, the Jews.”
 
 “The Jews!” said the Chinese; “those people then must certainly be
 masters of three parts of the globe at least.”
 
 “They hope to be so some day,” answered the other; “but all we have
 here are those peddlers you see going about with toys and nic-nacs,
 and who sometimes do us the honor to clip our gold and silver.”
 
 “Surely you are not serious,” exclaimed the Chinese. “Could those
 people ever have been in possession of a vast empire?”
 
 Here I joined in the conversation, and told him that for a few years
 they were in possession of a small country to themselves; but that we
 were not to judge of a people from the extent of their dominions, any
 more than of a man by his riches.
 
 “But does not this book take notice of some other nations?” demanded
 the man of letters.
 
 “Undoubtedly,” replied a learned gentleman who stood at my elbow; “it
 treats largely of a small country about sixty leagues wide, called
 Egypt, in which it is said that there is a lake of one hundred and
 fifty leagues in circumference, made by the hands of man.”
 
 “My God!” exclaimed the Chinese, “a lake of one hundred and fifty
 leagues in circumference within a spot of ground only sixty leagues
 wide. This is very curious!”
 
 “The inhabitants of that country,” continued the doctor, “were all
 sages.”
 
 “What happy times were those!” cried the Chinese; “but is that all?”
 
 “No,” replied the other, “there is mention made of those famous
 people the Greeks.”
 
 “Greeks! Greeks!” said the Asiatic, “who are those Greeks?”
 
 “Why,” replied the philosopher, “they were masters of a little
 province, about the two-hundredth part as large as China, but whose
 fame spread over the whole world.”
 
 “Indeed!” said the Chinese, with an air of openness and
 ingenuousness; “I declare I never heard the least mention of these
 people, either in the Mogul’s country, in Japan, or in Great Tartary.”
 
 “Oh, the barbarian! the ignorant creature!” cried out our sage very
 politely. “Why, then, I suppose you know nothing of Epaminondas the
 Theban, nor of the Pierian heaven, nor the names of Achilles’ two
 horses, nor of Silenus’ ass? You have never heard speak of Jupiter,
 nor of Diogenes, nor of Lais, nor of Cybele, nor of—”
 
 “I am very much afraid,” said the learned Oriental, interrupting
 him, “that you know nothing of that eternally memorable adventure of
 the famous Xixofon Concochigramki, nor of the mysteries of the great
 Fi-psi-hi-hi! But pray tell me what other unknown things does this
 “Universal History” treat of?”
 
 Upon this my learned neighbor harangued for a quarter of an hour
 together about the Roman republic, and when he came to Julius Cæsar
 the Chinese stopped him, and very gravely said:
 
 “I think I have heard of him; was he not a Turk?”
 
 “How!” cried our sage in a fury, “don’t you so much as know the
 difference between pagans, Christians, and Mahometans? Did you never
 hear of Constantine? Do you know nothing of the history of the popes?”
 
 “We have heard something confusedly of one Mahomet,” replied the
 Asiatic.
 
 “It is surely impossible,” said the other, “but you must have heard
 at least of Luther, Zwinglius, Bellarmine, and Œcolampadius.”
 
 “I shall never remember all those names,” said the Chinese, and
 so saying he quitted the shop, and went to sell a large quantity
 of Pekoe tea and fine calico, and then, after purchasing what
 merchandise he required, set sail for his own country, adoring Tien,
 and recommending himself to Confucius.
 
 As to myself, the conversation I had been witness to plainly
 discovered to me the nature of vain glory; and I could not forbear
 exclaiming:
 
 “Since Cæsar and Jupiter are names unknown to the finest, most
 ancient, most extensive, most populous, and most civilized kingdom
 in the universe, it becomes ye well, O ye rulers of petty states!
 ye pulpit orators of a narrow parish, or a little town! ye doctors
 of Salamanca, or of Bourges! ye trifling authors, and ye heavy
 commentators!—it becomes you well, indeed, to aspire to fame and
 immortality.”
 
 
 
 
  MEMNON THE PHILOSOPHER.
 
 
 Memnon one day took it into his head to become a great philosopher.
 “To be perfectly happy,” said he to himself, “I have nothing to do
 but to divest myself entirely of passions, and nothing is more easy,
 as everybody knows. In the first place, I will never be in love,
 for when I see a beautiful woman I will say to myself, These cheeks
 will one day grow sallow and wrinkled, these eyes be encircled with
 vermilion, that bosom become lean and emaciated, that head bald and
 palsied. Now, I have only to consider her at present in imagination
 as she will afterwards appear in reality, and certainly a fair face
 will never turn my head.
 
 “In the second place, I shall always be temperate. It will be in vain
 to tempt me with good cheer, with delicious wines, or the charms of
 society. I will have only to figure to myself the consequences of
 excess—an aching head, a loathing stomach, the loss of reason, of
 health, and of time; I will then only eat to supply the waste of
 nature; my health will be always equal, my ideas pure and luminous.
 All this is so easy that there is no merit in accomplishing it.
 
 “But,” says Memnon, “I must think a little of how I am to regulate
 my fortune; why, my desires are moderate, my wealth is securely
 placed with the receiver-general of the finances of Nineveh. I
 have wherewithal to live independent, and that is the greatest of
 blessings. I shall never be under the cruel necessity of dancing
 attendance at court. I will never envy any one, and nobody will envy
 me. Still all this is easy. I have friends, and I will preserve them,
 for we shall never have any difference. I will never take amiss
 anything they may say or do; and they will behave in the same way to
 me. There is no difficulty in all this.”
 
 Having thus laid this little plan of philosophy in his closet,
 Memnon put his head out of the window. He saw two women walking
 under the plane trees near his house. The one was old and appeared
 quite at her ease. The other was young, handsome, and seemingly much
 agitated. She sighed, she wept, and seemed on that account still
 more beautiful. Our philosopher was touched, not, to be sure, with
 the lady (he was too much determined not to feel any uneasiness
 of that kind), but with the distress which he saw her in. He came
 downstairs and accosted the young Ninevite, designing to console
 her with philosophy. That lovely person related to him, with an air
 of the greatest simplicity and in the most affecting manner, the
 injuries she sustained from an imaginary uncle—with what art he had
 deprived her of some imaginary property, and of the violence which
 she pretended to dread from him.
 
 “You appear to me,” said she, “a man of such wisdom that if you will
 come to my house and examine into my affairs, I am persuaded you will
 be able to relieve me from the cruel embarrassment I am at present
 involved in.”
 
 Memnon did not hesitate to follow her, to examine her affairs
 philosophically, and to give her sound counsel.
 
 The afflicted lady led him into a perfumed chamber and politely
 made him sit down with her on a large sofa, where they both placed
 themselves opposite to each other, in the attitude of conversation,
 the one eager in telling her story, the other listening with devout
 attention. The lady spoke with downcast eyes, whence there sometimes
 fell a tear, and which, as she now and then ventured to raise them,
 always met those of the sage Memnon. Their discourse was full of
 tenderness, which redoubled as often as their eyes met. Memnon took
 her affairs exceedingly to heart and felt himself every instant more
 and more inclined to oblige a person so virtuous and so unhappy. By
 degrees, in the warmth of conversation, they drew nearer. Memnon
 counselled her with great wisdom, and gave her most tender advice.
 
 At this interesting moment, as may easily be imagined, who should
 come in but the uncle? He was armed from head to foot, and the first
 thing he said was that he would immediately sacrifice, as was just,
 both Memnon and his niece. The latter, who made her escape, knew that
 he was disposed to pardon, provided a good round sum were offered
 to him. Memnon was obliged to purchase his safety with all he had
 about him. In those days people were happy in getting so easily quit.
 America was not then discovered, and distressed ladies were not then
 so dangerous as they are now.
 
 Memnon, covered with shame and confusion, got home to his own house.
 He there found a card inviting him to attend dinner with some of his
 intimate friends.
 
 “If I remain at home alone,” said he, “I shall have my mind so
 occupied with this vexatious adventure that I shall not be able
 to eat a bit and I shall bring upon myself some disease. It will,
 therefore be prudent in me to go to my intimate friends and partake
 with them of a frugal repast. I shall forget in the sweets of their
 society the folly I have this morning been guilty of.”
 
 Accordingly he attends the meeting; he is discovered to be uneasy at
 something, and he is urged to drink and banish care.
 
 “A little wine, drunk in moderation, comforts the heart of God and
 man”—so reasoned Memnon the philosopher, and he became intoxicated.
 After the repast, play is proposed.
 
 “A little play with one’s intimate friends is a harmless pastime.” He
 plays and loses all in his purse and four times as much on his word.
 A dispute arises on some circumstance in the game and the disputants
 grow warm. One of his intimate friends throws a dice-box at his head
 and strikes out one of his eyes. The philosopher Memnon is carried
 home drunk and penniless, with the loss of an eye.
 
 He sleeps out his debauch and when his head becomes clear he sends
 his servant to the receiver-general of the finances of Nineveh to
 draw a little money to pay his debt of honor to his intimate friends.
 The servant returns and informs him that the receiver-general had
 that morning been declared a fraudulent bankrupt, and that by this
 means a hundred families are reduced to poverty and despair. Memnon,
 almost beside himself, puts a plaster on his eye and a petition
 in his pocket, and goes to court to solicit justice from the king
 against the bankrupt. In the saloon he meets a number of ladies, all
 in the highest spirits and sailing along with hoops four-and-twenty
 feet in circumference. One of them, slightly acquainted with him,
 eyed him askance, and cried aloud: “Ah! what a horrid monster!”
 
 Another, who was better acquainted with him, thus accosts him:
 “Good-morrow, Mr. Memnon; I hope you are well, Mr. Memnon. La! Mr.
 Memnon, how did you lose your eye?” and, turning upon her heel, she
 tripped unconcernedly away.
 
 Memnon hid himself in a corner and waited for the moment when he
 could throw himself at the feet of the monarch. That moment at last
 arrived. Three times he kissed the earth and presented his petition.
 His gracious majesty received him very favorably and referred the
 paper to one of his satraps. The satrap takes Memnon aside and says
 to him, with a haughty air and satirical grin:
 
 “Hark ye, you fellow with the one eye; you must be a comical dog
 indeed to address yourself to the king rather than to me, and still
 more so to dare to demand justice against an honest bankrupt,
 whom I honor with my protection, and who is also a nephew to the
 waiting-maid of my mistress. Proceed no further in this business, my
 good friend, if you wish to preserve the eye you have left.”
 
 Memnon, having thus in his closet resolved to renounce women, the
 excess of the table, play, and quarrelling, but especially having
 determined never to go to court, had been, in the short space of
 four-and-twenty hours, duped and robbed by a gentle dame, had got
 drunk, had gamed, had been engaged in a quarrel, had got his eye
 knocked out, and had been at court, where he was sneered at and also
 insulted.
 
 Petrified with astonishment, and his heart broken with grief, Memnon
 returns homeward in despair. As he was about to enter his house,
 he is repulsed by a number of officers who are carrying off his
 furniture for the benefit of his creditors. He falls down almost
 lifeless under a plane tree. There he finds the fair dame of the
 morning, who was walking with her dear uncle, and both set up a loud
 laugh on seeing Memnon with his plaster. The night approached, and
 Memnon made his bed on some straw near the walls of his house. Here
 the ague seized him and he fell asleep in one of the fits, when a
 celestial spirit appeared to him in a dream.
 
 It was all resplendent with light; it had six beautiful wings, but
 neither feet, nor head, and could be likened to nothing.
 
 “What art thou?” said Memnon.
 
 “Thy good genius,” replied the spirit.
 
 “Restore me, then, my eye, my health, my fortune, my reason,” said
 Memnon, and he related how he had lost them all in one day.
 
 “These are adventures which never happen to us in the world we
 inhabit,” said the spirit.
 
 “And what world do you inhabit?” said the man of affliction.
 
 “My native country,” replied the other, “is five hundred millions of
 leagues distant from the sun, in a little star near Sirius.”
 
 “Charming country!” said Memnon. “And are there indeed with you no
 jades to dupe a poor devil, no intimate friends that win his money
 and knock out an eye for him, no fraudulent bankrupts, no satraps
 that make a jest of you while they refuse you justice?”
 
 “No,” said the inhabitant of the star, “we have nothing of the kind.
 We are never duped by women because we have none among us; we never
 commit excesses at table because we neither eat nor drink; we have
 no bankrupts because with us there is neither silver nor gold; our
 eyes cannot be knocked out because we have not bodies in the form of
 yours, and satraps never do us injustice, because in our world we are
 all equal.”
 
 “Pray, my lord,” said Memnon, “without women and without eating, how
 do you spend your time?”
 
 “In watching over the other worlds that are entrusted to us, and I am
 now come to give you consolation.”
 
 “Alas!” replied Memnon, “why did you not come yesterday to hinder me
 from committing so many indiscretions?”
 
 “I was with your elder brother Hassan,” said the celestial being. “He
 is still more to be pitied than you are. His most gracious majesty,
 the sultan of the Indies, in whose court he has the honor to serve,
 has caused both his eyes to be put out for some small indiscretion,
 and he is now in a dungeon, his hands and feet loaded with chains.”
 
 “Tis a happy thing, truly,” said Memnon, “to have a good genius in
 one’s family, when out of two brothers, one is blind of an eye,
 the other blind of both; one stretched upon straw, the other in a
 dungeon.”
 
 “Your fate will soon change,” said the spirit of the star. “It is
 true you will never recover your eye, but, except that, you may be
 sufficiently happy if you never again take it into your head to be a
 perfect philosopher.”
 
 “Is it, then, impossible?” said Memnon.
 
 “As impossible as to be perfectly wise, perfectly strong, perfectly
 powerful, perfectly happy. We ourselves are very far from it. There
 is a world, indeed, where all this takes place; but, in the hundred
 thousand millions of worlds dispersed over the regions of space,
 everything goes on by degrees. There is less philosophy and less
 enjoyment in the second than in the first, less in the third than in
 the second, and so forth till the last in the scale, where all are
 completely fools.”
 
 “I am afraid,” said Memnon, “that our little terraqueous globe here
 is the madhouse of those hundred thousand millions of worlds of which
 your lordship does me the honor to speak.”
 
 “Not quite,” said the spirit, “but very nearly; everything must be in
 its proper place.”
 
 “But are those poets and philosophers wrong, then, who tell us that
 everything is for the best?”
 
 “No, they are right, when we consider things in relation to the
 gradation of the whole universe.”
 
 “Oh! I shall never believe it till I recover my eye again,” said the
 unfortunate Memnon.
 
 
 
 
  PLATO’S DREAM.
 
 
 Plato was a great dreamer, as many others have been since his
 time. He dreamed that mankind were formerly double, and that, as a
 punishment for their crimes, they were divided into male and female.
 
 He undertook to prove that there can be no more than five perfect
 worlds, because there are but five regular mathematical bodies. His
 republic was one of his principal dreams. He dreamed, moreover, that
 watching arises from sleep, and sleep from watching, and that a
 person who should attempt to look at an eclipse otherwise than in a
 pail of water would surely lose his sight. Dreams were at that time
 in great repute.
 
 Here follows one of his dreams, which is not one of the least
 interesting. He thought that the great Demiurgos, the eternal
 geometer, having peopled the immensity of space with innumerable
 globes, was willing to make a trial of the knowledge of the genii
 who had been witnesses of his works. He gave to each of them a small
 portion of matter to arrange, nearly in the same manner as Phidias
 and Zeuxis would have given their scholars a statue to carve or a
 picture to paint, if we may be allowed to compare small things to
 great.
 
 Demogorgon had for his lot the lump of mould which we call the earth,
 and, having formed it such as it now appears, he thought he had
 executed a masterpiece. He imagined he had silenced Envy herself, and
 expected to receive the highest panegyrics, even from his brethren;
 but how great was his surprise, when, at his next appearing among
 them, they received him with a general hiss.
 
 One among them, more satirical than the rest, accosted him thus:
 
 “Truly you have performed mighty feats! you have divided your world
 into two parts; and, to prevent the one from communication with the
 other, you have carefully placed a vast collection of waters between
 the two hemispheres. The inhabitants must perish with cold under both
 your poles and be scorched to death under the equator. You have, in
 your great prudence, formed immense deserts of sand, so that all who
 travel over them may die with hunger and thirst. I have no fault to
 find with your cows, your sheep, your cocks, and your hens, but can
 never be reconciled to your serpents and your spiders. Your onions
 and your artichokes are very good things, but I cannot conceive what
 induced you to scatter such a heap of poisonous plants over the face
 of the earth, unless it was to poison its inhabitants. Moreover, if
 I am not mistaken, you have created about thirty different kinds
 of monkeys, a still greater number of dogs, and only four or five
 species of the human race. It is true, indeed, you have bestowed
 on the latter of these animals a faculty by you called reason, but,
 in truth, this same reason is a very ridiculous thing, and borders
 very near upon folly. Besides, you do not seem to have shown any
 very great regard to this two-legged creature, seeing you have left
 him with so few means of defence, subjected him to so many disorders
 and provided him with so few remedies, and formed him with such a
 multitude of passions and so small a portion of wisdom or prudence to
 resist them. You certainly were not willing that there should remain
 any great number of these animals on the earth at once, for, without
 reckoning the dangers to which you have exposed them, you have so
 ordered matters that, taking every day throughout the year, smallpox
 will regularly carry off the tenth part of the species, and sister
 maladies will taint the springs of life in the nine remaining parts;
 and then, as if this were not sufficient, you have so disposed things
 that one-half of those who survive will be occupied in going to law
 with each other or cutting one another’s throats.
 
 “Now, they must doubtless be under infinite obligations to you, and
 it must be owned you have executed a masterpiece.”
 
 Demogorgon blushed. He was sensible there was much moral and physical
 evil in this affair, but still he insisted there was more good than
 ill in it.
 
 “It is an easy matter to find fault, good folks,” said the genius,
 “but do you imagine it is so easy to form an animal, who, having the
 gift of reason and free-will, shall not sometimes abuse his liberty?
 Do you think that, in rearing between nine and ten thousand different
 plants, it is so easy to prevent some few from having noxious
 qualities? Do you suppose that with a certain quantity of water,
 sand, and mud you could make a globe that should have neither seas
 nor deserts?
 
 “As for you, my sneering friend, I think you have just finished the
 planet Jupiter. Let us see now what figure you make with your great
 belts and your long nights with four moons to enlighten them. Let us
 examine your worlds and see whether the inhabitants you have made are
 exempt from follies or diseases.”
 
 Accordingly the genius fell to examining the planet Jupiter, when
 the laugh went strongly against the laugher. The serious genius who
 had made the planet Saturn did not escape without his share of the
 censure, and his brother operators, the makers of Mars, Mercury, and
 Venus, had each in his turn some reproaches to undergo.
 
 Several large volumes and a great number of pamphlets were written on
 this occasion; smart sayings and witty repartees flew about on all
 sides; they railed against and ridiculed each other, and, in short,
 the disputes were carried on with all the warmth of party heat, when
 the eternal Demiurgos thus imposed silence on them all:
 
 “In your several performances there is both good and bad, because you
 have a great share of understanding, but at the same time fall short
 of perfection. Your works will not endure above a hundred millions of
 years, after which you will acquire more knowledge and perform much
 better. It belongs to me alone to create things perfect and immortal.”
 
 This was the doctrine Plato taught his disciples. One of them, when
 he had finished his harangue, cried out: “And so you then awoke?”
 
 
 
 
  AN ADVENTURE IN INDIA.
 
 
 All the world knows that Pythagoras, while he resided in India,
 attended the school of the Gymnosophists and learned the language of
 beasts and plants. One day while he was walking in a meadow near the
 sea-shore he heard these words:
 
 “How unfortunate that I was born an herb! I scarcely attain two
 inches in height, when a voracious monster, a horrid animal, tramples
 me under his large feet; his jaws are armed with rows of sharp
 scythes, by which he cuts, then grinds, and then swallows me. Men
 call this monster a sheep. I do not suppose there is in the whole
 creation a more detestable creature.”
 
 Pythagoras proceeded a little way and found an oyster yawning on a
 small rock. He had not yet adopted that admirable law by which we are
 enjoined not to eat those animals which have a resemblance to us. He
 had scarcely taken up the oyster to swallow it, when it spoke these
 affecting words:
 
 “O Nature, how happy is the herb, which is, as I am, thy work! Though
 it be cut down, it is regenerated and immortal, and we, poor oysters,
 in vain are defended by a double cuirass; villains eat us by dozens
 at their breakfast, and all is over with us forever. What a horrible
 fate is that of an oyster, and how barbarous are men!”
 
 Pythagoras shuddered; he felt the enormity of the crime he had nearly
 committed; he begged pardon of the oyster, with tears in his eyes,
 and replaced it very carefully on the rock.
 
 As he was returning to the city, profoundly meditating on this
 adventure, he saw spiders devouring flies; swallows eating spiders,
 and sparrow-hawks eating swallows. “None of these,” said he, “are
 philosophers.”
 
 On his entrance, Pythagoras was stunned, bruised, and thrown down by
 a lot of tatterdemalions, who were running and crying: “Well done, he
 fully deserved it.” “Who? What?” said Pythagoras, as he was getting
 up. The people continued running and crying: “Oh, how delightful it
 will be to see them boiled!”
 
 Pythagoras supposed they meant lentils or some other vegetables, but
 he was in error; they meant two poor Indians. “Oh!” said Pythagoras,
 “these Indians, without doubt, are two great philosophers weary of
 their lives; they are desirous of regenerating under other forms; it
 affords pleasure to a man to change his place of residence, though he
 may be but indifferently lodged; there is no disputing on taste.”
 
 He proceeded with the mob to the public square, where he perceived
 a lighted pile of wood and a bench opposite to it, which was called
 a tribunal. On this bench judges were seated, each of whom had a
 cow’s tail in his hand and a cap on his head, with ears resembling
 those of the animal which bore Silenus when he came into that country
 with Bacchus, after having crossed the Erytrean sea without wetting
 a foot, and stopping the sun and moon, as it is recorded with great
 fidelity by the Orphics.
 
 Among these judges there was an honest man with whom Pythagoras was
 acquainted. The Indian sage explained to the sage of Samos the nature
 of that festival to be given to the people of India.
 
 “These two Indians,” said he, “have not the least desire to be
 committed to the flames. My grave brethren have adjudged them to
 be burnt; one for saying that the substance of Xaca is not that of
 Brahma, and the other for supposing that the approbation of the
 Supreme Being was to be obtained at the point of death without
 holding a cow by the tail. ‘Because,’ said he, ‘we may be virtuous
 at all times, and we cannot always have a cow to lay hold of just
 when we may have occasion.’ The good women of the city were greatly
 terrified at two such heretical opinions; they would not allow the
 judges a moment’s peace until they had ordered the execution of those
 unfortunate men.”
 
 Pythagoras was convinced that from the herb up to man there were
 many causes of chagrin. However, he obliged the judges and even the
 devotees to listen to reason, which happened only at that time.
 
 He went afterwards and preached toleration at Crotona; but a bigot
 set fire to his house, and he was burned—the man who had delivered
 the two Hindoos from the flames! Let those save themselves who can!
 
 
 
 
  BABABEC.
 
 
 When I was in the city of Benares, on the borders of the Ganges, the
 country of the ancient Brahmins, I endeavored to instruct myself
 in their religion and manners. I understood the Indian language
 tolerably well. I heard a great deal and remarked everything. I
 lodged at the house of my correspondent, Omri, who was the most
 worthy man I ever knew. He was of the religion of the Brahmins; I
 have the honor to be a Mussulman. We never exchanged one word higher
 than another about Mahomet or Brahma. We performed our ablutions each
 on his own side; we drank of the same sherbet, and we ate of the same
 rice, as if we had been two brothers.
 
 One day we went together to the pagoda of Gavani. There we saw
 several bands of fakirs, some of whom were janguis, that is to say,
 contemplative fakirs, and others were disciples of the ancient
 Gymnosophists, who led an active life. They all have a learned
 language peculiar to themselves; it is that of the most ancient
 Brahmins; and they have a book written in this language, which they
 call the “_Shasta_.” It is, beyond all contradiction, the most
 ancient book in all Asia, not excepting the “_Zend_.”
 
 I happened by chance to cross in front of a fakir who was reading in
 this book.
 
 “Ah! wretched infidel!” cried he, “thou hast made me lose a number of
 vowels that I was counting, which will cause my soul to pass into the
 body of a hare instead of that of a parrot, with which I had before
 the greatest reason to flatter myself.”
 
 I gave him a rupee to comfort him for the accident. In going a few
 paces farther I had the misfortune to sneeze. The noise I made roused
 a fakir, who was in a trance.
 
 “Heavens!” cried he, “what a dreadful noise. Where am I? I can no
 longer see the tip of my nose—the heavenly light has disappeared.”
 
 “If I am the cause,” said I, “of your not seeing farther than the
 length of your nose, here is a rupee to repair the great injury I
 have done you. Squint again, my friend, and resume the heavenly
 light.”
 
 Having thus brought myself off discreetly enough, I passed over to
 the side of the Gymnosophists, several of whom brought me a parcel
 of mighty pretty nails to drive into my arms and thighs, in honor
 of Brahma. I bought their nails and made use of them to fasten down
 my boxes. Others were dancing upon their hands, others cut capers
 on the slack rope, and others went always upon one foot. There were
 some who dragged a heavy chain about with them, and others carried a
 packsaddle; some had their heads always in a bushel—the best people
 in the world to live with. My friend Omri took me to the cell of one
 of the most famous of these. His name was Bababec; he was as naked
 as he was born, and had a great chain about his neck that weighed
 upwards of sixty pounds. He sat on a wooden chair, very neatly
 decorated with little points of nails that penetrated into his flesh,
 and you would have thought he had been sitting on a velvet cushion.
 Numbers of women flocked to him to consult him. He was the oracle of
 all the families in the neighborhood, and was, truly speaking, in
 great reputation. I was witness to a long conversation that Omri had
 with him.
 
 “Do you think, father,” said my friend, “that after having gone
 through seven metempsychoses, I may at length arrive at the
 habitation of Brahma?”
 
 “That is as it may happen,” said the fakir. “What sort of life do you
 lead?”
 
 “I endeavor,” answered Omri, “to be a good subject, a good husband,
 a good father, and a good friend. I lend money without interest to
 the rich who want it, and I give it to the poor; I always strive to
 preserve peace among my neighbors.”
 
 “But have you ever run nails into your flesh?” demanded the Brahmin.
 
 “Never, reverend father.”
 
 “I am sorry for it,” replied the father, “very sorry for it, indeed.
 It is a thousand pities, but you will certainly not reach above the
 nineteenth heaven.”
 
 “No higher!” said Omri. “In truth, I am very well contented with
 my lot. What is it to me whether I go into the nineteenth or the
 twentieth, provided I do my duty in my pilgrimage, and am well
 received at the end of my journey? Is it not as much as one can
 desire to live with a fair character in this world and be happy with
 Brahma in the next? And pray what heaven do you think of going to,
 good master Bababec, with your chain?”
 
 “Into the thirty-fifth,” said Bababec.
 
 “I admire your modesty,” replied Omri, “to pretend to be better
 lodged than me. This is surely the result of an excessive ambition.
 How can you, who condemn others that covet honors in this world,
 arrogate such distinguished ones to yourself in the next? What right
 have you to be better treated than me? Know that I bestow more alms
 to the poor in ten days than the nails you run into your flesh cost
 for ten years. What is it to Brahma that you pass the whole day stark
 naked with a chain about your neck? This is doing a notable service
 to your country, doubtless! I have a thousand times more esteem for
 the man who sows pulse or plants trees than for all your tribe, who
 look at the tips of their noses or carry packsaddles to show their
 magnanimity.”
 
 Having finished this speech, Omri softened his voice, embraced the
 Brahmin, and, with an endearing sweetness, besought him to throw
 aside his nails and his chain, to go home with him and live with
 decency and comfort.
 
 The fakir was persuaded: he was washed clean, rubbed with essences
 and perfumes and clad in a decent habit; he lived a fortnight in this
 manner, behaved with prudence and wisdom and acknowledged that he was
 a thousand times happier than before; but he lost his credit among
 the people; the women no longer crowded to consult him; he therefore
 quitted the house of the friendly Omri and returned to his nails and
 his chain—to regain his reputation.
 
 
 
 
  ANCIENT FAITH AND FABLE.
 
 
 In order to be successful in their efforts to govern the multitude,
 rulers have endeavored to instil all the visionary notions possible
 into the minds of their subjects.
 
 The good people who read Virgil, or the “Provincial Letters,” do
 not know that there are twenty times more copies of the “Almanac of
 Liège” and of the “_Courier Boiteux_” printed than of all the ancient
 and modern books together. No one can have a greater admiration
 than myself for the illustrious authors of these almanacs and their
 brethren. I know that ever since the time of the ancient Chaldæans
 there have been fixed and stated days for taking physic, paring our
 nails, giving battle, and cleaving wood. I know that the best part of
 the revenue of an illustrious academy consists in the sale of these
 almanacs. May I presume to ask, with all possible submission and a
 becoming diffidence of my own judgment, what harm it would do to the
 world if some powerful astrologer were to assure the peasants and the
 good inhabitants of little villages that they might safely pare their
 nails when they please, provided it be done with a good intention?
 The people, I shall be told, would not buy the almanacs of this new
 astrologer. On the contrary, I will venture to affirm that there
 would be found among your great geniuses many who would make a merit
 in following this novelty. Should it be alleged, however, that these
 geniuses, in their new-born zeal, would form factions and kindle a
 civil war, I would have nothing further to say on the subject, but
 readily give up for the sake of peace my too radical and dangerous
 opinion.
 
 Everybody knows the king of Boutan. He is one of the greatest princes
 in the universe. He tramples under his feet the thrones of the earth,
 and his shoes (if he has any) are provided with sceptres instead
 of buckles. He adores the devil, as is well known, and his example
 is followed by all his courtiers. He one day sent for a famous
 sculptor of my country and ordered him to make a beautiful statue
 of Beelzebub. The sculptor succeeded admirably. Never before was
 there seen such an interesting and handsome devil. But, unhappily,
 our Praxiteles had only given five clutches to his statue, whereas
 the devout Boutaniers always gave him six. This serious blunder of
 the artist was attributed by the grand master of ceremonies to the
 devil with all the zeal of a man justly jealous of his master’s
 acknowledged rights, and also of the established and sacred customs
 of the kingdom of Boutan. He insisted that the sculptor should be
 punished for his thoughtless innovation, by the loss of his head. The
 anxious sculptor explained that his five clutches were exactly equal
 in weight to six ordinary clutches; and the king of Boutan, who was
 a prince of great clemency, granted him a pardon. From that time the
 people of Boutan no longer believed the dogma relating to the devil’s
 six clutches.
 
 The same day it was thought necessary that his majesty should be
 bled, and a surgeon of Gascony, who had come to his court in a ship
 belonging to our East India company, was appointed to take from him
 five ounces of his precious blood. The astrologer of that quarter
 cried out that the king would be in danger of losing his life if the
 surgeon opened a vein while the heavens were in their present state.
 The Gascon might have told him that the only question was about the
 king’s health; but he prudently waited a few moments, and then,
 taking an almanac in his hand, thus addressed the astrologer:
 
 “You were in the right, great man! The king would have died had he
 been bled at the instant you mentioned, but the heavens have since
 changed their aspect, and now is the favorable moment.”
 
 The astrologer assented to the surgeon’s observation. The king was
 cured; and by degrees it became an established custom among the
 Boutaniers to bleed their kings whenever it was considered necessary.
 
 Although the Indian astrologers understood the method of calculating
 eclipses, yet the common people obstinately held to the old belief
 that the sun, when obscured, had fallen into the throat of a great
 dragon, and that the only way to free him from thence was by standing
 naked in the water and making a hideous noise to frighten away the
 monster, and oblige him to release his hold. This notion, which is
 quite prevalent among the orientals, is an evident proof how much the
 symbols of religion and natural philosophy have at all times been
 perverted by the common people. The astronomers of all ages have been
 wont to distinguish the two points of intersection, upon which every
 eclipse happens, and which are called the lunar nodes, by marking
 them with a dragon’s head and tail. Now the vulgar, who are equally
 ignorant in every part of the world, took the symbol or sign for
 the thing itself. Thus, when the astronomers said the sun is in the
 dragon’s head, the common people said the dragon is going to swallow
 up the sun; and yet these people were remarkable for their fondness
 for astrology. But while we laugh at the ignorance and credulity of
 the Indians, we do not reflect that there are no less than 300,000
 almanacs sold yearly in Europe, all of them filled with observations
 and predictions equally as false and absurd as any to be met with
 among the Indians. It is surely as reasonable to say that the sun is
 in the mouth or the claws of a dragon as to tell people every year
 in print that they must not sow, nor plant, nor take physic, nor be
 bled, but on certain days of the moon. It is high time, in an age
 like ours, that some men of learning should think it worth their
 while to compose a calendar that might be of use to the industrious
 classes by instructing instead of deceiving them.
 
 A blustering Dominican at Rome said to an English philosopher with
 whom he was disputing:
 
 “You are a dog; you say that it is the earth that turns round, never
 reflecting that Joshua made the sun to stand still!”
 
 “Well! my reverend father,” replied the philosopher, “ever since that
 time has not the sun been immovable?”
 
 The dog and the Dominican embraced each other, and even the devout
 Italians were at length convinced that the earth turns round.
 
 An augur and a senator lamented, in the time of Cæsar, the declining
 state of the republic.
 
 “The times, indeed, are very bad,” said the senator; “we have reason
 to tremble for the liberty of Rome.”
 
 “Ah!” said the augur, “that is not the greatest evil; the people now
 begin to lose the respect which they formerly had for our order. We
 seem barely to be tolerated—we cease to be necessary. Some generals
 have the assurance to give battle without consulting us. And, to
 complete our misfortunes, even those who sell us the sacred pullets
 begin to reason.”
 
 “Well, and why don’t you reason likewise?” replied the senator, “and
 since the dealers in pullets in the time of Cæsar are more knowing
 than they were in the time of Numa, ought not you modern augurs to be
 better philosophers than those who lived in former ages?”
 
 
 
 
  THE TWO COMFORTERS.
 
 
 The great philosopher Citosile once said to a woman who was
 disconsolate, and who had good reason to be so: “Madame, the queen
 of England, daughter to Henry IV., was as wretched as you. She was
 banished from her kingdom, was in great danger of losing her life at
 sea, and saw her royal spouse expire on a scaffold.”
 
 “I am sorry for her,” said the lady, and began again to lament her
 own misfortunes.
 
 “But,” said Citosile, “remember the fate of Mary Stuart. She loved
 (but with a most chaste and virtuous affection) an excellent
 musician, who played admirably on the bass-viol. Her husband killed
 her musician before her face; and in the sequel her good friend and
 relative, Queen Elizabeth, who called herself a virgin, caused her
 head to be cut off on a scaffold covered with black, after having
 confined her in prison for the space of eighteen years.”
 
 “That was very cruel,” replied the lady, and presently relapsed into
 her former melancholy.
 
 “Perhaps,” said the comforter, “you have heard of the beautiful Joan
 of Naples, who was taken prisoner and strangled.”
 
 “I have a dim remembrance of her,” said the afflicted lady.
 
 “I must relate to you,” continued the other, “the adventure of a
 sovereign princess who, within my recollection, was dethroned after
 supper and who died on a desert island.”
 
 “I know her whole history,” replied the lady.
 
 “Well, then,” said Citosile, “I will tell you what happened to
 another great princess whom I instructed in philosophy. She had
 a lover, as all great and beautiful princesses have. Her father
 surprised this lover in her company, and was so displeased with
 the young man’s confused manner and excited countenance that he
 gave him one of the most terrible blows that had ever been given in
 his province. The lover seized a pair of tongs and broke the head
 of the angry parent, who was cured with great difficulty, and who
 still bears the marks of the wound. The lady in a fright leaped out
 of the window and dislocated her foot, in consequence of which she
 habitually halts, though still possessed in other respects of a very
 handsome person. The lover was condemned to death for having broken
 the head of a great prince. You can imagine in what a deplorable
 condition the princess must have been when her lover was led to the
 gallows. I have seen her long ago when she was in prison, and she
 always spoke to me of her own misfortunes.”
 
 “And why will you not allow me to think of mine?” said the lady.
 
 [Illustration: SO MANY GREAT LADIES HAVE BEEN SO UNFORTUNATE, IT ILL
 BECOMES YOU TO DESPAIR]
 
 “Because,” said the philosopher, “you ought not to think of
 them; and since so many great ladies have been so unfortunate, it ill
 becomes you to despair. Think of Hecuba—think of Niobe.”
 
 “Ah!” said the lady, “had I lived in their time, or in that of so
 many beautiful princesses, and had you endeavored to console them by
 a relation of my misfortunes, would they have listened to you, do you
 imagine?”
 
 Next day the philosopher lost his only son, and was entirely
 prostrated with grief. The lady caused a catalogue to be drawn up
 of all the kings who had lost their children, and carried it to the
 philosopher. He read it—found it very exact—and wept nevertheless.
 
 Three months afterwards they chanced to renew their acquaintance,
 and were mutually surprised to find each other in such a gay and
 sprightly humor. To commemorate this event, they caused to be erected
 a beautiful statue to Time, with this inscription: “TO HIM WHO
 COMFORTS.”
 
 
 
 
  A DIALOGUE  BETWEEN
  MARCUS AURELIUS AND
  A RECOLLET FRIAR.
 
 
 MARCUS AURELIUS.—Now I think I begin to know where I am. That’s
 certainly the capitol, and that basilica, the temple. The person I
 behold there is undoubtedly the priest of Jupiter. Hark ye, friend;
 one word with you, if you please.
 
 FRIAR.—Friend! very familiar, truly: you must certainly be a stranger
 in Rome, to accost in this manner brother Fulgentius the recollet, an
 inhabitant of the capitol, confessor to the duchess de Popoli, and
 who speaks sometimes to the pope, with as much familiarity as if he
 were a mere mortal.
 
 MARCUS AURELIUS.—Brother Fulgentius in the capitol! Matters are
 somewhat changed indeed. I don’t understand one word you say. Is
 there no such place here as the temple of Jupiter?
 
 FRIAR.—Get you gone about your business, honest friend; you seem to
 be out of your senses. Who are you, prithee, with your antique dress
 and your Jew’s beard? Whence come you, and what do you want here?
 
 MARCUS AURELIUS.—This is my ordinary apparel: I am come back to see
 Rome once more. My name is Marcus Aurelius.
 
 FRIAR.—Marcus Aurelius! I think I remember to have heard of such a
 name. If I don’t mistake, there was a Pagan emperor so called.
 
 MARCUS AURELIUS.—I am he. I longed to have another view of that Rome
 which I loved, and which was so fond of me; that capitol in which I
 triumphed by my contempt of triumph; that land I formerly rendered
 so happy: but now I can hardly think it to be the same place. I have
 been to see the column that was erected to my honor, and have not
 been able to find the statue of the sage Antonine, my father. The
 face is quite altered from what it was.
 
 FRIAR.—So it ought, M. Damned Soul. Sixtus V. erected that column;
 but then he put on it a better man than you and your father to boot.
 
 MARCUS AURELIUS.—I was always of opinion it was no difficult matter
 to excel me; but I thought it no such easy affair to surpass my
 father. Perhaps my piety towards him has imposed on my judgment. All
 men are liable to error. But why give me the epithet of Damned Soul?
 
 FRIAR.—Because so you are. Was it not you—let me see, I don’t
 mistake—that so often persecuted a set of folks, to whom you lay
 under very great obligations, and who procured you a shower of rain
 which enabled you to thrash your enemies?
 
 MARCUS AURELIUS.—Alas! I was very far from persecuting any one. I
 thank Heaven, by a very happy conjuncture, a storm happened, just in
 the nick of time, to save my troops, who were dying of thirst; but
 I never heard before that I owed the favor of this tempest to the
 folks you mention, though, to tell you the truth, they were very good
 soldiers. I assure you, in the most solemn manner, I am not damned:
 I have done too much good to mankind, that the Divine Being should
 do me any evil. But, prithee tell me, where is the palace of the
 emperor, my successor? Is it still on the Palatine hill? For really I
 hardly know my own country again.
 
 FRIAR.—I believe it, truly, we have so improved everything. If you
 please, I will carry you to Monte Cavallo: you shall have the honor
 to kiss the great toe of St. Peter; and you will, besides, receive a
 handsome present of indulgences, which, in my humble opinion, will be
 very seasonable; for I don’t doubt you stand in great need of them.
 
 MARCUS AURELIUS.—First of all, I desire you would grant me your own;
 and tell me ingenuously, is there an end of the emperors and empire
 of Rome?
 
 FRIAR.—No, no, by no means; there is still an empire and an emperor;
 but then he keeps his court at the distance of about four hundred
 leagues hence, at a small city called Vienna, on the Danube. My
 advice is, that you go there to pay a visit to your successors;
 because here you stand a great chance to visit the inquisition. I
 warn you that the reverend Dominican fathers are not at all disposed
 to jest in such matters, and that your Marcus Aureliuses, your
 Antonines, your Trajans, and your Tituses, and such gentry as cannot
 say their catechism, are treated by them after a very scurvy manner.
 
 MARCUS AURELIUS.—The catechism! the inquisition! Dominicans!
 Recollets! a pope and cardinals! and the Roman Empire in a little
 city on the Danube! I could never have dreamt of such things; though
 I will allow, that in sixteen hundred years things will change
 strangely in this world of ours. I could like, methinks, to see one
 of these Roman emperors, Marcoman, Quadus, Cimber, and Teuto.
 
 FRIAR.—You shall not want that pleasure when you please, and a
 greater than that still. You would, in all likelihood, be surprised,
 were I to tell you that the Scythians hold one half of your empire,
 and we the other: that the sovereign of Rome is a priest like me:
 that brother Fulgentius may be that sovereign in his turn: that I
 shall disperse indulgences on the very spot where you were wont to be
 drawn in your car by vanquished sovereigns: and, lastly, that your
 successor on the Danube has not a city he can call his own; but that
 there is a certain priest that lets him have the use of his capital,
 when he has occasion for it.
 
 MARCUS AURELIUS.—You tell me strange news, indeed. All these great
 changes could never have happened without great misfortunes. I own I
 still love the human race, and am heartily sorry for them.
 
 FRIAR.—You are too good. These revolutions have really cost a deluge
 of blood, and a hundred provinces have been ravaged; but had it not
 been so, your servant, brother Fulgentius, had never slept at his
 ease in the capitol.
 
 MARCUS AURELIUS.—Rome, that metropolis of the universe, is then most
 miserably fallen.
 
 FRIAR.—Fallen, I grant you; but as for miserably, there I must
 say you nay: on the contrary, peace and the fine arts flourish
 here eternally. The ancient masters of the world are now become
 music-masters. Instead of sending colonies into England, we now send
 them eunuchs and fiddlers. We have, it is true, none of your Scipios
 now, those destroyers of Carthage; but then we have none of your
 proscriptions neither. We have bartered glory for tranquillity.
 
 MARCUS AURELIUS.—I tried what I could to become a philosopher in
 my life-time, but now I am sure I have become one indeed. I find
 tranquillity is at the least an equivalent for glory: but, by what
 you tell me, I should be apt to suspect brother Fulgentius is no
 adept in philosophy.
 
 FRIAR.—What do you mean? Not a philosopher! I am one with a
 vengeance. I once taught philosophy; nay, better still, I read
 lectures in theology.
 
 MARCUS AURELIUS.—And, pray, what may this theology of yours be, an’t
 please you?
 
 FRIAR.—Why, it is—it is that which has made me be here, and the
 emperor elsewhere. You seem to grudge me the honor I enjoy, and are
 out of humor at the trifling revolution that has happened to your
 empire.
 
 MARCUS AURELIUS.—I adore the eternal decrees of Providence: I know
 man ought not to repine at fate: I admire the vicissitude of human
 affairs; but since everything is so liable to change, and since the
 Roman Empire has experienced this wonderful mutability, let me hope
 the recollets may also experience it in their turn.
 
 FRIAR.—I declare you anathematized: but hold, now I think on’t, it is
 time to go to matins.
 
 MARCUS AURELIUS.—And I will go and be reunited to the Being of
 Beings.
 
 
 
 
  DIALOGUE   BETWEEN   A   BRAHMIN
    AND A JESUIT, ON NECESSITY AND
    FREE-WILL,   AND  THE  GENERAL
    CONCATENATION  OF  CAUSES  AND
    EFFECTS.
 
 JESUIT.—In all probability, you are indebted to the prayers of St.
 Francis Xavier for that long and happy life you have enjoyed a
 hundred and fourscore years! Why, ’tis a life-time for a patriarch.
 
 BRAHMIN.—My master, Fonfouca, lived till three hundred; it is the
 ordinary course of life among us Brahmins. I have a very great regard
 for Francis Xavier; but all his prayers would never have put nature
 out of her destined order: had he really been able to prolong the
 life of a gnat but for one single instant beyond what the general
 concatenation of causes and events allows of, this globe of ours had
 worn a quite different appearance from that in which you now behold
 it.
 
 JESUIT.—You have a strange opinion of future contingents: why, you
 must be entirely ignorant that man is free, and that our free-will
 disposes of everything in this sublunary world at its mere fancy and
 pleasure. I can assure you the Jesuits alone have contributed not a
 little to some very considerable revolutions.
 
 BRAHMIN.—I have no manner of question in regard to the learning and
 power of the reverend fathers, the Jesuits: they are a very valuable
 part of human society; yet I cannot by any means believe them the
 sovereign arbiters of human transactions: every single person, every
 single being, whether Jesuit or Brahmin, is one of the springs which
 act in the general movement of the universe; in which he is the
 slave, and not the master of destiny. Pray, to what do you think
 Genghis Khan owed the conquest of Asia? To the very moment in which
 his father one day happened to awake as he was in bed with his wife;
 to a word which a Tartar chanced to let fall some years before. I,
 for example, the very person you behold, am one of the chief causes
 of the deplorable death of Henry IV., for which, you may see, I am
 still much afflicted.
 
 JESUIT.—Your reverence is pleased to be very merry upon the matter?
 You the cause of the death of Henry IV.!
 
 BRAHMIN.—Alas! it is too true. This happened in the nine hundred and
 eighty-three thousandth year of the revolution of Saturn, which makes
 the fifteen hundred and fiftieth of your era. I was then young and
 giddy headed. I thought proper, upon a time, to take a walk, which I
 began with moving my left foot first, on the coast of Malabar, whence
 most evidently followed the death of Henry IV.
 
 JESUIT.—How so, prithee? For, as to our society, who were accused
 with having had a large share in that affair, we had not the least
 knowledge of it.
 
 BRAHMIN.—I’ll tell ye how fate thought proper to order the matter.
 By moving my left foot, as I told you, I unluckily tumbled my friend
 Eriban, the Persian merchant, into the water, and he was drowned. My
 friend, it seems, had a very handsome wife, that ran away with an
 Armenian merchant: this lady had a daughter, who married a Greek; the
 daughter of this Greek settled in France, and married the father of
 Ravaillac. Now, had not every tittle of this happened exactly as it
 did, you are very sensible the affairs of the houses of France and
 Austria would have turned out in a very different manner. The system
 of Europe would have been entirely changed. The wars between Turkey
 and the German Empire would have had quite another issue; which issue
 would have had an effect on Persia, as well as Persia on the East
 Indies; so you see it is plain to a demonstration, that the whole
 depended on my left foot, which was connected with all the other
 events of the universe, past, present, and to come.
 
 JESUIT.—I must have this affair laid before some of our fathers, who
 are theologians.
 
 BRAHMIN.—In the meantime, I will tell you, father, that
 the maid-servant of the grandfather of the founder of the
 _Feuillants_—for you must know I have dipped into your histories—was
 likewise one principal cause of the death of Henry IV., and of all
 the accidents which it produced.
 
 JESUIT.—This servant-maid must then have been a domineering quean!
 
 BRAHMIN.—Oh fie! no such thing. She was a mere idiot, by whom her
 master had a child. Madame de la Barrière, poor soul, died of grief
 at it. She who succeeded her was, as your chronicles tell, the
 grandmother of the blessed John de la Barrière, who founded the order
 of _Feuillants_. Ravaillac was a monk of this order. With them he
 sucked in a certain doctrine very fashionable in those days, as you
 well enough know. This doctrine taught him to believe that the most
 meritorious thing he could possibly do was to assassinate the best
 king in the whole world. What followed is known to everybody.
 
 JESUIT.—In spite of your left foot, and the wench of the grandfather
 of the founder of the _Feuillants_, I shall ever be of opinion that
 the horrible action committed by Ravaillac was a future contingent,
 which might very well not have happened: for, after all, man is
 certainly a free agent.
 
 BRAHMIN.—I do not know what you mean by a free agent. I can affix no
 certain idea to these words. To be free, is to do whatever we think
 proper, and not to will whatever we please. All I know of the matter
 is, that Ravaillac voluntarily committed the crime, of which he was
 destined by fate to be the instrument. This crime was no more than a
 link of the great chain of destiny.
 
 JESUIT.—You may say what you will, but the affairs of this world are
 far from having any such dependence as you are pleased to think.
 What signifies, for example, this useless conversation of ours, here
 on the shores of the East Indies?
 
 BRAHMIN.—What you and I say in conversation is doubtless sufficiently
 insignificant; but, for all that, were you not here, the machine of
 the universe would be extremely changed from what it is.
 
 JESUIT.—There your Brahmin reverence is pleased to advance a huge
 paradox truly.
 
 BRAHMIN.—Your Ignatian fathership may believe me or no, as you
 like it. But assuredly, we should never have had this conversation
 together, had you not come into the East Indies. You had never made
 this voyage, had not your St. Ignatius de Loyola been wounded at the
 siege of Pampeluna, or had not the king of Portugal persisted in
 discovering the passage round the Cape of Good Hope. Now, prithee,
 did not the king of Portugal, with the help of the compass, entirely
 change the face of this world of ours? But it was first of all
 necessary that a certain Neapolitan should make this discovery of the
 compass; now tell me, if you have the face, that everything is not
 wholly subservient to one constant and uniform tenor of action; which
 by indissoluble, but invisible, concatenation, unites all that lives,
 or acts, or dies, or suffers on the surface of our globe?
 
 JESUIT.—What then would become of our future contingents?
 
 BRAHMIN.—What care I what become of them? but yet the order
 established by the hand of an eternal and almighty God must certainly
 exist forever.
 
 JESUIT.—Were one to listen to you, we ought not to pray to God at all.
 
 BRAHMIN.—It is our duty to adore Him. But pray what mean ye by
 praying to God?
 
 JESUIT.—What all the world means by it, to be sure: that He would
 grant our petitions, and favor us in all our wants.
 
 BRAHMIN.—I understand you. You mean, that a gardener might obtain
 clear sunshine weather, at a time which God had ordained from all
 eternity to produce rains; and that a pilot should have an easterly
 wind, when a westerly wind ought to refresh the earth, as well as the
 seas? My good father, to pray as we ought is to submit one’s self
 wholly to Providence. So good evening to you. Destiny requires I
 should now visit my Brahminess.
 
 JESUIT.—And my free-will urges me to give a lesson to a young
 scholar.
 
 
 
 
  DIALOGUES BETWEEN
      LUCRETIUS AND
      POSIDONIUS.
 
 
  FIRST COLLOQUY.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—Your poetry is sometimes admirable; but the philosophy of
 Epicurus is, in my opinion, very bad.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—What! will you not allow that the atoms, of their own
 accord, disposed themselves in such a manner as to produce the
 universe?
 
 POSIDONIUS.—We mathematicians can admit nothing but what is proved by
 incontestable principles.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—My principles are so.
 
  _Ex nihilo nihil, in nihilum nil posse reverti._
  _Tangere enim & tangi nisi corpus nulla potest res._
 
  From nothing nought can spring, to nothing nought return.
  Nought but a body can a body touch.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—Should I grant you these principles, and even your atoms
 and your vacuum, you can no more persuade me that the universe put
 itself into the admirable order in which we now behold it, than if
 you were to tell the Romans that the armillary sphere composed by
 Posidonius made itself.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—But who then could make the world?
 
 POSIDONIUS.—An intelligent Being, much more superior to the world
 and to me than I am to the brass of which I made my sphere.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—How can you, who admit nothing but what is evident,
 acknowledge a principle of which you have not the least idea?
 
 POSIDONIUS.—In the same manner as, before I knew you, I judged that
 your book was the work of a man of genius.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—You allow that nature is eternal, and exists because it
 does exist. Now if it exists by its own power, why may it not, by the
 same power, have formed suns, and worlds, and plants, and animals,
 and men?
 
 POSIDONIUS.—All the ancient philosophers have supposed matter to be
 eternal, but have never proved it to be really so; and even allowing
 it to be eternal, it would by no means follow that it could form
 works in which there are so many striking proofs of wisdom and
 design. Suppose this stone to be eternal if you will, you can never
 persuade me that it could have composed the “Iliad” of Homer.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—No: a stone could never have composed the “Iliad,” any
 more than it could have produced a horse: but matter organized in
 process of time, and become bones, flesh, and blood, will produce a
 horse; and organized more finely, will produce the “Iliad.”
 
 POSIDONIUS.—You suppose all this without any proof; and I ought to
 admit nothing without proof. I will give you bones, flesh, and blood,
 ready made, and will leave you and all the Epicureans in the world
 to make your best of them. Will you only consent to this alternative:
 to be put in possession of the whole Roman Empire, if, with all the
 ingredients ready prepared, you produce a horse, and to be hanged if
 you fail in the attempt?
 
 LUCRETIUS.—No; that surpasses my power, but not the power of nature.
 It requires millions of ages for nature, after having passed through
 all the possible forms, to arrive at last at the only one which can
 produce living beings.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—You might, if you pleased, continue all your lifetime to
 shake in a cask all the materials of the earth mixed together, you
 would never be able to form any regular figure; you could produce
 nothing. If the length of your life is not sufficient to produce even
 a mushroom, will the length of another man’s life be sufficient for
 that purpose? Why should several ages be able to effect what one age
 has not effected? One ought to have seen men and animals spring from
 the bosom of the earth, and corn produced without seed, etc., before
 he should venture to affirm that matter, by its own energy, could
 give itself such forms; but no one that I know of has seen such an
 operation, and therefore no one ought to believe it.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—Well! men, animals, and trees must always have existed.
 All the philosophers allow that matter is eternal; and they must
 further allow, that generations are so likewise. It is the very
 nature of matter that there should be stars that revolve, birds that
 fly, horses that run, and men that compose “Iliads.”
 
 POSIDONIUS.—In this new supposition you change your opinion; but you
 always suppose the point in question, and admit a thing for which you
 have not the least proof.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—I am at liberty to believe that what is to-day was
 yesterday, was a century ago, was a hundred centuries ago, and so on
 backwards without end. I make use of your argument: no one has ever
 seen the sun and stars begin their course, nor the first animals
 formed and endowed with life. We may, therefore, safely believe that
 all things were from eternity as they are at present.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—There is a very great difference. I see an admirable
 design, and I ought to believe that an intelligent being formed that
 design.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—You ought not to admit a being of whom you have no
 knowledge.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—You might as well tell me that I should not believe that
 an architect built the capitol because I never saw that architect.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—Your comparison is not just. You have seen houses built,
 and you have seen architects; and therefore you ought to conclude
 that it was a man like our present architects that built the capitol.
 But here the case is very different: the capitol does not exist of
 itself, but matter does. It must necessarily have had some form; and
 why will you not allow it to possess, by its own energy, the form in
 which it now is? Is it not much easier for you to admit that nature
 modifies itself, than to acknowledge a being that modifies it? In the
 former case you have only one difficulty to encounter, namely, to
 comprehend how nature acts. In the latter you have two difficulties
 to surmount: to comprehend this same nature, and the visible being
 that acts on it.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—It is quite the reverse. I see not only a difficulty, but
 even an impossibility in comprehending how matter can have infinite
 designs; but I see no difficulty in admitting an intelligent being,
 who governs this matter by his infinite wisdom, and by his almighty
 will.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—What? is it because your mind cannot comprehend one thing
 that you are to suppose another? Is it because you do not understand
 the secret springs, and admirable contrivances, by which nature
 disposed itself into planets, suns, and animals, that you have
 recourse to another being?
 
 POSIDONIUS.—No; I have not recourse to a god, because I cannot
 comprehend nature; but I plainly perceive that nature needs a supreme
 intelligence; and this reason alone would to me be a sufficient proof
 of a deity had I no other.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—And what if this matter possessed intelligence of itself?
 
 POSIDONIUS.—It is plain to me that it does not possess it.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—And to me it is plain that it does possess it, since I see
 bodies like you and me reason.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—If matter possesses, of itself, the faculty of thinking,
 you must affirm that it possesses it necessarily and independently:
 but if this property be essential to matter, it must have it at
 all times and in all places; for whatever is essential to a thing
 can never be separated from it. A bit of clay, and even the vilest
 excrement would think; but sure you will not say that dung thinks.
 Thought, therefore, is not an essential attribute of matter.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—Your reasoning is a mere sophism. I hold motion to be
 essential to matter; and yet this dung, or that piece of clay, is not
 actually in motion; but they will be so when they are impelled by
 some other body. In like manner thought will not be an attribute of a
 body, except when that body is organized for thinking.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—Your error proceeds from this, that you always suppose
 the point in question. You do not reflect that, in order to organize
 a body, to make it a man, to render it a thinking being, there must
 previously be thought, there must be a fixed design. But you cannot
 admit such a thing as design before the only beings in this world
 capable of design are formed; you cannot admit thought before the
 only beings capable of thinking exist. You likewise suppose the
 point in question, when you say that motion is necessary to matter;
 for what is absolutely necessary always exists, as extension, for
 instance, exists always and in every part of matter; but motion does
 not exist always. The pyramids of Egypt are not surely in motion.
 A subtile matter perhaps, may penetrate between the stones which
 compose the pyramids; but the body of the pyramid is immovable.
 Motion, therefore, is not essential to matter, but is communicated to
 it by a foreign cause, in the same manner as thought is to men. Hence
 it follows that there must be a powerful and intelligent being, who
 communicates motion, life, and thought to his creatures.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—I can easily answer your objections by saying that there
 have always been motion and intelligence in the world. This motion
 and this intelligence have been distributed at all times according to
 the laws of nature. Matter being eternal, it must necessarily have
 been in some order; but it could not be put into any order without
 thought and motion; and therefore thought and motion must have always
 been inherent in it.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—Do what you will, you can at best but make suppositions.
 You suppose an order; there must, therefore, have been some
 intelligent mind who formed this order. You suppose motion and
 thought before matter was in motion, and before there were men and
 thoughts. You must allow, that thought is not essential to matter,
 since you dare not say that a flint thinks. You can oppose nothing
 but a _perhaps_ to the truth that presses hard upon you. You are
 sensible of the weakness of matter, and are forced to admit a
 supreme intelligent and almighty being, who organized matter and
 thinking beings. The designs of this superior intelligence shine
 forth in every part of nature, and you must perceive them as
 distinctly in a blade of grass, as in the course of the stars.
 Everything is evidently directed to a certain end.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—But do you not take for a design what is only a necessary
 existence? Do you not take for an end what is no more than the use
 which we make of things that exist? The Argonauts built a ship to
 sail to Colchis. Will you say that the trees were created in order
 that the Argonauts might build a ship, and that the sea was made to
 enable them to undertake their voyage? Men wear stockings: will you
 say that legs were made by the Supreme Being in order to be covered
 with stockings? No, doubtless; but the Argonauts, having seen wood,
 built a ship with it, and having learned that the water could carry
 a ship, they undertook their voyage. In the same manner, after an
 infinite number of forms and combinations which matter had assumed,
 it was found that the humors, and the transparent horn which compose
 the eye, and which were formerly separated in different parts of
 the body, were united in the head, and animals began to see. The
 organs of generation, dispersed before, were likewise collected, and
 took the form they now have; and then all kinds of procreation were
 conducted with regularity. The matter of the sun, which had been
 long diffused and scattered through the universe, was conglobated,
 and formed the luminary that enlightens our world. Is there anything
 impossible in all this?
 
 POSIDONIUS.—In fact, you cannot surely be serious when you have
 recourse to such a system: for, in the first place, if you adopt this
 hypothesis, you must, of course, reject the eternal generations of
 which you have just now been talking: and, in the second place, you
 are mistaken with regard to final causes. There are voluntary uses to
 which we apply the gifts of nature; and there are likewise necessary
 effects. The Argonauts need not, unless they had pleased, have
 employed the trees of the forest to build a ship; but these trees
 were plainly destined to grow on the earth, and to produce fruits and
 leaves. We need not cover our legs with stockings; but the leg was
 evidently made to support the body, and to walk, the eyes to see, the
 ears to hear, and the parts of generation to perpetuate the species.
 If you consider that a star, placed at the distance of four or five
 hundred millions of leagues from us, sends forth rays of light, which
 make precisely the same angle in the eyes of every animal, and that,
 at that instant, all animals have the sensation of light, you must
 acknowledge that this is an instance of the most admirable mechanism
 and design. But is it not unreasonable to admit mechanism without a
 mechanic, a design without intelligence, and such designs without a
 Supreme Being?
 
 LUCRETIUS.—If I admit the Supreme Being, what form must I give Him?
 Is He in one place? Is He out of all place? Is He in time or out
 of time? Does He fill the whole of space, or does He not fill it?
 Why did He make the world? What was His end in making it? Why form
 sensible and unhappy beings? Why moral and natural evil? On whatever
 side I turn my mind, everything appears dark and incomprehensible.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—’Tis a necessary consequence of the existence of this
 Supreme Being that His nature should be incomprehensible; for, if
 He exists, there must be an infinite distance between Him and us.
 We ought to believe that He is, without endeavoring to know what
 He is, or how He operates. Are you not obliged to admit asymptotes
 in geometry, without comprehending how it is possible for the same
 lines to be always approaching, and yet never to meet? Are there not
 many things as incomprehensible as demonstrable, in the properties
 of the circle? Confess, therefore, that you ought to admit what is
 incomprehensible, when the existence of that incomprehensible is
 proved.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—What! must I renounce the dogmas of Epicurus?
 
 POSIDONIUS.—It is better to renounce Epicurus than to abandon the
 dictates of reason.
 
 
  SECOND COLLOQUY.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—I begin to recognize a Supreme Being, inaccessible to our
 senses, and proved by our reason, who made the world, and preserves
 it; but with regard to what I have said of the soul, in my third
 book, which has been so much admired by all the learned men of Rome,
 I hardly think you can oblige me to alter my opinion.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—You say: “_Idque situm media regione in pectoris
 hæret._”—“The mind is in the middle of the breast.”—But, when you
 composed your beautiful verses, did you never make any effort of the
 head? When you speak of the orators Cicero and Mark Antony, do you
 not say that they had good heads? And were you to say that they had
 good breasts, would not people imagine that you were talking of their
 voice and lungs?
 
 LUCRETIUS.—Are you not convinced, from experience, that the feelings
 of joy, of sorrow, and of fear, are formed about the heart?
 
  _Hic exultat enim pavor ac metus; hæc loca circum Lætitiæ mulcent._
 
  For there our passions live, our joy, our fear, And hope.
 
 Do you not feel your heart dilate or contract itself on the hearing
 of good or bad news? Is it not possessed of some secret springs of a
 yielding and elastic quality? This, therefore, must be the seat of
 the soul.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—There are two nerves which proceed from the brain, pass
 through the heart and stomach, reach to the parts of generation, and
 communicate motion to them; but would you therefore say, that the
 human mind resides in the parts of generation?
 
 LUCRETIUS.—No; I dare not say so. But though I should place the soul
 in the head, instead of placing it in the breast, my principles will
 still subsist: the soul will still be an infinitely subtile matter,
 resembling the elementary fire that animates the whole machine.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—And why do you imagine that a subtile matter can have
 thoughts and sentiments of itself?
 
 LUCRETIUS.—Because I experience it; because all the parts of my body,
 when touched, presently feel the impression; because this feeling is
 diffused through my whole machine; because it could not be diffused
 through it but by a matter of a very subtile nature, and of a very
 rapid motion; because I am a body, and one body cannot be affected
 but by another; because the interior part of my body could not be
 penetrated but by very small corpuscles; and, in consequence, my soul
 must be an assemblage of these corpuscles.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—We have already agreed, in our first colloquy, that it
 is extremely improbable that a rock could compose the “Iliad.” Will
 a ray of the sun be more capable of composing it? Suppose this ray a
 hundred thousand times more subtile and rapid than usual, will this
 light, or this tenuity of parts, produce thoughts and sentiments?
 
 LUCRETIUS.—Perhaps it may, when placed in organs properly prepared.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—You are perpetually reduced to your _perhaps_. Fire, of
 itself, is no more capable of thinking than ice. Should I suppose
 that it is fire that thinks, perceives, and wills in you, you would
 then be forced to acknowledge that it is not by its own virtue that
 it has either will, thought, or perception.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—No; these sensations will be produced not by its own
 virtue, but by the assemblage of the fire, and of my organs.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—How can you imagine that two bodies, neither of which can
 think apart, should be able to produce thought, when joined together?
 
 LUCRETIUS.—In the same manner as a tree and earth, when taken
 separately, do not produce fruit, but do so when the tree is planted
 in the earth.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—The comparison is only specious. This tree has in it
 the seeds of fruit: we plainly perceive them in the buds, and the
 moisture of the earth unfolds the substance of these fruits. Fire,
 therefore, must possess in itself the seeds of thought, and the
 organs of the body serve only to develop these seeds.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—And do you find anything impossible in this?
 
 POSIDONIUS.—I find that this fire, this highly refined matter, is
 as devoid of the faculty of thinking as a stone. The production of
 a being must have something similar to that which produced it; but
 thought, will, and perception have nothing similar to fiery matter.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—Two bodies, struck against each other, produce motion,
 and yet this motion has nothing similar to the two bodies; it has
 none of their three dimensions, nor has it any figure. A being,
 therefore, may have nothing similar to that which produced it, and,
 in consequence, thought may spring from an assemblage of two bodies
 which have no thought.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—This comparison likewise is more specious than just. I
 see nothing but matter in two bodies in motion: I only see bodies
 passing from one place to another. But when we reason together I see
 no matter in your ideas, or in my own. I shall only observe that I
 can no more conceive how one body has the power of moving another,
 than I can comprehend the manner of my having ideas. To me both are
 equally inexplicable, and both equally prove the existence and the
 power of a Supreme Being, the author of thought and motion.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—If our soul is not a subtile fire, an ethereal
 quintessence, what is it?
 
 POSIDONIUS.—Neither you nor I know aught of the matter. I will tell
 you plainly what it is not; but I cannot tell you what it actually
 is. I see that it is a power lodged in my body; that I did not give
 myself this power; and, in consequence, that it must have come from
 a Being superior to myself.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—You did not give yourself life; you received it from your
 father; from whom, likewise, together with life, you received the
 faculty of thinking, as he had received both from his father, and so
 on backwards to infinity. You no more know the true principle of life
 than you do that of thought. This succession of living and thinking
 beings has always existed.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—I plainly see that you are always obliged to abandon the
 system of Epicurus, and that you dare no longer maintain that the
 declination of atoms produced thought. I have already, in our last
 colloquy, refuted the eternal succession of sensible and thinking
 beings. I showed you that, if there are material beings capable of
 thinking by their own power, thought must necessarily be an attribute
 essential to all matter; that, if matter thought necessarily, and
 by its own virtue, all matter must of course think: but this is not
 the case, and therefore it is impossible to maintain a succession of
 material beings, who, of themselves, possess the faculty of thinking.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—Notwithstanding this reasoning, which you repeat, it is
 certain that a father communicates a soul to his son at the same time
 that he forms his body. This soul and this body grow together; they
 gradually acquire strength; they are subject to calamities, and to
 the infirmities of old age. The decay of our strength draws along
 with it that of our judgment; the effect at last ceases with the
 cause, and the soul vanishes like smoke into air.
 
  _Præterea, gigni pariter cum corpore, & una_
  _Crescere sentimus, pariterque senescere mentem._
  _Nam velet infirmo pueri, teneroque vagantur_
  _Corpore, sic animi sequitur sententia tenuis._
  _Inde ubi robustis adolevit viribus ætas,_
  _Consilium quoque majus, & auctior est animi vis._
  _Post ubi jam validis quassatum est viribus ævi_
  _Corpus, & obtusis ceciderunt viribus artus:_
  _Claudicat ingenium delirat linguaque, mensque;_
  _Omnia deficiunt, atque uno tempore desunt,_
  _Ergo dissolvi quoque convenit omnem animai_
  _Naturam, ceu fumus in altas aeris auras:_
  _Quandoquidem gigni pariter, pariterque videmus_
  _Crescere, & (ut docui) simul ævo fessa fatiscit._
 
  Besides, ’tis plain that souls are born, and grow;
  And all by age decay, as bodies do;
  To prove this truth: in infants, minds appear
  Infirm, and tender as their bodies are:
  In man, the mind is strong; when age prevails,
  And the quick vigor of each member fails,
  The mind’s powers, too, decrease, and waste apace;
  And grave and reverend folly takes the place.
  ’Tis likely then the soul and mind must die;
  Like smoke in air, its scattered atoms fly;
  Since all these proofs have shown, these reasons told,
  ’Tis with the body born, grows strong, and old.
                                            —CREECH.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—These, to be sure, are very fine verses; but do you
 thereby inform me of the nature of the soul?
 
 LUCRETIUS.—No; I only give you its history, and I reason with
 probability.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—Where is the probability of a father’s communicating to
 his son the faculty of thinking?
 
 LUCRETIUS.—Do you not daily see children resembling their fathers in
 their inclinations, as well as in their features?
 
 POSIDONIUS.—But does not a father, in begetting his son, act as a
 blind agent? Does he pretend, when he enjoys his wife, to make a
 soul, or to make thoughts? Do either of them know the manner in
 which a child is formed in the mother’s womb? Must we not, in this
 case, have recourse to a superior cause, as well as in all the other
 operations of nature which we have examined? Must you not see, if you
 are in earnest, that men give themselves nothing, but are under the
 hand of an absolute master?
 
 LUCRETIUS.—If you know more of the matter than I do, tell me what the
 soul is.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—I do not pretend to know what it is more than you. Let us
 endeavor to enlighten each other. Tell me, first, what is vegetation.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—It is an internal motion, that carries the moisture of the
 earth into plants, makes them grow, unfolds their fruits, expands
 their leaves, etc.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—Surely you do not think that there is a being called
 _Vegetation_ that performs these wonders?
 
 LUCRETIUS.—Who ever thought so?
 
 POSIDONIUS.—From our former colloquy you ought to conclude that the
 tree did not give vegetation to itself.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—I am forced to allow it.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—Tell me next what life is.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—It is vegetation joined with perception in an organized
 body.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—And is there not a being called life, that gives
 perception to an organized body?
 
 LUCRETIUS.—Doubtless vegetation and life are words which signify
 things that live and vegetate.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—If a tree and an animal cannot give themselves life and
 vegetation, can you give yourself thoughts?
 
 LUCRETIUS.—I think I can, for I think of whatever I please. My
 intention was to converse with you about metaphysics, and I have done
 so.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—You think that you are master of your ideas; do you know,
 then, what thoughts you will have in an hour, or in a quarter of an
 hour?
 
 LUCRETIUS.—I must own that I do not.
 
 POSIDONIUS.—You frequently have ideas in your sleep; you make verses
 in a dream: Cæsar takes cities: I resolve problems; and hounds pursue
 the stag in their dreams. Ideas, therefore, come to us independently
 of our own will; they are given us by a Superior Being.
 
 LUCRETIUS.—In what manner do you mean? Do you suppose that the
 Supreme Being is continually employed in communicating ideas; or that
 he created incorporeal substances, which were afterwards capable of
 forming ideas of themselves, sometimes with the assistance of the
 senses, and sometimes without it? Are these substances formed at
 the moment of the animal’s conception? Or are they formed before its
 conception? Do they wait for bodies, in order to insinuate themselves
 into them? or are they not lodged there till the animal is capable of
 receiving them? Or, in fine, is it in the Supreme Being that every
 animated being sees the ideas of things? What is your opinion?
 
 POSIDONIUS.—When you tell me how our will produces an instantaneous
 motion in our bodies, how your arm obeys your will, how we receive
 life, how food digests in the stomach, and how corn is transformed
 into blood, I will then tell you how we have ideas. With regard to
 all these particulars I frankly confess my ignorance. The world,
 perhaps, may one day obtain new lights; but from the time of Thales
 to the present age we have not had any. All we can do is to be
 sensible of our own weakness, to acknowledge an Almighty Being, and
 to be upon our guard against these systems.
 
 
 
 
  DIALOGUE BETWEEN
      A CLIENT AND
      HIS LAWYER.
 
 
 CLIENT.—Well, sir! with regard to the cause of those poor orphans?
 
 LAWYER.—What do you mean? It is but eighteen years since their estate
 has been in litigation.
 
 CLIENT.—I don’t complain of that trifling matter; I know the custom
 well enough; I respect it, but how in the name of heaven comes it to
 pass that you have been these three months soliciting a hearing and
 have not yet obtained it?
 
 LAWYER.—The reason is because you have not solicited an audience in
 person in behalf of your pupils; you ought to have waited on the
 judge several different times, to entreat him to try your cause.
 
 CLIENT.—It is their duty to do justice of their own accord without
 waiting till it is asked them. He is a very great man that has it
 in his power to sit in judgment on men’s lives and fortunes, but he
 is by no means so to desire that the miserable should wait in his
 antechamber. I do not go to our parson’s levee to pray and beseech
 him to have the goodness to sing high mass, why ought I then to
 petition my judge to discharge the function of his office? In short,
 after so many and such tedious delays, are we at length going to be
 so happy as to have our cause tried to-day?
 
 LAWYER.—Why yes, and there is great likelihood of your carrying a
 very material point in your process; you have a very decisive article
 in “Charondas” on your side.
 
 CLIENT.—This same Charondas was, in all probability, some
 lord-chancellor in the time of one of the kings of the first race who
 has passed a law in favor of orphans?
 
 LAWYER.—By no means, he is no more than a private person who has
 given his opinion in a great volume which nobody reads, but then your
 advocate quotes him, the judges take it upon his credit, so there’s
 your cause gained in a trice.
 
 CLIENT.—What! do you tell me the opinion of this Judge Charondas
 passes current for a law?
 
 LAWYER.—But there is one devilish bad circumstance attends us. Turnet
 and Brodeau are both against us.
 
 CLIENT.—These, I suppose, are two other legislators whose laws have
 much the same authority with those of that other hard-named gentleman.
 
 LAWYER.—Yes, certainly, as it was impossible to explain the Roman law
 sufficiently in the present case the world took different sides of
 the question.
 
 CLIENT.—What the devil signifies it to bring in the Roman law in this
 affair? Do we live in the present age under Theodosius or Justinian?
 
 LAWYER.—By no means, but our forefathers, you must know, had a
 prodigious passion for tilting and fox hunting; they ran all, as if
 they were mad, to the Holy Land with their doxies. You will grant
 me that men in such a hurry of business of consequence could not be
 supposed to have time on their hands to frame a complete body of
 universal jurisprudence.
 
 CLIENT.—Aye, aye, I understand you. For want of laws of your own you
 are forced to beg of Charondas and Justinian to be so good as tell
 you how you should proceed when an inheritance is to be divided.
 
 LAWYER.—There you are mistaken, we have more laws than all Europe
 besides; almost every city has a body of laws of its own.
 
 CLIENT.—Your most obedient. Here’s another miracle.
 
 LAWYER.—Ah! had your wards been born at Guignes-la-Putain instead of
 being natives of Melun near Corbeil!
 
 CLIENT.—Very well; what had happened then, for God’s sake?
 
 LAWYER.—You should have gained your cause as sure as two and two
 make four, that’s all, for at this same Guignes-la-Putain there is
 a custom which is wholly in your favor; but were you to go but two
 leagues beyond this, you would then be in a very different situation.
 
 CLIENT.—But pray are not Guignes and Melun both in France? And can
 anything be more absurd or horrible than to tell me that what’s right
 in one village is wrong in another? By what fatal barbarity does
 it happen that people born in the same country do yet live under
 different laws?
 
 LAWYER.—The reason is, that formerly the inhabitants of Guignes and
 those of Melun were not inhabitants of the same country: these two
 fine cities formed in the golden days of yore two distinct empires,
 and the august sovereign of Guignes, though a vassal to the king of
 France, gave laws to his own subjects. Those laws depended on the
 good will and pleasure of his _major domo_, who, it seems, could
 not read, so that they have been handed down by a most venerable
 tradition from father to son, so that the whole race of the barons de
 Guignes becoming extinct, to the irrecoverable loss of all mankind,
 the conceits of their first lackeys still exist and are held for the
 fundamental law of the land. The case is exactly the same in every
 six leagues in the whole kingdom, so that you change laws every time
 you change horses, so you may judge what a taking we poor advocates
 are in when we are to plead, for instance, for an inhabitant of
 Poictou against an inhabitant of Auvergne.
 
 CLIENT.—But these same men of Poictou, Auvergne, with your Guignes
 gentry, are they not all dressed in the same manner? Is it a harder
 matter to use the same laws than it is to wear the same clothes? And
 since it is evident the tailors and cobblers understand one another
 from one end of the kingdom to the other, why cannot the judges
 learn of them, and follow so excellent an example?
 
 LAWYER.—You desire a thing altogether as impossible as it would be to
 bring the nation to make use of one sort of weights and measures. Why
 would you have the laws everywhere the same when you see the point is
 different in all places? For my own part, after thinking till my head
 was like to split, all I have been able to conclude for the soul of
 me, is this: That as the measure of Paris is different from that at
 St. Denis, it follows that men’s judgments must also be different in
 both. The varieties of nature are infinite, and it would be wrong in
 us to endeavor to render uniform what she intends shall not be so.
 
 CLIENT.—Yet, now I think on it, I have a strong notion the English
 have but one sort of weight and measures.
 
 LAWYER.—The English! aye. Why the English are mere barbarians; they
 have, it is true, but one kind of measure, but, to make amends, they
 have a score of different religions.
 
 CLIENT.—There you mention something strange indeed! Is it possible
 that a nation who live under the same laws, should not likewise live
 under the same religion?
 
 LAWYER.—It is; which makes it plain they are abandoned to their own
 reprobate understandings.
 
 CLIENT.—But may not it also prove that they think laws made for
 regulating the external actions of men and religion the internal?
 Possibly the English, and other nations, were of opinion that laws
 related to the concernments of man with man and that religion
 regarded man’s relation to God. I am sure I should never quarrel with
 an Anabaptist who should take it into his head to be christened at
 thirty years old, but I should be horridly offended with him should
 he fail paying his bill of exchange. They who sin against God ought
 to be punished in the other world; they who sin against man ought to
 be chastised in this.
 
 LAWYER.—I understand nothing of all this. I am just going to plead
 your cause.
 
 CLIENT.—I wish to God you understood it better first.
 
 
 
 
  DIALOGUE  BETWEEN  MADAME DE
    MAINTENON AND MADEMOISELLE
    DE L’ENCLOS.[1]
 
 
 MADAME DE MAINTENON.—’Tis true, I did request you to come to see me
 privately, perhaps you may think it was only to make a display of my
 grandeur; by no means, I really meant it that I might receive in you
 a real consolation—
 
 MADEMOISELLE DE L’ENCLOS.—Consolation, madam! I must acknowledge
 that, having never been favored with hearing of you since you were
 grown great, I concluded you must be perfectly happy.
 
 MADAME DE MAINTENON.—I have the good fortune to be thought so. There
 are people in the world who are satisfied with this, though, to be
 plain with you, it is not at all my case, I have always exceedingly
 regretted your company.
 
 MADEMOISELLE DE L’ENCLOS.—I understand you. In the midst of your
 grandeur you were sensible of the want of friendship; and I, on
 the other hand, who am entirely engrossed by friendship, never had
 occasion to wish for grandeur; but how then comes it to pass you
 forgot me so long?
 
 MADAME DE MAINTENON.—You know the necessity I was under to seem at
 least to forget you. Believe me, amidst all the misfortunes attached
 to my elevation I always considered this restraint the chief.
 
 MADEMOISELLE DE L’ENCLOS.—As for my part, I neither forget my former
 pleasures nor my old friends; but if you are really unhappy, as you
 say you are, you impose prodigiously on the whole world who believe
 you otherwise.
 
 MADAME DE MAINTENON.—I was the first person deceived in this manner
 myself. If, while we were at supper together, in company with
 Villarfaux and Nantouillet at our little house the Tournelles,
 when the mediocrity of our fortune was scarce worth thinking of,
 somebody had said, You will, before ’tis long, approach very near
 to the throne; the most powerful monarch in the world will soon
 make you his sole confidante; all favors will pass through your
 hands; you will be regarded as a sovereign: if, said I, any one had
 made me such predictions I should have answered, The accomplishment
 of this strange prognostication must certainly kill one with mere
 astonishment. The whole of it was actually accomplished. I felt some
 surprise in the first moments but, in hoping for joy, I found myself
 entirely mistaken.
 
 MADEMOISELLE DE L’ENCLOS.—A philosopher might possibly believe this,
 but the public will with great difficulty be brought to believe
 you were dissatisfied, and should they really think so they would
 certainly blame you for it.
 
 MADAME DE MAINTENON.—The world must then be as much in the wrong as
 I was. This world of ours is a vast amphitheatre where every one is
 placed on his bench by mere chance. They imagine the supreme degree
 of felicity to be on the uppermost benches. What an egregious mistake!
 
 MADEMOISELLE DE L’ENCLOS.—I take this mistake to be necessary to
 human nature: they would never give themselves any trouble about
 getting higher were they not led by an opinion that happiness
 is placed above them. Both of us are acquainted with pleasures
 infinitely less deceiving or fanciful, but, for Heaven’s sake, how
 did you contrive to be so exceedingly wretched on your exalted seat?
 
 MADAME DE MAINTENON.—Alas! my dear Ninon! from the time I left off
 calling you anything but Mademoiselle de l’Enclos, I from that moment
 began to be less happy. It was decreed I must be a prude. This is
 telling all in one word. My heart is empty, my mind under restraint.
 I make the first figure in France, but it is really no more than a
 figure, a shadow! I live only a kind of borrowed life. Ah! did you
 but know what a burden it must be to a drooping soul to animate
 another soul or to amuse a mind no longer capable of amusement!
 
 MADEMOISELLE DE L’ENCLOS.—I easily guess the uneasiness of your
 situation. I fear insulting you should I mention the reflection
 that Ninon is happier at Paris in her little house with the Abbé de
 Châteauneuf, and some friends, than you at Versailles in the company
 of the most respectable personage in all Europe, who lays all his
 power at your feet. I am afraid to show you the superiority of my
 situation; I know it is wrong to discover too sensible a relish of
 our felicity in the presence of the unhappy. Endeavor, madam, to
 bear the load of your grandeur with patience, try to forget that
 delightful obscurity in which we formerly lived together, in the same
 manner you have been obliged to forget your ancient friends. The
 sole remedy in your painful state is to avoid reflection as much as
 possible, crying out with the poet,
 
  _Félicité passée,_
  _Qui ne peut revenir,_
  _Tourment de ma pensée,_
  _Que n’ai-je en te perdant, perdu le souvenir!_
 
 Tormenting thought of former happiness gone, never to return! Why,
 when I was bereft of the joy, did I not lose the remembrance of it
 also!
 
 Drink of the river Lethe, and above all, comfort yourself with having
 before your eyes so many royal dames whose time lies as heavy on
 their hands as yours can do.
 
 MADAME DE MAINTENON.—Ah, my dear! what felicity can one find in being
 alone? I would fain make a proposal to you but I am afraid to open
 myself.
 
 MADEMOISELLE DE L’ENCLOS.—Indeed, madam, to be plain with you, you
 have reason to be a little mistrustful, but take courage.
 
 MADAME DE MAINTENON.—I mean that you will barter, at least in
 appearance, your philosophy for prudery, and then you will become a
 truly respectable woman. You shall live with me in Versailles, you
 shall be more my friend than ever, and help me to support my present
 condition.
 
 MADEMOISELLE DE L’ENCLOS.—I still have a great affection for you,
 madam, but I must freely own to you I love myself still better, and
 can never consent to turn hypocrite and render myself miserable
 forever because fortune has treated you cruelly.
 
 MADAME DE MAINTENON.—Ah, cruel Ninon! you have a heart more hard than
 even the very courtiers themselves. Can you then abandon me without
 the least remorse?
 
 MADEMOISELLE DE L’ENCLOS.—By no means; I am still but too sensible.
 You really melt me, and, to convince you I have the same regard
 for you as ever I now make you the last offer in my power; quit
 Versailles and come and live with me at the rues des Tournelles.
 
 MADAME DE MAINTENON.—You pierce my very heart. I cannot be happy near
 the throne, nor can I enjoy pleasure in a retired life. This is one
 of the fatal effects of living in a court.
 
 MADEMOISELLE DE L’ENCLOS.—There is no remedy for an incurable
 disorder. I shall take the opinion of the philosophers who frequent
 my house concerning your malady, but I cannot promise you they will
 effect impossibilities.
 
 MADAME DE MAINTENON.—Good heavens! what a cruel situation! to behold
 myself on the very pinnacle of greatness, to be worshipped as a
 deity, and yet not to be able to taste of happiness!
 
 MADEMOISELLE DE L’ENCLOS.—Hold, my dear friend, I fancy there is
 some mistake in this; you believe yourself unhappy merely on account
 of your greatness, but may not the misfortune proceed from another
 cause, that your eyes have no longer the same lustre, your appetite
 no longer so good, nor your relish for pleasures so lively as
 heretofore? You have lost your youth, beauty, and feelings; this,
 this is your real misfortune. This is the reason why so many women
 turn devotees at fifty and so fly from one chagrin into the arms of
 another.
 
 MADAME DE MAINTENON.—But, after all, you have more years over your
 head than I have and you are neither unhappy nor a devotee.
 
 MADEMOISELLE DE L’ENCLOS.—Let us understand each other. We ought not
 to imagine that at your age and mine we can enjoy complete happiness.
 It requires a soul glowing with the most exquisite sensations and
 the five senses in their highest perfection to taste this kind of
 felicity. But with a few friends, a little philosophy, and liberty,
 one may be as much at one’s ease as this age will admit of. The mind
 is never unhappy but when out of its sphere. So e’en take my advice
 and come and live with me and my philosophical friends.
 
 MADAME DE MAINTENON.—I see two ministers of state coming this way.
 They are very different company from philosophers, so fare you well,
 my dear Ninon.
 
 MADEMOISELLE DE L’ENCLOS.—Adieu, illustrious unfortunate.
 
 
 FOOTNOTE
 
 [1] Madame de Maintenon and Mademoiselle Ninon de l’Enclos had

 Châteauneuf say, that Madame de Maintenon had used her utmost
 endeavors to engage Ninon to turn nun, and to come and comfort her at
 Versailles.
 
 
 
  DIALOGUE BETWEEN A SAVAGE
    AND A BACHELOR OF ARTS.
 
 
 A governor of Cayenne, having brought over with him a savage from
 Guiana, who had a great share of good natural understanding, and
 spoke French tolerably well; a bachelor of arts at Paris had the
 honor of entering into the following conversation with him:
 
 BACHELOR.—I suppose, Mr. Savage, you have seen a number of your
 country people who pass their lives all alone, for it is said that
 this is the true way of living natural to man, and that society is
 only an artificial depravity?
 
 SAVAGE.—Indeed I never did see any of those people you speak of.
 Man appears to me to be born for society, as well as several other
 species of animals. Each species follows the dictates of its nature;
 as for us, we live all together in a community.
 
 BACHELOR.—How! in community? Why, then, you have fine towns, and
 cities with walls, and kings who keep a court. You have shows,
 convents, universities, libraries, and taverns, have you?
 
 SAVAGE.—No; but have I not frequently heard it said that in your
 continent you have Arabians and Scythians who never knew anything of
 these matters, and yet form considerable nations? Now we live like
 these people; neighboring families assist each other. We inhabit a
 warm climate, and so have very few necessities; we can easily procure
 ourselves food; we marry; we get children; we bring them up, and
 then we die. You see this is just the same as among you; some few
 ceremonies excepted.
 
 BACHELOR.—Why, my good sir, then you are not a savage?
 
 SAVAGE.—I do not know what you mean by that word.
 
 BACHELOR.—Nor, to tell you the truth, do I myself—stay—let me
 consider a little—Oh!—a savage?—Why—a savage is—what we call a
 savage, is a man of a morose, unsociable disposition, who flies all
 company.
 
 SAVAGE.—I have told you already that we live together in families.
 
 BACHELOR.—We also give the name of savage to those beasts who are
 not tamed, but roam wild about the forests; and from hence we have
 transferred that appellation to men who inhabit the woods.
 
 SAVAGE.—I go into the woods sometimes, as well as you do, to hunt.
 
 BACHELOR.—Pray, now, do you think sometimes?
 
 SAVAGE.—It is impossible to be without some sort of ideas.
 
 BACHELOR.—I have a great curiosity to know what your ideas are. What
 think you of man?
 
 SAVAGE.—Think of him! Why, that he is a two-footed animal, who has
 the faculty of reasoning, speaking, and who uses his hands much more
 dexterously than the monkey. I have seen several kinds of men, some
 white, like you, others copper-colored, like me, and others black,
 like those that wait upon the governor of Cayenne. You have a beard,
 we have none; the negroes have wool, you and I have hair. They say,
 that in your more northerly climates the inhabitants have white hair,
 whereas that of the Americans is black. This is all I know about man.
 
 BACHELOR.—But your soul, my dear sir? your soul? what notion have you
 of that? whence comes it? what is it? what does it do? how does it
 act? where does it go?
 
 SAVAGE.—I know nothing about all this, indeed; for I never saw the
 soul.
 
 BACHELOR.—Apropos; do you think that brutes are machines?
 
 SAVAGE.—They appear to me to be organized machines, that have
 sentiment and memory.
 
 BACHELOR.—Well; and pray now, Mr. Savage, what do you think that you,
 you yourself, I say, possess above those brutes?
 
 SAVAGE.—The gifts of an infinitely superior memory, a much greater
 share of ideas, and, as I have already told you, a tongue capable
 of forming many more sounds than those of brutes; with hands more
 ready at executing; and the faculty of laughing, which a long-winded
 argumentator always makes me exercise.
 
 BACHELOR.—But tell me, if you please, how came you by all this? What
 is the nature of your mind? How does your soul animate your body? Do
 you always think? Is your will free?
 
 SAVAGE.—Here are a great number of questions; you ask me how I came
 to possess what God has given to man? You might as well ask me how I
 was born? For certainly, since I am born a man, I must possess the
 things that constitute a man in the same manner as a tree has its
 bark, roots, and leaves. You would have me to know what is the nature
 of my mind. I did not give it to myself, and therefore I cannot know
 what it is; and as to how my soul animates my body, I am as much a
 stranger to that, too; and, in my opinion, you must first have seen
 the springs that put your watch in motion before you can tell how
 it shows the hour. You ask me if I always think? No, for sometimes
 I have half-formed ideas, in the same manner as I see objects at a
 distance, confusedly; sometimes my ideas are much stronger, as I
 can distinguish an object better when it is nearer to me; sometimes
 I have no ideas at all, as when I shut my eyes I can see nothing.
 Lastly, you ask me, if my will is free? Here I do not understand you;
 these are things with which you are perfectly well acquainted, no
 doubt, therefore I shall be glad you will explain them to me.
 
 BACHELOR.—Yes, yes, I have studied all these matters thoroughly; I
 could talk to you about them for a month together without ceasing,
 in such a manner as would surpass your understanding. But tell me,
 do you know good and evil, right and wrong? Do you know which is the
 best form of government? which the best worship? what is the law of
 nations? the common law? the civil law? the canon law? Do you know
 the names of the first man and woman who peopled America? Do you know
 the reason why rain falls into the sea; and why you have no beard?
 
 SAVAGE.—Upon my word, sir, you take rather too great advantage of the
 confession I made just now, that man has a superior memory to the
 brutes; for I can hardly recollect the many questions you have asked
 me; you talk of good and evil, right and wrong; now, I think that
 whatever gives you pleasure, and does injury to no one, is very good
 and very right; that what injures our fellow-creatures, and gives us
 no pleasure, is abominable; and what gives us pleasure but, at the
 same time, hurts others, may be good with respect to us for the time,
 but it is in itself both dangerous to us, and very wrong in regard to
 others.
 
 BACHELOR.—And do you live in society with these maxims?
 
 SAVAGE.—Yes, with our relatives and neighbors, and, without much
 pain or vexation, we quietly attain our hundredth year; some indeed
 reach to a hundred and twenty, after which our bodies serve to
 fertilize the earth that has nourished us.
 
 BACHELOR.—You seem to me to have a clear understanding, I would
 very fain puzzle it. Let us dine together, after which we will
 philosophize methodically.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 SAVAGE.—I find that I have swallowed foods that are not made for me,
 notwithstanding I have a good stomach; you have made me eat after my
 stomach was satisfied, and drink when I was no longer dry. My legs
 are not so firm under me as they were before dinner; my head feels
 heavy, and my ideas are confused. I never felt this diminution of my
 faculties in my own country. For my part, I think the more a man puts
 into his body here, the more he takes away from his understanding.
 Pray, tell me, what is the reason of all this damage and disorder?
 
 BACHELOR.—I will tell you. In the first place, as to what passes in
 your legs, I know nothing about the matter, you must consult the
 physicians about that; they will satisfy you in a trice. But I am
 perfectly well acquainted with how things go in your head. You must
 know, then, that the soul being confined to no place, has fixed her
 seat either in the pineal gland, or callous body in the middle of the
 brain. The animal spirits that rise from the stomach fly up to the
 soul, which they cannot affect, they being matter and it immaterial.
 Now, as neither can act upon the other, therefore the soul takes
 their impression, and, as it is a simple principle, and consequently
 subject to no change, therefore it suffers a change, and becomes
 heavy and dull when we eat too much; and this is the reason that so
 many great men sleep after dinner.
 
 SAVAGE.—What you tell me appears very ingenious and profound, but I
 should take it as a favor if you would explain it to me in such a
 manner as I might comprehend.
 
 BACHELOR.—Why, I have told you everything that can be said upon
 this weighty affair; but, to satisfy you, I will be a little more
 explicit. Let us go step by step. First, then, do you know that this
 is the best of all possible worlds?
 
 SAVAGE.—How! is it impossible for the Infinite Being to create
 anything better than what we now see?
 
 BACHELOR.—Undoubtedly; for nothing can be better than what we see.
 It is true, indeed, that mankind rob and murder each other, but they
 all the while extol equity and moderation. Several years ago they
 massacred about twelve millions of your Americans, but then it was to
 make the rest more reasonable. A famous calculator has proved that
 from a certain war of Troy, which you know nothing of, to the last
 war in North America, which you do know something of, there have been
 killed in pitched battles no less than five hundred and fifty-five
 million six hundred and fifty thousand men, without reckoning young
 children and women buried under the ruins of cities and towns which
 have been set on fire; but this was all for the good of community;
 four or five thousand dreadful maladies, to which mankind are
 subject, teach us the true value of health; and the crimes that cover
 the face of the earth greatly enhance the merit of religious men,
 of which I am one; you see that everything goes in the best manner
 possible, at least as to me.
 
 Now things could never be in this state of perfection, if the soul
 was not placed in the pineal gland. For—but let me take you along
 with me in the argument. Let us go step by step. What notion have you
 of laws, and of the rule of right and wrong; of the _to Kalon_, as
 Plato calls it?
 
 SAVAGE.—Well, but my good sir, while you talk of going step by step,
 you speak to me of a hundred different things at a time.
 
 BACHELOR.—Every one converses in this manner. But tell me who made
 the laws in your country?
 
 SAVAGE.—The public good.
 
 BACHELOR.—That word _public good_ means a great deal. We have not any
 so expressive; pray, in what sense do you understand?
 
 SAVAGE.—I understand by it that those who have a plantation of cocoa
 trees or maize, have forbidden others to meddle with them, and that
 those who had them not, are obliged to work, in order to have a
 right to eat part of them. Everything that I have seen, either in
 your country or my own, teaches me that there can be no other spirit
 of the laws.
 
 BACHELOR.—But as to women, Mr. Savage, women?
 
 SAVAGE.—As to women, they please me when they are handsome and
 sweet-tempered; I prize them even before our cocoa trees; they are a
 fruit which we are not willing to have plucked by any but ourselves.
 A man has no more right to take my wife from me than to take my
 child. However, I have heard it said, that there are people who will
 suffer this; they have it certainly in their will; every one may do
 what he pleases with his own property.
 
 BACHELOR.—But as to successors, legatees, heirs, and collateral
 kindred?
 
 SAVAGE.—Every one must have a successor. I can no longer possess my
 field when I am buried in it, I leave it to my son; if I have two,
 I divide it equally between them. I hear that among you Europeans,
 there are several nations where the law gives the whole to the eldest
 child, and nothing to the younger. It must have been sordid interest
 that dictated such unequal and ridiculous laws. I suppose either the
 elder children made it themselves, or their fathers, who were willing
 they should have the pre-eminence.
 
 BACHELOR.—What body of laws appears to you the best?
 
 SAVAGE.—Those in which the interests of mankind, my fellow
 creatures, have been most consulted.
 
 BACHELOR.—And where are such laws to be found?
 
 SAVAGE.—In no place that I have ever heard of.
 
 BACHELOR.—You must tell me from whence the inhabitants of your
 country first came? Who do you think first peopled America?
 
 SAVAGE.—God—whom else should we think?
 
 BACHELOR.—That is no answer. I ask you from what country your people
 first came?
 
 SAVAGE.—The same country from which our trees came; really the
 Europeans appear to me a very pleasant kind of people, to pretend
 that we can have nothing without them; we have just as much reason to
 suppose ourselves your ancestors as you have to imagine yourselves
 ours.
 
 BACHELOR.—You are an obstinate little savage.

  CHAPTER I.
  A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE DEATH OF JOHN CALAS.
 
 The murder of John Calas, committed in Toulouse with the sword of
 justice, the 9th of March, 1762, is an event which, on account of its
 singularity, calls for the attention of the present age, and that of
 posterity. We soon forget the crowd of victims who have fallen in the
 course of innumerable battles, not only because this is a destiny
 inevitably connected with a life of warfare, but because those who
 thus fell might also have given death to their enemies, and did not
 lose their lives till after having first stood in their own defence.
 Where the danger and the advantage are equal, our wonder ceases, and
 even pity itself is in some measure lessened; but where the father of
 an innocent family is delivered up to the sword of error, prejudice,
 or enthusiasm, where the accused person has no other defence but his
 conscious virtue; where the arbiters of his destiny have nothing to
 hazard in putting him to death but the having been mistaken, and
 where they may murder with impunity under the sanction of a judicial
 process, then every one is ready to cry out, every one brings the
 case home to himself, and sees with fear and trembling that no
 person’s life is in safety in a court erected to watch over the lives
 of the subject, the public unite in demanding vengeance.
 
 In this strange affair, we find religion, self-murder and parricide
 blended. The object of inquiry was, whether a father and a mother
 had murdered their own son with a view to please God, and whether a
 brother had murdered his brother, or a friend his friend; or whether
 the judges had to reproach themselves with having publicly executed
 an innocent father, or with having acquitted a guilty mother,
 brother, and friend.
 
 John Calas, a person of sixty-eight years of age, had followed the
 profession of a merchant in Toulouse for upwards of forty years,
 and had always borne the character of a tender parent in his family
 and neighborhood; he was himself by religion a Protestant, as was
 also his wife, and all his children, one son only excepted, who had
 abjured heresy, and to whom the father allowed a small annuity;
 indeed, the good man appeared so far from being infected with that
 absurd zeal which destroys the bands of society, that he even
 approved of the conversion of his son, Louis Calas. He had for above
 thirty years kept in his house a maid-servant, who was a zealous
 Catholic, and who had brought up all his children.
 
 Another of his sons, whose name was Mark Antony, was a man of
 letters, but, at the same time, of a restless, gloomy, and impetuous
 disposition. This young man finding that he had no prospect of
 getting into business as a merchant, for which indeed he was very
 unfit, nor of being admitted to the bar as a lawyer, as not being
 able to obtain the requisite certificates of his being a Catholic,
 resolved to lay violent hands upon himself, and gave some intimation
 of his design to one of his friends. In order to confirm himself in
 the resolution he had formed, he carefully collected everything that
 had been written upon the subject of suicide, all of which he read
 with great attention; at length, one day, having lost all his money
 at play, he chose that as a most proper opportunity for putting his
 design into execution. One Lavaisse, a young man of nineteen years
 of age, the son of a lawyer in great repute at Toulouse, and who was
 esteemed by every one who knew him, happened to come from Bordeaux
 the evening before,[2] when he went by chance to sup with the Calas
 family at their house, being an acquaintance of that family’s, and of
 Mark Antony Calas in particular. Old Calas, his wife, Mark Antony,
 their eldest son, and Peter their second son, supped all together
 that evening; after supper was over, they retired into another room,
 where Mark Antony suddenly disappeared. After some time, young
 Lavaisse took his leave, and Peter Calas accompanied him downstairs;
 when they came to the warehouse they saw Mark Antony hanging in his
 shirt behind the door, and his coat and waistcoat folded up and laid
 upon the counter; his shirt was not in the least rumpled, nor his
 hair, which he had dressed that day, in any wise disordered; there
 was no wound upon his body, nor any other mark of violence.[3]
 
 We shall not here enter into all the minute circumstances with
 which the lawyers have filled their briefs; nor shall we attempt to
 describe the grief and distraction of the unhappy parents; their
 cries were heard by the whole neighborhood. Lavaisse and Peter Calas,
 almost beside themselves, ran, the one to fetch a surgeon, and the
 other an officer of justice. While they were thus employed, and
 old Calas and his wife in all the agonies of grief, the people of
 the town gathered in crowds about the house. The Toulousians are a
 superstitious and headstrong people, and look upon all persons, even
 their own relations, who are not of the same religion as themselves,
 as monsters and objects of detestation. It was at Toulouse that a
 solemn thanksgiving was ordered for the death of Henry III. and that
 the inhabitants took an oath to murder the first person who should
 propose to acknowledge that great and good prince Henry IV. for their
 sovereign; and this same city still continues to solemnize, by an
 annual procession, illuminations, and bonfires, the day on which,
 about two hundred years ago, it ordered the massacre of four thousand
 of its citizens for being heretics. In vain has the council issued
 six decrees prohibiting the keeping of this detestable anniversary,
 the Toulousians still continuing to celebrate it as a high festival.
 
 Some one among the mob, a greater enthusiast than the rest, cried out
 that John Calas himself had hanged his son; this cry became in an
 instant unanimous, some persons taking occasion to observe that the
 deceased was to have made his abjuration the next day, and that his
 own family and young Lavaisse had murdered him out of the hatred they
 bore to the Catholic religion. No sooner was this opinion broached,
 than it was fully believed by every one; and the whole town was
 persuaded that it is one of the articles of the Protestant religion
 for a father or mother to murder their own son, if he attempts to
 show any inclination to change his faith.
 
 When the minds of the populace are once put into a ferment they are
 not easily appeased; it was now imagined that all the Protestants of
 Languedoc had assembled together the preceding night, and had chosen
 by a plurality of voices one of their sect for an executioner; that
 the choice had fallen upon Lavaisse; that this young man had, in less
 than four and twenty hours, received the news of his election, and
 had come from Bordeaux to assist John Calas, his wife, and their son
 Peter, to murder a son, a brother, and a friend.
 
 The Sieur David, capitoul of Toulouse, instigated by these rumors,
 and being desirous of bringing himself into notice, by the ready
 execution of his office, took a step contrary to all the established
 rules and ordinances, by ordering the Calas family, together with
 their Catholic maid-servant and Lavaisse, to be put in irons.
 
 After this a monitory was published, which was as erroneous as the
 former step. Nay, matters were carried still farther; Mark Antony
 Calas had certainly died a Calvinist, and as such, if he had laid
 violent hands on himself, his body ought to have been dragged on a
 hurdle; whereas it was interred with the greatest funeral pomp in the
 church of St. Stephen, notwithstanding the curate entered his protest
 against this profanation of holy ground.
 
 There are in Languedoc four orders of penitents, the white, the blue,
 the gray, and the black, who wear a long capuchin or hood, having a
 mask of cloth falling down over the face, in which are two holes for
 the sight. These orders wanted the Duke of Fitz-James to become one
 of their body, but he refused them. On the present occasion the white
 penitents performed a solemn service for Mark Antony Calas as for a
 martyr; nor was the festival of a real martyr ever celebrated with
 greater pomp by any church: but then this pomp was truly terrible.
 Beneath a magnificent canopy was placed a skeleton, which was made to
 move by springs; this skeleton was to represent Mark Antony Calas,
 holding in one hand a branch of palm, and, in the other, the pen
 with which he was to sign his abjuration of heresy; or rather, as the
 sequel proved, the death-warrant of his father.
 
 And now nothing more remained to be done for this wretch who had been
 his own murderer but the office of canonization; the people, already
 to a man, looked on him as a saint; some invoked him, some went to
 pray at his tomb, some besought him to work miracles, while others
 gravely recounted those he had already performed; a monk pulled out
 one or two of his teeth, in order to have some lasting relics; an
 old woman, more pious than the rest, but unhappily troubled with a
 deafness, declared that she had heard the sound of bells very plainly
 at his interment; and a priest was cured of an apoplectic fit, after
 taking a stout emetic; protocols were drawn up of these stupendous
 miracles, and the author of this account has in his possession an
 affidavit to prove that a young man of Toulouse had his brain turned,
 on having prayed several nights successively at the tomb of the new
 saint, without having been able to obtain the miracle he requested of
 him.
 
 Among the order of the white penitents there were some magistrates of
 justice; the death of John Calas seemed then inevitable.
 
 But what more particularly hastened his fate was the approach of
 that singular festival, which, as I have already observed, the
 Toulousians celebrate every year, in commemoration of the massacre
 of four thousand Huguenots; the year 1762 happened to be the _annum
 seculare_ of this execrable deed. The inhabitants were busied in
 making preparations for the solemnity; this circumstance added fresh
 fuel to the heated imagination of the populace; every one cried out
 that a scaffold for the execution of the Calas family would be one of
 the greatest ornaments of the ceremony; and that heaven itself seemed
 to have brought them thither as victims, to be sacrificed to our holy
 religion. Twenty persons were ear-witnesses to these speeches, and to
 others still more outrageous. And this, in the present age! this at
 a time when philosophy has made so great a progress! and while the
 pens of a hundred academies are employed in inculcating humanity and
 gentleness of manners. It should seem that enthusiasm enraged at the
 late success of reason, fought under her standard with redoubled fury.
 
 Thirteen judges met every day to try this cause; they had not, they
 could not, have any proof against this unhappy family; but mistaken
 zeal held the place of proofs. Six of the judges continued a long
 time obstinate, being resolved to sentence John Calas, his son, and
 Lavaisse, to be broken on the wheel, and his wife to be burned at
 the stake; the other seven judges, rather more moderate, were at
 least for having the accused examined; the debates were frequent
 and long. One of the judges, convinced in his mind of the innocence
 of the parties, and of the impossibility of the crime laid to their
 charge, spoke warmly in their favor; he opposed the zeal of humanity
 to that of cruelty, and openly pleaded the cause of the Calas family
 in all the houses of Toulouse where misguided religion demanded with
 incessant cries the blood of these unfortunate wretches. Another
 judge, well known for his violence and severity, went about the town,
 raving with as much fury against the accused as his brother had been
 earnest in defending them. In short, the contest became so warm that
 both were obliged to enter protests against each other’s proceedings,
 and retire into the country.
 
 But by a strange fatality, the judge who had been on the favorable
 side had the delicacy to persist in his exceptions, and the other
 returned to give his vote against those on whom he could no longer
 sit as judge; and it was his single vote which carried the sentence
 of being broken upon the wheel against them, there being eight voices
 against five, one of the six merciful judges being at last, after
 much contestation, brought over to the rigorous side.
 
 In my opinion, in cases of parricide, and where the master of a
 family is to be devoted to the most dreadful punishment, the sentence
 ought to be unanimous, inasmuch as the proofs of so unparalleled[4]
 a crime ought to be proved in such a manner as to satisfy all the
 world, and the least shadow of a doubt in a case of this nature
 should be sufficient to make the judge tremble who is about to pass
 sentence of death. The weakness of our reason, and the insufficiency
 of our laws, become every day more obvious; but surely there cannot
 be a greater example of this deficiency than that one single casting
 vote should be sufficient to condemn a fellow-citizen to be broken
 alive on the wheel; the Athenians required at least fifty voices,
 over and above the one-half of the judges, before they would dare to
 pronounce sentence of death; but to what does all this tend? Why, to
 what we know, but make very little use of, that the Greeks were wiser
 and more humane than ourselves.
 
 It appeared altogether impossible that John Calas, who was an old man
 of sixty-eight, and had a long while been troubled with a swelling
 and weakness in his legs, should have been able by himself to have
 mastered his son and hanged him, who was a stout young fellow of
 eight and twenty, and more than commonly robust; therefore he must
 absolutely have been assisted in this act by his wife, his other
 son, Peter Calas, Lavaisse, and by the servant-maid, and they had
 been together the whole night of this fatal adventure. But this
 supposition is altogether as absurd as the other; for can any one
 believe that a servant, who was a zealous Catholic, would have
 permitted those whom she looked on as heretics to murder a young man
 whom she herself had brought up, for his attachment to a religion
 to which she herself was devoted; that Lavaisse would have come
 purposely from Bordeaux to assist in hanging his friend, of whose
 pretended conversion he knew nothing, or that an affectionate mother
 would have joined in laying violent hands on her own son? And lastly,
 how could they all together have been able to strangle a young man
 stronger than them all, without a long and violent struggle, or
 without his making such a noise as must have been heard by the whole
 neighborhood, without repeated blows passing between them, without
 any marks of violence, or without any of their clothes being in the
 least soiled or disordered!
 
 It was evident that if this murder could in the nature of things have
 been committed, the accused persons were all of them equally guilty,
 because they did not quit each other’s company an instant the whole
 night; but then it was equally evident that they were not guilty, and
 that the father alone could not be so, and yet, by the sentence of
 the judges, the father alone was condemned to suffer.
 
 The motive on which this sentence was passed was as unaccountable
 as all the rest of the proceeding. Those judges who had given their
 opinion for the execution of John Calas persuaded the others that
 this poor old man, unable to support the torments, would, when on
 the wheel, make a full confession of his own guilt and that of his
 accomplices; but how wretchedly were they confounded, when yielding
 up his breath on that instrument of execution, he called God as a
 witness of his innocence, and besought Him to forgive his judges!
 
 They were afterwards obliged to pass a second decree, which
 contradicted the first, namely to set at liberty the mother, her
 son Peter, young Lavaisse, and the maid-servant; but one of the
 counsellors having made them sensible that this latter decree
 contradicted the other, and that they condemned themselves, inasmuch
 as, it having been proved that all the accused parties had been
 constantly together during the whole time the murder was supposed
 to be committed, the setting at liberty the survivors was an
 incontestable proof of the innocence of the master of the family whom
 they had ordered to be executed; on this it was determined to banish
 Peter Calas, the son, which was an act as ill-grounded and absurd as
 any of the rest, for Peter Calas was either guilty or not guilty of
 the murder; if he was guilty, he ought to have suffered in the same
 manner as his father; if he was innocent, there was no reason for
 banishing him. But the judges, frightened with the sufferings of the
 father, and with that affecting piety with which he had resigned his
 life, thought to preserve their characters by making people believe
 that they showed mercy to the son; as if this was not a new degree
 of prevarication, and that, thinking no bad consequences could arise
 from banishing this young man, who was poor and destitute of friends,
 was not a very great additional act of injustice after that which
 they had been already so unfortunate as to commit.
 
 They now began to go to work with Peter Calas in his confinement,
 threatening to treat him as they had done his father, if he would
 not abjure his religion. This the young man has declared on oath, as
 follows:
 
  “A Dominican friar came to me to my cell, and threatened me with the
  same kind of death if I did not abjure; this I attest before God,
  this 23d day of July, 1762.                          PETER CALAS.”
 
 As Peter was going out of the town, he was met by one of the abbés
 with a converting spirit, who made him return back to Toulouse, where
 he was shut up in a convent of Dominicans, and there compelled to
 perform all the functions of a convert to the Catholic religion;
 this was in part what his persecutors aimed at, it was the price of
 his father’s blood, and due atonement now seemed to be made to the
 religion of which they looked on themselves as the avengers.
 
 The daughters were next taken from their mother, and shut up in a
 convent. This unhappy woman, who had been, as it were, sprinkled with
 the blood of her husband, who had held her eldest son lifeless within
 her arms, had seen the other banished, her daughters taken from her,
 herself stripped of her effects, and left alone in the wide world
 destitute of bread, and bereft of hopes, was almost weighed down to
 the grave with the excess of her misfortunes. Some certain persons,
 who had maturely weighed all the circumstances of this horrible
 adventure, were so struck with them that they pressed Mrs. Calas, who
 now led a life of retirement and solitude, to exert herself, and go
 and demand justice at the foot of the throne. At this time she was
 scarcely able to drag about the remains of a miserable life; besides,
 having been born in England and brought over to a distant province in
 France when very young, the very name of the city of Paris frightened
 her. She imagined that in the capital of the kingdom they must be
 still more cruel than in Toulouse; at length, however, the duty of
 revenging the death of her husband got the better of her weakness.
 She set out for Paris, arrived there half dead, and was surprised
 to find herself received with tenderness, sympathy, and offers of
 assistance.
 
 In Paris reason always triumphs over enthusiasm, however great,
 whereas in the more distant provinces of the kingdom, enthusiasm
 almost always triumphs over reason.
 
 M. de Beaumont, a famous lawyer of the Parliament of Paris,
 immediately took her cause in hand, and drew up an opinion, which
 was signed by fifteen other lawyers. M. Loiseau, equally famous for
 his eloquence, likewise drew up a memorial in favor of this unhappy
 family; and M. Mariette, solicitor to the council, drew up a formal
 statement of the case, which struck every one who read it with
 conviction.
 
 These three noble defenders of the laws and of innocence made the
 widow a present of all the profits arising from the publication of
 these pieces,[5] which filled not only Paris but all Europe with pity
 for this unfortunate woman, and every one cried aloud for justice to
 be done her. In a word, the public passed sentence on this affair
 long before it was determined by the council.
 
 The soft infection made its way even to the Cabinet, notwithstanding
 the continual round of business, which often excludes pity, and the
 familiarity of beholding miserable objects, which too frequently
 steels the heart of the statesman against the cries of distress. The
 daughters were restored to their disconsolate mother, and all three
 in deep mourning, and bathed in tears, drew a sympathetic flood from
 the eyes of their judges, before whom they prostrated themselves in
 thankful acknowledgment.
 
 Nevertheless, this family had still some enemies to encounter, for
 it is to be considered that this was an affair of religion. Several
 persons, whom in France we call _dévots_,[6] declared publicly that
 it was much better to suffer an old Calvinist, though innocent, to
 be broken alive upon the wheel, than to expose eight counsellors of
 Languedoc to the mortification of being obliged to own that they had
 been mistaken; nay, these people made use of this very expression:
 “That there were more magistrates than Calases”; by which it would
 seem they inferred that the Calas family ought to be sacrificed
 to the honor of the magistracy. Alas! they never reflected that
 the honor of a judge, like that of another man, consists in making
 reparation for the faults he may have committed.
 
 In France no one believes that the pope, even when assisted by his
 cardinals, is infallible; ought they then to have believed that eight
 judges of Toulouse were so? Every sensible and disinterested person
 did without scruple declare that the decree of the court of justice
 of Toulouse would be looked upon as void by all Europe, even though
 particular considerations might prevent it from being declared so by
 the council.
 
 Such was the state of this surprising affair when it occasioned
 certain impartial, but sensible, persons to form the design of laying
 before the public a few reflections upon toleration, indulgence,
 and commiseration, which the Abbé Houteville in his bombastic and
 declamatory work, which is false in all the facts, calls a _monstrous
 doctrine_, but which reason calls the portion of human nature.
 
 Either the judges of Toulouse, carried away by popular enthusiasm,
 caused the innocent master of a family to be put to a painful
 and ignominious death, a thing which is without example; or this
 master of a family and his wife murdered their eldest son, with the
 assistance of another son and a friend, which is altogether contrary
 to nature. In either case, the most holy of all religions has been
 perverted to the production of an enormous crime. It is therefore
 to the interest of mankind to examine how far charity or cruelty is
 consistent with true religion.
 
 
  CHAPTER II.
  CONSEQUENCES OF THE EXECUTION OF JOHN CALAS.
 
 If the order of white penitents had been the cause of the punishment
 of an innocent person, and of the utter ruin and dispersion of a
 whole family, and of branding them with that ignominy which is
 annexed to those who suffer, when it ought properly to fall only
 upon those who pass an unjust sentence; if the frantic hurry of
 these penitents in celebrating as a saint one whom they ought to
 have treated as a self-murderer, brought a virtuous, an innocent
 fellow-citizen to the scaffold, surely this fatal mistake ought to
 make them true penitents for the rest of their lives, and they and
 the judges ought to have their eyes continually filled with tears,
 without wearing a white cloak or a mask on their faces, to hide
 those tears. We have a proper respect for all religious orders—they
 are edifying; but will all the good they have ever been able to do
 the state compensate for the shocking disaster of which they have
 been the cause? Their institution seems to have been the work of
 that zeal which animates the Catholics of Languedoc against those we
 call Huguenots. One would be tempted to imagine that they had made
 a vow to hate their brethren; and that, though men have religion
 enough to hate and persecute, they have not sufficient to love and
 cherish one another. But what would be the case if these orders were
 governed by enthusiastic superiors, as were certain congregations,
 among whom, to use the words of one of our most eloquent and learned
 magistrates, the custom of seeing visions was reduced to an art and
 system? Or that their convents had in them those dark rooms, called
 meditation rooms, which were filled with pictures of frightful
 devils, armed with long horns and talons, flaming gulfs, crosses, and
 daggers, with the holy name of Jesus in a scroll over them? Edifying
 spectacles, doubtless, for eyes already blinded with fanaticism, and
 for imaginations no less filled with mistaken zeal than with abject
 submission to the will of their directors!
 
 There have been times, and we know it but too well, in which
 religious orders have been dangerous to the state. The Frérots and
 the Flagellants have excited troubles in the kingdom. The League owed
 its origin to such associations. But wherefore should any set of men
 thus distinguish themselves from the rest of their fellow-citizens?
 Is it that they think themselves more perfect? If so, it is offering
 an insult to the rest of the community; or are they desirous that
 every Christian should become a member of their society? Truly, it
 would be a curious sight to see all the inhabitants of Europe in long
 hoods and masks, with two little round holes to peep through! Or,
 lastly, do they seriously think that this dress is more acceptable to
 God than the coats and waistcoats we usually wear? No, no, there is
 something more at the bottom; this habit is a kind of controversial
 uniform, a signal for those of a contrary opinion to stand upon their
 guard, and might in time kindle a kind of civil war in our minds
 that would terminate in the most terrible consequences, were not the
 wisdom of the king and of his ministers as great as the folly of
 these fanatics.
 
 Every one is sufficiently sensible what fatal effects have arisen
 since Christians have begun to dispute among themselves concerning
 modes of belief; the blood of the subjects has flown in torrents
 either on the scaffold or in the field, from the fourth century to
 the present time. But let us confine ourselves only to the wars and
 disasters which the disputes concerning reformation have excited in
 France, and examine into their source. Perhaps a short and faithful
 portrait of these numberless calamities may open the eyes of some who
 have not had the advantage of education, and touch those hearts which
 are not by nature callous.
 
 
  CHAPTER III.
  A SKETCH OF THE REFORMATION IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.
 
 When learning began to revive, and the understandings of mankind
 became more enlightened, there was a general complaint of errors and
 abuses, and every one acknowledged the complaint to be just.
 
 Pope Alexander VI. made a public purchase of the pontifical crown,
 and his five bastards shared with him the profits. His son, the
 Cardinal Duke of Borgia, in concert with the pope, his father, caused
 the noble families of Vitelli, Urbino, Gravina, and Oliveretto,
 together with a hundred other lords, to be made away with, in order
 to seize upon their estates. Julius II., full of the same spirit,
 excommunicated Louis XII. of France, while he himself, armed
 cap-a-pie, ravaged a part of Italy with fire and sword. Leo X., in
 order to raise money to pay the expenses of his pleasures, made a
 sale of indulgences, like goods in a common market. Those who opposed
 such shameful impositions were certainly right in a moral view; let
 us see how far they were so with regard to us, in a political one.
 
 They asserted that as Jesus Christ had never exacted annats, nor
 reversions, nor sold dispensations for this world nor indulgences for
 the next, they saw no reason why they should pay a foreign prince
 his price for these things. Supposing that the annats, the law
 proceedings in the pope’s court, and the dispensations which still
 subsist were to cost us no more than five hundred thousand crowns a
 year; it is clear that since the time of Francis I., that is, in two
 hundred and fifty years, we have paid a hundred and twenty millions;
 and if we calculate the different value of the mark of silver, we
 shall find that this sum amounts to about two hundred and fifty
 millions of the present money. It may therefore, I think, without any
 blasphemy be allowed that the heretics in proposing the abolition of
 these extraordinary taxes, which will be the admiration of posterity,
 did, in that respect, no great injury to the kingdom, and showed
 themselves good calculators rather than bad subjects. Add to this,
 that they were the only persons who understood the Greek language,
 or had any knowledge of antiquity; let us own likewise, without
 dissimulation, that with all their errors, we are indebted to them
 for the opening of our understandings, which had been long buried
 beneath the most barbarous obscurity.
 
 But as they denied the doctrine of purgatory, concerning which no
 one ought to have the least doubt, and which, moreover, brought in
 a comfortable revenue to the monks; as they paid no reverence to
 relics which every one ought to reverence, and which brought in still
 greater profits; and lastly, as they attacked the most respectable
 tenets,[7] their adversaries made them no other reply than by
 committing them to the stake. The king, who styled himself their
 protector, and who kept a body of them in pay in Germany, marched at
 the head of a procession through Paris, which was concluded by the
 execution of a number of these unhappy wretches, in the following
 manner:
 
 They were suspended at the end of a long beam, which played upon
 a pole erected for that purpose, and underneath them was kindled a
 large fire, into which they were alternately lowered and then raised
 up again, by which they experienced the most excruciating torments,
 till a lingering death at last put an end to the longest and most
 dreadful punishment that cruelty ever invented.
 
 A short time before the death of Francis I., the members of the
 Parliament of Provence, whom the clergy had incensed against the
 inhabitants of Mirandol and Cabrière, applied to the king for a body
 of troops to attend the execution of nineteen persons of that country
 who had been condemned by them; with the assistance of this armed
 force they massacred about six thousand souls, without sparing sex
 or age, and reduced thirty villages to ashes. The people who were
 the objects of these executions, and who had, till then, been in a
 manner unknown, were doubtless to blame for having been born Vaudois,
 but this was their only crime. They had been settled for upwards
 of three hundred years in deserts and on mountains, which they had
 rendered fertile by incredible labor, and led a pastoral and quiet
 life, the perfect image of the innocence which we find attributed to
 the first ages of the world. They had no acquaintance with the towns
 or villages round about them, except that obtained by carrying the
 produce of their grounds thither to sell. Totally ignorant of all
 military operations, they made no defence, but were slaughtered like
 timorous animals, whom we drive into a net and then knock them on the
 head.[8]
 
 After the death of Francis I., a prince who, it must be confessed,
 was more remarkable for his gallantries and his misfortunes than for
 his cruelty, the execution of a thousand heretics, and in particular
 that of Dubourg, a counsellor of the parliament, together with the
 massacre of Vassy, made the persecuted fly to arms. Their sect
 multiplied in proportion with the fires lighted for them, and the
 swords of executioners drawn against them, patience gave way to rage,
 and they followed the example of their enemies in cruelty. Nine civil
 wars filled France with carnage, and a peace, more fatal than war
 itself, produced the day of St. Bartholomew, which stands without
 example in the annals of crime.
 
 Henry III. and Henry IV. fell victims to the league, the one by the
 hand of a Dominican friar, and the other by that of a monster who had
 been a brother of the mendicant order. There are those who pretend
 that humanity, indulgence, and liberty of conscience are horrible
 things; I would ask such persons seriously, if they could have
 produced calamities comparable to those I have just related?
 
 
  CHAPTER IV.
  WHETHER TOLERATION IS DANGEROUS, AND
  AMONG WHAT NATIONS IT IS PRACTISED.
 
 Some people will have it, that if we were to make use of humanity
 and indulgence towards our mistaken brethren who pray to God in bad
 French, it would be putting arms into their hands, and we should see
 revived the bloody days of Jarnac, Moncontour, Coutras, Dreux, St.
 Denis, and others. I know not how this may be, as I have not the
 gift of prophecy, but I really cannot discover the congruity of this
 reasoning, “that because these men took up arms against me when I
 oppressed them, they will do the same if I show them favor.”
 
 And here I would willingly take the liberty to entreat those who have
 the reins of government in hand, or are destined to fill the highest
 stations, for once to examine maturely whether there is any reason
 to apprehend that indulgence would occasion the same rebellions as
 cruelty and oppression, and whether what has happened under certain
 circumstances would happen under others of a different nature, or
 whether times, opinions, and manners are always the same?
 
 The Huguenots, it cannot be denied, have formerly given in to all
 the rage of enthusiasm, and have been polluted with blood as well
 as ourselves, but can it be said that the present generation is as
 barbarous as the former? Have not time and reason, which have lately
 made so great progress, together with good books, and that natural
 softness introduced from society, found their way among those who
 have the guidance of these people? And do we not clearly perceive
 that almost all Europe has undergone a change within the last century?
 
 The hands of government have everywhere been strengthened, while the
 minds of the people have been softened and civilized; the general
 police, supported by numerous standing armies, leave us no longer any
 cause to fear the return of those times of anarchy, when Protestant
 boors and Catholic peasants were hastily called together from the
 labors of agriculture to wield the sword against each others’ lives.
 
 _Alia tempora, aliæ curæ._ It would be highly absurd in the present
 days to decimate the body of the Sorbonne because it formerly
 petitioned for burning the _Pucelle d’Orléans_ because it declared
 Henry III. to have lost his right to the throne, and because it
 excommunicated and proscribed the illustrious Henry IV. We certainly
 should not think of prosecuting the other public bodies of the
 nation, who committed the like excesses in those times of error and
 madness; it would not only be very unjust, but as ridiculous as if we
 were to oblige all the inhabitants of Marseilles to undergo a course
 of physic because they had the plague in 1720.
 
 [Illustration: THE MAID OF ORLEANS AT THE STAKE]
 
 Should we at present go and sack Rome, as the troops of Charles
 the Fifth did, because Pope Sixtus the Fifth, in the year 1585,
 granted a nine years’ indulgence to all Frenchmen who would take up
 arms against their sovereign? No, surely it is enough if we prevent
 the court of Rome from ever being guilty of such excesses in the
 future.
 
 The rage inspired by a spirit of controversy, and the abuse made
 of the Christian religion from want of properly understanding it,
 has occasioned as much bloodshed, and produced as many calamities
 in Germany, England, and even in Holland, as in France; and yet,
 at present, the difference in religion occasions no disturbances
 in those countries; but the Jew, the Catholic, the Lutheran, the
 Calvinist, the Anabaptist, the Socinian, the Moravian, and a
 multitude of other sects live in brotherly harmony together, and
 contribute equally to the good of society.
 
 In Holland they no longer fear that the disputations of a Gomar[9]
 concerning predestination should bring the head of a grand
 pensionary to the block, nor in London that the quarrels between
 the Presbyterians and the Episcopals about a form of prayer and
 a surplice should again spill the blood of their kings upon a
 scaffold.[10] Ireland, now populous and rich, will not any more
 behold its Catholic inhabitants sacrificing, as an acceptable
 offering, the lives of their Protestant brethren, by burying them
 alive, hanging up mothers upon gibbets, and tying their daughters
 round their necks to see them expire together; ripping up women with
 child, taking the half-formed infant from the womb, and throwing it
 to swine or dogs to be devoured; putting a dagger into the hands of
 their manacled prisoners, and forcing them to plunge it into the
 breasts of their fathers, their mothers, their wives, or children,
 thereby hoping to make them guilty of parricide, and damn their souls
 while they destroyed their bodies; all which we find related by
 Rapin, who served as an officer in the English service in Ireland,
 and who lived very near the time of those transactions, and confirmed
 by most of the English historians. No! such cruelties as these were
 never to be paralleled, so they doubtless will never be imitated.
 Philosophy, the sister of religion, has herself snatched the poniard
 from the hands of superstition, so long bathed in blood; and the
 human understanding, recovered from its delirium, stands amazed at
 the shocking brutalities into which it has been hurried by enthusiasm.
 
 We ourselves know that in France there is a rich and populous
 province where the Protestant religion prevails much more than that
 of the Church of Rome. The University of Alsace consists almost
 entirely of Lutherans, and they are likewise in possession of most
 of the civil posts in that province; and yet the public peace has
 never once been disturbed by any quarrels about religion since that
 province has belonged to our kings. And what is the reason? Because
 no one is persecuted there on account of his religion. Seek not to
 lay a restraint upon the mind, and you may always be sure that the
 mind will be yours.
 
 I do not mean by this to insinuate that those who are of a different
 faith to the prince under whose government they live should have
 an equal share in the places of profits and honor with those who
 are of the established religion of the state. In England the
 Roman Catholics, who are in general looked upon to be friends to
 the Pretender, are excluded from all civil posts, and are even
 double-taxed; but then, in every other respect, they enjoy the
 prerogatives of citizens.
 
 Some of our bishops in France have been suspected of thinking
 that their honor and interest is concerned in not suffering any
 Protestants within their diocese, and that this is the principal
 obstacle to allowing of toleration amongst us; but this I cannot
 believe. The episcopal body in France is composed of persons of
 quality, who think and act in a manner suitable to their high
 birth; and as envy itself must confess that they are generous and
 charitable, they therefore certainly cannot think that those whom
 they thus drive out of their diocese would become converts in any
 other country, but great honor would redound from the conversion
 of them at home; nor would the prelate be any loser by it in his
 temporals, seeing that the greater the number of the inhabitants, the
 greater is the value of the land.
 
 A certain Polish bishop had a farmer who was an Anabaptist, and a
 receiver of his rents who was a Socinian. Some person proposed to
 the bishop to prosecute the latter in the spiritual court for not
 believing in transubstantiation, and to turn the other out of his
 farm because he would not have his son christened till he was fifteen
 years of age; the prelate very prudently replied that though he made
 no doubt of their being eternally damned in the next world, yet he
 found them extremely necessary to him in this.
 
 Let us now for a while quit our own little sphere, and take a survey
 of the rest of the globe. The Grand Seignior peaceably rules over
 subjects of twenty different religions; upwards of two hundred
 thousand Greeks live unmolested within the walls of Constantinople;
 the mufti himself nominates the Greek patriarch, and presents him
 to the Emperor, and, at the same time, allows the residence of a
 Latin patriarch. The Sultan appoints Latin bishops for some of the
 Greek isles. The form used on this occasion is as follows:[11] “I
 command such a one to go and reside as bishop in the Isle of Chios,
 according to the ancient custom and idle ceremonies of those people.”
 The Ottoman Empire swarms with Jacobins, Nestorians, Monothelites,
 Cophti, Christians of St. John, Guebres, and Banians; and the Turkish
 annals do not furnish us with one single instance of a rebellion
 occasioned by any of these different sects.
 
 Go into India, Persia, and Tartary, and you will meet with the same
 toleration and the same tranquillity. Peter the Great encouraged all
 kinds of religions throughout his vast empire; trade and agriculture
 have been gainers by it, and no injury ever happened therefrom to the
 body politic.
 
 We do not find that the Chinese government, during the course of
 four thousand years that it has existed, has ever adopted any other
 religion than that of the Noachides, which consists in the simple
 worship of one God; and yet it tolerates the superstitions of Fo, and
 that of a multitude of bonzes; which might be productive of dangerous
 consequences did not the wisdom of the tribunals keep them within
 proper bounds.
 
 It is true that the great Yong-T-Chin, the most wise and magnanimous
 of all the emperors of China, drove the Jesuits out of his kingdom;
 but this was not because that prince himself was non-tolerant, but,
 on the contrary, because the Jesuits were so.
 
 They themselves, in their letters, have given us the speech the
 emperor made to them on that occasion: “I know,” said he, “that
 your religion admits not of toleration; I know how you have behaved
 in the Manilas and in Japan; you deceived my father, but think
 not to deceive me in the same manner.” And if we read the whole
 of the conversation which he deigned to hold with them, we must
 confess him to be the wisest and most clement of all princes. How
 could he indeed, with any consistency, keep in his kingdom European
 philosophers, who, under the pretence of teaching the use of
 thermometers and eolipiles, had found means to debauch a prince of
 the blood? But what would this emperor have said had he read our
 histories, and had he been acquainted with the times of the League
 and the Gunpowder Plot?
 
 It was sufficient for him to be informed of the outrageous and
 indecent disputes between those Jesuits, Dominicans, Capuchins, and
 secular priests who were sent as missionaries into his dominions from
 one extremity of the globe to preach the truth; instead of which
 they employed their time in mutually pronouncing damnation against
 one another. The emperor, then, did no more than send away a set of
 foreigners who were disturbers of the public peace. But with what
 infinite goodness did he dismiss them! and with what paternal care
 did he provide for their accommodation in their journey, and to
 prevent their meeting with any insult on their way! This very act
 of banishment might serve as an example of toleration and humanity.
 [12] The Japanese were the most tolerant of all nations; twelve
 different religions were peaceably established in their empire; when
 the Jesuits came, they made the thirteenth; and, in a very little
 time after their arrival, they would not suffer any other than their
 own. Everyone knows the consequence of these proceedings; a civil
 war, as calamitous as that of the League, soon spread destruction and
 carnage through the empire; till at length the Christian religion was
 itself swallowed up in the torrents of blood it had set aflowing, and
 the Japanese forever shut the entrance of their country against all
 foreigners, looking upon us as no better than savage beasts, such
 as those from which the English have happily cleared their island.
 Colbert, the minister, who knew the necessity we were in of the
 commodities of Japan, which wants nothing from us, labored in vain to
 settle a trade with that empire; he found those people inflexible.
 
 Thus, then, everything on our continent shows us that we ought
 neither to preach nor to exercise non-toleration.
 
 Let us now cast our eyes on the other hemisphere. Behold Carolina!
 whose laws were framed by the wise Locke; there every master of a
 family, who has only seven souls under his roof, may establish what
 religion he pleases, provided all those seven persons concur with him
 therein; and yet this great indulgence has not, hitherto, been the
 occasion of any disorders. God forbid that I should mention this as
 an example to every master of a family to set up a particular worship
 in his house; I have only introduced it to show that the utmost
 lengths to which toleration can be carried have never yet given rise
 even to the slightest dissensions.
 
 And what shall we say of those pacific primitive Christians, who
 have, by way of derision, been called Quakers; and who, though some
 of their customs may perhaps be ridiculous, are yet remarkable for
 the virtue and sobriety of their lives, and for having in vain
 endeavored to preach peace and good-will to the rest of mankind?
 There are at least a hundred thousand of them in Pennsylvania;
 discord and controversy are unknown in that happy spot where they
 have settled; the very name of their principal city, Philadelphia, is
 a continual memento to them that all men are brethren, and is at once
 an example and reproach to those nations which have not yet adopted
 toleration.
 
 To conclude, toleration has never yet excited civil wars, whereas its
 opposite has filled the earth with slaughter and desolation. Let any
 one then judge which of the two is more entitled to our esteem, or
 which we should applaud; the mother who would deliver her son into
 the hand of the executioner, or she who would resign all right to him
 to save his life.
 
 In all that I have said I have had only the interest of nations in
 view, and, as I pay all due respect to the doctrines of the Church,
 I have in this article only considered the physical and moral
 advantages of society. I therefore hope that every impartial reader
 will properly weigh these truths, that he will view them in their
 proper light, and rectify what may be amiss. Those who read with
 attention, and reciprocally communicate their thoughts, will always
 have the start of the author.[13]
 
 
  CHAPTER V.
  IN WHAT CASES TOLERATION MAY BE ADMITTED.
 
 Let me for once suppose that a minister equally noble and discerning,
 that a prelate equally wise and humane, or a prince who is sensible
 that his interest consists in the increased number of his subjects,
 and his glory in their happiness, may deign to cast their eyes on
 this random and defective production. In this case his own consummate
 knowledge will naturally lead him to ask himself, “What hazard shall
 I run by seeing the land beautiful and enriched by a greater number
 of industrious laborers, the aids augmented, and the state rendered
 more flourishing?”
 
 Germany, by this time, would have been a desert, covered with the
 unburied bodies of many different sects, slaughtered by one another,
 had not the Peace of Westphalia happily procured a liberty of
 conscience.
 
 We have Jews in Bordeaux, in Mentz, and in Alsace; we have Lutherans,
 Molinists, and Jansenists amongst us; can we not then admit
 Protestants likewise under proper restrictions, nearly like those
 under which the Roman Catholics are permitted in England? The greater
 the number of different sects, the less danger is to be apprehended
 from any one in particular; they become weaker in proportion as
 they are more numerous, and are easily kept in subjection by those
 just laws which prohibit riotous assemblies, mutual insults, and
 seditions, and which the legislative power will always properly
 support in their full vigor.
 
 We know that there are several heads of families, who have acquired
 great fortunes in foreign countries, who would be glad to return to
 their native country. These require only the protection of the law
 of nature, to have their marriages remain valid and their children
 secured in the enjoyment of their present property, and the right
 of succeeding to the inheritance of their fathers, together with
 protection for their persons. They ask no public places of worship;
 they aim not at the possession of civil employment, nor do they
 aspire to dignities either in Church or State; for no Roman Catholics
 can enjoy any of these, either in England or in any other Protestant
 country.[14] In this case, therefore, there is no occasion for
 granting great privileges, or delivering strongholds into the hands
 of a faction, but only to suffer a quiet set of people to breathe
 their native air; to soften the rigor of some edicts, which in
 former times might perhaps have been necessary, but at present are no
 longer so. It is not for us to direct the ministry what it has to do;
 it is sufficient if we presume to plead the cause of an unfortunate
 and distressed people.
 
 Many and easy are the methods to render these people useful to the
 state, and to prevent them from ever becoming dangerous; the wisdom
 of the legislature supported by the military force, will certainly
 find out these methods, which other nations have employed with so
 much success.
 
 It is certain that there is still a number of enthusiasts among the
 lower kind of Calvinists; but, on the other hand, it is no less
 certain that there is still a greater number among the lower kind
 of bigoted Roman Catholics. The dregs of the madmen of St. Médard
 are passed over unnoticed in the nation, while the greatest pains
 are taken to exterminate the Calvinist prophets. The most certain
 means to lessen the number of the mad of both sorts, if any still
 remain, is to leave them entirely to the care of reason, which will
 infallibly enlighten the understanding in the long run, though
 she may be slow in her operations. Reason goes mildly to work,
 she persuades with humanity, she inspires mutual indulgence and
 forbearance, she stifles the voice of discord, establishes the rule
 of virtue and sobriety, and disposes those to pay a ready obedience
 to the laws who might start from the hand of power when exerted
 to enforce them. Besides, are we to hold for nothing that contempt
 and ridicule which enthusiasm everywhere meets with in the present
 enlightened age from persons of rank and education? This very
 contempt is the most powerful barrier that can be opposed to the
 extravagancies of all sectaries. Past times are as though they never
 had been. We should always direct our views from the point where we
 ourselves at present are, and from that to which other nations have
 attained.
 
 There has been a time in which it was thought a duty to issue edicts
 against all such as taught a doctrine contrary to the categories of
 Aristotle, or who opposed the abhorrence of a vacuum, quiddities, or
 the whole or the part of a thing. There are above a hundred volumes
 in Europe containing the writings of civilians against magic, and
 the manner of distinguishing real sorcerers from pretended ones.
 The excommunication of grasshoppers and other insects hurtful to
 the fruits of the earth was formerly much in use, and is still to
 be found in several rituals; that custom is now laid aside, and
 Aristotle, with his sorcerers, and the grasshoppers are left to
 themselves. Innumerable are the examples of these grave follies,
 which formerly were deemed of great importance; others have succeeded
 from time to time, but as soon as they have had their effect, and
 people begin to grow weary of them, they pass away and are no more
 heard of. If any one were, at present, to take it into his head
 to turn Eutychian, Nestorian, or Manichæan, what would be the
 consequence? We should laugh at him in the same manner as at a person
 who should appear dressed after the ancient fashion, with a great
 ruff and slashed sleeves.
 
 The first thing that opened the eyes of our nation was when the
 Jesuits Letellier and Doucin drew up the bull Unigenitus, and sent
 it to the Court of Rome, imagining they lived still in those times
 of ignorance in which people adopted, without examination, the most
 absurd assertions. They even dared to proscribe a proposition, which
 is universally true in all cases and in all times, “that the dread
 of an unjust excommunication ought not to hinder any one from doing
 his duty.” This was, in fact, proscribing reason, the liberties of
 the Gallican church, and the very foundation of all morality; it was
 saying to mankind: “God commands you never to do your duty when you
 are apprehensive of suffering any injustice.” Never was so gross
 an insult offered to common sense, and yet this never occurred to
 these correspondents of the Church of Rome. Nay, they even persuaded
 that court that this bull was necessary, that the nation desired it.
 Accordingly it was signed, sealed, and sent back to France; and every
 one knows the consequences; assuredly, had they been foreseen, this
 bull would have been mitigated. Very warm disputes ensued upon it;
 but, however, by the great prudence and goodness of the king, they
 were at length appeased.
 
 It is much the same with regard to most of those points in which the
 Protestants and we at present differ; some of them are of little
 or no consequence; others again are more serious; but even in
 these latter, the rage of disputation is so far subsided that the
 Protestants nowadays no longer preach upon controversial points in
 any of their churches.
 
 Let us then seize this period of disgust or satiety for such matters,
 or, rather, indeed, of the prevalence of reason, as an epoch for
 restoring the public tranquillity, of which it seems to be a pleasing
 earnest. Controversy, that epidemical malady, is now in its decline,
 and requires nothing more than a gentle regimen. In a word, it is
 the interest of the state that these wandering sects, who have so
 long lived as aliens to their father’s house, on their returning
 in a submissive and peaceable manner, should meet with a favorable
 reception; humanity seems to demand this, reason advises it, and good
 policy can have nothing to apprehend from it.
 
 
  CHAPTER VI.
  IF NON-TOLERATION IS AGREEABLE TO
  THE LAW OF NATURE AND OF SOCIETY.
 
 The law of nature is that which nature points out to all mankind.
 You have brought up a child, that child owes you a respect as its
 parent, and gratitude as its benefactor. You have a right over the
 productions of the earth which you have raised by the labor of your
 own hands; you have given and received a promise; that promise ought
 to be kept.
 
 The law of society can have no other foundation in any case than on
 the law of nature. “Do not that to another which thou wouldst not he
 should do unto thee,” is the great and universal principle of both
 throughout the earth; now, agreeably to this principle, can one man
 say to another: “Believe that which I believe, and which thou thyself
 canst not believe, or thou shalt die?” And yet this is what is every
 day said in Portugal, in Spain, and in Goa. In some other countries,
 indeed, they now content themselves with saying, “Believe as I do,
 or I will hold thee in abhorrence; believe like me, or I will do
 thee all the evil I can; wretch, thou art not of my religion, and
 therefore thou hast no religion at all, and oughtest to be held in
 execration by thy neighbors, thy city, and thy province.”
 
 If the law of society directs such a conduct, the Japanese ought
 then to hold the Chinese in detestation; the latter the Siamese, who
 should persecute the inhabitants of the Ganges; and they fall upon
 those of India; the Mogul should put to death the first Malabar he
 found in his kingdom; the Malabar should poniard the Persian; the
 Persian massacre the Turk; and, all together, should fall upon us
 Christians, who have so many ages been cutting one another’s throats.
 
 The law of persecution then is equally absurd and barbarous; it is
 the law of tigers; nay, it is even still more savage, for tigers
 destroy only for the sake of food, whereas we have butchered one
 another on account of a sentence or a paragraph.
 
 
  CHAPTER VII.
  IF NON-TOLERATION WAS
  KNOWN AMONG THE GREEKS.
 
 The several nations with which history has made us in part
 acquainted, all considered their different religions as ties by which
 they were united; it was the association of human kind. There was a
 kind of law of hospitality among the gods, the same as among men. If
 a stranger arrived in any town, the first thing he did was to pay his
 adoration to the gods of the country, even though they were the gods
 of his enemies. The Trojans offered up prayers even to those gods who
 fought for the Greeks.
 
 Alexander made a journey into the deserts of Libya, purposely to
 consult the god Ammon, to whom the Greeks gave the name of Zeus and
 the Latins that of Jupiter, though both countries had their Jupiter
 and their Zeus among themselves. When they sat down before any town
 or city, they offered up sacrifices and prayers to the gods of that
 city or town, to render them propitious to their undertaking. Thus,
 even in the midst of war, religion united mankind; and though it
 might sometimes prompt them to exercise the most inhuman cruelties,
 at other times it frequently softened their fury.
 
 I may be mistaken, but it seems to me that not one of all the
 civilized nations of antiquity ever laid a restraint upon liberty
 of thinking. They all had a particular religion; but they seem to
 have acted in this respect toward men in the same manner as they did
 toward their gods; they all acknowledged one Supreme Being, though
 they associated him with an infinite number of inferior deities;
 in like manner, though they had but one faith, yet they admitted a
 multitude of particular systems.
 
 The Greeks, for example, though a very religious people, were not
 offended with the Epicureans, who denied Providence and the existence
 of the soul, not to mention divers other sects, whose tenets were
 all of them repugnant to the pure ideas we ought to entertain of a
 Creator, and yet were all of them tolerated.
 
 Socrates, who came the nearest to the knowledge of the true God,
 is said to have suffered on that account, and died a martyr to
 the Deity; he was the only one whom the Greeks ever put to death
 on account of opinion. If this was really the cause of his being
 condemned, it does very little honor to persecution, since he was put
 to death for being the only one who gave true glory to God, whilst
 those who taught notions the most unworthy of the Deity were held
 in high honor; therefore, I think, the enemies of toleration should
 be cautious how they lay a stress upon the infamous example of his
 judges.
 
 Moreover, it is evident from history that he fell a victim to the
 revenge of an enraged party. He had made himself many inveterate
 enemies among the sophists, orators, and poets, who taught in the
 public schools, and even among the preceptors who had the care of the
 children of distinction. He himself acknowledges in his discourse
 handed down to us by Plato, that he went from house to house to
 convince these preceptors that they were a set of ignorant fellows,
 a conduct certainly unworthy of one who had been declared by an
 oracle the wisest of mankind. A priest and one of the members of the
 Areopagus were let loose upon him, who accused him I cannot precisely
 say of what, as his apology to me seems very vague; from which,
 however, we learn in general that he was charged with inspiring
 the youth of the nation with notions contrary to the religion and
 government of the country, an accusation which the slanderers of all
 times and places have constantly made use of; but a court of justice
 requires positive facts, and that the charge should be circumstantial
 and well supported, none of which are to be found in the proceedings
 against Socrates. All we know is that he had at first two hundred and
 twenty voices for him; therefore there must have been two hundred
 and twenty out of the five hundred judges who were philosophers, a
 great many more, I believe, than are to be found anywhere else. At
 length, however, the majority were for the hemlock potion. But here
 let us not forget, that when the Athenians came to their reason,
 they held both his accusers and judges in detestation; made Melitus,
 who had been the principal author of the sentence pronounced against
 him, pay for that act of injustice with his life; banished all the
 others concerned in it, and erected a temple to Socrates. Never
 was philosophy so nobly avenged, so highly honored. This affair of
 Socrates then is, in fact, the most powerful argument that can be
 alleged against persecution. The Athenians had an altar dedicated to
 the strange gods, gods they could never know. What stronger proof
 then can there be, not only of their extreme indulgence towards all
 nations, but even of their respect for the religion of those nations?
 
 A very worthy person, who is neither an enemy to reason, learning,
 or probity, nor to his country, in undertaking to justify the affair
 of the massacre of St. Bartholomew, quotes the war of the Phocians,
 by them called the sacred war, as if that war had been entered into
 on the score of religion, or a particular point in divinity, whereas
 it is well known that it was caused by a dispute about a particular
 spot of ground, the constant cause of all wars. A few corn-grounds
 can certainly never be a symbol of belief; it is as certain that none
 of the Greek cities ever made war on one another for the sake of
 opinion. After all, what would this modest and humane writer drive
 at? Would he have us undertake a sacred war!
 
 
  CHAPTER VIII.
  WHETHER THE ROMANS
  ENCOURAGED TOLERATION.
 
 Among the ancient Romans, from the days of Romulus to those in which
 the Christians began to dispute with the priests of the empire, we
 do not find a single instance of any person being persecuted on
 account of his sentiments. Cicero doubted everything, Lucretius
 denied everything, and yet neither the one nor the other underwent
 the least reproach from their fellow-citizens; nay, so far did this
 licence go, that Pliny, the naturalist, begins his book by denying
 the existence of a God, and saying, that if there be one, it must be
 the sun. Cicero, in speaking of hell, says: _Non est una tam excors
 quæ credat_ (“There is not even an old woman so silly as to believe
 it”). Juvenal says: _Nec pueri credunt_ (“Nor do the children believe
 it”). And the following maxim was publicly repeated in the Roman
 theatre: _Post mortem nihil est, ipsaque mors nihil_ (“Naught after
 death; even death itself is naught”). While we abhor these maxims,
 let us pardon them in a people who were never enlightened by the holy
 truths of the Gospel; and, while we own them to be false and impious,
 let us, however, confess that the Romans were great friends to
 toleration, seeing that such tenets never excited any commotions.
 
 _Deorum offensa diis curæ_, was the grand principle of the senate and
 people of Rome, that illustrious nation employing their attention
 wholly to conquer, govern and civilize the universe. They were our
 legislators as well as our conquerors; and even Cæsar, who reduced
 us to his subjection, and gave us laws and games, never attempted to
 compel us to quit our Druids for him, though supreme pontiff of a
 nation whose subjects we were now become.
 
 The Romans themselves did not profess all kinds of religion,
 therefore they did not give public sanction to all, but they
 permitted them. Under Numa nothing material was the object of their
 worship. They had neither statues nor pictures; in process of time,
 however, some were erected to the _Dii Majorum Gentium_, with which
 the Greeks brought them into acquaintance. That law in the twelve
 tables, _Deos peregrinos ne colunto_, was confined to the allowing
 no public worship to be paid, except to the superior and inferior
 deities, approved by the senate. The Egyptian goddess Isis had a
 temple in Rome at the time of Tiberius, who demolished it because
 its priests, having been bribed by Mundus, suffered him to lie with
 a lady called Paulina in the temple itself, under the name and form
 of the god Anubis. Indeed this story is to be found only in Josephus,
 who did not live at that time, and was moreover a credulous and
 exaggerating writer; and there is very little probability that
 in so enlightened an age as that of Tiberius, a lady of the first
 distinction in Rome could be so weak as to believe that a god
 cohabited with her.
 
 But whether this anecdote be true or false, this one thing is
 certain, that the Egyptian idolatry was in the possession of a temple
 in Rome with the public consent. The Jews had also lived as traders
 in that city ever since the Punic war; they had their synagogues
 there in the time of Augustus, and almost always continued to have
 them in the same manner as they now have in modern Rome. Can we
 desire a stronger instance that the Romans looked upon toleration as
 the most sacred of all the laws of nations?
 
 We are told that as soon as the Christian religion began to make its
 appearance, its followers were persecuted by these very Romans who
 persecuted no one. This fact, however, appears to me to be evidently
 false, and I desire no better authority than that of St. Paul
 himself. In the Acts of the Apostles[15] we are told that St. Paul,
 being accused by the Jews of attempting to overturn the Mosaic law by
 that of Jesus Christ, St. James proposed to him to shave his head and
 go into the temple with four Jews and purify himself with them, “That
 all men may know,” says he, “that those things whereof they were
 informed concerning thee, are nothing, but that thou thyself dost
 keep the law of Moses.”
 
 Accordingly, we find that St. Paul, though a Christian, submitted
 to perform these Jewish ceremonies for the space of seven days; but
 before the expiration of this time, the Jews of Asia, who knew him
 again, seeing him in the temple, not only with Jews but Gentiles
 also, cried out that he had polluted the holy place, and laid hands
 upon him, drew him out of the temple, and carried him before the
 Governor Felix; they afterwards accused him at the judgment-seat of
 Festus, whither the Jews came in crowds demanding his death. But
 Festus answered them: “It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver
 any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers
 face to face, and have licence to answer for himself.”[16]
 
 These words of the Roman magistrate are the more remarkable as he
 appears to have been no favorer of St. Paul, but rather to have held
 him in contempt, for, imposed upon by the false lights of his own
 reason, he took him for a person beside himself; nay, he expressly
 says to him, “Much learning hath made thee mad.”[17] Festus then was
 entirely guided by the equity of the Roman law in taking under his
 protection a stranger for whom he could have no regard.
 
 Here then we have the word of God itself declaring that the Romans
 were a just people, and no persecutors. Besides, it was not the
 Romans who laid violent hands on St. Paul, but the Jews. St. James,
 the brother of Jesus, was stoned to death by order of a Sadducee Jew,
 and not by that of a Roman judge. It was the Jews alone who put St.
 Stephen to death;[18] and though St. Paul held the clothes of those
 who stoned him, he certainly did not act then as a Roman citizen.
 
 The primitive Christians had certainly no cause of complaint against
 the Romans; the Jews, from whom they at that time began to separate
 themselves, were their only enemies. Every one knows the implacable
 hatred all sectaries bore to those who quit their sect. There
 doubtless were several tumults in the synagogues in Rome. Suetonius,
 in his life of Claudius, has these words, _Judæos impulsore Christo
 assidue tumultuantes Roma expulit_. He is wrong in saying that it
 was at the instigation of Christ they raised commotions in Rome; but
 he could not be acquainted with all the circumstances relating to
 a people who were held in such contempt in Rome as the Jews were;
 and, however mistaken he may have been in this particular, yet he is
 right as to the occasion of these commotions. Suetonius wrote in the
 reign of Adrian in the second century, when the Christians were not
 distinguished from the Jews by the Romans; therefore this passage
 of Suetonius is a proof that the Romans, so far from oppressing the
 primitive Christians, chastised the Jews who persecuted them, being
 desirous that the Jewish synagogue in Rome should show the same
 indulgence to its dissenting brethren as it received itself from
 the Roman Senate; and we find from Dion Cassius and Ulpian, that
 the Jews who were thus banished from Rome returned soon after, and
 even attained to several honors and dignities, notwithstanding the
 laws which excluded them therefrom.[19] Can it be believed, that
 after the destruction of Jerusalem, the emperors would have loaded
 the Jews with their favors, and have persecuted and put to death the
 Christians, whom they looked upon as a sect of the Jews?
 
 Nero is said to have been a great persecutor of the Christians. But
 Tacitus tells us that they were accused of having set fire to the
 city of Rome, and were thereupon given up to the resentment of the
 populace. But had religion anything to do with this charge? No,
 certainly. We might as well say that the Chinese, whom the Dutch
 murdered a few years ago in Batavia, were slaughtered on account of
 their religion. And nothing but a strong desire to deceive ourselves
 can possibly make us attribute to persecution the sufferings of a
 few half-Jews and half-Christians under Nero.[20]
 
 
 
 Several Christians afterwards suffered martyrdom; it is not easy
 to say on what particular account they were condemned, but I can
 venture to assert that none suffered under the first Cæsars merely on
 the account of religion, for they tolerated all beliefs; therefore,
 why should they seek out and persecute an obscure people, who had a
 worship peculiar to themselves, at the time they licensed all others?
 
 The Emperors Titus, Trajan, Antoninus, and Decius were not
 barbarians; how then can we imagine that they would have deprived
 the Christians alone of that liberty with which they indulged every
 other nation, or that they would even have troubled them for having
 concealed mysteries, while the worshippers of Isis, Mithra, and the
 Goddess of Assyria, whose rites were all of them equally unknown
 to the Romans, were suffered to perform them without hindrance?
 Certainly, the persecutions the Christians suffered must have arisen
 from other causes, and from some private pique, enforced by reasons
 of state.
 
 For instance, when St. Laurence refused to deliver to Cornelius
 Secularius, the Roman prefect, the money belonging to the Christians
 which he had in his custody, was it not very natural for the prefect
 and the emperor to be incensed at this refusal? They did not know
 that St. Laurence had distributed this money among the poor, in acts
 of charity and benevolence; therefore they considered him only as a
 refractory person, and punished him accordingly.[21]
 
 Again, let us consider the martyrdom of St. Polyeuctes. Can he be
 said to have suffered on account of religion only? He enters a
 temple, where the people are employed in offering thanksgivings to
 their gods on account of the victory gained by the Emperor Decius;
 he insults the priests and overturns and breaks in pieces the altar
 and statues. Is there a country in the world where so gross an
 insult would have been passed over? The Christian who publicly tore
 the edict of the Emperor Diocletian, and by that act brought on the
 great persecution against his brethren in the two last years of this
 prince’s reign, had not, surely, a zeal according to knowledge, but
 was the unhappy cause of all the disasters that befell his party.
 This inconsiderate zeal, which was often breaking forth, and was
 condemned even by several of the Fathers of the Church, was probably
 the occasion of all those persecutions we read of.
 
 Certainly, I would not make a comparison between the first
 sacramentarians and the primitive Christians, as error should never
 be ranked in the same class with truth, but it is well known that
 Farrel, the predecessor of Calvin, did the very same thing at Arles
 which St. Polyeuctes had done before him in Armenia. The townsmen
 were carrying the statue of St. Anthony, the hermit, in procession
 through the streets; Farrel and some of his followers in a fit of
 zeal fell upon the monks who were carrying the image, beat them, made
 them take to their heels, and, having seized upon St. Anthony, threw
 him into the river. Assuredly Farrel deserved death for this flagrant
 outrage upon the public peace, but he had the good luck to escape by
 flight. Now, had he only told those monks in the open streets that he
 did not believe that a raven had brought half a loaf to St. Anthony,
 nor that this hermit had had conversation with centaurs and satyrs,
 he would have deserved a severe reprimand for troubling the public
 peace; but if the night after the procession he had quietly examined
 the story in his own room, no one could have found any fault with him
 for it.
 
 But, indeed, can we suppose that the Romans, after permitting the
 infamous Antinous to be ranked among their demi-gods, would have
 massacred and thrown to wild beasts those against whom they had no
 other cause of reproach than having peaceably worshipped a just
 Deity? Or would those very Romans, who worshipped a supreme and
 all-powerful God,[22] master of all the subordinate deities, and
 distinguished by the title of _Deus optimus maximus_, would they, I
 say, have persecuted such who professed to worship only one God?
 
 There appears little reason to believe that there ever was an
 inquisition instituted against the Christians under the Roman
 emperors; I mean, that they were ever judicially examined on the
 subject of their faith; neither do we find that Jew, Syrian, Egyptian
 bards, Druids, or philosophers were ever troubled on this account.
 The primitive martyrs then were men who opposed the worship of false
 gods. But, however wise or pious they might be in rejecting the
 belief of such absurd fictions, if, not content with worshipping the
 true God in spirit and in truth, they offered a violent and public
 outrage to the received religion of the government under which they
 lived, however absurd that religion might be, impartiality obliges us
 to confess that they themselves were the first persecutors.
 
 Tertullian, in his Apology,[23] says that the Christians were
 looked upon as a turbulent and seditious sect. This accusation is
 doubtless unjust; but it serves to prove that the civil power did
 not set itself against the Christians purely on account of their
 religion. In another place,[24] he says that the Christians refused
 to adorn the doors of their houses with laurel branches on the days
 of public rejoicing for the victories of the emperors. Now this
 blamable particularity might not, without some reason, be taken for
 disaffection to the government.
 
 The first judicial act of severity we find exercised against
 the Christians was that of Domitian; but this extended only to
 banishment, which did not last above a year, for, says the author
 above quoted, _Facile cœptum repressit restitutis quos ipse
 relegaverat_. Lactantius, so remarkable for his passionate and
 pompous style, acknowledges that from the time of Domitian to that
 of Decius the Church continued in a peaceable and flourishing
 condition. This long tranquillity, says he,[25] was interrupted by
 that execrable animal Decius, who began to oppress the Church: _Post
 multos annos extitit execrabile animal Decius qui vexaret ecclesiam_.
 
 I shall not here enter into a discussion of the opinion of the
 learned Mr. Dodwell concerning the small number of martyrs; but
 if the Romans had been such violent persecutors of the Christian
 religion, if their senate had condemned so many of its innocent
 votaries to perish by the most unheard-of tortures, plunging them
 alive in boiling oil, and exposing their wives and daughters naked
 to the wild beasts in the circus, how happened it that they suffered
 all the first bishops of Rome to live unmolested? St. Ireneus reckons
 only one martyr among all these bishops, namely, Telesphorus, who
 suffered in the year 139 of our vulgar era; nor have we any positive
 proof of this Telesphorus being put to death. Zephirinus governed the
 flock in Rome for eighteen years successively, and died peaceably in
 the year 219. It is true that in the ancient martyrologies we find
 almost all the first popes ranked as martyrs, but the word martyr is
 there taken only in its original and true signification, which is a
 witness and not a sufferer.
 
 Moreover, we can hardly reconcile this rage of persecution with
 the liberty granted the Christians, of assembling no less than
 fifty-six councils in the course of the first three centuries, as is
 acknowledged by all ecclesiastical writers.
 
 That there were persecutions, is doubtless; but if they had been as
 violent as represented, it is hardly probable that Tertullian, who
 wrote with so much energy against the established religion, would
 have been suffered to die peaceably in his bed. It is certain that
 none of the emperors ever read his “Apology,” as an obscure work
 composed in Africa can hardly be supposed to have come into the hands
 of the governors of the world; but then, it might have been shown to
 their proconsuls in Africa, and have drawn down their resentment upon
 the author; nevertheless, we do not find that he suffered martyrdom.
 
 Origen taught the Christian religion publicly in Alexandria, and yet
 was not put to death for it. And this very Origen himself, who spoke
 with so much freedom both to the heathens and the Christians, and
 who, while he taught Jesus to the one, denied the triple Godhead to
 the other, expressly acknowledges, in his third book against Celsus,
 that “There were very few who suffered martyrdom, and those at a
 great distance of time from one another; notwithstanding,” says he,
 “that the Christians leave nothing undone to make their religion
 generally embraced, running from city to city, and from town to town,
 to make converts.”
 
 It must be confessed that these continual peregrinations might
 readily give cause to the priests, who were their enemies, to accuse
 them of a design to raise disturbances; and yet we find that these
 missions were tolerated even among the Egyptians, who have ever
 been a turbulent, factious, and mean people, and who tore a Roman
 to death for having killed a cat; in a word, a nation at all times
 contemptible, whatever may have been said to the contrary by the
 admirers of pyramids.[26]
 
 What person could do more to call down upon him the resentment of
 both ecclesiastical and civil power than St. Gregory Thaumaturgos,
 the disciple of Origen? This same St. Gregory had a vision during
 the night-time, in which an old man appeared to him sent from God,
 accompanied by a woman shining with glory; the first of these was
 St. John the Evangelist, and the other the Holy Virgin. St. John
 dictated to him a creed, which Gregory afterwards went about to
 preach. In his way he passed through Neo-Cæsarea, where the rain
 obliged him to stay all night, and he took up his lodging near a
 temple famous for its oracles. Here he made several signs of the
 cross. The high priest coming the next morning into the temple was
 surprised to find that the oracle did not give its answer as usual,
 upon which he invoked the spirits of the place, who appearing, told
 him that they could no longer inhabit that mansion, as St. Gregory
 had passed a night there and had made signs of the cross, upon
 which the high priest caused Gregory to be seized, who gave him to
 understand that he could drive out or cause to enter the familiar
 spirits wherever he pleased. “If so,” said the high priest, “pray
 send them back here again.” Then St. Gregory, tearing a leaf from a
 little book he held in his hand, wrote these words upon it: “Gregory
 to Satan: I command thee to enter again into this temple.” The paper
 being laid upon the altar, the demons, in obedience to the saint’s
 mandate, gave their oracles that day as usual, after which they
 remained silent.
 
 This story is related by St. Gregory of Nyssa in his life of St.
 Gregory Thaumaturgos. Certainly, the idolatrous priests had great
 reason to be offended with St. Gregory, and might have delivered him
 over to the secular power as one who was their greatest enemy, and
 yet we do not find that they offered him any hurt.
 
 The history of St. Cyprian informs us that he was the first bishop
 of Carthage who suffered martyrdom; this was A. D. 258, consequently
 no bishop of Carthage had been put to death on account of religion
 for a great length of time. The history of this saint does not inform
 us what charge was brought against him, who were his enemies, or how
 he incurred the displeasure of the proconsul of Africa. We find St.
 Cyprian thus writing to Cornelius, bishop of Rome: “There has been
 a tumult of the people lately at Carthage, in which it was twice
 proposed to throw me to the lions.” It might possibly happen that
 the blind resentment of the people of Carthage did at length cause
 Cyprian to be put to death, for, certainly, he was never condemned
 to suffer for his religion by the Emperor Gallus, who lived at so
 great a distance, and, moreover, permitted Cornelius to exercise his
 episcopal function under his very eye.
 
 So many and various are the hidden causes that are frequently blended
 with the apparent one, in the persecution of an individual, that it
 is hardly possible for posterity to discover the true source of the
 misfortunes that befell even the most considerable personages, much
 less that of the sufferings of a private person, hardly known to any
 but those of his own sect.
 
 And here let it be observed that neither St. Gregory Thaumaturgos
 nor St. Denis, bishop of Alexandria, who were both contemporaries of
 St. Cyprian, suffered the slightest persecution. How then happened
 it that, being certainly as well known as the bishop of Carthage,
 they were suffered to live unmolested, while he was delivered over
 to punishment? May we not fairly infer that the one fell a victim to
 personal and powerful enemies, either in consequence of a malicious
 accusation, or from reasons of state, which frequently interfere in
 religious matters, while the other had the good fortune to escape the
 designs of wicked men?
 
 We cannot, with any degree of probability, suppose that the charge
 of being a Christian was the only cause of St. Ignatius being put to
 death, under the just and merciful Trajan, since we find that several
 of his own religion were suffered to accompany and minister comfort
 to him on his way to Rome.[27] There had been frequent seditions
 in Antioch, a city remarkable for the turbulent disposition of
 its inhabitants; here Ignatius privately acted as bishop over the
 Christians. It might happen that some of these disturbances, being
 maliciously imputed to the innocent Christians, had occasioned the
 government to take cognizance of them, and that the judge might have
 been mistaken, as it often happens.
 
 St. Simeon, for example, was accused before King Sapor of being a
 spy to the Romans. The history of his martyrdom tells us that Sapor
 proposed to him to worship the sun, whereas every one knows that the
 Persians paid no divine honors to that planet, but only considered
 it as an emblem of the good principle, the Orasmades, or Sovereign
 Creator, whom they all adored.
 
 Any one of the least tolerating spirit cannot help his indignation
 from rising against those writers who accused Diocletian of
 persecuting the Christians after his accession to the empire. Here
 we need only refer to Eusebius of Cæsarea, whose testimony certainly
 cannot be rejected. The favorite, the panegyrist of Constantine, and
 the declared enemy of the emperors his predecessors, is certainly
 entitled to our credit when he justifies those very emperors. The
 following are his own words:[28]
 
 “The emperors had for a long time given the Christians great marks of
 their favor and benevolence; they had entrusted them with the care
 of whole provinces; many of them lived within the imperial palace;
 and some of the emperors even married Christian women; Diocletian, in
 particular, espoused Prisca, whose daughter was wife to Maximianus
 Galerius,” etc.
 
 Let this authentic testimony make us cautious how we fall too readily
 into calumny; and from this let any impartial person judge, if the
 persecution raised by Galerius, after nineteen years of continued
 clemency and favor to the Christians, must not have been occasioned
 by some intrigues with which we are at present unacquainted.
 
 From this also we may perceive the absurdity of that fabulous story
 of the Theban legion, said to have been all massacred for their
 religion. Can anything be more ridiculous than to make this legion
 be brought from Asia by the great St. Bernard? It is altogether
 impossible that this legion should have been sent for from Asia to
 quiet a tumult in Gaul, a year after that tumult was suppressed,
 and not less so that six thousand foot and seven hundred horse
 should have suffered themselves to be all murdered in a place where
 two hundred men only might have kept off a whole army. The account
 of this pretended butchery is introduced with all the marks of
 imposture: “When the earth groaned under the tyranny of Diocletian,
 heaven was peopled with martyrs.” Now, this event, such as it is
 related, is supposed to have happened in 286, the very time in which
 Diocletian most favored the Christians, and that the Roman Empire
 was in a state of the greatest tranquillity. But to cut short this
 matter at once, no such legion as the Theban ever existed; the Romans
 were too haughty and too wise to form a corps of those Egyptians, who
 served only as slaves in Rome, _Vernæ Canopi_; we may as well suppose
 them to have had a Jewish legion. We have the names of two and thirty
 legions that formed the principal military force of the Roman Empire,
 and it is very certain the Theban legion is not to be found among
 them. In a word, we may rank this story with the acrostic verses of
 the Sibyls, which are said to have foretold the miracles wrought by
 Jesus Christ, and with many other like spurious productions, which
 false zeal has trumped up to impose upon credulity.
 
 
  CHAPTER X.
  THE DANGER OF FALSE LEGENDS AND PERSECUTION.
 
 Mankind has been too long imposed upon by falsehood; it is therefore
 time that we should come to the knowledge of the few truths that can
 be distinguished from amidst the clouds of fiction which cover Roman
 history from the times of Tacitus and Suetonius, and with which the
 annals of the other nations of antiquity have almost always been
 obscured.
 
 Can any one, for example, believe that the Romans, a grave and
 modest people, could have condemned Christian virgins, the children
 of persons of the first quality, to common prostitution? This is
 assuredly very inconsistent with the noble austerity of that nation
 from whom we received our laws, and who punished so rigorously the
 least transgression of chastity in their vestals. These shameful
 stories may indeed be found in the _Actes Sincères_ of Ruinart. But
 should we believe those acts before the “Acts of the Apostles”? The
 _Actes Sincères_ tell us from Bollandus that there were in the city
 of Ancira seven Christian virgins, each of them upwards of seventy,
 whom the governor, Theodectes, ordered to be deflowered by the
 young men of the place; but these poor maidens having escaped this
 disaster—as indeed there was great reason they should—he compelled
 them to assist stark naked at the mysteries of Diana, at which, by
 the way, no one ever assisted but in a veil. St. Theodotus, who,
 though indeed nothing more than an innkeeper, was not the less pious
 for that, besought God devoutly that he would be pleased to take away
 the lives of these holy maidens lest they should yield to temptation.
 God heard his prayer. The governor ordered them all to be thrown into
 a lake with stones about their necks; immediately after which they
 appeared to Theodotus, and begged of him, “that he would not suffer
 their bodies to be devoured by the fishes.” These, it seems, were
 their own words.
 
 Hereupon the innkeeper saint and some of his companions went in the
 night-time to the side of the lake, which was guarded by a party of
 soldiers, a heavenly torch going all the way before, to light them.
 When they came to the place where the guards were posted, they saw
 a heavenly horseman armed cap-a-pie, with a lance in his hand, who
 fell upon the soldiers and dispersed them, while St. Theodotus drew
 the dead bodies of the virgins out of the water. He was afterwards
 carried before the governor, who ordered his head to be struck off,
 without the heavenly horseman interfering to prevent it. However
 disposed we may be to pay all due reverence to the true martyrs of
 our holy religion, we must confess it is very hard to believe the
 story of Bollandus and Ruinart.
 
 Need I add to this the legend of young St. Romanus? Eusebius tells
 us, that having been condemned to be burnt, he was accordingly thrown
 into the fire, when some Jews, who were present, made a mock of
 Jesus Christ, who suffered his followers to be burnt when God had
 delivered Shadrac, Meshach, and Abednego out of the fiery furnace.
 No sooner had the Jews uttered this blasphemy than they beheld St.
 Romanus walking triumphant and unhurt forth from the flaming pile;
 this being reported to the emperor, he gave orders for his being
 pardoned, telling the judge that he would not have an affair upon
 his hands with God—a strange expression for Diocletian! The judge,
 however, notwithstanding the emperor’s clemency, ordered St. Romanus
 to have his tongue cut out; and, though he had executioners at hand,
 commanded the operation to be performed by a surgeon. Young Romanus,
 who had from his birth labored under an impediment of speech, no
 sooner lost his tongue than he spoke distinctly, and with great
 volubility. Upon this, the surgeon received a severe reprimand; when,
 in order to show that he had performed his operation, _secundum
 artem_, he laid hold of a man who was going by, from whom he cut just
 the same portion of tongue as he had done from St. Romanus, on which
 the patient instantly died, for, adds our author very learnedly,
 “Anatomy teaches us that a man cannot live without his tongue.” If
 Eusebius did really write such stuff, and it has not been added by
 some other hand, what degree of credit can we give to his history?
 
 We have the relation of the martyrdom of St. Felicitas and her seven
 children, who are said to have been condemned to death by the wise
 and pious Antoninus, but without giving us the author’s name, who,
 most probably, possessed of more zeal than veracity, had a mind to
 imitate the history of the Maccabees. He begins his relation in the
 following manner: “St. Felicitas was by birth a Roman, and lived in
 the reign of Antoninus.” It is clear by these words that the author
 did not live at the same time with St. Felicitas. He says that they
 were judged before the prætor in the Campus Martius, whereas the
 Roman prefect’s tribunal was not in the Campus Martius, but in the
 Capitol, for, although the Comitia had been held there formerly, yet
 at this time it was used only as a place for reviewing the soldiers,
 for chariot races, and for military games. This alone is sufficient
 to detect the fiction.
 
 The author adds furthermore, that after sentence was passed, the
 emperor committed the care of seeing it executed to different judges,
 a circumstance which is entirely repugnant to the usual forms in
 those times, and in every other.
 
 We also read of St. Hippolytus, who is said to have been drawn in
 pieces by horses, as was Hippolytus, the son of Theseus. But a
 punishment of this kind was not known among the ancient Romans; and
 this fabulous story took its rise wholly from the similitude of names.
 
 And here we may make one observation, that in the multitude of
 martyrologies, composed wholly by the Christians themselves, we
 almost always read of a great number of them coming of their own
 accord into the prison of their condemned brother, following him
 to execution, saving the blood as it flows from him, burying his
 dead body and performing miracles with his relics. Now, if the
 persecution was levelled only at the religion, would not the authors
 of it have destroyed those who thus openly declared themselves
 Christians, administered comfort and assistance to their brethren
 under sentence, and were moreover, charged with working enchantments
 with their inanimate remains? Would they not have treated them as
 we have treated several different sects of Protestants, whom we
 have butchered and burnt by hundreds, without distinction of age or
 sex? Is there amongst all the authenticated accounts of the ancient
 persecutions a single instance like that of St. Bartholomew, and
 the massacre in Ireland? Is there one that comes near to the annual
 festival, which is still celebrated at Toulouse, and which for its
 cruelty deserves to be forever abolished, where the inhabitants of a
 whole city go in procession to return thanks to God, and felicitate
 one another, for having, two hundred years ago, massacred upwards of
 four thousand of their fellow subjects?
 
 With horror I say it, but it is an undoubted truth, that we, who
 call ourselves Christians, have been persecutors, executioners, and
 assassins! And of whom? Of our own brethren. It is we who have razed
 a hundred towns to their foundations with the crucifix or Bible in
 our hands, and who have continually persevered in shedding torrents
 of blood, and lighting the fires of persecution, from the reign of
 Constantine to the time of the religious horrors of the cannibals
 who inhabited the Cévennes; horrors which, praised be God, no longer
 exist.
 
 Indeed, we still see at times some miserable wretches of the more
 distant provinces sent to the gallows on account of religion.
 Since the year 1745 eight persons have been hanged of those called
 predicants or ministers of the gospel, whose only crime was that of
 having prayed to God for their king in bad French, and giving a drop
 of wine, and a morsel of leavened bread, to a few ignorant peasants.
 Nothing of all this is known in Paris, where pleasure engrosses the
 whole attention, and where they are ignorant of everything that
 passes, not only in foreign kingdoms, but even in the more distant
 parts of their own. The trials in these cases frequently take up less
 time than is used to condemn a deserter. The king wants only to be
 informed of this, and he would certainly extend his mercy on such
 occasions.
 
 We do not find that the Roman Catholic priests are treated in this
 manner in any Protestant country: there are above a hundred of
 them,[29] both in England and Ireland, publicly known to be such, and
 who have yet been suffered to live peaceably and unmolested, even
 during the last war.
 
 Shall we then always be the last to adopt the wholesome sentiments
 of other nations? They have corrected their errors, when shall we
 correct ours? It has required sixty years to make us receive the
 demonstrations of the great Newton: we have but just begun to dare
 to save the lives of our children by inoculation, and it is but of
 very late date that we have put in practice the true principles
 of agriculture; when shall we begin to put in practice the true
 principles of humanity, or with what face can we reproach the
 heathens with having made so many martyrs, when we ourselves are
 guilty of the same cruelties in the like circumstances?
 
 Let it be allowed that the Romans put to death a number of Christians
 on account of their religion only: if so, the Romans were highly
 blamable; but shall we commit the same injustice, and while we
 reproach them for their persecutions, be persecutors ourselves?
 
 If there should be any one so destitute of honesty, or so blinded
 with enthusiasm, as to ask me here, why I thus undertake to lay open
 our errors and faults, and to destroy the credit of all our false
 miracles and fictitious legends, which serve to keep alive the zeal
 and piety of many persons; and should such a person tell me that some
 errors are absolutely necessary; that, like ulcers, they give a vent
 to the humors of the body, and by being taken away would compass its
 destruction, thus would I answer him:
 
 “All those false miracles by which you shake the credit due to real
 ones, the numberless absurd legends with which you clog the truths
 of the Gospel, serve only to extinguish the pure flame of religion
 in our hearts.” There are too many persons, who, desirous of being
 instructed, but not having the time for acquiring instruction, say:
 “The teachers of my religion have deceived me, therefore there is no
 religion: it is better to throw myself into the arms of Nature than
 those of Error; and I had rather place my dependence on her law than
 in the inventions of men.” Others again unhappily go still greater
 lengths; they perceive that imposture has put a bridle in their
 mouths, and therefore will not submit even to the necessary curb of
 truth; they incline towards atheism, and run into depravity because
 others have been impostors and persecutors.
 
 Such are undeniably the consequences of pious frauds and
 superstitious fopperies. Mankind in general reason but by halves:
 it is certainly a very vicious way of arguing to say, that because
 the golden legend of Voraginus, and the “Flower of Saints” of the
 Jesuit Ribadeneira, abound in nothing but absurdities, therefore
 there is no God: that the Catholics have massacred a great number
 of Huguenots, and the Huguenots in their turn have murdered a great
 number of Catholics, therefore there is no God: that certain bad men
 have made use of confession, the holy communion, and all the other
 sacraments, as a means for perpetrating the most atrocious crimes,
 and therefore there is no God. For my part, I, on the contrary,
 should conclude from thence that there is a God, who after this
 transitory life, in which we have wandered so far from the true
 knowledge of Him, and have seen so many crimes committed under the
 sanction of His holy name, will at length deign to comfort us for the
 many dreadful calamities we have suffered in this life; for if we
 consider the many religious wars, and the forty papal schisms, which
 have almost all of them been bloody; if we reflect upon the multitude
 of impostures, which have almost all proved fatal; the irreconcilable
 animosities excited by differences in opinions, and the numberless
 evils occasioned by false zeal, I cannot but believe that men have
 for a long time had their hell in this world.
 
 
  CHAPTER XI.
  ILL CONSEQUENCES OF NON-TOLERATION.
 
 What! it may then be demanded, shall every one be allowed to believe
 only his own reason, and to think that his reason, whether true or
 false, should be the guide of his actions? Yes, certainly, provided
 he does not disturb the peace of the community; for man has it not in
 his power to believe or disbelieve;[30] but he has it in his power
 to pay a proper respect to the established customs of his country;
 and if we say that it is a crime not to believe in the established
 religion, we ourselves condemn the primitive Christians, our
 forefathers, and justify those whom we accuse of having put them to
 death.
 
 It may be replied, that the difference here is very great, because
 all other religions are of men, whereas the Catholic, Apostolic,
 and Roman Church is of God alone. But let me seriously ask, whether
 the divine origin of our religion is a reason for establishing it
 by hatred, rage, banishment, confiscation of goods, imprisonment,
 tortures, and murder, and by solemn acts of thanksgiving to the Deity
 for such outrages? The more assured we are of the divine authority of
 the Christian religion, the less does it become weak man to enforce
 the observance of it: if it is truly of God, God will support it
 without man’s assistance. Persecution never makes any but hypocrites
 or rebels; a shocking alternative! Besides, ought we to endeavor to
 establish, by the bloody hand of the executioner, the religion of
 that God who fell by such hands, and who, while on earth, taught only
 mercy and forbearance?
 
 And here let us consider a while, the dreadful consequences of the
 right of non-toleration; if it were permitted us to strip of his
 possessions, to throw into prison, or to take away the life of a
 fellow-creature, who, born under a certain degree of latitude, did
 not profess the generally received religion of that latitude, what
 is there which would exempt the principal persons of the state from
 falling under the like punishments? Religion equally binds the
 monarch and the beggar. Accordingly, we know that upwards of fifty
 doctors or monks have maintained this execrable doctrine: that it
 was lawful to depose, or even to kill, such princes as did not agree
 with the established church; and we also know, that the several
 parliaments of the kingdom have on every occasion condemned these
 abominable decisions of still more abominable divines.[31]
 
 The blood of Henry the Great was still reeking on the sword of his
 murderer, when the Parliament of Paris issued an arret to establish
 the independence of the crown as a fundamental law; whilst Cardinal
 Duperron, who owed his elevation to that prince, opposed this decree
 in an assembly of the states, and got it suppressed. The following
 expression, made use of on this occasion by Duperron, is to be found
 in all the historical tracts of these times: “Should a prince,” says
 he, “turn Arian, it would be necessary to depose him.”
 
 But here I must beg the cardinal’s pardon; for let us for a while
 adopt his chimerical supposition, and say, that one of our kings
 having read the “History of the Councils and of the Fathers,” and
 being struck with these words, “My Father is greater than I,” and
 taking them in too literal a sense, should be divided between the
 Council of Nice and that of Constantinople, and adopt the opinion of
 Eusebius of Nicomedia: yet I should not be the less obliged to obey
 my king, nor think the oath of allegiance I had taken to him less
 binding; and if you, Mr. Cardinal, should dare to oppose him, and
 I were one of your judges, I should, without scruple, declare you
 guilty of high treason.
 
 Duperron carried this dispute much further; but I shall cut it very
 short, by saying with every good citizen, that I should not look upon
 myself as bound to obey Henry IV. because he was king; but because he
 held the crown by the incontestable right of birth, and as the just
 reward of his virtue and magnanimity.
 
 Permit me then to say, that every individual is entitled by the same
 right to enjoy the inheritance of his father, and that he in no wise
 deserves to be deprived of it, or to be sent to the gallows, because
 he may perhaps be of the opinion of Ratram against Paschasius
 Ratberg, or of Berengarius against Scotus.
 
 We are very sensible that there are many of our tenets which have
 not been always clearly explained: Jesus Christ not having expressly
 told us in what manner the Holy Ghost really proceeds, both the Latin
 church and the Greek believed that it proceeded only from the Father;
 but afterwards an article was added to the Creed in which it is said
 to proceed from the Son also. Now, I desire to know whether the day
 after this new article was added a person who might abide by the old
 Creed would have been deserving of death? And is there less cruelty
 or injustice in punishing at this day a person who may possibly think
 as they did two or three centuries ago? Or was there any crime in
 believing in the time of Honorius I. that Christ had not two wills?
 
 It is but very lately that the belief of the immaculate conception
 has been established: the Dominicans have not received it as yet. Now
 will any one tell me the precise point of time when the Dominicans
 will begin to deserve punishment in this world, and in that which is
 to come?
 
 If any one can set us an example for our conduct, it is certainly the
 Apostles and the Evangelists. There was sufficient matter to excite
 a violent schism between St. Peter and St. Paul. The latter, in his
 Epistle to the Galatians,[32] says: “That he withstood Peter to the
 face, because he was to be blamed; for before that certain men came
 from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come,
 he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the
 circumcision, insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with his
 dissimulation.” “But,” adds he, “when I saw that they walked not
 uprightly, according to the truth of the Gospel, I said unto Peter
 before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of
 Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to
 live as do the Jews?”
 
 Here now was a subject for a violent dispute. The question was,
 whether the new Christians followed the manners of the Jews or not.
 St. Paul at that very time sacrificed in the Temple of Jerusalem; and
 we know that the first fifteen bishops of Jerusalem were circumcised
 Jews; and that they observed the Sabbath, and abstained from the
 meats forbidden by the Jewish law. Should a bishop of Spain or
 Portugal at this time be circumcised, or observe the Sabbath, he
 would assuredly burn at an _auto da fé_: and yet this fundamental
 point did not occasion the least animosity between the Apostles, or
 between the primitive Christians.
 
 If the Evangelists had resembled our modern writers, what an immense
 field was there for disputation between them. St. Matthew reckons
 only eight and twenty generations from David to Jesus. St. Luke
 reckons forty-one; and these generations are absolutely different.
 Yet no dissension appears to have arisen between the disciples
 on account of these apparent contradictions, which have been so
 admirably well reconciled by the Fathers of the Church; but they
 still continued in brotherly love, peace, and charity with one
 another. What more noble lesson can we have of indulgence in our
 disputes, and of humility in regard to those things which we do not
 understand?
 
 St. Paul, in his Epistle to certain Jews of Rome who had been
 converted to Christianity, employs all the latter part of his third
 chapter in telling them that by faith alone they will be glorified,
 and that no man is justified by good works only. St. James, on the
 contrary, in the second chapter of his Epistle to the twelve tribes
 dispersed over the earth, is continually preaching up to them, that
 without good works no man can be saved. This has occasioned the
 separation of two great communions amongst us; but it caused no
 division among the Apostles.
 
 If the persecuting of those who differ from us in opinion is a holy
 action, it must be confessed that he who had murdered the greatest
 number of heretics would be the most glorious saint in heaven. If
 so, what a pitiful figure would a man who had only stripped his
 brethren of all they had, and thrown them to rot in a dungeon, make,
 in comparison with the zealot who had butchered his hundreds on the
 famous day of St. Bartholomew? This may be proved as follows:
 
 The successor of St. Peter and his consistory cannot err; they
 approved, they celebrated, they consecrated the action of St.
 Bartholomew; consequently that action was holy and meritorious;
 and, by a like deduction, he who of two murderers, equal in piety,
 had ripped up the bellies of eighty Huguenot women big with child
 would be entitled to double the portion of glory of another who had
 butchered but twelve; in this manner, by the same argument also, the
 enthusiasts of the Cévennes have reason to believe that they will
 be exalted in glory in proportion to the number of Catholic women,
 priests and monks whom they may have knocked on the head: but surely
 these are strange claims to eternal happiness.
 
 
  CHAPTER XII.
  IF NON-TOLERATION WAS PART OF THE DIVINE LAW
  AMONG THE JEWS, AND WHETHER IT WAS ALWAYS
  PUT IN PRACTICE.
 
 By the divine law, I take to be understood those rules and precepts
 which have been given to us by God Himself. For example, he ordained
 that the Jews should eat a lamb dressed with bitter herbs, and
 standing with a staff in their hand, in remembrance of the Passover;
 that the consecration of the high-priest should be performed by
 touching the tip of his right ear, his right hand, and his right foot
 with blood; that the scapegoat should be charged with the sins of the
 people: he also forbade the eating of all shellfish, swine, hares,
 hedgehogs, owls, the heron, and the lapwing.[33]
 
 He also instituted their several feasts and ceremonies; and all those
 things which appeared arbitrary to other nations, and subjected to
 positive law and custom, when commanded by God Himself, became a
 divine law to the Jews, in like manner as whatever Jesus Christ the
 Son of Mary and the Son of God has commanded us is to us a divine law.
 
 But here let us not presume to inquire wherefore it has pleased God
 to substitute a new law in the room of that given to Moses, and
 wherefore He commanded Moses more things than he did the patriarch
 Abraham, and Abraham more than Noah.[34] In this he seems, with
 infinite condescension, to have accommodated himself to times and
 the state of population amongst the inhabitants of the earth; and in
 this gradation, to have shown his paternal love: but these are depths
 too profound for our weak faculties to measure; I shall therefore
 confine myself to my subject, and proceed to examine the state of
 non-toleration among the Jews.
 
 It is certain, that in Exodus, Numbers, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy we
 find several very rigorous laws and severe punishments in relation
 to religious worship. Several able commentators have been greatly
 puzzled to reconcile these books of Moses with several passages in
 the prophets Jeremiah and Amos, and with the famous discourse of
 St. Stephen, as related in the Acts of the Apostles. Amos says that
 the Jews constantly worshipped in the wilderness, Moloch and Chiun,
 gods whom they had made to themselves.[35] And Jeremiah expressly
 says, that God commanded not their fathers concerning burnt-offerings
 or sacrifices in the day that he brought them out of the land of
 Egypt.[36] And St. Stephen, in his discourse to the Jews previously
 mentioned, says: “They worshipped the host of heaven, and that they
 neither offered sacrifices nor slew beasts, for the space of forty
 years in the wilderness, but took up the tabernacle of Moloch and the
 star of their god Remphan.”[37]
 
 Other critics again infer from the worship of so many strange gods
 here mentioned, that the Israelites were indulged with having these
 gods by Moses; and in support of their opinion they quote the
 following words in Deuteronomy: “When ye shall enter into the land
 of Canaan, ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this
 day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.”[38][39]
 
 And as a further proof, they say that there is no mention made of
 any religious act of the people of Israel while in the wilderness;
 neither the celebration of the Passover, nor of the Feast of the
 Tabernacles, nor of any public form of worship being established, nor
 even the practice of circumcision, the seal of the covenant made by
 God with Abraham.
 
 They likewise refer to the history of Joshua, where this great
 conqueror thus addresses the Jews: “If it seem evil unto you to
 serve the Lord, choose you this day whom you will serve; whether
 the gods which your fathers served in Mesopotamia or the gods of
 the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell:” and the people said, “Nay,
 but we will serve the Lord our God (Adonai).” And Joshua said unto
 the people, “Ye have chosen, now therefore put away the strange
 gods which are among you.” Hence, say they, it is evident that the
 Israelites had other gods besides the Lord (Adonai) under Moses.
 
 It is altogether needless to take up the reader’s time with an
 attempt to refute the opinions of those critics who think that
 the Pentateuch was not written by Moses. This subject has been
 sufficiently discussed long ago; and, even admitting that some few
 parts of it were written in the times of the Judges, the Kings, or
 the Prophets, it would not make the whole less inspired or divine.
 It is sufficient, in my opinion, if the Holy Scripture proves to
 us, that, notwithstanding the extraordinary punishments which the
 Jews called down upon themselves by their idolatrous worship of the
 golden calf, they continued for a long time to enjoy perfect liberty
 of conscience; and it is even probable, that Moses, after having
 massacred the twenty-three thousand, in the first transports of his
 rage against his brother and them for having erected this idol,
 finding that nothing was to be gained by such severity in matters of
 religion, was glad to wink at the fondness the people expressed for
 strange gods.
 
 And indeed he himself appears soon after to have transgressed the
 very law which he had given:[40] for, notwithstanding his having
 forbidden all molten or graven images, we find him erecting the
 brazen serpent. And this law was again dispensed with by Solomon
 in the building of his temple; where that prince caused twelve
 brazen bulls to be placed as supporters to the great Laver; as also
 cherubim in the ark, which had two heads, one of an eagle and the
 other of a calf; and it was probable from this latter head, badly
 made, and found in the temple by the Roman soldiers at the time
 of their plundering of it, that the Jews were so long reported to
 have worshipped an ass. Moreover, notwithstanding the repeated
 prohibitions against the worship of false gods, Solomon, though
 giving way to the grossest idolatry, lived and died in peace.
 Jeroboam, to whom God himself gave ten parts out of twelve of the
 kingdom, set up two golden calves, and yet reigned two and twenty
 years, having united in his person the twofold dignity of monarch and
 of high-priest. The petty people of Judæa erected altars and images
 to strange gods under Rehoboam. Pious King Aza suffered the high
 places to remain undemolished. And lastly, Uriah, the high-priest,
 erected a brazen altar, which had been sent to him by the king of
 Syria, in the temple, in the place of the altar of burnt-offerings.
 In a word, we do not anywhere find the least constraint in point of
 religion among the Jews; it is true, indeed, that they frequently
 destroyed and murdered one another; but that was from motives of
 political concern, and not about the modes of belief. It is true,
 that among the prophets we find some making heaven a party in their
 vengeance. Elias, for instance, calls down fire from heaven to
 consume the priests of Baal. And Elisha sent bears to devour two and
 forty little children for calling him baldhead. But these miracles
 are very rare in their kind, and it would moreover be somewhat
 inhuman to desire to imitate them. We are also told that the Jews
 were a most ignorant and cruel people; and that in their war with
 the Midianites[41] they were commanded by Moses to kill all the
 male children and all the child-bearing women, and to divide the
 spoil.[42] They found in the enemy’s camp 675,000 sheep, 72,000
 oxen, 61,000 asses, and 32,000 young maidens, and they took all the
 spoil and slew the captives. Several commentators will have it, that
 thirty-two of the young women were sacrificed to the Lord. “The
 Lord’s tribute was thirty and two persons.”[43]
 
 It is evident that the Jews offered human sacrifices to God; witness
 that of Jephthah’s daughter,[44] and of King Agag hewed in pieces by
 the prophet Samuel.[45] And we find the prophet Ezekiel promising
 them, by way of encouragement, that they should feast upon human
 flesh: “Ye shall eat of the flesh of the horse, and of his rider,
 and ye shall drink the blood of the princes of the earth.”[46] But
 although the history of this people does not furnish us with one
 single act of generosity, magnanimity, or humanity, yet amidst so
 long and dismal a night of barbarism, there is continually breaking
 forth a cheering ray of universal toleration.
 
 Jephthah, who was inspired of God, and who sacrificed to him his
 daughter, says to the chief of the Amorites, “Wilt not thou possess
 that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? so whomsoever the
 Lord our God shall drive from before us, them will we possess.”[47]
 This declaration is express, and might be carried to a great length;
 however, it is at least an evident proof that God permitted the
 worship of Chemosh. For the words of the Holy Scripture are not
 “_Thou thinkest_ thou hast a right to possess that which thy god
 Chemosh giveth thee to possess,” but expressly, “_Thou hast_ a right
 to possess,” etc., for that is the true interpretation of the Hebrew
 words _Otho thirasch_.
 
 The story of Micah and the Levite, related in the seventeenth
 and eighteenth chapters of the Book of Judges, is a still more
 incontestable proof of this extensive toleration and liberty of
 conscience allowed among the Jews. The mother of Micah having lost
 eleven hundred shekels of silver, and her son having restored them to
 her, she dedicated or vowed them unto the Lord, and made images with
 them, and she built a small chapel and hired a Levite to officiate
 therein for ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel
 and his victuals. Then said Micah: “Now know I that the Lord will do
 me good, seeing that I have a Levite to be my priest.”[48]
 
 In a short time after, six hundred men of the tribe of Dan, who
 were in search of some town which they might seize upon as an
 inheritance to dwell in, came to the house of Micah, where they
 found the Levite officiating; and having no priest of their own with
 them, and thinking that on that account God would not prosper their
 undertaking, they seized upon the carved image, the ephod, and the
 teraphim belonging to Micah, and also the Levite, whom they took
 with them in spite of all the remonstrances of the latter, and the
 outcries of Micah and his mother. After this, full of assurance of
 success, they went and fell upon the city of Laish, and smote all
 the inhabitants with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city to
 the ground, as was their usual custom; they then built them another
 city, and called its name Dan,[49] in remembrance of their victory;
 and they set up Micah’s graven image; and what is more remarkable,
 Jonathan, the grandson of Moses, was a priest of the temple, wherein
 the God of Israel and the idol of Micah were both worshipped at the
 same time.[50]
 
 After the death of Gideon, the Israelites worshipped Baal-Perith
 for upwards of twenty years, and abandoned the worship of the true
 God, without any punishment being inflicted upon them for it, either
 by their chiefs, their judges, or their priests. This, I must
 confess, was a very heinous crime; but then, if even this idolatry
 was tolerated, how great must have been the differences of the true
 worship?
 
 There are some persons, who, in support of non-toleration, bring us
 the authority of God Himself; who, having suffered His ark to fall
 into the hands of the Philistines in the day of battle, punished
 them only by afflicting them with an inward distemper, resembling
 the hæmorrhoids or piles, by breaking in pieces the statue of their
 god Dagon, and by sending a number of rats to devour the fruits of
 their lands. But when the Philistines, in order to appease his wrath,
 sent back the ark drawn by two cows that gave milk to their calves,
 and made an offering to the Lord of five golden rats, and the like
 number of golden hæmorrhoids, the Lord smote seventy of the Elders of
 Israel, and fifty thousand of the people, for having looked upon the
 ark. To this it may be answered, that the judgment of God was not, on
 this occasion, directed against any particular belief, any difference
 in worship, or idolatry.
 
 If God had meant to punish idolatry, He would have destroyed all the
 Philistines who had attempted to seize upon His ark, and who were
 worshippers of the idol Dagon; whereas, we find Him smiting with
 death fifty thousand and seventy of His own people, for having looked
 upon His ark, which they ought not to have looked upon. So much did
 the laws and manners of those times and the Jewish dispensation
 differ from everything that we know, and so inscrutable are the ways
 of God to us! “The rigorous punishment,” says the learned Doctor
 Calmet, “inflicted on such a multitude of persons on this occasion,
 will appear excessive only to those who do not comprehend how greatly
 God would have Himself feared and respected among His chosen people,
 and who judge of the ways and designs of Providence only by the weak
 lights of their own reason.”
 
 Here then God punished the Israelites, not for any strange worship,
 but for a profanation of His own; an indiscreet curiosity, a
 disobedience of His precepts, and perhaps an inward rebellious
 spirit. It is true, that such punishments appertain alone to the God
 of the Hebrews, and we cannot too often repeat, that those times and
 manners were altogether different from ours.
 
 Again, we find, some ages after, when the idolatrous Naaman asked of
 Elijah if he might be allowed to follow his king up to the temple of
 Rimmon, and bow down himself there with him; this very Elijah,[51]
 who had before caused the little children to be devoured by bears
 only for mocking him, answered this idolater, “Go in peace.”
 
 But this is not all; we find the Lord commanding Jeremiah to make
 him bonds and yokes, saying: “Put them upon thy neck,[52] and send
 them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of
 the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon,”
 and he did so, bidding the messenger say to them in the name of the
 Lord: “I have given all your lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar,
 king of Babylon, my servant.”[53] Here then we have God declaring an
 idolatrous prince his servant and favorite.
 
 The same prophet having been cast into the dungeon by order of the
 Jewish king Zedekiah, and afterwards released by him, advises him in
 the name of God to submit himself to the king of Babylon, saying:
 “If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon’s princes,
 thy soul shall live.” God therefore takes part with an idolatrous
 king, and delivers into his hands His holy ark, the looking upon
 which only had cost the lives of fifty thousand and seventy Jews;
 and not only so, but also delivers up to him the Holy of Holies,
 together with the rest of the temple, the building of which had cost
 a hundred and eight thousand talents of gold, one million seventeen
 thousand talents of silver, and ten thousand drachmas of gold, that
 had been left by David and his great officers for building the house
 of the Lord; which, exclusive of the sums expended for that purpose
 by King Solomon, amounts to the sum of nineteen milliards, sixty-two
 millions, or thereabouts, of the present currency. Never, surely,
 was idolatry so nobly rewarded. I am sensible that this account
 is exaggerated, and that it seems to be an error of the copyist.
 But if we reduce the sum to one half, to a fourth, or even to an
 eighth part, it will still be amazing. But Herodotus’s account of
 the treasures which he himself saw in the temple of Ephesus is not
 less surprising. In fine, all the riches of the earth are as nothing
 in the sight of God; and the title of _my servant_, with which he
 dignified Nebuchadnezzar, is the true and invaluable treasure.
 
 Nor does God show less favor to Kir, or Koresh whom we call Cyrus,
 and whom He calls His _Christ_, His _anointed_, though he never
 was anointed according to the general acceptation of that word,
 and was moreover a follower of the religion of Zoroaster, and a
 usurper in the opinion of the rest of mankind; yet him He calls His
 _shepherd_;[54] and we have not in the whole sacred writings so great
 an instance of divine predilection.
 
 We are told by the prophet Malachi, that, “from the rising of the
 sun even unto the going down of the same, the name of God shall be
 great among the Gentiles; and in every place a pure offering shall be
 offered unto his name.”[55] God takes as much care of the idolatrous
 Ninevites as of His chosen Jews. Melchizedek, though no Jew, was
 the high-priest of the living God. Balaam, though an idolater, was
 His prophet. The Holy Scripture then teaches us, that God not only
 tolerated every other religion, but also extended His fatherly care
 to them all. And shall we, after this, dare to be persecutors?
 
 
 
 Thus, then, under Moses, the Judges, and the Kings, we find
 numberless instances of toleration. Moreover, we are told by Moses,
 that “God will visit the sins of the fathers upon the children,
 unto the third and fourth generation.” This threat was necessary to
 a people to whom God had not revealed the immortality of the soul,
 and the rewards and punishment of a future state. These truths are
 not to be found in any part of the decalogue, nor in the Levitic or
 Deuteronomic law. They were the tenets of the Persians, Babylonians,
 Egyptians, Greeks, and Cretans, but made no part of the Jewish
 religion. Moses does not say, “Honor thy father and thy mother,
 that thou mayest inherit _eternal_ life,” but “that thy days may be
 long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee”; that is, in
 this life; and the punishments with which he threatens them regard
 only the present mortal state; such as being smitten with the scab
 and with the itch, with blasting and with mildew; that they shall
 betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her; that they shall
 build houses, and others shall dwell therein; that they shall plant
 vineyards, and shall not gather the grapes thereof; that they shall
 eat the fruit of their own bodies, the flesh of their sons and of
 their daughters, and be obliged to bow down before the stranger
 that is within their gates;[56] but he never tells them that their
 souls are immortal, and shall taste of felicity or punishment after
 death. God, who conducted His people Himself, punished or rewarded
 them immediately according to their good or evil deeds. Everything
 relating to them was temporal, and this the learned Bishop Warburton
 brings as a proof of the divine origin of the Jewish law;[57]
 “inasmuch,” says he, “as God being their King, and exercising
 justice immediately upon them, according to their transgression or
 obedience, found it not necessary to reveal to them a doctrine which
 He reserved for after-times, when He should no longer so directly
 govern His people.” Those who through ignorance pretend that Moses
 taught the immortality of the soul, deprive the New Testament of
 one of its principal advantages over the Old. It is certain that
 the law of Moses taught only temporal punishments, extending to the
 fourth generation; and yet, notwithstanding the positive declaration
 of God delivered in this law, Ezekiel preached the very contrary to
 the Jews, telling them, “The son shall not bear the iniquities of
 the father;”[58][59] and in another place he goes so far as to make
 God say that “He had given them statutes that were not good, and
 judgments whereby they should not live.”[60]
 
 Notwithstanding these contradictions, the book of Ezekiel was not
 the less admitted into the number of those inspired writers: It is
 true, that according to St. Jerome, the synagogue did not permit the
 reading of it till after thirteen years of age; but that was for fear
 their youth should make a bad use of the too lively description, in
 the sixteenth and twenty-third chapters, of the whoredoms of Aholah
 and Aholibah.
 
 But when the immortality of the soul came to be a received
 doctrine,[61] which was probably about the beginning of the
 Babylonish captivity, the sect of Sadducees still continued to
 believe that there were no rewards or punishments after death, and
 that the faculties of the soul perished with us in like manner
 as those of the body. They also denied the existence of angels.
 In a word, they differed much more from the other Jews than the
 Protestants do from the Catholics; nevertheless, they lived in
 peaceable communion with their brethren; and some of their sect were
 admitted to the high-priesthood.
 
 The Pharisees held fatality or predestination,[62] and believed in
 the Metempsychosis;[63] the Essenians thought that the souls of
 the just went into some happy islands,[64] and those of the wicked
 into a kind of Tartarus, or hell. They offered no sacrifices, and
 assembled together in particular synagogues of their own. In a word,
 if we examine closely into the Jewish economy, we shall be surprised
 to find the most extensive toleration prevailing amidst the most
 shocking barbarities. This is indeed a contradiction, but almost all
 people have been governed by contradictions. Happy are those whose
 manners are mild, while their laws are bloody!
 
 
 
 Let us now see whether Christ established sanguinary laws, whether He
 enjoined non-toleration, instituted the horrors of the inquisition,
 or the butchery of an _auto da fé_.
 
 There are, unless I am much mistaken, very few passages in the New
 Testament from which the spirit of persecution can have inferred that
 tyranny and constraint in religious matters are permitted: one is
 the parable wherein the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain
 king who made a marriage for his son, and sent forth his servants to
 invite guests to the wedding, saying, “Tell them which were bidden,
 my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready; come
 unto the marriage.”[65] But those who were bidden made light of the
 invitation, one going to his farm and another to his business, and
 the rest of them took the king’s servants and slew them. Upon which
 he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burnt up
 their city. After this he sent out into the highways to invite all
 that could be found to come to the marriage; but one of the guests
 happening to sit down to table without a wedding garment, the king
 ordered him to be bound hand and foot and cast into outer darkness.
 
 But it is clear that this allegory relates only to the kingdom of
 heaven; therefore, assuredly no man can assume a right from thence
 to fetter or imprison his neighbor who should come to dine with
 him without being properly dressed; nor do I believe that history
 furnishes us with any instance of a prince causing one of his
 courtiers to be hanged upon such an occasion; and there is little
 reason to apprehend that when the emperor sent his pages to any of
 the princes of the empire to invite them to an entertainment those
 princes would fall upon the pages and kill them.
 
 The invitation to the marriage feast is a type of the preaching of
 the gospel, and the murder of the king’s servants is figurative of
 the persecution of those who preach wisdom and virtue.
 
 The other parable is that of a private person who made a great
 supper, to which he invited many of his friends,[66] and when he was
 ready to sit down to table sent his servants to tell them that all
 things were ready; but one excused himself by saying that he had
 bought a piece of ground and must needs go and see it, an excuse
 which was not admissible, as no one goes to visit their lands in the
 night-time; another said he had bought five yoke of oxen and was
 going to prove them; he was as much to blame as the other, since
 no one would go to prove oxen at supper-time; the third said he
 had married a wife and could not come; this last was certainly a
 very good excuse. The master of the house being very angry at this
 disappointment, told his servants to go into the streets and lanes
 of the city and bring in the poor, and the maimed, the halt and the
 blind; this being done, and finding that there was yet room, he said
 unto his servant, “Go out into the highways and hedges and compel
 them (that you find) to come in.”
 
 It is true that we are not expressly told that this parable is a type
 of the kingdom of heaven, and the words “compel them to come in” have
 been perverted to very bad purposes; but it is very evident that
 one single servant could not _forcibly_ compel every person he met
 to come and sup with his master; besides, the company of people so
 compelled would not have made the supper very agreeable. “Compel them
 to come in,” therefore, means nothing more, according to commentators
 of the best reputation, than pray, desire, press them to come in;
 therefore, what connection, for heaven’s sake, can prayers and
 invitations have with persecution?
 
 But to take things in a literal sense, is it necessary to be maimed,
 halt, and blind, or to be compelled by force to enter into the bosom
 of the Church? Christ says in the same parable: “When thou makest a
 dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy
 rich kinsmen”; but did any one ever infer from this that we should
 never dine or sup with our friends or kinsmen if they happen to be
 worth money?
 
 Our Saviour, after this parable of the feast, says: “If any man come
 to me, and hate not his father and mother, his wife and children,
 his brethren and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be
 my disciple,” etc. But is there any person living so unnatural as to
 conclude from this that he ought to hate his father and mother and
 his nearest relations? And is it not evident to one of the meanest
 capacity that the true interpretation of these words is: hesitate not
 between me and your dearest affections?
 
 The following passage in the eighth chapter of St. Matthew is also
 quoted: “Whosoever heareth not the word of God shall be like to
 an heathen, and like one who sitteth at the receipt of custom”;
 but certainly this is not saying that we ought to persecute all
 unbelievers and custom-house officers; they are frequently cursed
 indeed, but they are not delivered up to the arm of secular power.
 And so far from depriving the latter of any part of the prerogatives
 of citizens, they are indulged with the greatest privileges; and
 though their profession is the only one condemned in Scripture, it
 is of all others the most protected and favored by every government.
 Why then should we not show some indulgence to our brethren who
 are unbelievers, while we load with benefits our brethren the
 tax-gatherers?
 
 Another passage which has been grossly abused is that in St. Matthew
 and St. Mark, where we are told that Jesus being hungry in the
 morning, and coming to a fig tree which had no leaves—for it was not
 the time of figs—Jesus cursed the tree and it immediately dried up.
 
 This miracle has been explained in several different ways, but not
 one of them appears to authorize persecution. Though a fig tree
 could not be expected to bear fruit in the beginning of March, yet
 we find it blasted; but is that a reason why we should blast our
 brethren with affliction in all seasons of the year? When we meet
 with anything in holy writing that may occasion doubts in our vain
 and inquisitive minds, we should pay it all due reverence, but let us
 not make use of it to countenance cruelty and persecution.
 
 The spirit of persecution which perverts everything has also strained
 in its own vindication the story of Christ driving the buyers and
 sellers out of the temple, and that of his sending a legion of
 devils out of the body of the man possessed with an evil spirit
 into two thousand unclean animals; but cannot any one perceive that
 these two instances were no other than acts of justice, which God
 Himself deigned to execute for a contravention of His law? It was
 a disrespect shown to the house of the Lord to change His dwelling
 into a market for buyers and sellers. And although the Sanhedrim and
 its priests might permit this traffic for the greater convenience of
 their sacrifices, yet the God to whom these sacrifices were offered
 might, doubtless, though under a human shape, overturn this profane
 practice. In the same manner might He punish those who brought into
 the country whole troops of those animals which were prohibited by
 the law of which He Himself deigned to be an observer. These two
 examples, then, have not the least connection with persecution for
 religion’s sake; and the spirit of non-toleration must certainly be
 founded upon very false principles when it everywhere seeks such idle
 pretexts.
 
 Christ, in almost every other part of His gospel, both by His words
 and actions, preaches mildness, forbearance and indulgence. Witness
 the father who receives his prodigal son, and the workman who comes
 at the last hour and yet is paid as much as the others; witness the
 charitable Samaritan, and Christ Himself, who excuses His disciples
 for not fasting, who pardons the woman who had sinned, and only
 recommends fidelity for the future to the woman caught in adultery.
 He even condescends to partake of the innocent mirth of those who
 have met at the marriage feast in Cana, and who being already warmed
 with wine and wanting still more, Christ is pleased to perform a
 miracle in their favor by changing their water into wine. He is not
 even incensed against Judas, whom He knew to be about to betray Him;
 He commands Peter never to make use of the sword, and reprimands
 the sons of Zebedee, who, after the example of Elias, wanted to
 call down fire from heaven to consume a town in which they had been
 refused a lodging. In a word, He Himself died a victim to malice
 and persecution; and, if one might dare to compare God with a mortal
 and sacred things with profane, His death, humanly speaking, had a
 great resemblance to that of Socrates. The Greek philosopher suffered
 for the hatred of the sophists, the priests and the heads of the
 people; the Christian Law-giver, by that of the Scribes, Pharisees
 and priests. Socrates might have avoided death, but would not;
 Christ offered Himself a voluntary sacrifice. The Greek philosopher
 not only pardoned his false accusers and iniquitous judges, he even
 desired them to treat his children as they had done himself, should
 they, like him, one day be happy enough to deserve their hatred. The
 Christian Law-giver, infinitely superior to the heathen, besought
 His Father to forgive His enemies. If Christ seemed to fear death,
 and if the agonies He was in at its approach drew from Him sweat
 mixed with blood, which is the most violent and rare of all symptoms,
 it was because He condescended to submit to every weakness of the
 human frame, which He had taken upon Him; His body trembled, but His
 soul was unshaken. By His example we may learn that true fortitude
 and greatness consist in supporting those evils at which our nature
 shrinks. It is the height of courage to meet death at the same time
 that we fear it.
 
 Socrates accused the sophists of ignorance and convicted them of
 falsehood; Jesus, in His godlike character, accused the Scribes and
 Pharisees of being hypocrites, blind guides and fools, and a race of
 vipers and serpents.
 
 Socrates was not accused of attempting to found a new sect, nor was
 Christ charged with endeavoring to introduce a new one. We are told
 in St. Matthew that the great men and the priests and all the council
 sought false witness against Jesus to put Him to death.
 
 Now, if they were obliged to seek for false witnesses, they could
 not charge Him with having preached openly against the law; besides,
 it was evident that He complied in every respect with the Mosaic law
 from His birth to His death. He was circumcised the eighth day like
 other Jewish children; He was baptized in Jordan, agreeable to a
 ceremony held sacred among the Jews and among all the other people
 of the east. All impurities of the law were cleansed by baptism; it
 was in this manner their priests were consecrated at the solemn feast
 of the expiation, every one plunged himself in the water, and all
 new-made proselytes underwent the same ceremony.
 
 Moreover, Jesus observed all the points of the law; He feasted every
 Sabbath day, and He abstained from forbidden meats; He kept all
 the festivals, and even before His death He celebrated that of the
 Passover; He was not accused of embracing any new opinion, nor of
 observing any strange rites. Born an Israelite, He always lived as an
 Israelite.
 
 He was accused, indeed, by two witnesses of having said that He
 could destroy the Temple and build it up again in three days; a
 speech altogether unintelligible to the carnal Jews, but which did
 not amount to an accusation of seeking to found a new sect.
 
 When He was examined before the high priest, this latter said to him:
 “I command you, in the name of the living God, to tell us if Thou
 art Christ, the Son of God.” We are not told what the high priest
 meant by the Son of God. This expression was sometimes made use of to
 signify a just or upright man,[67] in the same manner as the words
 son of Belial, to signify a wicked person. The carnal Jews had no
 idea of the sacred mystery of the Son of God, God Himself coming upon
 earth.
 
 Jesus answered the high priest, “thou hast said; nevertheless, I say
 unto you, hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right
 hand of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of heaven.”[68]
 
 This answer was looked upon by the whole assembly as a blasphemy.
 But the Sanhedrim having no longer the power of life and death, they
 falsely accused Jesus before the Roman governor of the province of
 being a disturber of the public peace, and one who, said they, should
 not pay tribute to Cæsar; and, moreover, called Himself King of the
 Jews. It is therefore incontestably evident that he was accused of a
 crime against the state.
 
 Pilate being informed that He was a Galilean, sent Him immediately to
 Herod, the tetrarch of Galilee. This latter, thinking it impossible
 that a person of Jesus’ appearance should pretend to be the head
 of a party, or aspire to royalty, treated Him with great contempt,
 and sent Him back again to Pilate, who had the infamous weakness to
 condemn Him to death as the only means to appease the tumult raised
 against himself; more especially as he had lately experienced the
 revolt of the Jews, as we are told by Josephus. On this occasion
 Pilate did not show the same generosity which the governor Festus did
 afterwards.
 
 I now desire to know whether toleration or non-toleration appears to
 be of divine prescription? Let those who would resemble Christ be
 martyrs and not executioners.
 
 
  CHAPTER XV.
  TESTIMONIES AGAINST PERSECUTION.
 
 It is an impious act to deprive men of liberty in matters of
 religion, or prevent them from making choice of a God. No God nor man
 would be pleased with a forced service.—_Apologetic_, chap. xxiv.
 
 Were violence to be used in defence of the faith, the bishops would
 oppose it.—_St. Hilarius_, lib. i.
 
 Religion when forced ceases to be religion; we should persuade and
 not compel. Religion cannot be commanded.—_Lactantius_, lib. iii.
 
 It is detestable heresy to endeavor to bring over by violence,
 bodily punishments, or imprisonments, those we cannot convince by
 reasoning.—_St. Athanasius_, lib. i.
 
 Nothing is more contradictory to true religion than constraint.—_St.
 Justin, Martyr_, lib. v.
 
 Is it for us to persecute those whom God tolerates? said St.
 Augustine, before his dispute with the Donatists had soured his
 disposition.
 
 Let no violence be done to the Jews.—_The 56th Canon of the 4th
 Council of Toledo._
 
 Advise but compel not.—_St. Bernard’s Letters._
 
 We do not pretend to overcome error by violence.—_Speech of the
 Clergy of France to Louis XIV._
 
 We have always disapproved of rigorous measures.—_Assembly of the
 Clergy, August 11, 1560._
 
 We know that faith may yield to persuasion, but it never will be
 controlled.—_Fléchier, Bishop of Nîmes, Letter, 19._
 
 We ought to abstain even from reproachful speeches.—_Bishop of
 Belley’s Pastoral Letters._
 
 Remember that the diseases of the soul are not to be cured by
 restraint and violence.—_Cardinal Camus’ Pastoral Instructions for
 the Year 1688._
 
 Indulge every one with civil toleration—_Archbishop Fénelon to the
 Duke of Burgundy._
 
 Compulsion in religion proves the spirit which dictates it to be an
 enemy to truth.—_Dirois, a Doctor of the Sorbonne_, b. vi. chap. iv.
 
 Compulsion may make hypocrites, but never can persuade.—_Tillemont’s
 Hist. Eccles._ tom. vi.
 
 We have thought it conformable to equity and right reason to walk
 in the paths of the ancient church which never used violence to
 establish or extend religion.—_Remonstrance of the Parliament of
 Paris to Henry II._
 
 Experience teaches us that violence is more likely to irritate than
 to cure a distemper which is seated in the mind.—_De Thou’s Epistle
 Dedicatory to Henry IV._
 
 Faith is not inspired by the edge of the sword.—_Cerisier, in the
 Reigns of Henry IV. and Louis XIII._
 
 It is a barbarous zeal which pretends to force any religion upon
 the mind, as if persuasion could be produced by constraint.—
 _Boulainvillier’s State of France._
 
 It is with religion as with love; command can do nothing, constraint
 still less; nothing is so independent as love and belief.—_Amelot de
 la Houssaye on Cardinal Ossat’s Letters._
 
 If Providence has been so kind to you as to give you a knowledge
 of the truth, receive it as an instance of His great goodness; but
 should those who enjoy the inheritance of their father hate those who
 do not?—_Spirit of Laws_, book xxv.
 
 One might compose an immense volume of such passages. All our
 histories, discourses, sermons, moral treatises and catechisms of
 the present time abound with and inculcate this holy doctrine of
 indulgence. What fatality, what false reason, then, leads us to
 contradict by our practice the theory we are every day teaching? When
 our actions give the lie to our morals it must certainly proceed from
 our thinking it to our interest to practise the contrary of what we
 teach; but what advantage can arise from persecuting those who do not
 think in the same manner as we do, and thereby making ourselves hated
 by them? Once more, then, let me repeat it; there is the highest
 absurdity in persecution. It may be replied that those who found it
 to their interest to lay a restraint upon the consciences of others
 are not absurd in so doing. To such men I address the following
 chapter.
 
 
  CHAPTER XVI.
  A CONVERSATION BETWEEN
  A DYING MAN AND ONE IN
  GOOD HEALTH.
 
 An inhabitant of a country village lying at the point of death was
 visited by a person in good health, who came to insult him in his
 last moments, with the following speech:
 
 “Wretch that thou art, think as I do this instant, sign this writing
 immediately, confess that five propositions are to be found in a
 book that neither thou nor I have ever read; adopt immediately the
 opinion of Lanfranc against Berengarius, and of St. Thomas against
 St. Bonaventura; join with the Council of Nice against the Council of
 Frankfort, and explain to me out of hand how the words ‘My Father is
 greater than I’ signify exactly ‘I am as great as He.’ Tell me also
 in what manner the Father communicates all His attributes to the Son,
 excepting the fatherhood, or I will have thy body thrown to the fowls
 of the air, thy children deprived of their inheritance, thy wife of
 her dowry and thy family turned out to beg their bread, which shall
 be refused them by those who are like myself.”
 
 DYING MAN.—I scarcely understand what you say; your threats strike
 my ears confusedly, they trouble my mind and render my last moments
 terrifying. In the name of God have pity on me!
 
 CRUEL MAN.—Pity! I can have none for thee, unless thou art exactly of
 my opinion.
 
 DYING MAN.—Alas! you must be sensible that in these, my last moments,
 my senses are all impaired, the doors of my understanding are shut,
 my ideas are lost in confusion and I have hardly any sentiments
 remaining. Am I then in a condition to dispute?
 
 CRUEL MAN.—Well, then, if thou canst not believe as I would have
 thee, only say that you do, and that will content me.
 
 DYING MAN.—How! Would you have me perjure myself to please you, when
 I am going in an instant to appear before the judgment seat of that
 God who is the avenger of perjury?
 
 CRUEL MAN.—No matter; thou wilt have the pleasure to be interred
 in holy ground, and thy wife and children will have wherewithal to
 maintain them after thy death. Die a hypocrite; hypocrisy is a very
 good thing; I have heard say it is the homage which vice pays to
 virtue. A little hypocrisy, friend, can’t cost you much.
 
 DYING MAN.—Surely you must either not acknowledge a God, or hold Him
 very cheap, since you require me to tell a lie with my last breath,
 when you yourself must soon appear in judgment before Him and answer
 for that lie.
 
 CRUEL MAN.—Insolent wretch! Dost thou say that I do not acknowledge a
 God?
 
 DYING MAN.—Pardon me, brother; I rather fear you do not know Him. The
 God whom I adore lends me at this time an increase of strength to
 tell you with my dying words that if you believe in Him you ought to
 behave toward me with charity. He has given me my wife and children;
 do not you make them perish with misery. As for my body, do with it
 as seems good to you; I leave it at your disposal; but let me conjure
 you to believe in God.
 
 CRUEL MAN.—Come, come; truce with your reasoning, and do as I bid
 you; I will have it so. I command you to do it.
 
 DYING MAN.—But what advantage can you have in thus tormenting me?
 
 CRUEL MAN.—What advantage? Why, if I can make you sign, it will be
 worth a good canonship to me.
 
 DYING MAN.—Ah! brother; my last moment approaches; I am expiring, but
 I will pray to God to touch your heart that you may be converted.
 
 CRUEL MAN.—The devil take the impertinent puppy; he has not signed
 after all! Well, I’ll e’en sign for him; it is but a little forgery.
 
 The following letter is a confirmation of the above doctrine:
 
 
  CHAPTER XVII.
  A LETTER FROM A BENEFICED PRIEST
  TO FATHER LETELLIER, THE JESUIT,
  DATED THE 6th OF MAY, 1714.
 
 Reverend Father: The following is in obedience to the orders I
 received from your reverence to lay before you the most effectual
 means for delivering Jesus and His company from their enemies.
 
 I believe there may be remaining at this time in the kingdom not more
 than five hundred thousand Huguenots; some say a million, others a
 million and a half; but let the number be what it will, the following
 is my advice, which, however, as in duty bound, I submit with all
 humility to your reverence’s judgment.
 
 In the first place, then, it will be very easy to seize in one day
 all the preachers, and to hang them all at one time and in one place,
 which will be not only a very edifying, but also a very entertaining
 exhibition to the people.
 
 Secondly, I would have all the fathers and mothers who are heretics
 murdered in their beds, because the killing of them in the streets
 might occasion some little disturbance; besides, by that means,
 several of them might escape, which is above all to be prevented.
 This execution is a necessary corollary of our principles; for if
 we ought to kill a heretic, as so many of our great divines have
 incontestably proved, it is evident that we ought to kill them all
 without exception.
 
 Thirdly, I would, the very next day, marry all the daughters to good
 Catholics, inasmuch as it would not be politic to depopulate the
 state so much after the late war; but as for the boys of fourteen
 and fifteen years of age, who have already imbibed bad principles,
 which we cannot hope to root out, ’tis my opinion that they should
 be all castrated to prevent the race from ever being reproduced. As
 for the other younger lads, they may be brought up in our colleges,
 where they may be whipped till they have learned by heart the works
 of Sanchez and Molinos.
 
 Fourthly, I think under correction, the same method ought to be taken
 with all the Lutherans of Alsace, for I remember, in the year 1704,
 to have seen two old women of that country laugh on the day of our
 defeat at Blenheim.
 
 Fifthly, What relates to the Jansenists will perhaps appear a little
 more difficult. I believe their numbers may amount to about six
 millions, a little more or less; but this ought not to give any
 alarm to a person of your reverence’s disposition. I reckon among
 the Jansenists all the parliaments who have so unworthily maintained
 the liberties of the Gallican church. I leave it to your reverence
 to weigh with your usual prudence the most effectual methods for
 reducing these turbulent spirits. The Gunpowder Plot failed of the
 desired success through the weakness of one of the conspirators,
 who wanted to save the life of his friend; but, as your reverence
 has no friend, the same inconvenience is not to be apprehended. You
 may very easily blow up all the parliaments in the kingdom with the
 composition called Pulvis Pyrius, invented by the monk Schwarz. By
 my calculation it will require upon an average thirty-six barrels of
 powder for each of the parliaments; now, if we multiply thirty-six,
 the number of barrels, by twelve, the number of parliaments, it will
 make four hundred and thirty-two barrels, which, at a hundred crowns
 per barrel, will amount to not quite a hundred and thirty thousand
 livres—a mere trifle for the reverend father-general.
 
 The parliaments thus disposed of, you may bestow their places upon
 your congregationists, who are perfectly well versed in the laws of
 the realm.
 
 Sixthly, It will be a very easy matter to poison the Cardinal de
 Noailles, who is a very simple, unsuspecting man.
 
 Your reverence may take the same steps for conversion with several of
 the refractory prelates; and their bishoprics, by a brief from the
 pope, may be put into the hands of the Jesuits; thus all the bishops
 that remain, being staunch to the good cause, and they making a
 proper choice of curates, I, with your reverence’s permission, would
 give the following advice:
 
 Seventhly and lastly, As the Jansenists are said to take the
 sacrament one time in the year at least, which is at Easter, it would
 not be amiss to season the consecrated wafers with a little of that
 drug which was used to do justice upon the Emperor Henry VII. Some
 nice caviller may perhaps tell me that in this operation we may run
 some risk of poisoning the Molinists at the same time. There is some
 weight in this objection; but then it should be considered that there
 is no project without its inconveniences, nor any system but what
 threatens destruction in some part. And if we were to be stopped by
 these little difficulties we should never attain our end in anything;
 besides, as here we have in view the obtaining the greatest of all
 possible advantages, we should not suffer ourselves to be shocked,
 though it brings with it some bad consequences, especially as those
 consequences are of little or no consideration.
 
 And, after all, we shall have nothing to reproach ourselves with,
 since it is proved that the Reformed, as they call themselves, and
 the Jansenists, have all of them their portion in hell; therefore, we
 only put them in possession of their inheritance a little sooner.
 
 It is as evident that heaven belongs of right to the Molinists;
 therefore by destroying them by mistake, and without any evil
 intention, we hasten their happiness; and are in both cases the
 ministers of Providence.
 
 As to those who may be a little shocked at the number to be thus made
 away with, your reverence may remark to them that from the first
 flourishing days of the church to the year 1707—that is to say, in
 about fourteen hundred years—religion has occasioned the massacre
 of upwards of fifty millions of persons; whereas by my proposal not
 above six millions and a half will be put to death by the halter, the
 dagger, or poison.
 
 But perhaps it may be objected that my calculation is not just, and
 that I have committed an error against the Rule of Three; inasmuch
 as, that if in fourteen hundred years there perished fifty millions
 of souls on account of some trifling disputes in divinity, that makes
 only thirty-five thousand seven hundred and fourteen and some little
 fraction in a year, and consequently that by my method an overplus of
 six millions sixty-four thousand two hundred and eighty-five and some
 fractions are put to death in the current year. But, indeed, this is
 a very childish quibble; nay, I’ll even call it impious; for is it
 not plain that by my method I save the lives of all the Catholics, so
 long as the world shall last? But, in short, there would be no end of
 answering every frivolous objection.
 
 I am, with the most profound respect, reverend father, your
 reverence’s most humble, most devout, and most humane
 
  R———,
  Native of Angoulême,
  Prefect of the Congregation.
 
 This glorious scheme, however, could not be carried into execution,
 because it required considerable time to make the necessary
 dispositions, and that Father Letellier was banished the year
 following. But as it is right to examine both sides of an argument,
 it will be proper to inquire in what cases it may be lawful to
 follow in part the scheme of the reverend father’s correspondent. It
 would seem rather too severe to execute it in all its parts; let us
 therefore examine in what cases we ought to break upon the wheel,
 to hang, or to make galley-slaves of those who differ from us in
 opinion. This shall be the subject of the following chapter.
 
 
  CHAPTER XVIII.
  THE ONLY CASES IN WHICH
  NON-TOLERATION MAKES
  PART OF THE HUMAN LAW.
 
 For a government not to have a right to punish men for their errors,
 it is necessary that those errors should not be crimes; and they
 are crimes only when they disturb the public tranquillity; which
 they do whenever they inspire enthusiasm. It is necessary therefore
 that men should begin by laying aside enthusiasm in order to deserve
 toleration.
 
 If a number of young Jesuits, knowing that the church holds all
 reprobates and heretics in detestation, and that the opinion of the
 Jansenists having been condemned by a bull this sect is consequently
 reprobate, thereupon go and set fire to the house of the fathers of
 the oratory, because Quesnel, one of that body, was a Jansenist; it
 is clear that the government would be obliged to punish those Jesuits.
 
 In like manner, if these latter have been found to teach the most
 reprehensible doctrines, and if their institution appears contrary
 to the laws of the kingdom, it becomes necessary to abolish their
 society, and of Jesuits to make them useful citizens; which, in fact,
 so far from being an oppression upon them, as has been pretended, is
 a real good done them; for where is the great oppression of being
 obliged to wear a short coat instead of a long gown, or to be free
 instead of being a slave? In time of peace whole regiments are broken
 without complaining. Why, then, should the Jesuits make such an
 outcry, when they are broken for the sake of peace?
 
 Were the Franciscans in a transport of holy zeal for the Virgin Mary,
 to go and pull down the church of the Dominicans, who hold Mary to
 have been born in original sin, the government would then be obliged
 to treat the Franciscans much in the same manner it has done the
 Jesuits.
 
 The same argument will hold good with regard to the Lutherans and
 Calvinists; for let them say, if they please, we follow the dictates
 of our consciences; it is more profitable to obey God than man; we
 are the only true flock, and therefore ought to cut off all the
 wolves. It is evident that in this case they themselves are the
 wolves.
 
 One of the most astonishing examples of enthusiasm was in a little
 sect in Denmark, founded on one of the best principles in the
 world; for these people endeavored to procure the eternal happiness
 of all their brethren; but the consequences of this principle were
 very singular. As they believed that all the young children who died
 without baptism were damned, and that those who had the happiness to
 die immediately after receiving that sacrament enter into eternal
 happiness, they went forth and murdered all the young children of
 both sexes lately baptized, whom they could meet with. By this
 action they doubtless procured the little innocents the greatest of
 all felicity, by preserving them at once from sin, the miseries of
 this life, and hell, and sending them certainly to heaven. But these
 people, in the excess of their charitable zeal, did not consider that
 it is forbidden to do evil that good may come thereof; that they had
 no right over the lives of these infants; that the greatest part
 of fathers and mothers are so carnal as to desire rather to keep
 their children about them than to see their throats cut, though it
 was to send them to heaven; and, lastly, that it is the duty of the
 magistrate to punish murder, though committed with a good intent.
 
 It would seem that the Jews had the greatest right of any persons
 to rob and murder us; for although the Old Testament abounds with
 examples of toleration and indulgence, yet are there several
 instances of the contrary, and some very severe laws. God did at
 times command his people to kill all idolaters, reserving only
 the young women fit for the nuptial state. They look upon us as
 idolaters; and notwithstanding that we at present tolerate them, they
 might certainly, had they the power in their hands, cut us all off,
 excepting our young women.
 
 Moreover, they would be under an indispensable obligation to
 exterminate the whole Turkish race. This speaks for itself, for the
 Turks are at present in possession of the countries of the Hittites,
 the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, etc., all of whom were
 laid under a curse, and their country, which was about five and
 twenty leagues in extent, was given to the Jews by several successive
 covenants; consequently they ought to resume possession of their own,
 which the Turks have usurped from them for upwards of a thousand
 years. But if the Jews were to reason in this manner nowadays, it is
 pretty certain we should make them no other answer than by impaling
 them alive.
 
 These are the only cases in which persecution appears reasonable.
 
 
  CHAPTER XIX.
  ACCOUNT OF A CONTROVERSIAL
  DISPUTE WHICH HAPPENED IN
  CHINA.
 
 In the beginning of the reign of the great Emperor Cam-hi, a mandarin
 of the city of Canton, hearing a great noise and outcry in the house
 adjoining that he dwelt in, sent to know if they were murdering
 any one; but was told that it was only a Danish almoner, a Dutch
 chaplain, and a Jesuit disputing together; upon which he ordered them
 to be brought before him, and inquired of them the occasion of their
 quarrel?
 
 The Jesuit, who was the first that spoke, said that it was a very
 grievous thing to him, who was always in the right, to have to do
 with people who were always in the wrong; that he at first began to
 reason with them with the greatest coolness; but that, at length, he
 could not but own his patience had left him.
 
 The mandarin then represented to all three, with all imaginable
 candor, how necessary it was to observe decorum and good manners even
 in disputation; he told them that no one ever gave way to heat or
 passion in China, and desired to be informed of the nature of their
 dispute.
 
 “My lord,” said the Jesuit, “I take you for judge in this affair.
 These two gentlemen refuse to submit to the decisions of the Council
 of Trent.”
 
 “I am surprised at that,” replied the mandarin. Then turning towards
 the two refractory parties: “Gentlemen,” said he, “you ought to
 show a deference to the opinion of a great assembly. I do not know
 what the Council of Trent is, but a number of persons must always
 have opportunities of knowing better than one single man. No one
 ought to imagine that he knows more than all others, and that reason
 dwells only with him; this is the doctrine of our great Confucius;
 therefore, if you would take my advice, abide by what the Council of
 Trent has decreed.”
 
 The Dane then began to speak in his turn. “Your excellence,” said he,
 “has delivered yourself with great wisdom and prudence; we have all
 that respect for great assemblies that we ought; and accordingly we
 submit entirely to the opinions of several councils that were held at
 the same time with that of Trent.”
 
 “Oh! if that is the case,” said the mandarin, “I ask your pardon;
 you may doubtless be in the right. So, then, it seems you and the
 Dutchman are of one opinion against the Jesuit.”
 
 “Not in the least,” answered the Dutchman; “this man here,” pointing
 to the Dane, “entertains notions almost as extravagant as those of
 the Jesuit, who pretends to so much mildness before you. ‘Sblood!
 there is no bearing this with patience.”
 
 “I cannot conceive what you mean,” said the mandarin; “are you
 not all three Christians? Are you not all three come to teach the
 Christian religion in our empire? And ought you not consequently have
 all the same tenets?”
 
 “You see how it is, my lord,” said the Jesuit; “these two men here
 are mortal enemies of each other; and yet both of them dispute
 against me; this makes it clear that they are both in the wrong, and
 that reason is on my side.”
 
 “I do not think it is so very clear,” replied the mandarin; “for
 it may very well happen that you are all three in the wrong. But I
 should be glad to hear your arguments singly.”
 
 The Jesuit then made a long discourse, while the Dutchman and the
 Dane at every period shrugged up their shoulders, and the mandarin
 could not make anything of what he heard. The Dane now took the lead
 in his turn, while his two adversaries looked upon him with manifest
 signs of contempt; and the mandarin, when he had finished, remained
 as wise as before. The Dutchman had the same success. At length
 they began to talk all three together, and broke out into the most
 scurrilous revilings. The honest mandarin could hardly get in a word.
 At length he dismissed them, saying: “If you expect to have your
 doctrine tolerated here, begin by showing an example of it to one
 another.”
 
 At leaving the house the Jesuit met with a Dominican missionary, to
 whom he related what had passed; and told him that he had gained his
 cause; “for you may be assured,” added he, “that truth will always
 prevail.” The Dominican replied: “Had I been there, friend, you would
 not so easily have gained your cause; for I should have proved you to
 be an idolater and a liar.” Upon this, there arose a violent dispute
 between them; and the Jesuit and the friar went to fisticuffs. The
 mandarin being informed of this scandalous behavior ordered them both
 to be sent to prison. A sub-mandarin asked his excellence how long he
 would please to have them remain in confinement. “Till they are both
 agreed,” said the judge. “Then, my lord,” answered the sub-mandarin,
 “they will remain in prison all their days.” “Well, then,” said
 the mandarin, “let them stay till they forgive one another.” “That
 they will never do,” rejoined the deputy; “I know them very well.”
 “Indeed!” said the mandarin; “then let it be till they appear so to
 do.”
 
 
  CHAPTER XX.
  WHETHER IT IS OF SERVICE
  TO INDULGE THE PEOPLE IN
  SUPERSTITION.
 
 Such is the weakness and perversity of the human race that it is
 undoubtedly more eligible for them to be subject to every possible
 kind of superstition, provided it is not of a bloody nature, than
 to live without religion. Man has always stood in need of a curb;
 and though it was certainly very ridiculous to sacrifice to fauns,
 satyrs, and naïads, yet it was more reasonable and advantageous to
 adore even those fantastic images of the deity than to be given up to
 atheism. An atheist of any capacity, and invested with power, would
 be as dreadful a scourge to the rest of mankind as the most bloody
 enthusiast.
 
 When men have not true notions of the Deity, false ideas must supply
 their place, like as in troublesome and calamitous times we are
 obliged to trade with base money when good is not to be procured.
 The heathens were afraid of committing crimes, lest they should be
 punished by their false gods. The Malabar dreads the anger of his
 pagods. Wherever there is a fixed community, religion is necessary;
 the laws are a curb upon open crimes, and religion upon private ones.
 
 But when once men have embraced a pure and holy religion,
 superstition then becomes not only needless, but very hurtful. Those
 whom God has been pleased to nourish with bread ought not to be fed
 upon acorns.
 
 Superstition is to religion what astrology is to astronomy, the
 foolish daughter of a wise mother. These two daughters, however, have
 for a long time governed this world with uncontrollable sway.
 
 In those dark and barbarous times amongst us, when there were hardly
 two feudal lords who had a New Testament in their houses, it might
 be pardonable to present the common people with fables; I mean those
 feudal lords, their ignorant wives, and brutish vassals. They were
 then made to believe that St. Christopher carried the child Jesus
 on his shoulders from one side of the river to the other; they were
 entertained with stories of witches and witchcraft; they readily
 believed that St. Genou cured the gout, and St. Claire sore eyes. The
 children believed in hobgoblins, and their fathers in St. Francis’
 girdle; and relics swarmed out of number.
 
 The common people have continued to be infected with the rust of
 these superstitions, even after religion became more enlightened. It
 is well known that when M. de Noailles, bishop of Châlons, ordered
 the pretended relic of the holy navel to be taken away and thrown
 into the fire, the whole city of Châlons joined in a prosecution
 against him; but he, who had resolution equal to his piety, soon
 brought the people of his diocese to believe that one may adore Jesus
 Christ in spirit and in truth, without having his navel in a church.
 
 Those whom we call Jansenists were not a little instrumental in
 rooting out by degrees, from the minds of the greatest part of the
 nation, the many absurd notions which were the disgrace of our holy
 religion. And it no longer continued to be thought sufficient to
 repeat the prayer of thirty days to the Blessed Virgin, to obtain
 whatever one should ask, and sin with impunity.
 
 At length the lower kind of people began to imagine that it was not
 St. Geneviève who gave rain or caused it to cease, but God Himself,
 who disposed the elements according to His good will and pleasure.
 The monks have been astonished to find their saints no longer perform
 miracles; and if the writers of the life of St. Francis Xavier were
 to come again into the world they would not venture to assert that
 their saint raised nine people from the dead; that he was at one and
 the same time both on the sea and on shore; or that a crab brought
 him his crucifix, which he had dropped out of his hand into the water.
 
 It has happened much the same with regard to excommunications. Our
 French historians tell us that when King Robert was excommunicated
 by Pope Gregory V. for having married the Princess Bertha, who
 was his godmother, his domestics threw all the victuals that came
 from his table out of the windows, and that his queen Bertha was
 delivered of a goose as a punishment for this incestuous alliance.
 It is not likely that the pages of the presence to a king of France
 nowadays would throw his dinner into the streets if he should be
 excommunicated, nor would it be very readily believed that the queen
 was brought to bed of a bird.
 
 If there are some few convulsionists yet to be met with in an obscure
 corner of the town it is a kind of lousy disease that infects only
 the dregs of the people. Reason is every day making her way into
 the tradesman’s counting house, as well as into the palaces of our
 nobility. It behooves us then to cultivate the fruits of this reason,
 more especially as it is impossible to prevent them from sprouting
 forth. France, after having been enlightened by a Pascal, a Nicole,
 an Arnaud, a Bossuet, a Descartes, a Gassendi, a Bayle, a Fontenelle,
 and other bright geniuses like them, is no longer to be governed as
 in the times of Garasse and Menot.
 
 If the masters of error, I mean the great masters who were so long
 a time prayed to and reverenced for brutalizing the human species,
 were at present to enjoin us to believe that the seed must rot in the
 earth before it can sprout; that this earth continues immovable on
 its basis without revolving about the sun; that the tides are not
 the natural effect of gravitation; that the rainbow is not formed by
 the refraction and reflection of the rays of light, etc., and were
 they to bring certain passages of Scripture badly understood and
 worse interpreted to authenticate their ordinances, how would they
 be looked upon by every person of common capacity? Would fools be
 thought too harsh a name to be imposed on them? But if they should
 have recourse to compulsion and persecution to establish their
 insolent ignorance, would not madmen and butchers be deemed a proper
 appellation?
 
 The more that monkish superstition becomes contemptible, the more
 bishops are respected and the clergy in general esteemed. They do
 good in their professions, whereas the monkish superstition of
 foreign climates occasioned a great deal of mischief. But of all
 superstitions, that of hating our neighbor on account of his opinion
 is surely the most dangerous! And will it not be granted me that
 there would be more sense and reason in adoring the holy navel, the
 holy prepuce, and the milk and the robe of the Blessed Virgin, than
 to detest and persecute our brother?
 
 
  CHAPTER XXI.
  VIRTUE IS BETTER
  THAN LEARNING.
 
 The fewer dogmas, the fewer disputes; and the fewer disputes, the
 fewer calamities: if this is not true I am much mistaken.
 
 Religion is instituted to make us happy in this life and the next.
 But what is required to make us happy in the life to come? To be
 just. And in this? To be merciful and forbearing.
 
 It would be the height of madness to pretend to bring all mankind to
 think exactly in the same manner in regard to metaphysics. We might,
 with much greater ease, subject the whole universe by force of arms
 than subject the minds of all the inhabitants of one single village.
 
 But Euclid found no difficulty in persuading every one of the truths
 of geometry. And why? Because there is not one of them which is not a
 self-evident corollary on this simple axiom: “Two and two make four.”
 But is it not altogether the same with relation to the complicated
 maxims in metaphysics and divinity.
 
 Eusebius and Socrates tell us that when Bishop Alexander and Arius
 the priest began first to dispute in what manner the Logos or word
 proceeded from the Father, the Emperor Constantine wrote to them in
 the following terms: “You are great fools to dispute about things
 you do not understand.”
 
 If the two contending parties had been wise enough to acknowledge
 that the emperor was in the right Christendom would not have been
 drenched in blood for upwards of three centuries.
 
 And, indeed, what can be more ridiculous, or rather detestable, than
 to address mankind in this manner: “My friends, it is not sufficient
 that you are faithful subjects, dutiful children, tender parents,
 and upright neighbors; that you live in the continual practice of
 virtue; that you are grateful, benevolent, and generous, and worship
 the Saviour of the world in peace; it is furthermore required of you
 that you should know how a thing may be begotten from all eternity,
 without being made from all eternity; and if you cannot distinguish
 the homoousian in the hypostasis, we declare to you that you are
 damned to all eternity; and in the meantime we shall begin by cutting
 your throats”?
 
 If such a decision as this had been presented to Archimedes,
 Posidonius, Varro, Cato, or Cicero, what answer do you think they
 would have given to it?
 
 Constantine, however, did not persevere in silencing the two parties;
 he might easily have summoned the chiefs of the disputes before
 him, and have demanded of them by what authority they disturbed the
 peace of mankind. “Are you,” he might have said, “possessed of the
 genealogy of the heavenly family? What is it to you whether the
 Son was made or begotten, provided that you are faithful to Him;
 that you preach a sound doctrine, and practise that doctrine if you
 can? I have committed many faults in my lifetime, and so have you;
 I have been ambitious, so have you; it has cost me many falsehoods
 and cruelties to attain to the empire; I have murdered my nearest
 relative that stood in my way; but I now repent, and am willing to
 make atonement for my crime by restoring peace to the Roman Empire;
 do not you prevent me from doing the only good action which can
 possibly make my former cruel ones forgotten; but rather assist me to
 end my days in peace.” Perhaps Constantine might not, by this speech,
 have prevailed over the minds of the disputants, and perhaps he might
 rather be pleased with presiding in a council in a long crimson robe,
 and his forehead glittering with jewels.
 
 This, however, opened a passage to all those dreadful calamities
 which overran the West from Asia. Out of every contested verse there
 issued a fury armed with a quibble and a poniard, who inspired
 mankind at once with folly and cruelty. The Huns, the Heruli,
 the Goths, and Vandals, who came afterwards, did infinitely less
 mischief; and the greatest they did was that of afterwards engaging
 in the same fatal disputes.
 
 
  CHAPTER XXII.
  OF UNIVERSAL TOLERATION.
 
 It does not require any great art or studied elocution to prove that
 Christians ought to tolerate one another. Nay, I shall go still
 farther and say that we ought to look upon all men as our brethren.
 How! call a Turk, a Jew, and a Siamese, my brother? Yes, doubtless;
 for are we not all children of the same parent, and the creatures of
 the same Creator?
 
 But these people hold us in contempt, and call us idolaters! Well,
 then, I should tell them that they were to blame. And I fancy that I
 could stagger the headstrong pride of an imaum, or a talapoin, were I
 to address them in the following manner:
 
 “This little globe, which is no more than a point, rolls, together
 with many other globes, in that immensity of space in which we are
 all alike confounded. Man, who is an animal, about five feet high,
 is certainly a very inconsiderable part of the creation; but one
 of those hardly visible beings says to others of the same kind
 inhabiting another spot of the globe: Hearken to me, for the God of
 all these worlds has enlightened me. There are about nine hundred
 millions of us little insects who inhabit the earth, but my ant-hill
 is alone cherished by God, who holds all the rest in horror and
 detestation; those who live with me upon my spot will alone be happy,
 and all the rest eternally wretched.”
 
 They would here stop me short and ask, “What madman could have made
 so ridiculous a speech?” I should then be obliged to answer them, “It
 is yourselves.” After which I should endeavor to pacify them, but
 perhaps that would not be very easy.
 
 I might next address myself to the Christians and venture to say,
 for example, to a Dominican, one of the judges of the inquisition:
 “Brother, you know that every province in Italy has a jargon of
 its own and that they do not speak in Venice and Bergamo as they
 do in Florence. The Academy della Crusca has fixed the standard of
 the Italian language; its dictionary is an unerring rule, and Buon
 Matei’s grammar is an infallible guide, from neither of which we
 ought to depart; but do you think that the president of the academy,
 or in his absence Buon Matei, could in conscience order the tongues
 of all the Venetians and Bergamese, who persisted in their own
 country dialect, to be cut out?”
 
 The inquisitor would, perhaps, make me this reply: “There is a very
 wide difference; here the salvation of your soul is concerned; and
 it is entirely for your good that the directory of the inquisition
 ordains that you shall be seized, upon the deposition of a single
 person, though of the most infamous character; that you shall have no
 person to plead for you, nor even be acquainted with the name of your
 accuser; that the inquisitor shall promise you favor, and afterwards
 condemn you; that he shall make you undergo five different kinds of
 torture, and that at length you shall be either whipped, sent to the
 galleys, or burned at the stake;[69] Father Ivonet, and the doctors,
 Chucalon, Zanchinus, Campegius, Royas, Telinus, Gomarus, Diabarus,
 and Gemelinus are exactly of this opinion, consequently this pious
 practice will not admit of contradiction.”
 
 To all which I should take the liberty of making the following reply:
 “Dear brother, you may perhaps be in the right, and I am perfectly
 well convinced of the great benefit you intend me; but may I not be
 saved without all this?”
 
 It is true that these horrible absurdities do not every day deform
 the face of the earth; but they have been very frequent, and one
 might easily collect instances enough to make a volume much larger
 than that of the Holy Gospels, which condemn such practices. It is
 not only very cruel to persecute in this short life those who do not
 think in the same manner as we do, but I very much doubt if there
 is not an impious boldness in pronouncing them eternally damned. In
 my opinion, it little befits such insects of a summer’s day as we
 are thus to anticipate the decrees of Providence. I am very far from
 opposing that maxim of the Church, that “out of her pale there is no
 salvation”; on the contrary, I respect that and every other part of
 her doctrine; but, after all, can we be supposed to be intimately
 acquainted with the ways of God, or to fathom the whole depth of His
 mercy? Is it not permitted us to hope in Him, as well as to fear
 Him? Is it not sufficient if we are faithful sons of the Church,
 without every individual presuming to wrest the power out of the hand
 of God, and determine, before Him, the future destiny of our fellow
 creatures?
 
 When we wear mourning for a king of England, Denmark, Sweden, or
 Prussia, do we say that we are in mourning for a damned soul that is
 burning in hell? There are about forty millions of inhabitants in
 Europe who are not members of the Church of Rome; should we say to
 every one of them, “Sir, as I look upon you to be infallibly damned,
 I shall neither eat, drink, converse, nor have any connections with
 you?”
 
 Is there an ambassador of France who, when he is presented to the
 grand seignior for an audience, will seriously say to himself,
 his sublime highness will infallibly burn to all eternity for
 having submitted to be circumcised? If he really thought that the
 grand seignior was a mortal enemy to God, and the object of divine
 vengeance, could he converse with such a person; nay, indeed, ought
 he to be sent to him? But how could we carry on any commerce, or
 perform any of the civil duties of society, if we were convinced that
 we were conversing with persons destined to eternal damnation?
 
 O ye different worshippers of a God of mercy! if ye have cruel
 hearts, if, while you adore that Deity who has placed the whole of
 His law in these few words, “Love God and your neighbor,” you have
 loaded that pure and holy law with sophistical and unintelligible
 disputes, if you have lighted the flames of discord sometimes for a
 new word, and at others for a single letter only; if you have annexed
 eternal punishment to the omission of some few words, or of certain
 ceremonies which other people cannot comprehend, I must say to you
 with tears of compassion for mankind: “Transport yourselves with me
 to that great instant in which all men are to receive judgment from
 the hand of God, who will then do unto every one according to their
 works, and with me behold all the dead of past ages appearing in His
 presence. Are you very sure that our heavenly Father and Creator
 will say to the wise and virtuous Confucius, to the great legislator
 Solon, to Pythagoras, Zaleucus, Socrates, Plato, the divine
 Antoninus, the good Trajan, to Titus, the delight of human kind,
 and to many others who have been the models of human kind: ‘Depart
 from me, wretches! into torments that know neither alleviation nor
 end; but are, like Himself, everlasting. But you, my well-beloved
 servants, John Châtel, Ravaillac, Cartouche, Damiens, etc., who have
 died according to the rules prescribed by the Church, enter into the
 joy of your Lord, and sit forever at my right hand in majesty and
 glory.’”
 
 Methinks I see you start with horror at these words; however, as they
 have escaped me, let them pass; I shall say nothing more to you.
 
 
  CHAPTER XXIII.
  AN ADDRESS TO THE DEITY.
 
 No longer then do I address myself to men, but to Thee, God of all
 beings, of all worlds, and of all ages; if it may be permitted weak
 creatures lost in immensity and imperceptible to the rest of the
 universe, to presume to petition Thee for aught, who hast given
 plenty of all things, and whose decrees are immutable as eternal.
 Deign to look with an eye of pity on the errors annexed to our
 natures! let not these errors prove the sources of misery to us! Thou
 hast not given us hearts to hate, nor hands to kill one another;
 grant then that we may mutually aid and assist each other to support
 the burden of this painful and transitory life! May the trifling
 differences in the garments that cover our frail bodies, in the
 mode of expressing our insignificant thoughts, in our ridiculous
 customs and our imperfect laws, in our idle opinions, and in our
 several conditions and situations, that appear so disproportionate
 in our eyes, and all are equal in Thine; in a word, may the slight
 variations that are found amongst the atoms called men not be made
 use of by us as signals of mutual hatred and persecution! May those
 who worship Thee by the light of tapers at noonday bear charitably
 with those who content themselves with the light of that glorious
 planet Thou hast placed in the midst of the heavens! May those who
 dress themselves in a robe of white linen to teach their hearers that
 Thou art to be loved and feared, not detest or revile those who teach
 the same doctrine in long cloaks of black wool! May it be accounted
 the same to adore Thee in a dialect formed from an ancient or a
 modern language! May those who, clothed in vestments of crimson or
 violet color, rule over a little parcel of that heap of dirt called
 the world, and are possessed of a few round fragments of a certain
 metal, enjoy without pride or insolence what they call grandeur and
 riches, and may others look on them without envy; for Thou knowest,
 O God, that there is nothing in all these vanities proper to inspire
 envy or pride.
 
 May all men remember that they are brethren! May they alike abhor
 that tyranny which seeks to subject the freedom of the will, as they
 do the rapine which tears from the arms of industry the fruits of its
 peaceful labors! And if the scourge of war is not to be avoided, let
 us not mutually hate and destroy each other in the midst of peace;
 but rather make use of the few moments of our existence to join in
 praising, in a thousand different languages, from one extremity of
 the world to the other, Thy goodness, O all-merciful Creator, to whom
 we are indebted for that existence!
 
 
  CHAPTER XXIV.
  POSTSCRIPT.
 
 While I was employed in writing this treatise, purely with a desire
 to make mankind more benevolent and charitable, another author was
 using his pen to the very contrary purpose; for every one has his
 particular way of thinking. This writer has published a small code
 of persecution under the title of “The Harmony of Religion and
 Humanity”; but this last word seems to be an error of the press, and
 should be read “Inhumanity.”
 
 The author of this holy libel takes St. Augustine for his example
 and authority, who, after having preached charity and forbearance,
 afterwards taught the doctrine of persecution, because he then had
 the upper hand and was naturally of a changeable disposition. He also
 quotes M. Bossuet, the bishop of Meaux, who persecuted the famous
 Fénelon, archbishop of Cambray, whom he accused of having said in
 print that God was well worthy to be loved for His own sake.
 
 I will readily grant that Bossuet was a very eloquent writer, and it
 must also be confessed that the bishop of Hippo[70] is frequently
 inconsistent, and in general more dry and barren than the rest of the
 African writers; and I must take the liberty of addressing them both
 in the words of Armande, in Molière’s “Learned Ladies”: “If we should
 imitate any person, it certainly should be in the most pleasing part
 of their character.” I should say to the bishop of Hippo: “My lord,
 as you have had two opinions, your lordship will be kind enough to
 suffer me to abide by your first, since I really think it the best.”
 
 To the bishop of Meaux I shall say: “My lord, you are certainly a
 very great man, and, in my opinion, have to the full as much learning
 as St. Augustine, and are far superior to him in eloquence; but
 then, my lord, why did you so distress your brother prelate, who had
 as much eloquence as yourself, though in another kind, and whose
 disposition was more amiable than yours.”
 
 The author of this “Treatise on Inhumanity”—for so I shall call
 it—is neither a Bossuet nor an Augustine, but seems admirably well
 qualified for an inquisitor; I wish he were at the head of that noble
 tribunal in Goa. Besides, he is a politician, and parades it in his
 book with several great maxims of state. “If you have to deal with
 any considerable number of heretics,” says he, “it will be necessary
 to use gentle methods, and try to bring them over by persuasion; but
 if they are only a few in number, then make free use of the gibbet
 and the galleys; you will find the advantage of it.” This is the good
 prelate’s own advice in the 89th and 90th pages of his work.
 
 Heaven be praised, I am an orthodox Catholic, and therefore am in no
 danger of what the Huguenots call martyrdom; but if ever this bishop
 should come to be prime minister, as he seems to flatter himself in
 his libels, I give him my promise that I will set out for England the
 very day his commission is signed.
 
 In the meantime, we ought to be thankful to Providence that those
 of his principles are always wretched reasoners. This writer has
 not scrupled to quote Bayle among the advocates for non-toleration,
 which is being equally sensible and honest; for, because Bayle agrees
 that it is necessary to punish incendiaries and rogues, our bishop
 directly concludes that we ought to persecute with fire and sword
 every honest and peaceable person. See page 98.
 
 Almost the whole of his book is no other than a copy of the apology
 for St. Bartholomew’s day. It is the apologist himself or his echo.
 But be this matter as it will, it is devoutly to be wished that
 neither the master nor the pupil may ever be at the head of an
 administration.
 
 But if ever such a thing should come to pass, let me beg leave to
 present them beforehand with the following hint in regard to a
 passage in the ninety-third page of the bishop’s holy libel:
 
 “Is the welfare of the whole nation to be sacrificed to the ease of
 only the twentieth part?”
 
 Let us suppose then for once that there are twenty Roman Catholics
 in France to one Huguenot, I am by no means for the Huguenots eating
 these twenty Catholics; but, at the same time, is there any reason
 why the twenty Catholics should eat the Huguenot? Besides, why should
 we hinder this latter from marrying? Are there not many bishops,
 abbots and monks that have estates in Dauphiny, Gevaudan, Agde and
 Carcassonne? And have not most of these farmers to manage those
 estates who do not believe in the doctrine of transubstantiation?
 Is it not the interest of these bishops and others that the farmers
 should have numerous families? And should one be permitted to have
 children that takes the sacrament in both kinds? Surely there is
 neither justice nor common honesty in this!
 
 “The revocation of the Edict of Nantes,” says my author, “has not
 been productive of so great inconveniences as has been generally
 alleged.”
 
 I must own if any have added to the number of bad effects that
 act produced, they must have greatly exaggerated; but then it is
 the common fault of all historians to exaggerate, as it is of all
 controversial writers to disguise the greatest part of those evils
 with which they are reproachable. But for once let us pin our
 faith neither upon the doctors of the Sorbonne nor the preachers
 of Amsterdam. Let us take for judges in this matter those who have
 had the best opportunities of being acquainted with what they wrote
 about; and in the first place I shall cite the Count d’Avaux,
 ambassador from France to the States-General during the years 1685,
 1686, 1687, and 1688.
 
 In the hundred and eighty-first page of the fifth volume of his
 works he says that one man only offered to discover upwards of
 twenty millions of livres that the persecuted Huguenots had found
 means to send out of France. Louis XIV., in answer to this, writes
 to M. d’Avaux: “The accounts which I daily receive of the prodigious
 numbers of those who are converted convince me that in a short time
 the most obstinate will follow the example of the others.”
 
 This letter of the king’s plainly shows that he was firmly persuaded
 of the greatness of his power. He was accustomed to hear said to him
 every morning: “Sire, you are the greatest monarch upon earth; you
 have but to declare your opinion and the whole world will be proud
 to follow it.” Pelisson, who had accumulated a prodigious fortune
 in the place of head clerk of the treasury, who had been three
 years confined in the Bastille as an accomplice with Fouquet, who,
 changing his religion, was from a Calvinist made a Roman, a deacon
 and a beneficed priest, who composed hymns for the mass and verses to
 Chloe, and who had got the post of comptroller and converter in chief
 of the heretics; this very Pelisson, I say, used to produce every
 morning a long list of pretended abjurations purchased at the rate
 of seven or eight crowns apiece, and made his prince believe that he
 could, whenever he pleased, convert the whole Mahometan empire at the
 same price. In short, every one was in league to impose upon him;
 how then was it possible for him to avoid being deceived?
 
 This very M. d’Avaux also acquaints the court that one Vincent kept
 upwards of five hundred workmen employed in the neighborhood of
 Angoulême, and that it would be of great prejudice to the nation
 should they quit the kingdom. Vol. v., page 194.
 
 The count likewise mentions two regiments at that time actually being
 raised by French refugee officers for the service of the prince of
 Orange; he observes that the entire crews of three French ships of
 war had deserted and entered into the same service, and that besides
 the two regiments above mentioned, the prince was forming a company
 of cadet refugees, who were to be commanded by two refugee captains.
 Page 240. The same ambassador in another letter to M. de Seignelay,
 dated the 9th of May, 1686, says that he can no longer conceal the
 uneasiness it gives him to see the manufactures of France transported
 into Holland, where they will be established, never more to return.
 
 Add to these incontestable evidences the testimonies of the several
 intendants of the kingdom in 1698, and then let any one judge whether
 the revocation of the Edict of Nantes has not done more harm than
 good, notwithstanding the opinion of the worthy author of the
 “Harmony of Religion and Inhumanity.”
 
 A Marshal of France well known for his superior abilities some years
 ago made use of the following expression: “I know not whether the
 practice of dragooning may ever have been necessary, but I am sure it
 is very necessary to lay it aside.”
 
 And here I must confess that I was apprehensive. I had gone rather
 too far in publishing the letter from a priest to Father Letellier,
 in which the use of gunpowder is so humanely proposed. I said to
 myself, people will not believe me; they will certainly think this
 letter is a forged piece; but luckily my scruples were entirely eased
 when in perusing the “Harmony of Religion and Inhumanity,” I came to
 the following Christian and charitable passage:
 
 “The entire extirpation of the Protestants in France would not weaken
 that kingdom more than a plentiful bleeding would a patient of a
 sound constitution.” Page 149.
 
 Here this pious minister of Christ, who, but a few pages before,
 says that the Protestants make about a twentieth part of the nation,
 is for shedding the blood of that twentieth part, and advises the
 operation with as much unconcern as he would the taking away two or
 three ounces from the arm of a plethoric person! Heaven preserve us
 and him from the other three-twentieths!
 
 Now, if this worthy prelate is for destroying the twentieth part
 of the nation at one stroke, might not Father Letellier’s friend
 and correspondent as well have proposed the blowing up, stabbing or
 poisoning the one-third? Hence then it appears very probable that
 such a letter was really written to Letellier.
 
 Our pious author concludes upon the whole that persecution is an
 excellent thing; “for,” says he, “we do not find it absolutely
 condemned by our Saviour.” Neither has our Saviour expressly
 condemned those who may set fire to the four corners of Paris; but is
 that a reason for canonizing all incendiaries?
 
 In this manner, while the gentle voice of Nature is everywhere
 pleading the cause of charity and benevolence, Enthusiasm, her avowed
 enemy, is continually howling against it; and while Peace opens her
 calm bosom to all mankind, Persecution is busied in forging weapons
 for their destruction. Let it be your care, then, O ye princely
 arbiters, who have restored peace to the world, to pass sentence
 between the spirit of mutual love and harmony and that of discord and
 bloodshed.
 
 
  CHAPTER XXV.
  SEQUEL AND CONCLUSION.
 
 [Illustration: WIDOW CALAS PLEADING FOR A REVOCATION OF THE DECREE OF
 THE PARLIAMENT OF TOULOUSE]
 
 On the 7th of March, 1763, a council of state being held at
 Versailles, at which all the great ministers assisted and the
 chancellor sat as president, M. de Crosne, one of the masters of
 requests, made a report of the affair of the Calas family with all
 the impartiality of a judge, and the precision of one perfectly
 well acquainted with the case, and with the plain truth and inspired
 eloquence of an orator and a statesman, which is alone suitable to
 such an assembly. The gallery was filled with a prodigious number
 of persons of all ranks, who impatiently waited the decision of
 the council. In a short time a deputation was sent to the king to
 acquaint him that the council had come to a unanimous resolution:
 that the parliament of Toulouse should transmit to them the whole
 account of its proceedings, together with the reasons on which it had
 framed the sentence condemning John Calas to be broken on the wheel;
 when his majesty was pleased to concur in the decree of the council.
 
 Justice and humanity then still continue to reside amongst mankind!
 and principally in the council of a king beloved, and deserving so
 to be; who, with his ministers, his chancellor and all the members
 of his council, have not disdained to employ their time in weighing
 all the circumstances relating to the sufferings of a private family
 with as much attention as if it had been the most interesting affair
 of war or peace; whilst the judges have shown themselves inspired
 by a love of equity and a tender regard to the interests of their
 fellow-subjects. All praise be given therefore to that Merciful
 Being, the only giver of integrity and every other virtue.
 
 And here we take occasion to declare that we never had the least
 acquaintance with the unfortunate man who was condemned on the most
 frivolous evidence by the court of justice of Toulouse, in direct
 contradiction to the ordinances of our king and the laws of all
 nations, nor with his son, Mark Antony, the extraordinary manner of
 whose death led the judges into the error they committed; nor with
 the mother, whose sufferings call aloud for compassion, nor yet with
 her innocent daughter, who, together with her, travelled upwards of
 six hundred miles to lay their virtue and distresses at the foot of
 the throne.
 
 The God in whose presence we declare this knows that we have been
 actuated solely by the love of justice, mercy, and truth, in
 delivering our thoughts in the manner we have done on toleration,
 in regard to John Calas, who fell a victim to non-toleration and
 persecution.
 
 We had not the least intent to offend the eight judges of Toulouse
 in saying that they were mistaken, as the council of state itself
 supposes them to have been; on the contrary, we have opened a way
 for them to vindicate themselves to all Europe by acknowledging that
 equivocal circumstances, and the clamor of a headstrong and enraged
 populace, had biassed their judgment; and by asking pardon of the
 widow and repairing as much as in them lies the ruin they have
 brought upon an innocent family, by adding to the number of those who
 succor them in their affliction. They have put the father to death
 unjustly; let them then be as fathers to his children, provided those
 children are willing to accept of this poor token of repentance from
 them. It would be infinitely to the honor of the judges to make such
 an offer, and to that of the injured family to refuse it.
 
 But it principally behooves the Sieur David, capitol of Toulouse, to
 set the example of remorse and penitence, who was the first to raise
 this persecution against innocence, and who insulted the hapless
 father of a family when expiring on the scaffold. This was indeed an
 unparalleled act of cruelty; but as God is willing to show mercy and
 forgiveness it is the duty of mortals to pardon in like manner those
 who make atonement for their offences.
 
 I have received a letter from a friend in Languedoc, dated the 20th
 of February, 1763, of which the following is an extract:
 
 “Your treatise on toleration appears to be full of humanity and
 truth; but I am afraid it will rather hurt than serve the Calas
 family. It may gall the eight judges who were for the sentence, and
 they may apply to the parliament to have your book burnt; besides,
 the bigots, of whom you are sensible there is always a considerable
 number, will oppose the voice of reason with the clamors of
 prejudice,” etc.
 
 My answer was as follows:
 
 “The eight judges of Toulouse may, if they please, have my book
 burnt. It will cost them very little trouble, since the “Provincial
 Letters,” which had infinitely superior merit to anything of mine,
 were condemned to the same fate. Every one, you know, is at liberty
 to burn in his own house such books as he does not like.
 
 “My treatise cannot possibly do either hurt or good to the Calas
 family, with whom I have not the least acquaintance. The king’s
 council is no less resolute than impartial; it judges according
 to law and equity of those things which fall properly under its
 cognizance; but it will not interfere with a common pamphlet, written
 upon a subject altogether foreign from the affair under consideration.
 
 “If a hundred volumes in folio should be written in condemnation or
 vindication of the judges of Toulouse, or of toleration, neither the
 council nor any other court of justice would look upon these as law
 matters.
 
 “I readily agree with you that there are numbers of enthusiasts who
 will set up the cry against me, but at the same time I do insist that
 I shall have as many sensible readers who will make use of their
 reason.
 
 “I hear that the Parliament of Toulouse and some other courts of
 justice have a method of proceeding peculiar to themselves. They
 admit fourths, thirds, and sixths of a proof; so that with six
 hearsays on one side, three on the other, and four-fourths of a
 presumption, they frame three complete proofs; and in consequence of
 this curious demonstration will condemn you a man to be broken upon
 the wheel without mercy. Now, the least acquaintance with the art of
 logic or reasoning would point out a different method of proceeding
 to them. What we call a half proof can never amount to more than a
 suspicion; but there is no such thing in reality as a half proof; for
 a thing must either be proved or not proved; there is no medium.
 
 “A million of suspicions put together can no more frame a regular
 proof than a million of ciphers can compose an arithmetical number.
 
 “There are fourths of tones or sounds in music, and these are to be
 expressed; but there are no fourths in truths, nor in reasoning.
 
 “Two witnesses agreeing in the same deposition, are esteemed to make
 a proof; but this is not enough; these two witnesses should be clear
 of all passion and prejudice, and, above all, their testimony should
 be in every part consonant with reason.
 
 “Suppose four persons of the most respectable appearance were to come
 and swear in a court of justice that they saw an infirm old man take
 a vigorous young fellow by the collar and toss him out of a window,
 to the distance of six or seven feet; certainly such deponents ought
 to be sent to a madhouse.
 
 “But the eight judges of Toulouse condemned John Calas upon a much
 more improbable accusation; for there was no one appeared to swear
 that he had actually seen this feeble old man of seventy seize
 a stout young fellow of twenty-eight, and hang him up. Indeed,
 certain enthusiastic wretches said that they had been told by other
 enthusiasts like themselves that they had been told by some of their
 own sect that they had heard that John Calas had by a supernatural
 strength overcome his son and hanged him. And thus was the most
 absurd of all sentences passed upon the most absurd of all evidence.
 
 “In fine, there is no remedy against such kind of proceedings but
 that those who purchase their seats in a court of justice should, for
 the future, be obliged to study a little better.”
 
 This treatise on toleration is a petition which humanity with all
 submission presents to power and prudence. I have sowed a grain that
 may perhaps produce a rich harvest. We may hope everything from time,
 from the goodness of the heart of our gracious monarch, the wisdom
 of his ministers, and the spirit of sound reason, which begins to
 diffuse its salutary influence over all minds.
 
 Nature addresses herself thus to mankind: “I have formed you all
 weak and ignorant, to vegetate a few moments on that earth which
 you are afterwards to fatten with your carcasses. Let your weakness
 then teach you to succor each other, and as you are ignorant, bear
 with and endeavor mutually to instruct each other. Even if ye were
 all of the same way of thinking, which certainly will never come
 to pass, and there should be one single person only found amongst
 you who differed from you in belief, you ought to forgive him, for
 it is I who make him think in the manner he does. I have given you
 hands to cultivate the earth, and a faint glimmering of reason to
 conduct yourselves by, and I have planted in your hearts a spirit of
 compassion, that you may assist each other under the burden of life.
 Do not smother that spark, nor suffer it to be corrupted, for know it
 is of divine origin; neither substitute the wretched debates of the
 schools in the place of the voice of nature.
 
 “It is I alone who unite you all, in despite of yourselves, by
 your mutual wants, even in the midst of those bloody wars that you
 undertake for the slightest causes, and that afford a continual scene
 of error, chances, and misfortunes. It is I alone who, in a nation,
 prevent the fatal effects of the inextinguishable differences that
 subsist between the sword and the law, between those two professions
 and the clergy, and between even the citizen and the husbandman.
 Though ignorant of the limits of their own prerogatives, they are
 in spite of themselves obliged to listen to my voice, which speaks
 to their hearts. It is I alone who maintain equity in the courts
 of judicature, where otherwise everything would be determined by
 error and caprice, in the midst of a confused heap of laws, framed
 too often at a venture and to supply an immediate call, differing
 from each other in every province and town, and almost always
 contradictory in the same place. I alone can inspire the love and
 knowledge of justice, while the laws inspire only chicanery and
 subterfuge. He who listens to me seldom forms a wrong judgment, while
 he who seeks only to reconcile contradictory opinions loses himself
 in the fruitless labor.
 
 “There is an immense edifice whose foundation I laid with my own
 hands. It was at once solid and simple; all mankind might have
 entered into it with safety, but they, in seeking to ornament,
 overloaded it with useless and fantastic decorations. The building is
 continually falling to decay, and they gather up the stones to throw
 at one another; while I am incessantly calling out to them, ‘Hold,
 madmen! clear away the ruins with which you are surrounded, and which
 you yourselves have made; come and live with me in uninterrupted
 tranquillity within my mansion, that is not to be shaken.’”
 
 
 FOOTNOTES TO A TREATISE ON TOLERATION
 
 [2] 12 October, 1761.
 
 [3] After the body was carried to the town-house, indeed, there was
 found a little scratch upon the end of the nose, and a small black
 and blue spot upon the breast; but these were probably occasioned by
 some carelessness in removing the corpse.
 
 [4] I know of but two instances in history of fathers having murdered
 their children on the score of religion; the first is the father of
 St. Barbara, as she is called; it seems he had ordered two windows
 to be made in his bathing-room. St. Barbara in his absence took it
 into her head to make a third in honor of the Holy Trinity; she also
 with the end of her finger made the sign of the cross upon the marble
 pillars, which remained deeply impressed thereon; her father, in a
 violent fury to have his room thus marked, runs after her with his
 sword in his hand with an intention to kill her; she flies towards a
 mountain, which very complaisantly opens upon her approach to give
 her a passage. Her father finds himself obliged to go round about,
 and at length gets hold of his fugitive daughter, whom he strips
 and prepares to scourge; but God envelops her with a white cloud;
 however, after all, her father caused her head to be struck off. This
 is the story as we find it related in the book called “The Flower of
 Saints.”
 
 The second instance is of Prince Hermenegildus, who raised a
 rebellion against the king, his father, and gave him battle in the
 year 584, but was himself defeated and slain by one of his father’s
 generals; however, he has been placed among the martyrs, because his
 father was an Arian.
 
 [5] It is necessary for the English reader to understand that in
 Paris it is customary for the great lawyers or counsellors employed
 in any remarkable case to publish their pleadings on each side. On
 this occasion, however, our author observes, “that these publications
 were pirated in several towns, by which Mrs. Calas lost the advantage
 that was intended her by this act of generosity.”
 
 [6] _Dévot_, or as we call it in English, devotee, comes from the
 Latin word _devotus_. The _devoti_ of ancient Rome were such persons
 who devoted themselves to death for the safety or good of the
 republic, as the Curtii and Decii.
 
 [7] They revived the opinion of Berengarius, concerning the
 eucharist; they denied that a body can exist in a thousand different
 places at one time, even by all the exertion of divine omnipotence;
 they also denied that attributes can subsist without a subject;
 they held that it was absolutely impossible that what appears to
 be simple bread and wine to the sight, the taste, and the stomach,
 can in the very instant of its existence be annihilated or changed
 into another substance; in a word, they maintained all those errors
 for which Berengarius was formerly condemned. They founded their
 belief on several passages of the ancient fathers of the church,
 and particularly of St. Justin, who says expressly in his Dialogue
 against Typhon, “That the offering of fine flour is the figure of the
 eucharist, which Christ has ordered us to make in commemoration of
 his passion;
 
  χαὶ ἡ τῆς σεμιδαλέως, _&c._, τύπος ἦν τοῦ ἄρτου τῆς εὐχαριστίας,
  ὃν είς ἀνάμνμησιν τοῦ πάθους, _&c._ Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸς ὁ χύριος ἡμῶν
  παρέδωχε ποιεῖν.”
 
 They revived all that had been advanced in the first ages against
 the worship of relics, and brought these words of Vigilantius for
 their authority: “What necessity is there for your paying adoration
 or even respect to a mass of vile dust? Can it be supposed that the
 souls of deceased martyrs retain after their death an affection for
 their ashes? The customs of the ancient idolaters are now introduced
 into the Church; we begun to light tapers at noonday; we may, indeed,
 during our lifetime, mutually pray for each other; but of what
 service can such prayers be after death?”
 
 [8] The candid and venerable President de Thou expresses himself thus
 concerning these innocent and unfortunate persons: “_Homines esse qui
 trecentis circiter abhinc annis asperum & incultum solum vectigale a
 dominis acceperint, quod improbo labore & assiduo cultu frugum ferax
 & aptum pecori reddiderint; patientissimos eos laboris & inediæ,
 a litibus abhorrentes, erga, egenos munificos, tributa principi &
 sua jura dominis sedulo & summa fide pendere; Dei cultum assiduis
 precibus & morum innocentiam præ se ferre, ceterum raro divorum
 templa adire, nisi si quando ad vicina suis finibus oppida mercandi
 aut negotiorum causa divertant; quo si quandoque pedem inferant, non
 dei, divorumque statuis advolvi, nec cereos eis aut donaria ulla
 ponere; non sacerdotes ab eis rogari ut pro se, aut propinquorum
 manibus rem divinam faciant, non cruce frontem insigniri uti aliorum
 moris est; cum cœlum intonant non se lustrali aqua aspergere, sed
 sublatis in cœlum oculis dei opem implorare; non religionis ergo
 peregre proficisci, non per vias ante crucium simulacra caput
 aperire; sacra alio ritu, & populari lingua celebrare; non denique
 Pontifici aut Episcopis honorem deferre, sed quosdam e suo numero
 delectos pro antistibus & doctoribus habere. Hæc uti ad Franciscum
 relata VI.” Id. Feb. anni &c._
 
 Madame de Cental, who was proprietor of part of the lands thus laid
 waste and drenched in the blood of their quondam inhabitants, applied
 for redress to Henry II., who referred her to the Parliament of
 Paris. The solicitor-general of Provence, whose name was Guerin and
 who had been the principal author of these massacres, was condemned
 to lose his head, and was the only one who suffered on this occasion
 the punishment due to the other accomplices in his guilt, because,
 says de Thou, _aulicorum favore destituertur_, he had not friends at
 court.
 
 [9] Francis Gomar was a Protestant divine; he maintained, in
 contradiction to Arminius, his colleague, that God has, from all
 eternity, predestined the greatest part of mankind to burn in
 everlasting flames: this infernal doctrine was supported in the
 manner most suitable to it, by persecution. The grand pensionary
 Barneveldt, who was of the party which opposed Gomar, was beheaded
 on the 13th of May, 1619, at the age of seventy-two, “_for having_”
 (says his sentence) “_used his uttermost endeavors to vex the Church
 of God_.”
 
 [10] A pompous writer, in his apology for the revocation of the Edict
 of Nantes, speaking of England, has these words: “These were the
 natural fruits of a false religion; there remained only one to be
 brought to perfection, which these islanders, justly the contempt of
 all nations, have cherished, and adapted to themselves.” Certainly
 this author has been a little unfortunate in choosing his time for
 representing the English as a people despicable and despised by all
 the world; for surely, when a nation gives the most signal proofs of
 its bravery and generosity, and when its victorious ensigns wave in
 the four parts of the world, no great credit is to be given to the
 writer who shall represent it as contemptible and contemned. But we
 must observe that it is in a chapter in favor of persecution that we
 meet with this extraordinary passage; and none but such as preach
 persecution can write thus. This detestable book, which seems the
 work of a madman, was composed by a person who has no ecclesiastical
 cure; for what real pastor would write in such a manner? The author
 has even carried his enthusiastic fury to such a length as to
 justify the massacre of St. Bartholomew. It might be supposed that a
 production full of such shocking paradoxes would be in the hands of
 almost every one, were it only on account of its singularity, and yet
 it seems to be hardly known.
 
 [11] See Ricaut.
 
 [12] See Kempfer, and all the accounts of Japan.
 
 [13] M. de la Bourdonnaie, intendant of Rouen, says that the
 manufacture of hats at Caudebec and Neufchâtel has greatly fallen off
 since the refugees left that county. M. Foucaut, intendant of Caen,
 says that trade in general has declined through the whole district;
 and M. de Maupeou, intendant of Poitiers, that the manufacture
 of druggets is quite lost. M. de Bezons complains that there is
 now hardly any trade stirring in Clérac and Nérac. M. Miroménil,
 intendant of Touraine, says that the trade of Tours has diminished
 near ten millions per annum, and all this through the persecution
 raised in that part of the kingdom. (See the Memorials of the
 Intendants in the year 1698.) To this, if we add the number of land
 and sea officers and common sailors who have been forced to engage
 in foreign services, frequently with fatal consequences to their own
 country, we shall then see whether or no persecution has been fatal
 to the state.
 
 We will not here presume to offer any hints to those ministers whose
 conduct and capacity are sufficiently known, and whose greatness of
 soul and nobleness of sentiment do honor to their illustrious birth;
 they will of themselves readily perceive that the restoration of
 our marine will require some indulgence at least to be shown to the
 inhabitants of our sea-coasts.
 
 [14] These disabilities no longer exist in Protestant countries.

 [18] Though the power of life and death in criminal matters had
 been taken from the Jews after the banishment of Archelaus into the
 country of the Allobroges and that Judæa had been governed as a
 province, nevertheless the Romans frequently winked at the exertion
 of a judicial power by these people on any particular occasion that
 related merely to those of their own sect, such as, for instance,
 when in any sudden tumult they out of zeal stoned to death the person
 whom they thought guilty of blasphemy.

 Christianos appellabat_.
 
 It is hardly probable that the name of Christian was already known
 in Rome. Tacitus wrote in the reigns of the Emperors Vespasian and
 Domitian, and he speaks of the Christians in the manner that was
 customary in his time. And here I must venture to assert that the
 words _Odio humani generis convicti_, may equally well be rendered
 agreeably to the style of this writer, _Convicted of being hated by
 mankind_, as _Convicted of hating all mankind_.
 
 And indeed, what was the employment of these first missionaries in
 Rome? They labored to gain a few proselytes by preaching a pure and
 simple moral doctrine; the humility of their hearts, and the modesty
 of their manners were equal to the lowliness of their condition and
 circumstances. Having been so lately separated from the Jews, they
 were hardly known in the world as a different sect; how then could
 they be hated by, or convicted of hating all mankind, to whom they
 were in a manner unknown?
 
 The Roman Catholics have been accused as the incendiaries of the city
 of London in the year 1666, but not till they had first occasioned
 civil wars on account of religion; and after several of that faith,
 though unworthy to be so, had been legally convicted of the Gunpowder
 Plot.
 
 But surely the case of the primitive Christians in the time of Nero
 was very different. It is no easy matter to clear up the obscurities
 of history. Even Tacitus himself says nothing that can afford a
 reason to suspect Nero of having set fire to Rome; and we might, with
 a greater appearance of probability, charge Charles II. with having
 lighted up the flames that laid London in ashes, to avenge the blood
 of his father, that had been so lately shed upon the scaffold to
 satisfy a rebellious people who thirsted for that blood. Charles had
 at least some excuse for such an action, whereas Nero had neither
 excuse, pretence, nor interest for the deed attributed to him.
 Reports of this kind have been common in every country among the
 populace, and even our own times have furnished us with some equally
 false and ridiculous.
 
 Tacitus, who was so well acquainted with the disposition of princes,
 could not have been a stranger to that of the common people, who
 are ever vain, inconstant, and violent in the opinions they adopt,
 incapable of discerning truth from falsehood, and ready to believe,
 assert, and forget everything.
 
 Philo says that “Sejanus persecuted the Jews under Tiberius, but
 that after the death of Sejanus, the emperor reinstated them in
 all their privileges,” one of which was, that of being denizens of
 Rome, notwithstanding the contempt they were held in by the Romans.
 As such, they had a share in the distribution of corn, and whenever
 such distribution happened to be made on the day that was their
 Sabbath, the portion allotted them was put by till the next day; this
 indulgence might probably be granted them in favor of the great sums
 of money with which they furnished the state; for they have purchased
 toleration in every country at a pretty high rate, though, it must be
 confessed, that they have soon found means to reimburse themselves.
 
 This passage of Philo’s clearly explains one in Tacitus, where he
 says that “Four thousand Jews or Egyptians were banished to Sardinia,
 where, if they had all perished, through the badness of the climate,
 it would have been no great loss.” _Vile damnum._
 
 Before I close this note, I shall observe that Philo speaks of
 Tiberius as a wise and just prince. I am very ready to believe that
 he was so, only where the being such was agreeable to his interest;
 but the good character given him here by Philo makes me at the same
 time greatly suspect the truth of those terrible crimes with which
 Tacitus and Suetonius reproach him. Nor can I think it likely that
 an infirm old man of seventy would have retired into the island of
 Caprera to indulge himself in the uninterrupted exercise of a refined
 debauchery, which appears to be hardly natural, and was, even in
 those days of licentiousness, unknown to the most abandoned of the
 Roman youth. Neither Tacitus nor Suetonius was acquainted with that
 emperor; but took these stories upon the credit of vulgar reports;
 Octavius and Tiberius Cæsar, and their successors, had been detested
 for reigning over a free people without their consent. All historians
 have taken a delight in bespattering their characters, and the world
 has taken them at their words for want of authentic memorials or
 chronicles in those times. Besides, as these writers do not quote
 any authority for what they advance, who could contradict them? They
 blackened whom they pleased, and wantonly directed the judgment of
 posterity. The wise and impartial reader will, however, readily
 perceive how far the veracity of historians is to be depended on, and
 what degree of credit is due to public facts attested by authors of
 reputation, born in a learned and enlightened nation, as well as what
 bounds to set to our belief of anecdotes, when related by these same
 authors, without any authority to support them.
 
 [21] We most certainly have a proper deference for whatever the Holy
 Church has made the objects of our reverence; accordingly, we invoke
 the blessed martyrs; but at the same time that we pay St. Laurence
 all due respect, may we not be permitted to doubt that St. Sixtus
 said to him: “You will follow me in three days.” That, during this
 short interval, the prefect of Rome made him demand a sum of money
 of the Christians; that Laurence had time to assemble all the poor
 people in that city; that he walked before the prefect, to show him
 the place where they were assembled; that he was afterwards tried
 and condemned to the torture; that the prefect ordered the smith to
 make a gridiron large enough to broil a man upon; that the principal
 magistrate of Rome assisted in person at this strange execution; and
 lastly that St. Laurence, while upon the gridiron, called out to him,
 “I am done enough on this side, let them turn me on the other, if you
 have a mind to eat me.” This same gridiron seems to have very little
 of the Roman genius in it; and besides, how happens it that we do not
 find a word of this story in any of the heathen writers?
 
 [22] We have only to open Virgil to be convinced that the Romans
 acknowledged one Supreme Being, the lord and master of all other
 heavenly beings.
 
          _O! quis res hominumque deumque_
  _Æternis regis imperiis, & fulmine terres,_
  _O pater, o hominum divumque æterna potestas, &c._
 
 And Horace expresses himself still more strongly:
 
  _Unde nil majus generatur ipso,_
  _Nec viget quidquam simile, aut secundum._
 
 In those mysteries into which almost all the Roman youths were
 initiated, nothing else was sung but the unity of God. See the
 noble hymn of Orpheus, and the letter of Maximus of Modarum to St.
 Augustine, in which he says that “None but fools can possibly deny
 a Supreme Being.” Longinus, who was a heathen, writes also to St.
 Augustine that “God is one, incomprehensible, ineffable.” Even
 Lactantius, who certainly cannot be charged with being too indulgent,
 acknowledges in his fifth book that “The Romans subjected all the
 other deities to the one supreme God;” _illos subjecit & mancipat
 Deo_. Tertullian also in his Apology confesses that “The whole empire
 acknowledged one God, ruler of the world, and infinite in power and
 majesty:” _Principem mundi perfectæ potentiæ & majestatis_. Again, if
 we look into Plato, who taught Cicero his philosophy, we shall there
 find him thus express himself: “There is but one God, whom we all
 ought to love and adore, and labor to resemble Him in integrity and
 holiness.” Epictetus in a dungeon, and Mark Antoninus on a throne,
 tell us the same in a hundred different passages of their writings.
 
 [23] Chap. 39.
 
 [24] Chap. 35.
 
 [25] Chap. iii.
 
 [26] This assertion requires to be proved. It cannot be denied that
 from the time that history succeeded to fiction, the Egyptians
 have constantly appeared to be a people as dastardly as they were
 superstitious. Cambyses made the conquest of their country in a
 single battle; Alexander gave them laws without striking a stroke,
 or without one of their cities daring to wait a siege. The Ptolemies
 subdued them with as little trouble, nor did Octavius and Augustus
 Cæsar find more difficulty in bringing them under their obedience.
 Omar overran all Egypt in one single campaign; the Mamelukes, who
 inhabited Colchis and the regions of Mount Caucasus, became their
 masters afterwards; and it was these people, and not the Egyptians,
 who defeated the army of St. Louis, and took that king prisoner. At
 length the Mamelukes having, in process of time, become Egyptians,
 that is to say, effeminate, cowardly, lazy, and dissipated, like the
 original natives of the climate, they were in three months’ time
 brought under the yoke of Selim I., who caused their Soldan to be
 hanged, and made their kingdom a province of the Turkish Empire,
 and such it will remain till other barbarians may hereafter make
 themselves masters of it.
 
 Herodotus relates that in the fabulous ages a king of Egypt called
 Sesostris left his country in order to go and make the conquest of
 the world; it is evident that such a design could only be worthy of
 a Don Quixote; and not to mention that the name Sesostris is not
 Egyptian, we may rank this event, like many others of the same date,
 among the romances and fairy tales. Nothing is more common among
 a conquered people than to tell strange stories of their former
 grandeur, just as, in some countries, certain wretched families,
 in want of the common necessaries of life, pride themselves upon
 being descended from ancient sovereigns. The Egyptian priests told
 Herodotus that this king, whom he called Sesostris, went on an
 expedition to conquer Colchis, which is much the same as if we were
 to say that a king of France set out from Touraine to conquer Norway.
 
 It avails not that these stories are found repeated in a thousand
 different writers; it makes them not a whit more probable; it is much
 more natural to suppose that the fierce and athletic inhabitants of
 Mount Caucasus, of Colchis, and the other parts of Scythia, who so
 often made incursions upon and ravaged Asia, might have penetrated as
 far as Egypt; and although the priests of Colchis might afterwards
 have carried back with them the form of circumcision, yet that is
 no kind of proof that they were ever conquered by the Egyptians.
 Diodorus Siculus tells us that all the kings who were conquered
 by Sesostris came every year from their own kingdoms to bring him
 their respective tributes, when Sesostris made them draw the chariot
 in which he went in triumph to the temples of his gods. These old
 women’s stories we see every day gravely copied by other writers; it
 must be confessed that these kings were very complaisant, to come
 every year so far to be made hackney horses of.
 
 As to their pyramids, and other monuments of antiquity, they prove
 nothing but the pride and bad taste of the Egyptian princes, and
 the wretched slavery of a weak people, who employed their strength,
 which was their only support, in pleasing the barbarous ostentation
 of their masters. The polity of these people, even in those times
 which are so much cried up, appears to have been both absurd and
 tyrannical; they pretended that the whole universe belonged to their
 monarchy. It well became such an abject race to set up for conquerors
 of the world!
 
 The profound learning which we find attributed to the Egyptian
 priests is also one of the most ridiculous absurdities in ancient
 history, that is to say, in fable. People who pretended that in a
 revolution of eleven thousand years the sun had risen twice in the
 west and set twice in the east in beginning his course anew were
 doubtless curious astronomers. The religion of these priests, who
 governed the state, was inferior even to that of the most savage
 people of America; every one knows that crocodiles, monkeys, cats,
 and onions were the objects of their adoration; and there is not
 perhaps in the world so absurd a worship, excepting that of the Great
 Lama.
 
 Their arts were as mean as their religion; there is not one ancient
 Egyptian statue fit to be seen; and whatever they had amongst them
 of any merit came from Alexandria in the times of the Ptolemies and
 Cæsars and was the work of Grecian artists; nay, they were even
 obliged to send to Greece for masters to teach them geometry.
 
 The illustrious Bossuet, in his discourse upon universal history,
 dedicated to the son of Louis the Fourteenth, runs wild in his
 encomiums upon the merits of the Egyptians; this may dazzle the
 understanding of a young prince, but will never satisfy men of
 learning. This production is a very fine piece of eloquence, but
 a historian should be more of the philosopher than the orator.
 The reflections here offered concerning the Egyptians are merely
 conjectural; for by what other name can we call anything that is said
 concerning antiquity?
 
 [27] Though we do not presume to doubt the suffering of St. Ignatius,
 yet, can any man of common understanding, who reads the account of
 his martyrdom, prevent some doubts from rising in his mind? The
 unknown author of this narrative says: “Trajan thought his glory
 would not be complete unless he subjected the God of the Christians
 to his obedience.” What a thought! Was Trajan the kind of man who
 could desire to triumph over the gods? The emperor is said to have
 thus accosted Ignatius when he was brought before him: “Who art thou,
 unclean spirit?” It is very unlikely that an emperor would have
 discoursed with a prisoner, or have passed sentence upon him himself;
 it is not customary for sovereign princes to do so. Trajan might
 possibly cause Ignatius to be brought before him, but he would not
 say to him, “Who art thou?” since he knew very well who he was. And
 as to the term “unclean spirit,” could it possibly have been used by
 such a man as Trajan? Is it not evident that this is an expression
 used in exorcising, and put by a Christian into the emperor’s mouth?
 Good heavens! what a style for Trajan.
 
 Can we imagine that Ignatius answered him that he was called
 Theophorus, because he carried Jesus in his heart, and that Trajan
 entered into a long conversation with him concerning Christ? They
 make Trajan say at the end of this conference: “We command that
 Ignatius, who glories in carrying within him the crucified man, be
 thrown into prison loaded with chains,” etc. A sophist, a foe to
 Christianity, might call Jesus Christ _the crucified man_; but it is
 hardly probable that such a term would have been used in a decree.
 The punishment of the cross was so common among the Romans that they
 could not in their law style think of distinguishing by the words
 “crucified man” the object of the Christians’ worship; nor is it in
 this manner that the laws or the emperors pronounced sentence.
 
 They afterwards make Ignatius write a long letter to the Christians
 of Rome. “I write to you,” says he, “though loaded with chains.”
 Certainly, if he was allowed to write to the Christians of Rome,
 those Christians were not considered as the objects of persecution;
 consequently, Trajan could have no design to subject their God to his
 obedience; or, on the other hand, if these Christians were actually
 liable to persecution, Ignatius was guilty of very great imprudence
 in regard to them, since this was betraying them to their enemies and
 making himself an informer against them.
 
 Surely those who had the compiling of these facts should have had
 greater regard to probability and the circumstances of the times. The
 martyrdom of St. Polycarp also occasions some doubts. It is said that
 a voice called to him from heaven, saying: “Courage, Polycarp!” that
 this voice was distinctly heard by the Christians, but by no other
 of the attendants: we are told also, that when Polycarp was tied to
 the stake, and the fire lighted round him, the flames parted asunder,
 and a dove flew out from the midst of them; and that this saint, to
 whom the fire showed so much respect, exhaled an aromatic odor that
 perfumed the whole assembly; nevertheless, he whom the fire dared
 not to approach, could not resist the edge of the sword. Surely we
 may hope for pardon if we discover more piety than truth in these
 relations.

 [29] The Catholic priests are now numbered by thousands in Great
 Britain and Ireland.
 
 [30] See Mr. Locke’s excellent letter upon toleration.
 
 [31] The Jesuit Busembaum, and his commentator, the Jesuit La Croix,
 tell us, that it “is lawful to kill any prince excommunicated by the
 Pope, of whatsoever country, because the whole world belongs to the
 Pope; and that whoever accepts of or executes such commission does a
 meritorious and charitable act.” It is this maxim which seems to have
 been invented in the madhouses of hell, that has almost stirred up
 all France against the Jesuits, who are now more than ever reproached
 for this doctrine, which they have so often preached, and as often
 disavowed. They have endeavored to justify themselves by producing
 nearly the same maxims in the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas and
 several Dominicans.* It is true, indeed, that this St. Thomas,
 the angelic Doctor and Interpreter of the Divine Will, advances
 that an apostate prince loses his right to the crown, and forfeits
 the obedience due to him from his subjects;† that the Church may
 condemn him to death; that the Emperor Julian was permitted to reign
 only because he was too powerful to be resisted: that we ought to
 kill every heretic:‡ that those who deliver a people from the
 government of a tyrannical prince, etc., etc. We have, doubtless, a
 great respect for the angel of the schools; but if he had preached up
 such maxims in France at the time of his brother James Clement, and
 the mendicant Ravaillac, his angelical doctorship would have met with
 but a scurvy reception.
 
                     * Peruse, if you can get it, the letter of a
                     layman to a divine on the subject of St. Thomas,
                     a Jesuitical pamphlet published in 1762.

 It must be confessed that John Gerson, chancellor of the University,
 carried the matter yet further than St. Thomas; and John Petit, the
 Franciscan, still further than Gerson. Several of the order openly
 maintained the detestable maxims of their brother Petit. It must be
 acknowledged that this hellish doctrine of king-killing proceeds
 wholly from the ridiculous notion which has so long prevailed amongst
 all orders of monks, that the Pope is a God upon earth, and can
 dispose of the crowns and lives of sovereigns at his pleasure. In
 this respect, we are inferior even to those Tartarian idolaters who
 held the Grand Lama to be immortal; greedily gather the contents of
 his close-stool, dry these precious relics with great care, enclose
 them in rich cases, and kiss them with the warmest devotion. For my
 part, I confess that I had rather, for the good of my country, and
 the sake of public tranquillity, carry those relics constantly about
 my neck, than to give my assent to the Pope’s having in any case
 whatsoever an authority over the temporals of kings, or even those of
 a private person.
 
 [32] Chap. ii. 11–14.
 
 [33] Deut. xiv.
 
 [34] Agreeable to my intention of making some useful notes upon this
 treatise, I shall here observe that although God is said to have
 made a covenant with Noah, and with all the beasts of the field, yet
 he permits him to eat of every thing that has the breath of life,
 excepting only the eating of blood, which he positively prohibits;
 and moreover adds that “the Lord will take vengeance of every beast
 by whom man’s blood shall be shed.”
 
 From these passages and several others of the like tenor, we may
 infer, with all the sages of ancient and present times, and with
 every person of enlightened conceptions, that beasts are endowed with
 some knowledge. We do not find God making a covenant with trees or
 with stones that have no sense; but He does with the beasts, whom
 it has pleased Him to endow with senses, frequently more exquisite
 than our own, and consequently with those ideas that are necessarily
 connected with sense. It is for this reason that He prohibits the
 barbarous custom of feeding upon their blood, the blood being the
 source of life, and consequently of sense. Take away all the blood
 from an animal and all his organs will immediately cease from action.
 It is therefore with the greatest justice that we find it said in so
 many different parts of the Holy Scripture, that the soul, that is to
 say, what was called the sensitive soul, is in the blood; an opinion
 perfectly agreeable to nature, and as such received by all nations.
 
 It is upon this opinion that we found that pity which we ought to
 show to all animals. It is one of the seven precepts of the Noachides
 that were adopted by the Jews, that no one shall eat the limb of a
 living animal. This precept is a proof that mankind had formerly the
 cruelty to mutilate animals in order to feast upon the limbs so cut
 off, and to leave the creatures living, in order to feed successively
 upon the other parts of their bodies; a custom which we find to
 have actually subsisted among some barbarous nations—witness the
 sacrifices offered in the island of Chios to _Bacchus Omadios_, or
 the eater of raw flesh. God, by permitting the flesh of animals to
 serve us for food, seems to recommend them to our humanity. It must
 be confessed that there is great cruelty in putting them to torture,
 and that nothing but custom could have lessened in us the natural
 abhorrence of slaughtering an animal that we have fed with our own
 hands. There have in all times been sects who have made a religious
 scruple of such practices, as do to this day all the inhabitants of
 the Peninsula of the Ganges. The whole sect of Pythagoreans, both in
 Greece and Italy, constantly abstained from the eating of flesh. And
 Porphyry, in his book upon “Abstinence,” reproaches his disciples
 with having quitted their sect only for the sake of indulging an
 inhuman appetite.
 
 It is in my opinion a giving up of the light of reason, to pretend
 to assert that beasts are no more than mere machines; for is it not
 a manifest contradiction to acknowledge that God has given them the
 organs of sense, and then to affirm that they have no sense?
 
 Besides, I think one must never have made any observation upon
 animals, not to distinguish in them the different cries of want,
 suffering, joy, fear, love, anger, and indeed all other affections of
 the mind or body; surely, it would be very strange that they should
 so well express what they have no sense of!
 
 This remark may furnish abundant matter of reflection to inquisitive
 minds, in relation to the power and goodness of the Creator, who has
 been pleased to bestow life, sense, ideas, and memory on those beings
 whose organs he has formed with His own all-powerful hand. As to us,
 we neither know how these organs are formed, how they are unfolded,
 in what manner we receive life, nor by what laws sense, ideas,
 memory, and will are annexed to that life; and yet in this dark and
 ternal state of ignorance inherent to our natures, we are perpetually
 disputing with, and persecuting one another, like the bulls of the
 field, who fight with their horns, without knowing for what use, or
 in what manner those horns were given them.

 [38] Deut. xii. 8.
 
 [39] Several writers have too rashly concluded from this passage that
 the chapter concerning the golden calf—which is no other than the
 Egyptian god Apis—has, as well as many other chapters, been added to
 the books of Moses.
 
 Eben-Ezra was the first who undertook to prove that the Pentateuch—or
 the five books of Moses—was written in the times of the Kings.
 Wollaston, Collins, Tindal, Shaftesbury, Bolingbroke, and many
 others have asserted that in those ages men had no other way of
 committing their thoughts to writing but by engraving them upon
 polished stone, brick, lead, or wood; and tell us that in the time
 of Moses the Chaldæans and Egyptians had no other way of writing,
 and that then they could engrave but in a very abridged manner, and
 by hieroglyphics, the substance only of such things as they thought
 worthy of being transmitted to posterity, and could never form any
 regular histories; then it was next to an impossibility to engrave
 books of any considerable bulk in the wilderness, where they were
 continually changing their habitation; where they had no person to
 furnish them with clothing, to make that clothing for them, or even
 to mend their sandals, and where God was obliged to perform a miracle
 to preserve the garments of His people entire. They say that it is
 hardly probable that there should have been so many engravers among
 them, at the time that they were so deficient in the more necessary
 arts of life, and did not know even how to make bread; and if we
 answer to this, that the pillars of the tabernacle were of brass, and
 their chapiters of massy silver they reply, that though the order for
 this might have been given in the wilderness, it was not executed
 till after they were settled in perfect tranquillity.
 
 They cannot conceive, they say, how the Israelites, who were a poor
 and vagabond people, could have asked for a calf of massy gold to
 be erected for the object of their adoration, at the foot of the
 very mountain where God was then talking with Moses, and in the very
 midst of the thunder and lightning, and the sound of the heavenly
 trumpet, which were heard and seen by all present. They profess
 their astonishment that it should have been only the day before
 Moses descended from the mountain, that all the people should have
 addressed themselves to his brother Aaron to raise this golden calf;
 or how it was possible for Aaron to have cast such an image in one
 single day; and still more, how Moses could have reduced it into an
 impalpable powder. They say that it is impossible for any artist to
 make a statue of gold in less than three months, and that not all the
 possible efforts of the chemical art are sufficient to reduce such a
 mass into a powder that may be swallowed, and consequently, that the
 prevarication of Aaron and this operation of Moses must have been two
 miracles.
 
 Deceived by the humanity and goodness of their hearts, they cannot
 believe that Moses slaughtered three and twenty thousand souls to
 expiate this crime; nor, that so many men would have tamely suffered
 themselves to be murdered without a third miracle. Lastly, they think
 it very extraordinary that Aaron, who was the most guilty of all,
 should have been rewarded for that very crime for which the rest
 underwent so dreadful a punishment, by being created high-priest, and
 go to offer sacrifice at the high altar, while the bodies of three
 and twenty thousand of his slaughtered brethren lay bleeding round
 him.
 
 They start the same difficulties concerning the eighty thousand
 Israelites who were slain by order of Moses, to atone for the crime
 of a single one of them, for being surprised with a Moabite woman;
 and seeing that Solomon, and so many other of the Jewish kings did,
 without being punished for it, take to themselves strange wives, they
 cannot conceive what great crime there could be in an individual
 making an alliance with one Moabite woman.
 
 Ruth was a Moabitess, though her family was originally of Bethlehem;
 the Scripture always distinguishes her by the name of Ruth the
 Moabitess; and yet she went and laid herself by the side of Boaz,
 received six measures of barley from him, was afterwards married to
 him, and was the grandmother of David. Rahab was not only a stranger,
 but also a common prostitute, or a harlot, as she is called in
 Scripture; yet she was taken to wife by Solomon, a prince of Judæa;
 from whom also David was descended. This Rahab is taken to be a
 type of the Christian church by several of the ancient fathers; and
 especially by Origen, in his seventh homily on Joshua.
 
 Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, by whom David begat Solomon, was a
 Hittite. And if we go farther back, we shall find that the patriarch
 Judah married a Canaanitess; and his sons lay with Thamar, who was of
 the race of Aaron; and the woman with whom Judah, without knowing it,
 committed incest, was not of the Israelitish race.
 
 Thus then was our Lord Jesus Christ pleased to take upon him flesh
 in a family descended from five aliens, to show that all nations
 should partake of his inheritance. The rabbi Eben-Ezra was, as we
 have already observed, the first who undertook to prove that the
 Pentateuch was compiled long after the time of Moses; and for his
 authority quotes several passages in those books; and amongst others
 the following: “The Canaanite then dwelt in that land. The mountain
 of Moriah, called the Mountain of God. The bed of Og, king of Bashan,
 is still to be seen in Rabah. And the country of Bashan is called
 the villages of Jaiar unto this day. Never was there a prophet
 seen in Israel like unto Moses. These are the kings who reigned in
 Edom, before any king reigned over Israel.” He pretends that these
 passages, in which mention is made of events that happened long after
 the time of Moses, could never have been written by Moses himself. To
 this it is replied, that these passages were added long after by way
 of notes by the transcribers.
 
 Newton, whose name ought on every other occasion to be mentioned with
 respect, but who, as a man, may have been liable to error, in the
 introduction to his commentaries upon Daniel and St. John, ascribes
 the five books of Moses, Joshua, and Judges to holy writers of much
 later date; and founds his opinion on the thirty-sixth chapter of
 Genesis, the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-first
 chapters of Judges, the eighth chapter of Samuel, the second chapter
 of Chronicles, and the fourth chapter of the book of Ruth; and
 indeed, considering that in the thirty-sixth chapter of Genesis
 we find mention made of Kings, and that David is spoken of in the
 books of Judges and that of Ruth, it should seem that those books
 were compiled in the times of the Kings. This is also the opinion
 of several divines, at the head of whom is the famous Le Clerc. But
 there are very few of those who are followers of this opinion, that
 have had the curiosity to fathom these mysteries; a curiosity which
 certainly makes no part of the duty of man. For when the learned and
 the ignorant, the prince and the peasant, shall, after this short
 life, appear together before the throne of Eternal Majesty, every
 one of us then will wish to have been just and humane, generous and
 compassionate; and no one will pride himself in having known exactly
 the year in which the Pentateuch was written, or in having been able
 to distinguish the true text from the additional notes in use among
 the Scribes. God will not ask us whether we were of the opinion of
 the Masorites against the Talmud, or whether we may not have mistaken
 a _Caph_ for a _Beth_, a _Yod_ for a _Vau_, or a _Daleth_ for a
 _Resh_. No, certainly; but he will judge us according to our deeds,
 and not according to our knowledge of the Hebrew language. Let us
 therefore abide firmly by the decision of the Church, so far as is
 agreeable to the reasonable duty of a believer.
 
 We will conclude this note with an important passage from Leviticus,
 a book composed after the time of the golden calf. The Jews are there
 commanded no more to offer their sacrifices to goats with whom they
 have gone a-whoring.* We cannot say whether this strange worship
 came from Egypt, the country of sorcery and superstition; but there
 is reason to believe, that the custom of our pretended magicians of
 keeping a Sabbath apart, for adoring a goat, and committing such
 detestable uncleanliness with it as is shocking to conception, came
 from the ancient Jews, as it is certain that they first taught a
 part of Europe the practice of magic. What a detestable people!
 Surely such infamous and unnatural practices deserve the punishment
 at least equal to that which befell them for worshipping the golden
 calf; and yet, we find the lawgiver contents himself with simply
 prohibiting those practices. We have quoted this subject only to show
 what the Jewish nation was; the sin of bestiality must certainly have
 been very common amongst them, since they are the only people we
 know among whom there was a necessity for any law to prohibit that
 crime, the commission of which was not even suspected by any other
 legislators.
 
                     * Leviticus vii. and xviii. 22.
 
 There is reason to believe that on account of the fatigues and
 distresses which the Jews suffered in the deserts of Paran, Horeb,
 and Kadash-Barnea, the female species, which is always the weakest,
 might have failed amongst them; and it is certain that the Jews were
 greatly in want of women, since we find them almost always commanded,
 when they conquered any town or village, to the right or left of the
 lake Asphaltes, to put all the inhabitants to the sword, excepting
 only the young women who were of an age to know man.
 
 The Arabs, who still inhabit a part of these deserts, stipulate to
 this day in the treaties which they make with the caravans, that
 they shall furnish them with marriageable women; so that it is not
 improbable but that the young men of those barren countries might
 have carried the depravation of human nature so far as to have
 had carnal commerce with goats, as is related of the shepherds of
 Calabria.
 
 It is still, however, uncertain whether any monsters were produced
 by this unnatural copulation, and whether there is any foundation
 for the ancient stories of satyrs, fauns, centaurs, and minotaurs;
 history says there is; but natural philosophy has not yet cleared up
 to us this monstrous circumstance.

 inhabited by a small Arabian horde or tribe, and may be about eight
 leagues long and about seven in breadth.

 [44] It is plain by the text that Jephthah did actually sacrifice his
 daughter. Doctor Calmet; in his dissertation upon Jephthah’s vow,
 says, that “God did not approve these vows; but when once any one had
 made them, he insisted upon their being fulfilled, was it only to
 punish those who made them, and to put a check upon them in the doing
 it by fear of being obliged to perform them.” This action of Jephthah
 is condemned by St. Augustine and almost all the fathers, although
 the Scripture says that he was filled with the spirit of God; and St.
 Paul in the eleventh chapter of his Epistle to the Hebrews, greatly
 praises Jephthah, exalting him even above Samuel and David.
 
 St. Jerome, in his Epistle to Julian, expresses himself thus;
 “Jephthah sacrificed his daughter to the Lord, and therefore the
 Apostle has placed him among the saints.” Here now is a diversity
 in opinions, concerning which it is not permitted us to pronounce a
 decision; nay, it is even dangerous to have any opinion of our own.
 
 [45] The death of Agag, king of the Amalekites, may be looked upon as
 a real sacrifice. Saul had made this prince a prisoner of war, and
 had admitted him to a capitulation notwithstanding that the priest
 and the prophet Samuel had charged him to spare no one; saying to him
 expressly: “Go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they
 have, and spare them not, but slay both man and woman, infant and
 suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.”—“And Samuel hewed Agag in
 pieces before the Lord at Gilgal.”
 
 “The zeal with which this prophet was animated,” says Calmet, “put a
 sword into his hand on this occasion, to revenge the honor of God,
 and to confound Saul.”
 
 In this melancholy adventure, we have a vow, a priest, and a victim;
 consequently, it is a real sacrifice. We find from history that most
 nations, the Chinese excepted, were wont to sacrifice human victims
 to the Deity; Plutarch says, that this custom prevailed even among
 the Romans at some certain times. Cæsar in his “Commentaries” tells
 us that the Germans were going to sacrifice two of his officers,
 whom he had sent to confer with their king, Ariovistus, had not
 Cæsar delivered them by beating the German army. I have in another
 place observed,* that this violation of the laws of nations, and
 the offering of human victims, which was rendered more horrible
 by its being done by the hands of their women, seems a little to
 contradict Tacitus’s panegyric on them in his treatise “_De Moribus
 Germanorum_,” which seems rather to have been designed as a satire
 upon the Roman people, than to praise the Germans, to whom he was an
 utter stranger. And here we may observe by the way, that Tacitus was
 fonder of satire than of truth; he labors to throw everything, even
 the most indifferent actions, into an odious point of light; and his
 malice pleases us as much as his style, because we are naturally fond
 of wit and slander.

 But to return to the subject of human sacrifices. This custom
 prevailed as much among our forefathers as with the Germans; it is
 the lowest degree of debasement to which human nature can fall when
 left to herself, and is one of the effects of the weakness of mortal
 understanding, which reasons thus: We ought to offer to God whatever
 we have of most pleasing or valuable; there is nothing more valuable
 than our children; therefore we ought to select the youngest and most
 beautiful to sacrifice them to the Deity.
 
 Philo says that the Canaanites used to offer their children in
 sacrifice, before God had commanded Abraham, as a trial of his faith,
 to offer up his only son, Isaac.
 
 Sanchoniathon, as quoted by Eusebius, says that the Phœnicians, when
 threatened with any great danger or distress, offered up the most
 favorite of their children, and that Ilus sacrificed his son, Jehud,
 much about the same time that God made the trial of Abraham’s faith.
 It is very difficult to penetrate into the dark recesses of early
 antiquity; but it is too melancholy a truth that these horrible
 sacrifices were almost everywhere in use; and men have laid them
 aside, only in proportion as they have become civilized. So true is
 it that civilization is the nurse of humanity.

 [52] Those who are unacquainted with the customs of antiquity,
 and who judge only from what they see about them, may possibly be
 astonished at this odd command; but they should reflect, that at
 those times it was the custom in Egypt, and most part of Assyria, to
 express things by hieroglyphical figures, signs, and types.
 
 The prophets, who were called seers by the Egyptians and Jews,
 not only expressed themselves in allegories, but also represented
 by signs those events which they foretold. Thus we find Isaiah,
 the chief of the four greater prophets, taking a roll and writing
 therein, “Maher-Shalal-Hashbaz,” that is, “Make haste to the spoil”;
 and going in unto the prophetess, she conceived and bare a son, whom
 the Lord called Maher-Shalal-Hashbaz. This is a type of the evils
 which were to be brought upon the Jews by the people of Egypt and
 Assyria.
 
 The prophet also says: “Before that the child shall be of an age to
 eat butter and honey, to refuse the evil and choose the good, the
 land that they abhorred shall be delivered of both her kings; and the
 Lord will hiss to the flies of Egypt, and for the bees of Assyr, and
 the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired, the beard and the
 hair of the feet of the king of Assyria.”*
 
                     * Isaiah vii. 15–18.
 
 This prophecy of the bees, and of the shaving of the beard, and of
 the hair of the feet, can be understood only by those who know that
 it was a custom to call the swarms of bees together by the sound of a
 flageolet or pipe, or some other rustic instrument; that the greatest
 affront that could be done to any man was to cut off his beard; and
 that the hair on the private parts was called the hair of the feet,
 which was never shaven but in cases of leprosy, or other unclean
 disorders. All these figures, which would appear so strange in our
 style, signify nothing more than that the Lord will, in the course of
 a few years, deliver His people from captivity.
 
 We find the same prophet walking naked and barefoot to show that
 the king of Assyria shall lead away the Egyptians and Ethiopians
 captives, without their having wherewithal to cover their
 nakedness.†

 The prophet Ezekiel eats the roll of parchment which God had given
 him; afterwards he eats his bread covered with excrement, and
 continues to lie on his left side three hundred and ninety days,
 and forty days on his right side, to show that the Jews should want
 bread, and as a type of the number of years they were to remain in
 captivity. He loads himself with chains, as a figure of those that
 they are to wear; and he cuts off the hair of his head and of his
 beard, and divides them into three parts; the first of these portions
 is a type of those who are to perish in the city of Jerusalem; the
 second, of such as are to be slain without the walls; and the third,
 of those who are to be carried away to Babylon.‡
 
                     ‡ Ezek. iv. seq.
 
 The prophet Hosea takes to himself a woman who is an adulteress, and
 whom he purchases for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer
 and a half of barley, and says unto her: “Thou shalt abide for me
 many days, thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for
 another man, for so shall the children of Israel abide many days
 without a king, and without a prince, and without an image, and
 without an ephod, and without teraphim”;§ in a word, the seers or
 prophets scarcely ever foretell anything without using a type or sign
 of the thing foretold.
 
                     § Hosea iii.
 
 Jeremiah therefore only conformed to the usual custom when he bound
 himself with cords, and put bonds and yokes upon his neck, as figures
 of the approaching slavery of those to whom he sent them, and if we
 attend properly to these things, we shall find the times here spoken
 of to be like those of an old world, differing in everything from the
 new society. The laws, the manner of making war, were all absolutely
 different; and if we only open Homer and the first book of Herodotus,
 we need nothing more to convince us that there is not the least
 resemblance between the people of early antiquity and ourselves;
 hence we ought to distrust our own judgment, when we attempt to
 compare their manners with ours. Even nature herself is not now the
 same she was then; magicians and sorcerers had at that time a power
 over her which they no longer possess; they enchanted serpents, they
 raised the dead out of their tombs, etc. God sent dreams, and men
 interpreted them. The gift of prophecy was common. And we read of
 several metamorphoses, such as of Nebuchadnezzar into an ox, of Lot’s
 wife into a pillar of salt, and of five whole cities changed in an
 instant into a burning lake.
 
 There were likewise several species of men that no longer exist. The
 race of giants, Rephaim, Emim, Nephilim, and Enacim, have totally
 disappeared. St. Augustine, in his fifth book “_De Civitate Dei_,”
 says that he saw a tooth of one of those ancient giants that was
 at least a hundred times as large as one of our grinders. Ezekiel
 speaks of pygmies (_Gamadim_), not above a cubit high, who fought at
 the siege of Tyre; and almost all writers, sacred and profane, have
 agreed in the truth of these relations.
 
 In fine, the ancient world was so different from ours that there is
 no drawing any rule for our conduct from it; and if in the earliest
 ages of antiquity we find mankind mutually persecuting and destroying
 one another on account of their different faiths, far be it from
 us, who live under the enlightened law of grace, to copy after such
 originals.

 [57] There is but one passage in the whole Mosaic law from which one
 might conclude that Moses was acquainted with the reigning opinion
 among the Egyptians, that the soul did not die with the body. This
 passage is very particular, and is in the eighteenth chapter of
 Deuteronomy: “There shall not be found among you any one that useth
 divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,
 or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits (Python), or a
 wizard, or a necromancer.” From this passage it appears that by
 invoking the souls of the dead this pretended necromancy supposed a
 permanency of the soul. It might also happen that the necromancers
 of whom Moses speaks, being but ignorant deceivers, might not have a
 distinct idea of the magic they operated. They made people believe
 that they forced the dead to speak, and by the power of their art
 restored the body to the same state as when living; without once
 examining whether their ridiculous operations might authorize the
 doctrine of the immortality of the soul. The ancient magicians were
 never philosophers; they were at best but a set of stupid jugglers,
 who played their tricks before as illiterate spectators.
 
 But what is very strange and worthy of observation is that the word
 “python” should be found in Deuteronomy so long before that Greek
 term was known to the Hebrews; and indeed this word is not to be
 found in the Hebrew, of which we have never had a good translation.
 
 There are many insurmountable difficulties in this language; it is a
 mixture of Phœnician, Egyptian, Syriac, and Arabic, and has undergone
 many alterations to the present time. The Hebrew verbs had only two
 moods, the present and the future; the rest were to be guessed at
 by the sense. The different vowels were frequently expressed by the
 same characters, or rather, indeed, they were not expressed at all;
 and the inventors of points have only increased the difficulties they
 meant to remove. Every adverb had twenty different significations,
 and the same word had frequently several contrary senses. Add to this
 that the language was in itself very dry and barren; for the Jews,
 not being acquainted with the arts, could not express what they knew
 nothing of. In a word, the Hebrew is to the Greek what the language
 of a pedant is to that of an academic.
 
 [58] Ezek. xviii. 20.
 
 [59] The opinion of Ezekiel was at length the prevailing one of the
 synagogue; not but that there were always some Jews who, though they
 believed in a state of eternal punishment, yet believed at the same
 time that God punished the sins of the fathers upon the children.
 At present, indeed, they are punished even beyond the fiftieth
 generation, and yet are in danger of eternal punishment. It may be
 asked how the offsprings of those Jews who were not concerned in
 putting Christ to death can be temporarily punished in the persons
 of their children, who were as innocent as themselves. This temporal
 punishment, or rather this manner of living, so different from all
 other people, and of trading over the whole earth without having any
 country of their own, cannot be considered as a punishment, compared
 with what they are to expect hereafter on account of their unbelief,
 and which they might avoid by a sincere repentance.
 
 [60] Ezek. xx. 25.
 
 [61] Those who have thought to discover the doctrine of hell and
 heaven, such as it is now believed by us, in the Mosaic books, have
 been strangely mistaken; their error is owing entirely to an idle
 dispute about words: the Vulgate having translated the Hebrew word
 _Sheol_, the pit, by the Latin word _infernum_, and this latter
 having been rendered in French by _enfer_, hell, they have taken
 occasion from this equivocal translation to establish a belief that
 the ancient Hebrews had a notion of the _Hades_ and _Tartarus_ of the
 Greeks, known to other nations before them by different appellations.
 
 We are told in the sixteenth chapter of Numbers, that the earth
 opened her mouth and swallowed up Korah, Dathan, and Abiron, and they
 and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit, or
 grave; now certainly there is nothing said in this passage concerning
 the souls of these three persons, nor yet of the torments of hell,
 nor of eternal punishments.
 
 It is very extraordinary that the authors of the “_Dictionnaire
 Encyclopédique_” under the word _hell_ (_enfer_) should say that the
 ancient Hebrews believed in its existence. If this be true, there
 would be an insurmountable contradiction in the Pentateuch; for why
 should Moses have spoken of the punishment after death in one single
 passage only, of all his works. On this occasion they quote the
 thirty-second chapter of Deuteronomy; but after a mutilated manner.
 The whole passage is as follows: “They have moved me to jealousy with
 that which is not God, they have provoked me to anger with their
 vanities, and I will move them to jealousy with those that are not
 a people, I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. For a
 fire is kindled in my anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell;
 and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the
 foundations of the mountains. I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will
 spend mine arrows upon them. They shall be burnt with hunger, and
 devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction; I will also
 send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of
 the dust.”
 
 But have any or all of these expressions the least relation to the
 idea of hell-torments? On the contrary, it seems as if these words
 were purposely inserted to prove that our hell was unknown to the
 ancient Jews.
 
 The author of this article quotes also the following passage from
 the twenty-fourth chapter of Job: “The eye of the adulterer waiteth
 for the twilight, saying, no eye shall see me, and disguiseth his
 face. In the dark they dig through houses which they had marked for
 themselves in the daytime. They know not the light, for the morning
 is to them as the shadow of death; if one know them, they are in the
 terrors of the shadow of death. He is swift as the waters, their
 portion is cursed in the earth, he beholdeth not the way of the
 vineyards. Drought and heat consume the snow-waters, so doth the
 grave those who have sinned.”
 
 I quote these passages entire, otherwise it will be impossible to
 form a true idea of them. But let me ask if there is the least
 expression here from which one may conclude that Moses ever taught
 the Jews the clear and simple doctrine of eternal rewards and
 punishments?
 
 Not to mention that the Book of Job has nothing to do with the Mosaic
 law, there is great reason to believe that Job himself was not a
 Jew; this is the opinion of St. Jerome in his “Hebrew Questions upon
 Genesis.” The word Satan, which occurs in Job, was not known to the
 Jews, nor is it anywhere to be found in the five books of Moses. This
 name, as well as those of Gabriel and Raphael, were entirely unknown
 to the Jews before their captivity in Babylon. It would appear, then,
 that Job is very improperly quoted in this place.
 
 But the last chapter of Isaiah is likewise brought in, where it is
 said: “And it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another,
 and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship
 before me, saith the Lord. And they shall go forth and look upon the
 carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me; for their
 worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched, and they
 shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.”
 
 Certainly, the casting out of these bodies to the view of all
 passengers, even to abhorring, and their being eaten by worms, can
 never mean that Moses taught the Jews the doctrine of the immortality
 of the soul; and the words “the fire shall not be quenched” can as
 little signify that the bodies so exposed to public view were to
 suffer eternal torments in hell.
 
 How can any one quote a passage in Isaiah to prove that the Jews in
 the time of Moses had adopted the doctrine of the immortality of
 the soul? According to the Hebrew computation, Isaiah prophesied
 about the year of the world 3380. Moses lived about the year 2500;
 therefore there was a distance of eight centuries between the one and
 the other. Now it is an insult to common sense, a downright mockery,
 thus to abuse the licence of quoting, by pretending to prove that a
 writer was of this or that opinion from a passage in another writer
 who lived eight hundred years after him, and who has not even made
 any mention of such opinion. It is beyond contradiction that the
 immortality of the soul, and rewards and punishments after death, are
 clearly and positively expressed and declared in the New Testament,
 and it is equally certain, that nothing concerning them is to be
 found in any one part of the five books of Moses.
 
 Notwithstanding that the Jews did afterwards embrace this doctrine,
 they were far from having a proper idea of the spirituality of the
 soul; they thought, in common with most other nations, that the
 soul was an uncompounded aerial light substance that retained the
 appearance of the body it had formerly animated; and hence came the
 term apparition, manes of the dead. Several fathers of the Church
 were of the same opinion. Tertullian, in his twenty-second chapter
 “_De Anima_,” expresses himself thus: “_Definimus animam Dei flatu
 natam, immortalem, corporalem, effigiatam, substantia simplicem_”;
 that is, “We define the soul a substance, formed by the breath of
 God; of an immortal, corporeal, figurative, and simple nature.”
 
 St. Irenæus, in the thirty-fourth chapter of his second book,
 says: “_Incorporales sunt animæ quantum ad comparationem mortalium
 corporum_.” “Souls are incorporeal in comparison of mortal bodies.”
 Adding, “Christ has taught us that the soul retains the image of the
 body”; “_Caracterem corporum in quo adoptantur_,” etc. Christ does
 not appear ever to have taught such a doctrine, and it is difficult
 to understand what St. Irenæus means in this passage.
 
 St. Hilarius, in his commentary on St. Matthew, is still more express
 and positive; he roundly asserts the soul to have a corporeal
 substance, “_Corpoream naturæ suæ substantiam sortiuntur_.”
 
 St. Ambrose on Abraham, book ii. chap. viii., will have it that
 there is nothing free from matter, unless it be the substance of the
 Blessed Trinity.
 
 These reverend fathers seem to have been very indifferent
 philosophers; but there is the greatest reason to believe that their
 divinity was in the main very sound, inasmuch as, notwithstanding
 their ignorance of the incomprehensible nature of the soul, they
 asserted it to be immortal, and endeavored to make it Christian.
 
 We know that the soul is of a spiritual nature, but we do not at all
 know what spirit is. We are very imperfectly acquainted with matter;
 nor is it possible for us to have a distinct idea of what is not
 matter. Hardly capable of understanding what effects our senses have,
 we cannot of ourselves know anything of what surpasses the bound of
 those senses. We carry some few words of our common language into the
 inexplorable depths of metaphysics and divinity, in order to acquire
 some slight idea of those things, which we could never conceive or
 express; and we use those words as props to support the steps of our
 feeble understandings in travelling through those unknown regions.
 
 Thus we make use of the word spirit, which is the same as breath or
 air, to express something which is not matter; and this word breath,
 air, spirit, inspiring us insensibly with an idea of an uncompounded
 and light substance, we still refine upon this as much as possible,
 in order to obtain a proper conception of pure and simple
 spirituality; but we shall never be able to obtain a distinct notion
 of this, we do not even know what we say, when we pronounce the word
 substance; in its literal signification, it signifies something
 beneath, and thereby shows us that it is incomprehensible; for what
 is meant by that which is beneath? The knowledge of the secrets of
 God is not to be acquired in this life. Plunged as we are in mortal
 obscurity, we fight against one another, and strike at random in the
 darkness with which we are surrounded, without precisely knowing for
 what we are fighting.
 
 If mankind would consider all this with attention, every reasonable
 person will be ready to conclude that we ought to have the greatest
 indulgence for the opinions of others, and by our conduct endeavor to
 merit the same from them.
 
 The above remarks are not at all foreign to the principal point in
 question, which is to know whether men are bound to tolerate one
 another; inasmuch as by proving that in all times those of different
 opinions have been alike mistaken, it appears to have been the duty
 of all mankind in every age to treat each other with kindness and
 forbearance.
 
 [62] The doctrine of predestination is of long standing and
 universal; we find it in Homer. Jupiter was desirous to save the
 life of his son Sarpedon; but destiny had marked him for death, and
 Jupiter was obliged to submit. Destiny was, with the philosophers,
 either the necessary concatenation of causes and effects necessarily
 produced by nature, or that same concatenation ordained by
 Providence; the latter of which is most reasonable. We find the
 whole system of fatality or predestination, comprised in this line
 of Annæus Seneca: “_Ducunt volentem fata, nolentem trahunt_.” It has
 always been acknowledged that God governs the universe by eternal,
 universal and immutable laws; this truth gave rise to the many
 unintelligible disputes concerning free-will, which had never been
 defined before the great philosopher Locke arose, who has proved it
 to be the power of acting. God bestows this power, and man, acting
 freely according to the eternal decrees of Providence, is one of the
 wheels of the great machine of the universe. Free-will has been a
 subject of disputation from all antiquity; but no one until of late
 times was ever persecuted on this subject. How horrible, how absurd
 is it to have imprisoned and banished on account of this dispute a
 Pompone d’Andilly, an Arnauld, a Nicole, a Sacy, and so many others
 who were the shining lights of France!
 
 [63] The theological romance of the Metempsychosis came from India,
 a part of the world to which we are indebted for many more fables
 than is generally believed. We find this doctrine explained by that
 beautiful poet Ovid, in the twelfth book of his “_Metamorphoses_.”
 It has been received in almost every part of the world, and has
 everywhere met with its opposers; nevertheless, we do not find that
 any priest among the ancients ever caused a disciple of Pythagoras to
 be sent to prison.
 
 [64] Neither the ancient Jews, the Egyptians, nor the Greeks, their
 contemporaries, believed that the soul of man went to heaven after
 death. The Jews thought that the sun and moon were placed some
 leagues above us in the same circle, and that the firmament was a
 thick and solid vault, that supported the weight of the waters,
 which, however, sometimes ran out through the crevices in this
 vault. The ancient Greeks placed the palace of their gods upon Mount
 Olympus. And the abode of heroes after death was, in Homer’s time,
 thought to be in an island beyond the ocean. This likewise was the
 opinion of the Essenians.
 
 After Homer, planets were assigned to the gods; but there was no more
 reason for men to place a god in the moon than for the inhabitants
 of the moon to place a god in our planet of the earth. Juno and Iris
 had no other palaces assigned them but the clouds, where there was
 no place to rest the soles of their feet. Among the Sabæans every
 deity had its star. But as the stars are little suns, it would be
 impossible to live there without partaking of the nature of fire.
 Upon the whole, then, it is needless to inquire what the ancients
 thought of heaven; since the best answer that can be given is, they
 thought nothing about it.
 
 [65] Matthew xxii. 1–13.
 
 [66] St. Luke xiv.
 
 [67] It was indeed very difficult, not to say impossible, for the
 Jews to comprehend, without an immediate revelation, the ineyable
 mystery of the incarnation of God, the Son of God. In the sixth
 chapter of Genesis we find the sons of great men called “the sons of
 God.” In like manner the royal Psalmist calls the tall cedars “the
 cedars of God.” Samuel says, “The fear of God fell upon the people”;
 that is, a violent fear seized them. A great tempest is called the
 wind of the Lord, and Saul’s distemper, the melancholy of the Lord.
 Nevertheless, the Jews seemed to have clearly understood that our
 Saviour called Himself the Son of God in the proper sense of that
 word; and if they looked upon this as a blasphemous expression, it
 is an additional proof of their ignorance of the incarnation, and
 of God, the Son of God, being sent upon earth for the redemption of
 mankind.

 PUBLISHER'S PREFACE
 
 
 Voltaire wrote what the people thought, and consequently his writings
 were universally read. He wittily ridiculed established abuses, and
 keenly satirized venerable absurdities. For this he was consigned to the
 Bastile, and this distinction served to increase his popularity and
 extend his influence. He was thus enabled to cope successfully with the
 papal hierarchy, and laugh at the murmurs of the Vatican. The struggle
 commenced in his youth, and continued till his death. It was a struggle
 of light against darkness--of freedom against tyranny; and it ended in
 the triumph of truth over error and of toleration over bigotry.
 
 Educated by the Jesuits, he early learned their methods, and his great
 ability enabled him to circumvent their wiles. The ceremonious
 presentation of his tragedy of _Mahomet_[1] to Pope Benedict XIV., is an
 example of his daring audacity;--his success with the "head of the
 church" shows his intellectual superiority--whilst the gracious reply of
 "his Holiness" fitly illustrates the pontiff's vanity. From priest to
 bishop, from cardinal to pope, all felt his intellectual power and all
 dreaded his merciless satire.
 
 [Illustration: Voltaire at seventy.]
 
 He was famous as poet, dramatist, historian, and philosopher. An
 experienced courtier and polished writer, he gracefully and politely
 conquered his clerical opponents, and with courteous irony overthrew his
 literary critics. From his demeanor you could not judge of his thoughts
 or intentions, and while listening to his compliments, you instinctively
 dreaded his sarcasms. But venture to approach this grand seigneur, this
 keen man of the world, this intellectual giant, and plead in favor of
 human justice--appeal to his magnanimity and love of toleration--and you
 then had no cause to question his earnestness, no reason to doubt his
 sincerity. His blood boiled, says Macaulay,[2] at the sight of cruelty
 and injustice, and in an age of religious persecution, judicial torture,
 and arbitrary imprisonment, he made manful war, with every faculty he
 possessed, on what he considered as abuses; and on many signal
 occasions, placed himself gallantly between the powerful and the
 oppressed. "When an innocent man was broken on the wheel at Toulouse,
 when a youth, guilty only of an indiscretion, was beheaded at Abbéville,
 when a brave officer, borne down by public injustice, was dragged, with
 a gag in his mouth, to die on the Place de Grêve, a voice instantly went
 forth from the banks of Lake Leman, which made itself heard from Moscow
 to Cadiz, and which sentenced the unjust judges to the contempt and
 detestation of all Europe."
 
 "None can read these stories of the horrible religious bigotry of the
 day," says Alex. A. Knox, in _The Nineteenth Century_,[3] "without
 feeling for Voltaire reverence and respect."
 
 The following extract from the above named Review will explain the
 religious cruelty to which Macaulay refers:
 
      "Jean Calas, a Protestant, kept a small shop in Toulouse. He had a
      scape-grace of a son, Marc Antoine by name, who hanged himself in
      his father's shop. The poor father and mother were up stairs at the
      time, at supper, in company with the second son. The evidence was
      so clear that a coroner's jury at a public-house would not have
      turned round upon it. The priests and the priest party got hold of
      it, and turned it into a religious crime. The Protestant, or
      Huguenot parents were charged with murdering their son for fear he
      should turn Catholic. The body was taken to the Hôtel de Ville, and
      then escorted by priests to the cathedral. The religious
      orders--White Penitents and others--held solemn ceremonies for the
      repose of Marc Antoine's soul. The churches resounded with the
      exhortations of the priests, informing the people what evidence was
      required to procure the condemnation of the Calas, and directing
      them to come forward as witnesses. Upon such assumptions as these
      horrible people could devise, the poor old man was stretched till
      his limbs were torn out of the sockets. He was then submitted to
      the _question extraordinaire_. This consisted in pouring water into
      his mouth from a horn till his body was swollen to twice its size.
      The man had been drowned a hundred times over, but he was still
      alive. He was then carried to the scaffold and his limbs were
      broken with an iron bar, and he was left for two hours to die. He
      did not then die, and so the executioner strangled him at last; but
      he died without confessing his crime. The man was innocent; he had
      no confession to make. The poor creature by his unutterable agony
      thus saved the lives of his wife and family, all as innocent as
      himself. Two daughters were thrust into a convent: a son shammed
      conversion to Catholicism and was released. The servant escaped
      into a convent. The property of the family was confiscated. The
      poor mother slipped away unseen. Finally, another son, who had been
      apprenticed to a watchmaker of Nismes, escaped to Geneva. This is a
      picture of France in the eighteenth century.
 
      "Voltaire took poor young Calas into his family. He tried at once
      to interest the Cardinal de Bernis, the Duc de Choiseul, and others
      in this horrible story. He found for the widow a comfortable
      retreat at Paris; he employed the best lawyers he could find to
      give practical form to the business; he sent the daughters to join
      the mother. He paid all the expenses out of his own pocket. He
      reached the Chancellor; he made his appeal to Europe. He employed a
      clever young advocate M. Elie de Beaumont, to conduct the cast. The
      Queen of England, Frederick the Great, Catharine of Russia, were
      induced by Voltaire to help the Calas.
 
      "The case of the Sirvens was well-nigh as bad as that of the Calas.
      Sirven lived with his wife and three daughters, all Protestants,
      near Toulouse. The story is so illustrative of the France of the
      eighteenth century, and of what Voltaire was about, that it
      deserves a few lines. Sirven's housekeeper, a Roman Catholic, with
      the assent of the Bishop of Castres, spirited away the youngest
      daughter, and placed her in a convent of the Black Ladies with a
      view to her conversion. She returned to her parents in a state of
      insanity, her body covered with the marks of the whip. She never
      recovered from the cruelties she had endured at the convent. One
      day, when her father was absent on his professional duties, she
      threw herself into a well, at the bottom of which she was found
      drowned. It was obvious to the authorities that the parents had
      murdered their child because she wished to become a Roman Catholic.
      They most wisely did not appear, and were sentenced to be hanged
      when they could be caught. In their flight the married daughter
      gave premature birth to a child; and Madame Sirven died in despair.
      It took Voltaire ten years to get this abominable sentence
      reversed, and to turn wrong into right.
 
      "A Protestant gentleman, M. Espinasse, had been condemned to the
      galleys for life and his estate confiscated because he had given
      supper and lodging to a Protestant clergyman. He served
      twenty-three years; but in 1763 Voltaire obtained his release, and
      ultimately obtained back for the family a portion of their
      property.
 
      "The Chevalier de la Barre was another victim. Some person or
      persons unknown had hacked with a knife a wooden crucifix which
      stood on a bridge at Abbéville over the Somme. The same night a
      crucifix on one of the cemeteries was bespattered with mud. The
      bishop of the place set to work to stir up excitement, praying for
      punishment 'on those who had rendered themselves worthy of the
      severest punishment known to the world's law.' Young De la Barre
      was arrested. The evidence against him was that he, with certain
      companions, had been known to pass within thirty yards of a
      procession bearing the Sacrament without taking off their hats. It
      was further proved in evidence that he and his friends had sung
      certain objectionable songs, and that not only some novels had been
      found in his rooms, but also two small volumes of Voltaire's
      _Dictionnaire Philosophique_. On this evidence he was sentenced to
      be subjected to the torture, ordinary and extraordinary; to have
      his tongue torn out by the roots with pincers of iron, to have his
      right hand cut off at the door of the principal church at
      Abbéville, to be drawn in a cart to the market-place, and there to
      be burned to death by a slow fire. The sentence was mitigated so
      far that he was allowed to be beheaded before he was burned. This
      sentence was carried out on the 1st of July, 1766. These are
      samples of what was occurring in France. Was there not enough to
      rouse indignation to fever-heat?
 
      "When one reads such stories, even at this distance of time, he
      understands the French Revolution and Voltaire."
 
 In all his writings Voltaire claimed to be religious, and was as ready
 to oppose with his sarcasms the agnostic or atheist, as the catholic. In
 speaking of Tully as a doubter, he makes Pococurante exclaim: "I once
 had some liking for his philosophical works; but when I found he
 doubted of everything, I thought I knew as much as himself, and had no
 need of a guide to learn ignorance."
 
 But while Voltaire was a Theist--as Lord Brougham says,[4] "without any
 hesitation or any intermission, a Theist"--and was a firm believer in
 the existence of a Creator and ruler of the universe,--he was also an
 avowed opponent of Catholicism; and when not engaged in the production
 of works which have added dignity to the literature of France, his life
 was passed in open warfare with the church of Rome. To this church he
 was as sincerely opposed as Martin Luther, and although his methods of
 attack and opposition differed entirely from that of the great German
 reformer, who shall say that his efforts have not proved even more
 successful? Macaulay has shown[5] that no Catholic nation has become
 Protestant since the period of the Reformation; while on the other hand,
 no nation once Protestant, has returned to Catholicism. Each party has
 retained its own territory, and the only gain has been in favor of
 religious freedom. The sincere and earnest appeals of Luther, which
 convulsed Germany, produced but little or no effect on the versatile
 mind of France. But the brilliant writings of Voltaire were welcomed by
 his countrymen, and have not been without their influence on French
 civilization. And although France has not been claimed as a protestant
 nation, yet freethinkers have there attained great power and influence,
 whilst Germany, once the stronghold of Protestantism, is now the chosen
 and hospitable home of freethought.
 
 Voltaire in his day was an acknowledged leader of public opinion. His
 thoughts engrossed the attention of the world. "Whole nations," says
 Quinet,[6] "emulously repeat every syllable that falls from his pen:"
 and the lapse of time has but confirmed the verdict of his
 cotemporaries, that of all the great reformers, his writings are the
 most useful to mankind.
 
 "If we judge of men by what they have _done_" says Lamartine,[7] "then
 Voltaire is incontestably the greatest writer of modern Europe. No one
 has caused, through the powerful influence of his genius alone, and the
 perseverance of his will, so great a commotion in the minds of men; his
 pen aroused a world, and has shaken a far mightier empire than that of
 Charlemagne, the European empire of a theocracy. His genius was not
 _force_ but _light_. Heaven had destined him not to destroy but to
 illuminate, and wherever he trod light followed him, for reason (which
 is _light_) had destined him to be first her poet, then her apostle, and
 lastly her idol."
 
 At seventeen years of age Voltaire wrote _Œdipus_, at eighty-three he
 wrote _Irène_. During the intervening years he enriched the world of
 thought with seventy volumes of irresistible humor--of brilliant and
 caustic wit,--in truth, a mine of literary gems undimmed with
 mediocrity's prosy dullness. In fact, it was this quality of humor and
 mirth that made Voltaire's writings so distasteful to his opponents--so
 welcome to mankind. Other writers, who went far beyond Voltaire, were
 not considered dangerous, because they were never read. They were
 sincere and learned, but tedious and austere. Their disbelief was
 condoned by its metaphysical obscurity--their skepticism was redeemed by
 its unmitigated dullness. But with Voltaire the case was very different.
 His writings were read and appreciated by old or young, grave or gay,
 sage or sophist, prince or peasant. To answer him was impossible--to
 abuse him was thought commendable.
 
 "Napoleon, during fifteen years," says Lamartine,[8] "paid writers who
 degrade, vilify, and deny the genius of Voltaire; he hated his name as
 _might_ must ever _hate intellect_; and so long as men yet cherished the
 memory of Voltaire--so long he felt his position was not secure." The
 church voluntarily joined in this work of aspersion. To the priests it
 was no hardship,--it was a welcome task--a labor of love. They hated the
 writings they could not answer--the genius they could not destroy.
 
 "The church," says Macaulay,[9] "made no defense, except by acts of
 power. Censures were pronounced; books were seized; insults were offered
 to the remains of infidel writers but no Bossuet, no Pascal, came forth
 to encounter Voltaire. There appeared not a single defense of the
 catholic doctrine which produced any considerable effect, or which is
 even now remembered."
 
 "His element," says Schlosser,[10] "was the lighter kind of poetry, and
 his fugitive verses, his sharp wit, his bold opinions, produced effects
 in his time, like flashes of lightning, for they illuminated at the same
 time the night of Jesuitical superstition, and struck and shivered to
 pieces the majestic towers and gothic domes of the middle ages.
 
 "The so-called fugitive pieces alone, if he had written nothing else,
 would have been sufficient to secure Voltaire's immortality; for in
 these he is altogether in his sphere; he has only to think of the people
 whom he calls exclusively the world, and he can direct every spark of
 his genius to the production of instantaneous effect, delight his reader
 by his fancy, and surprise him by his wit.
 
 "The chief aim of each one of Voltaire's small novels is the overthrow
 and refutation of some ruling opinion, and this object is admirably
 attained by the story itself, and by weaving in sarcasms, because this
 rendered all reply and refutation impossible. Seriousness could never
 have reached the readers of these novels, or would immediately weary
 them; and every attempt to rival Voltaire in a strain of pleasantry and
 satire, would have been a folly.
 
 "In _Zadig_ he shows palpably and obviously how entirely devoid of
 reason and taste the usual moral and edifying considerations upon the
 way of Providence, upon a God who thinks, counsels, acts, and conducts
 the affairs of the world as a man, must appear to the bold scoffer.
 Voltaire, we would say, confined and limited the doctrine of an
 immediate guidance of human affairs by the hand of Divine Providence,
 wholly to the church and to the faith of the people; he roofed it out of
 higher life and out of science by means of his dreadful ridicule. By his
 narratives he made that obvious, which indeed is easily made palpable
 enough, because it is undeniable, that the theory of a palpable guidance
 of human affairs by an ever-manifesting interposing Providence, may be
 just as easily refuted as proved by history and experience. In _Memnon_
 is shown, in an admirable manner, how the multitude are enamoured of
 their prudence, and laugh at nature and its feelings. In the _Ingenu_,
 the witty man yields himself up wholly to his humor and to accident, and
 brings forth a rich abundance of wit and flashes of genius with respect
 to the most various subjects."
 
 "Voltaire had the genius of criticism," says Lamartine,[11] "that power
 of raillery which withers all it overthrows. He had made human nature
 laugh at itself, had felled it low in order to raise it, had laid bare
 before it all errors, prejudices, iniquities, and crimes of ignorance;
 he had urged it to rebellion against consecrated ideas, not by the ideal
 but by sheer contempt. Destiny gave him eighty years of existence, that
 he might slowly decompose the decayed age; he had the time to combat
 against time, and when he fell he was the conqueror.
 
 "Such were the elements of the revolution in religious matters. Voltaire
 laid hold of them, at the precise moment, with that _coup d'œil_ of
 strong instinct which sees clearer than genius itself. To an age young,
 fickle, and unreflecting, he did not present reason under the form of an
 austere philosophy, but beneath the guise of a facile freedom of ideas,
 and a scoffing irony. He would not have succeeded in making his age
 think, he did succeed in making it smile. He never attacked it in front,
 nor with his face uncovered, in order that he might not set the laws in
 array against him; and to avoid the fate of Servetus, he, the modern
 Æsop, attacked under imaginary names the tyranny which he wished, to
 destroy. He concealed his hate in history, the drama, light poetry,
 romance, and even in jests. His genius was a perpetual allusion,
 comprehending all his age, but impossible to be seized on by his
 enemies. He struck, but his hand was concealed. Yet the struggle of a
 man against a priesthood, an individual against an institution, a life
 against eighteen centuries, was by no means destitute of courage.
 
 "There is an incalculable power of conviction and devotion of idea, in
 the daring of one against all. To brave at once, with no other power
 than individual reason, with no other support than conscience, human
 consideration, that cowardice of the mind, masked under respect for
 error; to dare the hatred of earth and the anathema of heaven, is the
 heroism of the writer. Voltaire was not a martyr in his body, but he
 consented to be one in his name, and devoted it during his life and
 after his death. He condemned his own ashes to be thrown to the winds,
 and not to have either an asylum or a tomb. He resigned himself even to
 lengthened exile in exchange for the liberty of a free combat. He
 isolated himself voluntarily from men, in order that their too close
 contact might not interfere with his thoughts.
 
 "At eighty years of age, feeble, and feeling his death nearly
 approaching, he several times made his preparations hastily, in order to
 go and struggle still, and die at a distance from the roof of his old
 age. The unwearied activity of his mind was never checked for a moment.
 He carried his gaiety even to genius, and under that pleasantry of his
 whole life we may perceive a grave power of perseverance and conviction.
 Such was the character of this great man. The enlightened serenity of
 his mind concealed the depth of its workings: under the joke and laugh
 his constancy of purpose was hardly sufficiently recognized. He suffered
 all with a laugh, and was willing to endure all, even in absence from
 his native land, in his lost friendships, in his refused fame, in his
 blighted name, in his memory accursed. He took all--bore all--for the
 sake of the triumph of the independence of human reason."
 
 The manners and customs of the eighteenth century differ widely from
 those of the nineteenth. Certain words and phrases that were then in
 common use are now wisely suppressed. Lecky says very truly,[12] that "a
 Roman of the age of Pliny, an Englishman of the age of Henry VIII., and
 an Englishman of our own day, would all agree in regarding humanity as a
 virtue, and its opposite as a vice; but their judgments of the acts
 which are compatible with a humane disposition would be widely
 different."
 
 The enemies of freethought have taken advantage of this fact--this
 change in modes of expression--this refinement in literature--to defame
 the memory of Voltaire. They denounce _La Pucelle_ or _The Maid of
 Orleans_ for language and expressions, formerly popular in court circles
 and sanctioned by the nobility and ladies of fashion, but which,
 happily, have now become obsolete. They judge the license of the
 eighteenth century--the license and profligacy which accompany
 ecclesiasticism and monasticism--by nineteenth century standards. If the
 same rule were applied to other writers, none would have cause to
 complain. But, unfortunately, an exception has been unjustly made in
 favor of the language employed by historians like Moses and Solomon, by
 poets like Shakspeare and Pope, by theologians like Rabelais and Swift,
 by novelists like Fielding and Smollett. In short, immodest language
 cannot be redeemed by wit, by learning, or by pretended revelation, and
 should always and invariably be suppressed; but writers should be judged
 by the manners and customs of their age, and not by modern standards.
 There are many passages in the old classic authors that were formerly
 considered in good taste, which cannot now be commended. Still, the gold
 outweighs the dross, and we should remember the laxity and
 licentiousness of the times in which those books were written.
 
 The romances and tales in this publication have been selected for their
 graceful and sprightly wit, as well as genial humor and keen satire; and
 further, because they are free from even a suspicion of impropriety.
 They each teach a lesson of wisdom and morality--they teach courage,
 fortitude and resignation, and, what is perhaps of even greater
 importance, they also tend to free the mind from the baneful errors of
 priestcraft and superstition.
 
 "The most interesting adventures are related to no sort of purpose,"
 says Voltaire in one of his essays, "if they do not convey, at the same
 time, a description of manners. And even this is but a frivolous
 amusement, if that description does not contribute to inspire us with
 sentiments of virtue. I dare assert that, from the _Henriade_ to _Zara_
 and down to the Chinese tragedy of _The Orphan of Tchao_ such was always
 the aim I proposed, and the principle that conducted me. In the history
 of the age of Louis the fourteenth, I have celebrated my king and
 country, without flattering either. In these endeavors have I spent
 above forty years. But here is the advice of a Chinese philosopher,
 whose writings are translated into Spanish, by the famous _Navarette_:
 
 "'If you write a book, show it only to your friends. Dread the public
 and your brother authors. They will embitter your expressions,
 misrepresent your meaning, and impute to you, what you never thought of.
 Calumny, which has an hundred mouths, will open them against you; and
 truth, which is silent, will remain with you.'"
 
 It has been said of Voltaire that he was "not only just, but generous in
 his dealings with others. With open purse and open heart, helpful to all
 who approached him. Collini, his secretary, said he was a miser _only of
 his time_, which was always usefully employed. But we are also told that
 there was one person to whom he could not even deny his time--it was
 Mademoiselle de Varicourt--_Belle-et-Bonne_--whom he had adopted, and
 who was afterward married to the Marquis de Villette. "She could never
 disturb him," says A.A. Knox, "not even when he was giving the last
 touches to _Irène_. If he were in a passion with anybody else, and she
 appeared in the room, he was at once gentle and calm. There is something
 very affecting in the old man's love and tenderness for this young
 girl."
 
 After the success of the French Revolution, to which the writings of
 Voltaire had so greatly contributed, when the National Assembly ordered
 the removal of his remains to the Pantheon, to repose between the ashes
 of Descartes and Mirabeau--when France honored herself in honoring the
 great philosopher--it was _Belle-et-Bonne_--in the full splendor of her
 majestic beauty--her heart overflowing with tenderness and
 gratitude--her eyes dimmed with pathetic tears--who placed with loving
 hands on the bier of her noble benefactor the wreath of filial
 affection--the grandest tribute that humanity can bestow.

 [1] This work, says Prof. F.C. Schlosser in his _History of the
 Eighteenth Century_, (vol. ii, p. 122.) "was sent to the pope, and very
 favorably received by him; although it could not possibly escape the
 notice of the pope, that the piece was indebted for its chief effect
 upon the public, to the vehement expressions against religious
 fanaticism which it contained. The pope felt himself flattered by the
 transmission of the _Mahomet_, and notified his approbation, of which
 Voltaire cunningly enough availed himself, for the advantage of his new
 principles."

      TAURUS.
 
 
      The object and significance of ancient Tauric and Phallic worship
      have been clearly set forth by Dupuis, Payne Knight, and other
      learned authors, and we have, even at the present day, a survival
      of the ancient faith, in the Mayday festivals of India and Britain,
      which were originally instituted to celebrate the entrance of the
      sun into the zodiacal sign Taurus, at the vernal equinox, when the
      god Osiris was worshiped in Egypt under the form of a bull called
      Apis.
 
      "The general devotion of the ancients to the worship of the BULL,"
      says the Rev. Mr. Maurice in his learned work on the _Antiquities
      of India_, "I have had frequent occasion to remark, and more
      particularly in the Indian history, by their devotion to it at that
      period 'when the Bull with his horns opened the Vernal year.' I
      observed that all nations seem anciently to have vied with each
      other in celebrating that blissful epoch; and that the moment the
      sun entered the sign Taurus, were displayed the signals of triumph
      and the incentives to passion; that memorials of the universal
      festivity indulged at that season, are to be found in the records
      and customs of people otherwise the most opposite in manners and
      most remote in situation;... that the Apis, or Sacred Bull of
      Egypt, was only the symbol of the sun in the vigor of vernal youth;
      and that the Bull of Japan, breaking with his horn the mundane egg,
      was evidently connected with the same bovine species of
      superstition, founded on the mixture of astronomy and mythology."
 
      "In many of the most ancient temples or India," says Godfrey
      Higgins in the _Anacalypsis_, "the Bull, as an object of adoration
      makes a most conspicuous figure. A gigantic image of one protrudes
      from the front of the temple of _the Great Creator_, called in the
      language of the country, Jaggernaut, in Orissa. This is the Bull of
      the Zodiac,--the emblem of the sun when the equinox took place in
      the first degree of the sign of the Zodiac, Taurus. In consequence
      of the precession of the equinoxes, the sun at the vernal equinox
      left Taurus, and took place in Aries, which it has left also for a
      great number of years, and it now takes place in Aquarius. Thus it
      keeps receding about one degree in seventy-two years, and about a
      whole _sign_ in 2,160 years. M. Dupuis has demonstrated that the
      labors of Hercules are nothing but a history of the passage of the
      sun through the signs of the zodiac; and that Hercules is the sun
      in Aries or the Ram, Bacchus the sun in Taurus or the Bull. The
      adoration of the Bull of the zodiac is to be met with everywhere
      throughout the world, in the most opposite climes. The examples of
      it are innumerable and incontrovertable; they admit of no dispute.
 
      "It appears from the book or history of the Exod, that it was on
      the leaving of Egypt that Moses changed the object of adoration
      from Taurus to Aries. It appears that the change took place on the
      mountain of _Sin_, or Nisi, or Bacchus, which was evidently its old
      name before Moses arrived there. The Israelites were punished for
      adhering to the old worship, that of the Calf, in opposition to the
      paschal Lamb, which Moses had substituted--'the Lamb which taketh
      away the sins of the world,'--in place of the Bull or Calf which
      took away the sins of the world.
 
      "The planets were in later times all called by names appropriated
      to the days of the week, which were dedicated by astrologers to the
      gods who were typified by the Bull: Monday to the horned _Isis_;
      Tuesday to Mercury, the same as Hermes and Osiris; Wednesday to
      Woden, Fo, Buddha, and Surya; Thursday or Thor-day, or _Tur_, or
      Taurus, or Bull-day, to Jove or Jupiter, who, as a Bull, stole
      Europa; Friday was dedicated to Venus, Ashteroth or beeve-horned
      Astarte; Saturday to Saturn, identified by Mr. Faber with Moloch
      and the _Centaur Cronus_ or Taschter; Sunday to the Sun, everywhere
      typified by Taurus. All these, I think, must have taken their names
      after the entrance of the Sun into Taurus; and before this date all
      history and even mythology fails us.
 
      "In ancient collections we often meet with a person in the prime of
      life killing a young bull. He is generally accompanied with a
      number of astrological emblems. This Bull was the mediatorial
      Mithra, slain to make atonement for, and to take away the sins of
      the world. This was the God Bull, to whom the prayers were
      addressed which we find in Bryant and Faber, and in which he is
      expressly called the Mediator. This is the Bull of Persia, which
      Sir. William Jones and Mr. Faber identify with Buddha or Mahabad.
      The sacrifice of the Bull, which taketh away the sins of the world,
      was succeeded by the sacrifice of the Agni or of Fire, by our
      Indians in, comparatively speaking, modern times; it was closely
      connected with the two principles spoken of above. While the sun
      was in Taurus, the Bull was slain as the vicarious sacrifice; when
      it got into Aries, the Ram or Lamb was substituted.
 
      "M. Dupuis observes, that the lamb was a symbol or mark of
      initiation into the Christian mysteries, a sort of proof of
      admission into the societies of the initiated of the lamb, like the
      private sign of the free-masons. It follows, then, that the
      mysteries of Christ are the mysteries of the Lamb, and that the
      mysteries of the Lamb are mysteries of the same nature as those of
      the Mithraitic Bull to which they succeeded by the effect of the
      precession of the equinoxes, which substituted the slain _lamb_ for
      the slain _bull_."--E.

 THE WHITE BULL.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER I.
 
 HOW THE PRINCESS AMASIDIA MEETS A BULL.
 
 
 The princess Amasidia, daughter of Amasis, King of Tanis in Egypt, took
 a walk upon the highway of Peluaium with the ladies of her train. She
 was sunk in deep melancholy. Tears gushed from her beautiful eyes. The
 cause of her grief was known, as well as the fears she entertained lest
 that grief should displease the king, her father. The old man, Mambres,
 ancient magician and eunuch of the Pharoahs, was beside her, and seldom
 left her. He was present at her birth. He had educated her, and taught
 her all that a fair princess was allowed to know of the sciences of
 Egypt. The mind of Amasidia equaled her beauty. Her sensibility and
 tenderness rivaled the charms of her person; and it was this sensibility
 which cost her so many tears.
 
 The princess was twenty-four years old, the magician, Mambres, about
 thirteen hundred. It was he, as every one knows, who had that famous
 dispute with Moses, in which the victory was so long doubtful between
 these two profound philosophers. If Mambres yielded, it was owing to
 the visible protection of the celestial powers, who favored his rival.
 It required gods to overcome Mambres!
 
 Amasis made him superintendent of his daughter's household, and he
 acquitted himself in this office with his usual prudence. His compassion
 was excited by the sighs of the beautiful Amasidia.
 
 "O, my lover!" said she to herself, "my young, my dear lover! O,
 greatest of conquerors, most accomplished, most beautiful of men! Almost
 seven years hast thou disappeared from the world. What God hath snatched
 thee from thy tender Amasidia? Thou art not dead. The wise Egyptian
 prophets confess this. But thou art dead to me. I am alone in the world.
 To me it is a desert. By what extraordinary prodigy hast thou abandoned
 thy throne and thy mistress?--thy throne, which was the first in the
 world--however, that is a matter of small consequence; but to abandon
 me, who adores thee! O, my dear Ne--"
 
 She was going on.
 
 "Tremble to pronounce that fatal name," said Mambres, the ancient eunuch
 and magician of the Pharoahs. "You would perhaps be discovered by some
 of the ladies of your court. They are all very much devoted to you, and
 all fair ladies certainly make it a merit to serve the noble passions of
 fair princesses. But there may be one among them indiscreet, and even
 treacherous. You know that your father, although he loves you, has sworn
 to put you to death, should you pronounce the terrible name always ready
 to escape your lips. This law is severe; but you have not been educated
 in Egyptian wisdom to be ignorant of the government of the tongue.
 Remember that Hippocrates, one of our greatest gods, has always his
 finger upon his mouth."
 
 [Illustration: Silence.]
 
 The beautiful Amasidia wept, and was silent.
 
 As she pensively advanced toward the banks of the Nile she perceived at
 a distance, under a thicket watered by the river, an old woman in a
 tattered gray garment, seated on a hillock. This old woman had beside
 her a she-ass, a dog, and a he-goat. Opposite to her was a serpent,
 which was not like the common serpents; for its eyes were mild, its
 physiognomy noble and engaging, while its skin shone with the liveliest
 and brightest colors. A huge fish, half immersed in the river, was not
 the least astonishing figure in the group; and on a neighboring tree
 were perched a raven and a pigeon. All these creatures seemed to carry
 on a very animated conversation.
 
 [Illustration: Amasidia.--"O, my lover! my young, my dear lover! O,
 greatest of conquerors, most accomplished, most beautiful of men!"]
 
 "Alas!" said the princess in a low tone, "these animals undoubtedly
 speak of their loves, and it is not so much as allowed me to mention the
 name of mine."
 
 The old woman held in her hand a slender steel chain a hundred fathoms
 long, to which was fastened a bull who fed in the meadow. This bull was
 white, perfectly well-made, plump, and at the same time agile, which is
 a thing seldom to be found. He was indeed the most beautiful specimen
 that was ever seen of his kind. Neither the bull of Pasiphæ, nor that in
 whose shape Jupiter appeared when he carried off Europa, could be
 compared to this noble animal. The charming young heifer into which Isis
 was changed, would have scarce been worthy of his company.
 
 As soon as the bull saw the princess he ran toward her with the
 swiftness of a young Arabian horse, who pricks up his ears and flies
 over the plains and rivers of the ancient Saana to approach the lovely
 consort whose image reigns in his heart. The old woman used her utmost
 efforts to restrain the bull. The serpent wanted to terrify him by its
 hissing. The dog followed him and bit his beautiful limbs. The she-ass
 crossed his way and kicked him to make him return. The great fish
 remounted the Nile and, darting himself out of the water, threatened to
 devour him. The he-goat remained immovable, apparently struck with fear.
 The raven fluttered round his head as if it wanted to tear out his eyes.
 The pigeon alone accompanied him from curiosity, and applauded him by a
 sweet murmur.
 
 So extraordinary a sight threw Mambres into serious reflections. In the
 meanwhile, the white bull, dragging after him his chain and the old
 woman, had already reached the princess, who was struck with
 astonishment and fear. He threw himself at her feet. He kissed them. He
 shed tears. He looked upon her with eyes in which there was a strange
 mixture of grief and joy. He dared not to low, lest he should terrify
 the beautiful Amasidia. He could not speak. A weak use of the voice,
 granted by Heaven to certain animals, was denied him; but all his
 actions were eloquent. The princess was delighted by him. She perceived
 that a trifling amusement could suspend for some moments even the most
 poignant grief.
 
 "Here," said she, "is a most amiable animal. I could wish much to have
 him in my stable."
 
 At these words he bull bent himself on his knees and kissed the ground.
 
 "He understands me," cried the princess. "He shows me that he wants to
 be mine. Ah, heavenly magician! ah, divine eunuch! Give me this
 consolation. Purchase this beautiful bovine. Settle the price with the
 old woman, to whom he no doubt belongs. This animal must be mine. Do not
 refuse me this innocent comfort."
 
 All the ladies joined their requests to the entreaties of the princess.
 Mambres yielded to them, and immediately went to speak to the old woman.
 
 
 [1] According to Eschenburg, Apis is the name of the ox in which Osiris
 was supposed to reside, rather than a distinct deity. The ox thus
 honored was known by certain marks; his body was all black, excepting a
 square spot of white on his forehead, and a white crescent or sort of
 half-moon on his right side; on his back was the figure of an eagle;
 under his tongue a sort of knot resembling a beetle (_cantharus_), and
 two sorts of hair upon his tail. This ox was permitted to live
 twenty-five years. His body was then embalmed, placed in a chest, and
 buried with many solemnities. A season of mourning then followed, until
 a new Apis, or ox properly marked, was discovered.--E.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER II.
 
 HOW THE WISE MAMBRES, FORMERLY MAGICIAN OF PHAROAH, KNEW AGAIN THE OLD
 WOMAN, AND WAS KNOWN BY HER.
 
 
 "Madam," said Mambres to her, "you know that ladies, and particularly
 princesses, have need of amusement. The daughter of the king is
 distractedly fond of your bull. I beg that you will sell him to us. You
 shall be paid in ready money."
 
 "Sir," answered the old woman, "this precious animal does not belong to
 me. I am charged, together with all the beasts which you see, to keep
 him with care, to watch all his motions, and to give an exact account of
 them. God forbid that I should ever have any inclination to sell this
 invaluable animal."
 
 [Illustration: The remarkable witch of Endor.--"What, is it indeed you,"
 cried Mambres, "who are so famous upon the banks of your little Jordan,
 and the first person in the world for raising apparitions?"]
 
 Mambres, upon this discourse, began to have a confused remembrance of
 something which he could not yet properly distinguish. He eyed the old
 woman in the gray cloak with greater attention.
 
 "Respectable lady," said he to her, "I either mistake, or I have seen
 you formerly."
 
 "I make no mistake, sir," replied the old woman. "I have seen you seven
 hundred years ago, in a journey which I made from Syria into Egypt some
 months after the destruction of Troy, when Hiram the second reigned at
 Tyre, and Nephel Keres in ancient Egypt."
 
 "Ah! madam," cried the old man, "you are the remarkable witch of Endor."
 
 "And you, sir," said the sorceress, embracing him, "are the great
 Mambres of Egypt."
 
 "O, unforeseen meeting! memorable day! eternal decrees!" said Mambres.
 "It certainly is not without permission of the universal providence that
 we meet again in this meadow upon the banks of the Nile near the noble
 city of Tanis. What, is it indeed you," continued Mambres, "who are so
 famous upon the banks of your little Jordan, and the first person in the
 world for raising apparitions?"
 
 "What, is it you, sir," replied Miss Endor, "who are so famous for
 changing rods into serpents, the day into darkness, and rivers into
 blood?"
 
 "Yes, madam, but my great age has in part deprived me of my knowledge
 and power. I am ignorant from whence you have this beautiful bull, and
 who these animals are that, together with you, watch round him."
 
 The old woman, recollecting herself, raised her eyes to heaven, and then
 replied.
 
 "My dear Mambres. We are of the same profession, but it is expressly
 forbidden me to tell you who this bull is. I can satisfy you with regard
 to the other animals. You will easily know them by the marks which
 characterize them. The serpent is that which persuaded Eve to eat an
 apple, and to make her husband partake of it. The ass, that which spoke
 to your contemporary, Balaam, in a remarkable discourse. The fish, which
 always carries its head above water, is that which swallowed Jonah a few
 years ago. The dog is he who followed Raphael and the young Tobit in
 their journey to Ragusa in Media, in the time of the great Salamanzar.
 This goat is he who expiates all the sins of your nation. The raven and
 the pigeon, those which were in the ark of Noah. Great event! universal
 catastrophe! of which almost all the world is still ignorant. You are
 now informed. But of the bull you can know nothing."
 
 Mambres, having listened with respect, said:
 
 "The Eternal, O illustrious witch! reveals and conceals what he thinks
 proper. All these animals who, together with you, are entrusted with the
 custody of the white bull, are only known to your generous and agreeable
 nation, which is itself unknown to almost all the world. The miracles
 which you and yours, I and mine, have performed, shall one day be a
 great subject of doubt and scandal to inquisitive philosophers. But
 happily these miracles shall find belief with the devout sages, who
 shall prove submissive to the enlightened in one corner of the world;
 and this is all that is necessary."
 
 As he spoke these words, the princess pulled him by the sleeve, and said
 to him,--
 
 "Mambres, will you not buy my bull?"
 
 The magician, plunged into a deep reverie, made no reply, and Amasidia
 poured forth her tears.
 
 She then addressed herself to the old woman.
 
 "My good woman," said she, "I conjure you, by all you hold most dear in
 the world, by your father, by your mother, by your nurse, who are
 certainly still alive, to sell me not only your bull, but likewise your
 pigeon, which seems very much attached to him.
 
 "As for the other animals, I do not want them; but I shall catch the
 vapors if you do not sell me this charming bull, who will be all the
 happiness of my life."
 
 The old woman respectfully kissed the fringe of her gauze robe, and
 replied,--
 
 "Princess, my bull is not to be sold. Your illustrious magician is
 acquainted with this. All that I can do for your service is, to permit
 him to feed every day near your palace. You may caress him, give him
 biscuits, and make him dance about at your pleasure; but he must always
 be under the eyes of all these animals who accompany me, and who are
 charged with the keeping of him. If he does not endeavor to escape from
 them, they will prove peaceable; but if he attempt once more to break
 his chain, as he did upon seeing you, woe be unto him. I would not then
 answer for his life. This large fish, which you see, will certainly
 swallow him, and keep him longer than _three_ days in his belly; or this
 serpent, who appears to you so mild, will give him a mortal sting."
 
 The white bull, who understood perfectly the old woman's conversation,
 but was unable to speak, humbly accepted all the proposals. He laid
 himself down at her feet; he lowed softly, and, looking tenderly at
 Amasidia, seemed to say to her,
 
 "Come and see me sometimes upon the lawn."
 
 The serpent now took up the conversation:
 
 "Princess," said he, "I advise you to act implicitly, as mademoiselle of
 Endor has told you."
 
 The she-ass likewise put in her word, and was of the opinion of the
 serpent.
 
 Amasidia was afflicted that this serpent and this ass should speak so
 well; while a beautiful bull, who had such noble and tender sentiments,
 was unable to express them.
 
 "Alas," said she, in a low voice, "nothing is more common at court. One
 sees there every day fine lords who cannot converse, and contemptible
 wretches who speak with assurance."
 
 "This serpent," said Mambres, "is not a contemptible wretch. He is
 perhaps the personage of the greatest importance."
 
 The day now declined, and the princess was obliged to return home, after
 having promised to come back next day at the same hour. Her ladies of
 the palace were astonished, and understood nothing of what they had seen
 or heard. Mambres made reflections. The princess recollecting that the
 serpent called the old woman Miss, concluded at random that she was
 still unmarried, and felt some affliction that such was also her own
 condition. Respectable affliction! which she concealed, however, with as
 much care as the name of her lover.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER III.
 
 HOW THE BEAUTIFUL AMASIDIA HAD A SECRET CONVERSATION WITH A BEAUTIFUL
 SERPENT.
 
 
 The beautiful princess recommended secrecy to her ladies with regard to
 what they had seen. They all promised it, and kept their promise for a
 whole day.
 
 We may believe that Amasidia slept little that night. An inexplicable
 charm continually recalled the idea of her beautiful bull. As soon,
 therefore, as she was at freedom with her wise Mambres, she said to him:
 
 "O, sage! this animal turns my head."
 
 "He employs mine very much," said Mambres. "I see plainly that this
 bovine is very much superior to those of his species. I see that there
 is a great mystery, and I suspect a fatal event. Your father Amasis is
 suspicious and violent; and this affair requires that you conduct
 yourself with the greatest precaution."
 
 "Ah!" said the princess, "I have too much curiosity to be prudent. It is
 the only sentiment which can unite in my heart with that which preys
 upon me on account of the lover I have lost. Can I not know who this
 white bull is that gives me such strange disquiet?"
 
 Mambres replied,--
 
 "I have already confessed to you, frankly, that my knowledge declines in
 proportion as my age advances; but I mistake much if the serpent is not
 informed of what you are so very desirous of knowing. He does not want
 sense. He expresses himself with propriety. He has been long accustomed
 to interfere in the affairs of the ladies."
 
 "Ah! undoubtedly," said Amasidia, "this is the beautiful serpent of
 Egypt, who, by fixing his tail into his mouth, becomes the emblem of
 eternity; who enlightens the world when he opens his eyes, and darkens
 it when he shuts them?"
 
 "No, Miss."
 
 "It is then the serpent of Æsculapius?"
 
 "Still less."
 
 "It is perhaps Jupiter under the figure of a serpent?"
 
 "Not at all."
 
 "Ah, now I see, I see. It is the rod which you formerly changed into a
 serpent?"
 
 "No, indeed, it is not; but all these serpents are of the same family.
 This one has a very high character in his own country. He passes there
 for the most extraordinary serpent that was ever seen. Address yourself
 to him. However, I warn you it is a dangerous undertaking. Were I in
 your place, I would hardly trouble myself either with the bull, the
 she-ass, the he-goat, the serpent, the fish, the raven, or the pigeon.
 But passion hurries you on; and all I can do is to pity you, and
 tremble."
 
 The princess conjured him to procure her a tête-à-tête with the serpent.
 Mambres, who was obliging, consented, and making profound reflections,
 he went and communicated to the witch in so insinuating a manner the
 whim of the princess, that the old woman told him Amasidia might lay her
 commands upon her; that the serpent was perfectly well bred, and so
 polite to the ladies, that he wished for nothing more than to oblige
 them, and would not fail to keep the princess's appointment.
 
 The ancient magician returned to inform the princess of this good news;
 but he still dreaded some misfortune, and made reflections.
 
 "You desire to speak with the serpent, mademoiselle. This you may
 accomplish whenever your highness thinks proper. But remember you must
 flatter him; for every animal has a great deal of self-love, and the
 serpent in particular. It is said he was formerly driven out of heaven
 for excessive pride."
 
 "I have never heard of it," replied the princess.
 
 "I believe it," said the old man.
 
 He then informed her of all the reports which had been spread about this
 famous serpent.
 
 "But, my dear princess, whatever singular adventures may have happened
 to him, you never can extort these secrets from him but by flattery.
 Having formerly deceived women, it is equitable that a woman in her turn
 should deceive him."
 
 "I will do my utmost," said the princess; and departed with her maids of
 honor. The old woman was feeding the bull at a considerable distance.
 
 Mambres left Amasidia to herself, and went and discoursed with the
 witch. One lady of honor chatted with the she-ass, the others amused
 themselves with the goat, the dog, the raven, and the pigeon. As for the
 large fish that frightened every body, he plunged himself into the Nile
 by order of the old woman.
 
 The serpent then attended the beautiful Amasidia into the grove, where
 they had the following conversation.
 
 SERPENT.--You cannot imagine, mademoiselle, how much I am flattered with
 the honor which your highness deigns to confer upon me.
 
 PRINCESS.--Your great reputation, sir, the beauty of your countenance,
 and the brilliancy of your eyes, have emboldened me to seek for this
 conversation. I know by public report (if it be not false) that you were
 formerly a very great lord in the empyrean heaven.
 
 SERPENT.--It is true, miss, I had there a very distinguished place. It
 is pretended I am a disgraced favorite. This is a report which once went
 abroad in India. The Brahmins were the first who gave a history of my
 adventures. And I doubt not but one day or other the poets of the north
 will make them the subject of an extravagant epic poem;[1] for in truth
 it is all that can be made of them. Yet I am not so much fallen, but
 that I have left in this globe a very extensive dominion. I might
 venture to assert that the whole earth belongs to me.
 
 PRINCESS.--I believe it; for they tell me that your powers of persuasion
 are irresistible, and to please is to reign.
 
 SERPENT.--I feel, mademoiselle, while I behold and listen to you, that
 you have over me the same power which you ascribe to me over so many
 others.
 
 PRINCESS.--You are, I believe, an amiable conqueror. It is said that
 your conquests among the fair sex have been numerous, and that you began
 with our common mother, whose name I have unfortunately forgotten.
 
 SERPENT.--They do me injustice. She honored me with her confidence, and
 I gave her the best advice. I desired that she and her husband should
 eat heartily of the fruit of the tree of knowledge. I imagined in doing
 this that I should please the ruler of all things. It seemed to me that
 a tree so necessary to the human race was not planted to be entirely
 useless. Would the supreme being have wished to have been served by
 fools and idiots? Is not the mind formed for the acquisition of
 knowledge and for improvement? Is not the knowledge of good and evil
 necessary for doing the one and avoiding the other? I certainly merited
 their thanks.
 
 PRINCESS.--Yet, they tell me that you have suffered for it. Probably it
 is since this period that so many ministers have been punished for
 giving good advice, and so many real philosophers and men of genius
 persecuted for their writings that were useful to mankind.
 
 SERPENT.--It is my enemies who have told you these stories. They say
 that I am out of favor at court. But a proof that my influence there has
 not declined, is their own confession that I entered into the council
 when it was in agitation to try the good man Job; and I was again called
 upon when the resolution was taken to deceive a certain petty king
 called Ahab. I alone was charged with this honorable commission.
 
 PRINCESS.--Ah, sir! I do not believe that you are formed to deceive. But
 since you are always in the ministry, may I beg a favor of you? I hope
 so amiable a lord will not deny me.
 
 SERPENT.--Mademoiselle, your requests are laws; name your commands.
 
 PRINCESS.--I intreat that you will tell me who this white bull is, for
 whom I feel such extraordinary sentiments, which both affect and alarm
 me. I am told that you would deign to inform me.
 
 SERPENT.--Curiosity is necessary to human nature, and especially to your
 amiable sex. Without it they would live in the most shameful ignorance.
 I have always satisfied, as far as lay in my power, the curiosity of the
 ladies. I am accused indeed of using this complaisance only to vex the
 ruler of the world. I swear to you, that I could propose nothing more
 agreeable to myself than to obey you; but the old woman must have
 informed you that the revealing of this secret will be attended with
 some danger to you.
 
 PRINCESS.--Ah! it is that which makes me still more curious.
 
 SERPENT.--In this I discover the sex to whom I have formerly done
 service.
 
 PRINCESS.--If you possess any feeling; if rational beings should
 mutually assist each other; if you have compassion for an unfortunate
 creature, do not refuse my request.
 
 SERPENT.--You affect me. I must satisfy you; but do not interrupt me.
 
 PRINCESS.--I promise you I will not.
 
 SERPENT.--There was a young king, beautiful, charming, in love,
 beloved--
 
 PRINCESS.--A young king! beautiful, charming, in love, beloved! And by
 whom? And who was this king? How old was he? What has become of him?
 Where is his kingdom? What is his name?
 
 SERPENT.--See, I have scarce begun, and you have already interrupted me.
 Take care. If you have not more command over yourself, you are undone.
 
 PRINCESS.--Ah, pardon me, sir. I will not repeat my indiscretion. Go on,
 I beseech you.
 
 SERPENT.--This great king, the most valiant of men, victorious wherever
 he carried his arms, often dreamed when asleep, and forgot his dreams
 when awake. He wanted his magicians to remember and inform him what he
 had dreamed, otherwise he declared he would hang them; for that nothing
 was more equitable. It is now near seven years since he dreamed a fine
 dream, which he entirely forgot when he awoke; and a young Jew, full of
 experience, having revealed it to him, this amiable king was immediately
 changed into an ox for--
 
 PRINCESS.--Ah! it is my dear Neb----
 
 She could not finish, she fainted away. Mambres, who listened at a
 distance, saw her fall, and believed her dead.

 Lost_.--E.

 CHAPTER IV.
 
 HOW THEY WANTED TO SACRIFICE THE BULL, AND EXORCISE THE PRINCESS.
 
 
 Mambres runs to her weeping. The serpent is affected. He, alas, cannot
 weep; but he hisses in a mournful tone. He cries out, "She is dead." The
 ass repeats, "She is dead." The raven tells it over again. All the other
 animals appeared afflicted, except the fish of Jonah, which has always
 been merciless. The lady of honor, the ladies of the court, arrive and
 tear their hair. The white bull, who fed at a distance and heard their
 cries, ran to the grove dragging the old woman after him, while his loud
 bellowings made the neighboring echoes resound. To no purpose did the
 ladies pour upon the expiring Amasidia their bottles of rose-water, of
 pink, of myrtle, of benzoin, of balm of Gilead, of amomum, of
 gilly-flower, of nutmeg, of ambergris. She had not as yet given the
 smallest signs of life. But as soon as she perceived that the beautiful
 white bull was beside her, she came to herself, more blooming, more
 beautiful and lively than ever. A thousand times did she kiss this
 charming animal, who languishingly leaned his head on her snowy bosom.
 She called him, "My master, my king, my dear, my life!" She throws her
 fair arms around his neck, which was whiter than the snow. The light
 straw does not adhere more closely to the amber, the vine to the elm,
 nor the ivy to the oak. The sweet murmur of her sighs was heard. Her
 eyes were seen, now sparkling with a tender flame, and now obscured by
 those precious tears which love makes us shed.
 
 We may easily judge into what astonishment the lady of honor and ladies
 of her train were thrown. As soon as they entered the palace, they
 related to their lovers this extraordinary adventure, and every one with
 different circumstances, which increased its singularity, and which
 always contributes to the variety of all histories.
 
 No sooner was Amasis, king of Tanis, informed of these events, than his
 royal breast was inflamed with just indignation. Such was the wrath of
 Minos, when he understood that his daughter Pasiphæ lavished her tender
 favors upon the father of the Minotaur. Thus raged Juno, when she beheld
 Jupiter caressing the beautiful cow Io, daughter of the river Inachus.
 Following the dictates of passion, the stern Amasis imprisoned his
 unhappy daughter, the beautiful Amasidia, in her chamber and placed over
 her a guard of black eunuchs. He then assembled his privy council.
 
 The grand magician presided there, but had no longer the same influence
 as formerly. All the ministers of state concluded that this white bull
 was a sorcerer. It was quite the contrary. He was bewitched. But in
 delicate affairs they are always mistaken at court.
 
 It was carried by a great majority that the princess should be
 exorcised, and the old woman and the bull sacrificed.
 
 The wise Mambres contradicted not the opinion of the king and council.
 The right of exorcising belonged to him. He could delay it under some
 plausible pretence. The god Apis had lately died at Memphis. A god ox
 dies just like another ox. And it was not allowed to exorcise any person
 in Egypt until a new ox was found to replace the deceased.
 
 It was decreed in the council to wait until the nomination should be
 made of a new god at Memphis.
 
 The good old man, Mambres, perceived to what danger his dear princess
 was exposed. He knew who her lover was. The syllables NEBU----, which
 had escaped her, laid open the whole mystery to the eyes of this sage.
 
 The dynasty of Memphis belonged at that time to the Babylonians. They
 preserved this remainder of the conquests they had gained under the
 greatest king of the world, to whom Amasis was a mortal enemy. Mambres
 had occasion for all his wisdom to conduct himself properly in the midst
 of so many difficulties. If the king Amasis should discover the lover of
 his daughter, her death would be inevitable. He had sworn it. The great,
 the young, the beautiful king of whom she was enamored, had dethroned
 the king her father, and Amasis had only recovered his kingdom about
 seven years. From that time it was not known what had become of the
 adorable monarch--the conqueror and idol of the nations--the tender and
 generous lover of the charming Amasidia. Sacrificing the white bull
 would eventually occasion the death of the beautiful princess.
 
 [Illustration: Lot and his wayward daughters leaving Sodom.--From a
 celebrated picture in S. Marks, Florence, by Domenico Cresti, named il
 Passigiano.]
 
 
 
      DESTRUCTION OF SODOM AND GOMORRAH.
 
      A STRANGE METAMORPHOSIS.
 
 
      In the preceding engraving the artist has pictured the "Cities of
      the Plain" in flames, ignited by a shower of "fire and brimstone
      out of heaven." Warned by an angel, Lot and his family are fleeing
      from the conflagration. The madame has, however, unfortunately
      changed her mind, and is seen returning toward the doomed locality.
      She dearly loves her home, and braves danger--even death--in its
      protection. Her husband and her children heartlessly forsake her.
      Lot does not look like the coward he is represented to have been,
      who basely offered to surrender his daughters to the horrible abuse
      of a Sodomite mob; and the daughters--innocent and beautiful--seem
      incapable of the depravity with which they are charged in the
      nineteenth chapter of Genesis.
 
      The comical statement that Madame Lot was transformed into "a
      pillar of salt" for merely _looking back_ toward her old home in
      Sodom, rests on bible authority, and is believed by all the world
      excepting intelligent clergymen, scientists, philosophers and
      reasonable people.
 
      The assertion of Mambres, (page 15), that this estimable "pillar"
      has become "very sharp tasted," rests on the authority of certain
      eastern travelers who claim to have examined and tasted the saline
      remains of this unfortunate female. But as this last claim is based
      on a French romance and not on Hebrew revelation, readers may be
      pardoned for receiving it with the greatest caution. Indeed, all
      that is absolutely necessary for even the orthodox to believe is
      that, "once upon a time," a Sodomite matron was chemically changed
      into pure chloride of sodium, and not that said sodium still
      retains its sharp and acrid flavor.--E.
 
 What could Mambres do in such critical circumstances? He went, after the
 council had broken up, to find his dear foster daughter.
 
 "My dear child," he says, "I will serve you; but I repeat it, they will
 behead you if ever you pronounce the name of your lover."
 
 "Ah! what signifies my neck," replied the beautiful Amasidia, "if I
 cannot embrace that of Nebu--? My father is a cruel man. He not only
 refuses to give me a charming prince whom I adore, but he declares war
 against him; and after he was conquered by my lover, he has found the
 secret of changing him into an ox. Did one ever see more frightful
 malice? If my father were not my father, I do not know what I should do
 to him."
 
 "It was not your father who played him this cruel trick," said the wise
 Mambres. "It was a native of Palestine, one of our ancient enemies, an
 inhabitant of a little country comprehended in that crowd of kingdoms
 which your lover subdued in order to polish and refine them.
 
 "Such metamorphoses must not surprise you. You know that formerly I
 performed more extraordinary. Nothing was at that time more common than
 those changes which at present astonish philosophers. True history,
 which we have read together, informs us that Lycaon, king of Arcadia,
 was changed into a wolf; the beautiful Calista, his daughter, into a
 bear; Io, the daughter of Inachus, our venerable Isis, into a cow;
 Daphne into a laurel; Sirinx into a flute; the fair Edith, wife of
 Lot--the best and most affectionate husband and father ever known in the
 world--has she not become, in our neighborhood, a pillar of salt, very
 sharp tasted, which has preserved both her likeness and form, as the
 great men attest who have seen it? I was witness to this change in my
 youth. I saw seven powerful cities in the most dry and parched situation
 in the world, all at once transformed into a beautiful lake. In the
 early part of my life, the whole world was full of metamorphoses.
 
 "In fine, madam, if examples can soothe your grief, remember that Venus
 changed Cerastes into an ox."
 
 "I do not know," said the princess, "that examples comfort us. If my
 lover were dead, could I comfort myself by the idea that all men die?"
 
 "Your pain may at least be alleviated," replied the sage; "and since
 your lover has become an ox, it is possible from an ox he may become a
 man. As for me, I should deserve to be changed into a tiger or a
 crocodile, if I did not employ the little power I have in the service of
 a princess worthy of the adoration of the world,--if I did not labor for
 the beautiful Amasidia, whom I have nursed upon my knees, and whom fatal
 destiny exposes to such rude trials."
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER V.
 
 HOW THE WISE MAMBRES CONDUCTED HIMSELF WISELY.
 
 
 The sage Mambres having said every thing he could to comfort the
 princess, but without succeeding in so doing, ran to the old woman.
 
 "My companion," said he to her, "ours is a charming profession, but a
 very dangerous one. You run the risk of being hanged, and your ox of
 being burned, drowned or devoured, I don't know what they will do with
 your other animals; for, prophet as I am, I know very little; but do you
 carefully conceal the serpent, and the fish. Let not the one show his
 head above water, nor the other venture out of his hole. I will place
 the ox in one of my stables in the country. You shall be there with him,
 since you say that you are not allowed to abandon him. The good
 scape-goat may upon this occasion serve as an expiation. We will send
 him into the desert loaded with the sins of all the rest. He is
 accustomed to this ceremony, which does him no harm; and every one knows
 that sin is expiated by means of a he-goat, who walks about for his own
 amusement. I only beg of you to lend me immediately Tobit's dog, who is
 a very swift greyhound; Balaam's ass, who runs better than a dromedary;
 the raven and the pigeon of the ark, who fly with amazing swiftness. I
 want to send them on an embassy to Memphis. It is an affair of great
 consequence."
 
 The old woman replied to the magician:
 
 "You may dispose as you please of Tobit's dog,[1] of Balaam's ass, of
 the raven and the pigeon of the ark, and of the scape-goat; but my ox
 cannot enter into a stable. It is said, Daniel, v:21,--That he must be
 always made fast to an iron chain, be always wet with the dew of heaven,
 and eat the grass of the field, and his portion be with the wild beasts.
 
 "He is entrusted to me, and I must obey. What would Daniel, Ezekiel, and
 Jeremiah, think of me, if I trusted my ox to any other than to myself? I
 see you know the secret of this extraordinary animal, but I have not to
 reproach myself with having revealed it to you. I am going to conduct
 him far from this polluted land, toward the lake Sirbon, where he will
 be sheltered from the cruelties of the king of Tanis. My fish and my
 serpent will defend me. I fear nobody when I serve my master."
 
 "My good woman," answered the wise Mambres, "let the will of God be
 done! Provided I can find your white bull again, the lake Sirbon, the
 lake Maris, or the lake of Sodom, are to me perfectly indifferent. I
 want to do nothing but good to him and to you. But why have you spoken
 to me of Daniel, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah?"
 
 "Ah! sir," answered the old woman, "you know as well as I what concern
 they have in this important affair. But I have no time to lose. I don't
 desire to be hanged. I want not that my bull should be burned, drowned,
 or devoured. I go to the lake Sirbon by Canopus, with my serpent and my
 fish. Adieu."
 
 The bull followed her pensively, after having testified his gratitude to
 the beneficent Mambres.
 
 The wise Mambres was greatly troubled. He saw that Amasis, king of
 Tanis, distracted by the strange passion of his daughter for this
 animal, and believing her bewitched, would pursue everywhere the
 unfortunate bull, who would infallibly be burned as a sorcerer in the
 public place of Tanis, or given to the fish of Jonah, or be roasted and
 served up for food. Mambres wanted at all events to save the princess
 from this cruel disaster.
 
 He wrote a letter in sacred characters, to his friend, the high priest
 of Memphis, upon the paper of Egypt, which was not yet in use. Here are
 the identical words of this letter:
 
      "Light of the world, lieutenant of Isis, Osiris, and Horus, chief
      of the circumcised, you whose altar is justly raised above all
      thrones! I am informed that your god, the ox Apis, is dead. I have
      one at your service. Come quickly with your priests to acknowledge,
      to worship him, and to conduct him into the stable of your temple.
      May Isis, Osiris, and Horus, keep you in their holy and worthy
      protection, and likewise the priests of Memphis in their holy care.
 
                                    Your affectionate friend,
                                                    Mambres."
 
 
 He made four copies of this letter for fear of accidents, and enclosed
 them in cases of the hardest ebony. Then calling to him his four
 couriers, whom he had destined for this employment, (these were the ass,
 the dog, the raven, and the pigeon,) he said to the ass:
 
 "I know with what fidelity you served Balaam my brother. Serve me as
 faithfully. There is not an unicorn who equals you in swiftness. Go, my
 dear friend, and deliver this letter to the person himself to whom it is
 directed, and return."
 
 The ass answered:
 
 "Sir, as I served Balaam, I will serve you. I will go, and I will
 return."
 
 The sage put the box of ebony into her mouth, and she swiftly departed.
 He then called Tobit's dog.
 
 "Faithful dog," said Mambres, "more speedy in thy course than the
 nimble-footed Achilles, I know what you performed for Tobit, son of
 Tobit, when you and the angel Raphael accompanied him from Nineveh to
 Ragusa in Medea, and from Ragusa to Nineveh, and that he brought back to
 his father ten talents, which the slave Tobit, the father, had lent to
 the slave Gabellus; for the slaves at that time were very rich. Carry
 this letter as it is directed. It is much more valuable than ten talents
 of silver."
 
 The dog then replied:
 
 "Sir, if I formerly followed the messenger Raphael, I can with equal
 ease execute your commission."
 
 Mambres put the letter into his mouth.
 
 He next spoke in the same manner to the pigeon, who replied.
 
 "Sir, if I brought back a bough into the ark, I will likewise bring you
 back an answer."
 
 She took the letter in her bill, and the three messengers were out of
 sight in a moment. Then Mambres addressed the raven,
 
 "I know that you fed the great prophet Elijah, when he was concealed
 near the torrent of Cherith, so much celebrated in the world. You
 brought him every day good bread and fat pullets. I only ask of you to
 carry this letter to Memphis."
 
 The raven answered in these words:
 
 "It is true, sir, that I carried every day a dinner to the great prophet
 Elijah the Tishbite. I saw him mount in a chariot of fire drawn by fiery
 horses, although this is not the usual method of traveling. But I always
 took care to eat half the dinner myself. I am very well pleased to carry
 your letter, provided you make me certain of two good meals every day,
 and that I am paid money in advance for my commission."
 
 Mambres, angry, replied:
 
 "Gluttonous and malicious creature, I am not astonished that Apollo has
 made you black as a mole, after being white as a swan, as you was
 formerly before you betrayed in the plains of Thessaly the beautiful
 Coronis, the unfortunate mother of Æsculapius. Tell me, did you eat ribs
 of beef and pullets every day when you was ten whole months in the ark?"
 
 "Sir," said the raven, "we had there very good cheer. They served up
 roast meat twice a day to all the fowls of my species who live upon
 nothing but flesh, such as the vultures, kites, eagles, buzzards,
 sparrow-hawks, owls, tarsels, falcons, great owls, and an innumerable
 crowd of birds of prey. They furnished, with the most plentiful
 profusion, the tables of the lions, leopards, tigers, panthers, hyænas,
 wolves, bears, foxes, polecats, and all sorts of carnivorous quadrupeds.
 There were in the ark eight persons of distinction, (and the only ones
 who were then in the world,) continually employed in the care of our
 table and our wardrobe; Noah and his wife, who were about six hundred
 years old, their three sons and their three wives. It was charming to
 see with what care, what dexterity, what cleanliness, our eight
 domestics served four thousand of the most ravenous guests, without
 reckoning the amazing trouble which about ten or twelve thousand other
 animals required, from the elephant and the giraffe, to the silk-worm
 and fly. What astonishes me is, that our purveyor Noah is unknown to all
 the nations of whom he is the stem, but I don't much mind it. I had
 already been present at a similar entertainment with Xesustres king of
 Thrace. Such things as these happen from time to time for the
 instruction of ravens. In a word, I want to have good cheer, and to be
 paid in ready money."
 
 The wise Mambres took care not to give his letter to such a discontented
 and babbling animal; and they separated very much dissatisfied with each
 other.
 
 But it is necessary to know what became of the white bull, and not to
 lose sight of the old woman and the serpent. Mambres ordered his
 intelligent and faithful domestics to follow them; and as for himself,
 he advanced in a litter by the side of the Nile, always making

 jovial song, made fast a small boat by the side of the river, and three
 grave personages, half clothed in dirty, tattered garments, landed from
 it; but preserved, under the garb of poverty the most majestic and
 august air. These strangers were Daniel, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah."]
 
 "How is it possible," said he to himself, "that a serpent should be
 master of almost all the world, as he boasts, and as so many learned men
 acknowledge, and that he nevertheless obeys an old woman? How is it,
 that he is sometimes called to the council of the Most High, while he
 creeps upon earth? In what manner can he enter by his power alone into
 the bodies of men, and that so many men pretend to dislodge him by means
 of words? In short, why does he pass with a small neighboring people,
 for having ruined the human race? And how is it that the human race are
 entirely ignorant of this? I am old, I have studied all my life, but I
 see a crowd of inconsistencies which I cannot reconcile. I cannot
 account for what has happened to myself, neither for the great things
 which I long ago performed, nor those of which I have been witness.
 Every thing well considered, I begin to think that this world subsists
 by contradictions, _rerum concordia discors_, as my master Zoroaster
 formerly said."
 
 While he was plunged in this obscure metaphysical reasoning,--obscure
 like all metaphysics,--a boatman singing a jovial song, made fast a
 small boat by the side of the river, and three grave personages, half
 clothed in dirty tattered garments, landed from it; but preserved, under
 the garb of poverty, the most majestic and august air. These strangers
 were Daniel, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah.
 
 
 [1] "Histories," says Pope, in his _Poetical Works_, vol. 4, p. 245,
 "are more full of examples of the fidelity of dogs than of friends, but:
 I will only say for the honor of dogs, that the two most ancient and
 estimable books, sacred and profane, extant, viz. the Scripture and
 Homer, have shown a particular regard to these animals. That of Tobit is
 the most remarkable, because there seemed no manner of reason to take
 notice of the dog, besides the great humanity of the author. ['And the
 dog went after them,' _Tobit_, xi: 4.] Homer's account of Ulysses's dog,
 Argus, is the most pathetic imaginable, all the circumstances
 considered, and an excellent proof of the old bard's good nature....
 Plutarch, relating how the Athenians were obliged to abandon Athens in
 the time of Themistocles, steps back again out of the way of his
 history, purely to describe the lamentable cries and howlings of the
 poor dogs they left behind. He makes mention of one that followed his
 master across the sea to Salamis, where he died, and was honored with a
 tomb by the Athenians, who gave the name of the Dog's Grave to that part
 of the island where he was buried. This respect to a dog, in the most
 polite people of the world, is very observable. A modern instance of
 gratitude to a dog is, that the chief order of Denmark, (now injuriously
 called the order of the elephant), was instituted in memory of the
 fidelity of a dog, named Wildbrat, to one of their kings who had been
 deserted by his subjects. He gave his order this motto, or to this
 effect, (which still remains), 'Wildbrat was faithful.' Sir William
 Trumbull has told me a story, which he heard from one that was present.
 King Charles I. being with some of his Court, during his troubles, a
 discourse arose what sort of dogs deserved pre-eminence, and it being on
 all hands agreed to belong either to the spaniel or greyhound, the King
 gave his opinion on the part of the greyhound, because (said he) it has
 all the good-nature of the other without the fawning."
 
 This satire upon fawning would no doubt have been as applicable to the
 court of king Amasis as to that of Charles I., for fawning has ever been
 the besetting sin of dogs and courtiers.
 
 It is indeed a grand testimonial to the value of the greyhound, that his
 fleetness and fidelity were appreciated by Mambres, the great Egyptian
 magician, five thousand years before they were endorsed by the
 unfortunate English king. Miss Endor, Homer, Ulysses, Mambres, Tobit,
 Plutarch, the polite Athenians, Charles I., and Alexander Pope are
 certainly as respectable a list of references as the most aristocratic
 greyhound could desire.--E.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER VI.
 
 HOW MAMBRES MET THREE PROPHETS, AND GAVE THEM A GOOD DINNER.
 
 
 These three great men who had the prophetic light in their countenance,
 knew the wise Mambres to be one of their brethren, by some marks of the
 same light which he had still remaining, and prostrated themselves
 before his litter. Mambres likewise knew them to be prophets, more by
 their uncouth dress, than by those gleams of fire which proceeded from
 their august heads. He conjectured that they came to learn news of the
 white bull; and conducting himself with his usual propriety, he alighted
 from his carriage and advanced a few steps toward them, with dignified
 politeness. He raised them up, caused tents to be erected, and prepared
 a dinner, of which he rightly judged that the prophets had very great
 need.
 
 He invited the old woman to it, who was only about five hundred paces
 from them. She accepted the invitation, and arrived leading her white
 bull.
 
 Two soups were served up, one _de Bisque_, and the other _a la Reine_.
 The first course consisted of a carp's tongue pie, livers of eel-pouts,
 and pikes; fowls dressed with pistachios, pigeons with truffles and
 olives; two young turkeys with gravy of cray fish, mushrooms, and
 morels; and a chipotata. The second course was composed of pheasants,
 partridges, quails, and ortalons, with four salads; the epergne was in
 the highest taste; nothing could be more delicious than the side dishes,
 nothing more brilliant and more ingenious than the dessert. But the wise
 Mambres took great care to have no boiled beef, nor short ribs, nor
 tongue, nor palate of an ox, nor cows' udder, lest the unfortunate
 monarch near at hand should think that they insulted him.
 
 This great and unfortunate prince was feeding near the tent; and never
 did he feel in a more cruel manner the fatal revolution which had
 deprived him of his throne for seven long years.
 
 "Alas!" said he, to himself, "this Daniel who has changed me into a
 bull, and this sorceress my keeper, make the best cheer in the world;
 while I, the sovereign of Asia, am reduced to the necessity of eating
 grass, and drinking water."
 
 When they had drank heartily of the wine of Engaddi, of Tadmor, and of
 Sebiras, the prophets and the witch conversed with more frankness than
 at the first course.
 
 "I must acknowledge," said Daniel, "that I did not live so well in the
 lion's den."
 
 "What, sir," said Mambres, "did they put you into a den of lions? How
 came you not to be devoured?"
 
 "Sir," said Daniel, "you know very well that lions never eat prophets."
 
 "As for me," said Jeremiah, "I have passed my whole life starving of
 hunger. This is the only day I ever ate a good meal; and were I to spend
 my life over again, and had it in my power to choose my condition, I
 must own I would much rather be comptroller-general or bishop of
 Babylon, than prophet at Jerusalem."
 
 Ezekiel cried, "I was once ordered to sleep three hundred and ninety
 days upon my left side, and to eat all that time bread of wheat, and
 barley, and beans, and lentiles, cooked in the strangest manner. Still I
 must own that the cookery of Seigneur Mambres is much more delicate.
 However, the prophetic trade has its advantages, and the proof is, that
 there are many who follow it."
 
 After they had spoken thus freely, Mambres entered upon business. He
 asked the three pilgrims the reason of their journey into the dominions
 of the king of Tanis. Daniel replied, "That the kingdom of Babylon had
 been all in a flame since Nebuchadnezzar had disappeared: that according
 to the custom of the court, they had persecuted all the prophets, who
 passed their lives in sometimes seeing kings humbled at their feet, and
 sometimes receiving a hundred lashes from them; that at length they had
 been obliged to take refuge in Egypt for fear of being starved."
 
 Ezekiel and Jeremiah likewise spoke a long time in such fine terms, that
 it was almost impossible to understand them. As for the witch, she had
 always a strict eye over her charge. The fish of Jonah continued in the
 Nile, opposite to the tent, and the serpent sported upon the grass.
 After drinking coffee, they took a walk by the side of the Nile; and the
 white bull, perceiving the three prophets, his enemies, bellowed most
 dreadfully, ran furiously at them, and gored them with his horns. As
 prophets never have anything but skin upon their bones, he would
 certainly have run them through; but the ruler of the world, who sees
 all and remedies all, changed them immediately into magpies; and they
 continued to chatter as before. The same thing happened since to the
 Pierides;[1] so much has fable always imitated sacred history.
 
 This incident caused new reflections in the mind of Mambres.
 
 "Here," said he, "are three great prophets changed into magpies. This
 ought to teach us never to speak too much, and always to observe a
 suitable discretion."
 
 He concluded that wisdom was better than eloquence, and thought
 profoundly as usual; when a great and terrible spectacle presented
 itself to his eyes.
 
 
 [1] The nine daughters of Pierus, king of Emathia, were called Pierides.
 They entered into a contest with the Muses, and being conquered were
 metamorphosed into birds.--E.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER VII.
 
 HOW KING AMASIS WANTED TO GIVE THE WHITE BULL TO BE DEVOURED BY THE FISH
 OF JONAH, AND DID NOT DO IT.
 
 
 Clouds of dust floated from south to north. The noise of drums, fifes,
 psalteries, harps, and sackbuts was heard. Several squadrons and
 battalions advanced, and Amasis, king of Tanis, was at their head upon
 an Arabian horse caparisoned with scarlet trappings embroidered with
 gold. The heralds proclaimed that they should seize the white bull, bind
 him, and throw him into the Nile, to be devoured by the fish of Jonah;
 "for the king our lord, who is just, wants to revenge himself upon the
 white bull, who has bewitched his daughter."
 
 The good old man Mambres made more reflections than ever. He saw very
 plainly that the malicious raven had told all to the king, and that the
 princess ran a great risk of being beheaded.
 
 "My dear friend," said he to the serpent, "go quickly and comfort the
 fair Amasidia, my foster daughter. Bid her fear nothing whatever may
 happen, and tell her stories to alleviate her inquietude; for stories
 always amuse the ladies, and it is only by interesting them that one can
 succeed in the world."
 
 Mambres next prostrated himself before Amasis, king of Tanis, and thus
 addressed him:
 
 "O king, live for ever! The white bull should certainly be sacrificed,
 for your majesty is always in the right, but the ruler of the world has
 said, this bull must not be swallowed up by the fish of Jonah till
 Memphis shall have found a god to supply the place of him who is dead.
 Then thou shalt be revenged, and thy daughter exorcised, for she is
 possessed. Your piety is too great not to obey the commands of the ruler
 of the universe."
 
 Amasis, king of Tanis, remained for some time silent and in deep
 thought.
 
 "The god Apis," said he, at length, "is dead! God rest his soul! When do
 you think another ox will be found to reign over the fruitful Egypt?"
 
 "Sire," replied Mambres, "I ask but eight days."
 
 "I grant them to you," replied the king, who was very religious, "and I
 will remain here the eight days. At the expiration of that time I will
 sacrifice the enemy of my daughter."
 
 Amasis immediately ordered that his tents, cooks, and musicians should
 be brought, and remained here eight days, as it is related in Manethon.
 
 The old woman was in despair that the bull she had in charge had but
 eight days to live. She raised phantoms every night, in order to
 dissuade the king from his cruel resolution; but Amasis forgot in the
 morning the phantoms he had seen in the night; similar to
 Nebuchadnezzar, who had always forgotten his dreams.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER VIII.
 
 HOW THE SERPENT TOLD STORIES TO THE PRINCESS TO COMFORT HER.
 
 
 Meanwhile the serpent told stories to the fair Amasidia to soothe her.
 He related to her how he had formerly cured a whole nation of the bite
 of certain little serpents, only by showing himself at the end of a
 staff. (_Num. xx:9._) He informed her of the conquests of a hero who
 made a charming contrast with Amphion, architect of Thebes. Amphion
 assembled hewn stones by the sound of his violin. To build a city he had
 only to play a rigadoon and a minuet; but the other hero destroyed them
 by the sound of rams' horns. He executed thirty-one powerful kings in a
 country of four leagues in length and four in breadth. He made stones
 rain down from heaven upon a battalion of routed Amorites; and having
 thus exterminated them, he stopped the sun and moon at noon-day between
 Gibeon and Ajalon, in the road to Beth-horon, to exterminate them still
 more, after the example of Bacchus, who had stopped the sun and the moon
 in his journey to the Indies.
 
 The prudence which every serpent ought to have, did not allow him to
 tell the fair Amasidia of the powerful Jephthah, who made a vow and
 beheaded his daughter, because he had gained a battle. This would have
 struck terror into the mind of the fair princess. But he related to her
 the adventures of the great Sampson, who killed a thousand Philistines
 with the jaw-bone of an ass, who tied together three hundred foxes by
 the tail, and who fell into the snares of a lady, less beautiful, less
 tender, and less faithful than the charming Amasidia.
 
 He related to her the story of the unfortunate Sechem and Dinah, as well
 as the more celebrated adventures of Ruth and Boaz; those of Judah and
 Tamar; those even of Lot's two daughters; those of Abraham and Jacob's
 servant maids; those of Reuben and Bilhah; those of David and
 Bath-sheba; and those of the great king Solomon. In short, every thing
 which could dissipate the grief of a fair princess.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER IX.
 
 HOW THE SERPENT DID NOT COMFORT THE PRINCESS.
 
 
 "All these stories tire me," said Amasidia, for she had understanding
 and taste. "They are good for nothing but to be commented upon among the
 Irish by that madman Abbadie, or among the Welsh by that prattler
 d'Houteville. Stories which might have amused the great, great, great
 grandmother of my grandmother, appear insipid to me who have been
 educated by the wise Mambres, and who have read _Human Understanding_ by
 the Egyptian philosopher named Locke[1] and the _Matron of Ephesus_. I
 choose that a story should be founded on probability, and not always
 resemble a dream. I desire to find nothing in it trivial or extravagant;
 and I desire above all, that under the appearance of fable there may
 appear some latent truth, obvious to the discerning eye, though it
 escape the observation of the vulgar."
 
 "I am weary of a sun and of a moon which an old beldam disposes of at
 her pleasure, of mountains which dance, of rivers which return to their
 sources, and of dead men who rise again; but I am above measure
 disgusted when such insipid stories are written in a bombastic and
 unintelligible manner. A lady who expects to see her lover swallowed up
 by a great fish, and who is apprehensive of being beheaded by her own
 father, has need of amusement; but suit amusement to my taste."
 
 "You impose a difficult task upon me," replied the serpent. "I could
 have formerly made you pass a few hours agreeably enough, but for some
 time past I have lost both my imagination and memory. Alas! what has
 become of those faculties with which I formerly amused the ladies? Let
 me try, however, if I can recollect one moral tale for your
 entertainment.
 
 "Five and twenty thousand years ago king Gnaof and queen Patra reigned
 in Thebes with its hundred gates. King Gnaof was very handsome, and
 queen Patra still more beautiful. But their home was unblest with
 children, and no heirs were born to continue the royal race.
 
 "The members of the faculty of medicine and of the academy of surgery
 wrote excellent treatises upon this subject. The queen was sent to drink
 mineral waters; she fasted and prayed; she made magnificent presents to
 the temple of Jupiter Ammon, but all was to no purpose. At length a----"
 
 "Mon Dieu!" said the princess, "but I see where this leads. This story
 is too common, and I must likewise tell you that it offends my modesty.
 Relate some very true and moral story, which I have never yet heard, to
 complete the improvement of my understanding and my heart, as the
 Egyptian professor Lenro says."
 
 "Here then, madam," said the beautiful serpent, "is one most
 incontestably authentic.
 
 "There were three prophets all equally ambitious and discontented with
 their condition. They had in common the folly to wish to be kings: for
 there is only one step from the rank of a prophet to that of a monarch,
 and man always aspires to the highest step in the ladder of fortune. In
 other respects, their inclinations and their pleasures were totally
 different. The first preached admirably to his assembled brethren, who
 applauded him by clapping their hands; the second was distractedly fond
 of music; and the third was a passionate lover of the fair sex.
 
 "The angel Ithuriel presented himself one day to them when they were at
 table discoursing on the sweets of royalty.
 
 "'The ruler of the world,' said the angel to them, 'sends me to you to
 reward your virtue. Not only shall you be kings, but you shall
 constantly satisfy your ruling passions. Your first prophet, I make king
 of Egypt, and you shall continually preside in your council, who shall
 applaud your eloquence and your wisdom; and you, second prophet, I make
 king over Persia, and you shall continually hear most heavenly music;
 and you, third prophet, I make king of India, and I give you a charming
 mistress who shall never forsake you.'
 
 "He to whose lot Egypt fell, began his reign by assembling his council,
 which was composed only of two hundred sages. He made them a long and
 eloquent speech, which was very much applauded, and the monarch enjoyed
 the pleasing satisfaction of intoxicating himself with praises
 uncorrupted by flattery.
 
 "The council for foreign affairs succeeded to the privy council. This
 was much more numerous; and a new speech received still greater
 encomiums. And it was the same in the other councils. There was not a
 moment of intermission in the pleasures and glory of the prophet king of
 Egypt. The fame of his eloquence filled the world.
 
 "The prophet king of Persia began his reign by an Italian opera, whose
 choruses were sung by fifteen hundred eunuchs. Their voices penetrated
 his soul even to the very marrow of the bones, where it resides. To this
 opera succeeded another, and to the second a third, without
 interruption.
 
 "The king of India shut himself up with his mistress, and enjoyed
 perfect pleasure in her society. He considered the necessity of always
 flattering her as the highest felicity, and pitied the wretched
 situation of his two brethren, of whom one was obliged always to convene
 his council, and the other to be continually at an opera.
 
 "It happened at the end of a few days, that each of these kings became
 disgusted with his occupation, and beheld from his window, certain
 wood-cutters who came from an ale-house, and who were going to work in a
 neighboring forest. They walked arm in arm with their sweet-hearts, with
 whom they were happy. The kings begged of the angel Ithuriel, that he
 would intercede with the ruler of the world, and make them
 wood-cutters."
 
 "I do not know whether the ruler of the world granted their request or
 not," interrupted the tender Amasidia, "and I do not care much about it;
 but I know very well that I should ask for nothing of any one, were I
 with my lover, with my dear NEBUCHADNEZZAR!"
 
 The vaults of the palace resounded this mighty name. At first Amasidia
 had only pronounced Ne--, afterwards Neb--, then Nebu----. At length
 passion hurried her on, and she pronounced entire the fatal name,
 notwithstanding the oath she had sworn to the king, her father. All the
 ladies of the court repeated Nebuchadnezzar, and the malicious raven did
 not fail to carry the tidings to the king. The countenance of Amasis,
 king of Tanis, sunk, because his heart was troubled. And thus it was
 that the serpent, the wisest and most subtle of animals, always beguiled
 the women, thinking to do them service.
 
 Amasis, in a fury, sent twelve alguazils for his daughter. These men are
 always ready to execute barbarous orders, because they are paid for it.
 
 
 [1] The doctrine of metempsychosis must be relied upon to explain this
 seeming anachronism.--E.

 CHAPTER X.
 
 HOW THEY WANTED TO BEHEAD THE PRINCESS, AND DID NOT DO IT.
 
 
 No sooner had the princess entered the camp of the king, than he said to
 her: "My daughter, you know that all princesses who disobey their
 fathers are put to death; without which it would be impossible that a
 kingdom could be well governed. I charged you never to mention the name
 of your lover, Nebuchadnezzar, my mortal enemy, who dethroned me about
 seven years ago, and disappeared. In his place, you have chosen a white
 bull, and you have cried Nebuchadnezzar. It is just that I behead you."
 
 The princess replied: "My father, thy will be done: but grant me some
 time to bewail my sad fate."
 
 "That is reasonable," said King Amasis; "and it is a rule established
 among the most judicious princes. I give you a whole day to bewail your
 destiny, since it is your desire. To-morrow, which is the eighth day of
 my encampment, I will cause the white bull to be swallowed up by the
 fish, and I will behead you precisely at nine o'clock in the morning."
 
 The beautiful Amasidia then went forth in sorrow, to bewail her father's
 cruelty, and wandered by the side of the Nile, accompanied with the
 ladies of her train.
 
 The wise Mambres pondered beside her, and reckoned the hours and the
 moments.
 
 "Well! my dear Mambres," said she to him, "you have changed the waters
 of the Nile into blood, according to custom, and cannot you change the
 heart of Amasis, king of Tanis, my father? Will you suffer him to behead
 me to-morrow, at nine o'clock in the morning?"
 
 "That depends," replied the reflecting Mambres, "upon the speed and
 diligence of my couriers."
 
 The next day, as soon as the shadows of the obelisks and pyramids marked
 upon the ground the ninth hour of the day, the white bull was securely
 bound, to be thrown to the fish of Jonah; and they brought to the king
 his large sabre.
 
 "Alas! alas!" said Nebuchadnezzar to himself, "I, a king, have been a
 bull for near seven years; and scarcely have I found the mistress I had
 lost when I am condemned to be devoured by a fish."
 
 Never had the wise Mambres made such profound reflections; and he was
 quite absorbed in his melancholy thoughts when he saw at a distance all
 he expected. An innumerable crowd drew nigh. Three figures of Isis,
 Osiris, and Horus, joined together, advanced, drawn in a carriage of
 gold and precious stones, by a hundred senators of Memphis, preceded by
 a hundred girls, playing upon the sacred sistrums. Four thousand
 priests, with their heads shaved, were each mounted upon a hippopotamus.
 
 At a great distance, appeared with the same pomp, the sheep of Thebes,
 the dog of Babastes, the cat of Phoebe, the crocodile of Arsinoe, the
 goat of Mendez, and all the inferior gods of Egypt, who came to pay
 homage to the great ox, to the mighty Apis, as powerful as Isis, Osiris,
 and Horus, united together.
 
 In the midst of the demi-gods, forty priests carried an enormous basket,
 filled with sacred onions. These were, it is true, gods, but they
 resembled onions very much.
 
 On both sides of this aisle of gods, followed by an innumerable crowd of
 people, marched forty thousand warriors, with helmets on their heads,
 scimitars upon their left thighs, quivers at their shoulders, and bows
 in their hands.
 
 All the priests sang in chorus, with a harmony which ravished the soul,
 and which melted it.
 
      "Alas! alas! our ox is dead--
       We'll have a finer in its stead."
 
 And at every pause was heard the sound of the sistrums, of cymbals, of
 tabors, of psalteries, of bagpipes, harps, and sackbuts.
 
 Amasis, king of Tanis, astonished at this spectacle, beheaded not his
 daughter. He sheathed his scimitar.

 CHAPTER XI.
 
 APOTHEOSIS OF THE WHITE BULL. TRIUMPH OF THE WISE MAMBRES. THE SEVEN
 YEARS PROCLAIMED BY DANIEL ARE ACCOMPLISHED. NEBUCHADNEZZAR RESUMES THE
 HUMAN FORM, MARRIES THE BEAUTIFUL AMASIDIA, AND ASCENDS THE THRONE OF
 BABYLON.
 
 
 "Great king," said Mambres to him, "the order of things is now changed.
 Your majesty must set the example. O king! quickly unbind the white
 bull, and be the first to adore him."
 
 Amasis obeyed, and prostrated himself with all his people. The high
 priest of Memphis presented to the new god Apis the first handful of
 hay; the Princess Amasidia tied to his beautiful horse festoons of
 roses, anemonies, ranunculuses, tulips, pinks, and hyacinths. She took
 the liberty to kiss him, but with a profound respect. The priests
 strewed palms and flowers on the road by which they were to conduct him
 to Memphis. And the wise Mambres, still making reflections, whispered to
 his friend, the serpent:
 
 "_Daniel changed this monarch into a bull, and I have changed this bull
 into a god!"_
 
 They returned to Memphis in the same order, and the king of Tanis, in
 some confusion, followed the band. Mambres, with a serene and diplomatic
 air, walked by his side. The old woman came after, much amazed. She was
 accompanied by the serpent, the dog, the she-ass, the raven, the pigeon,
 and the scape-goat. The great fish mounted up the Nile. Daniel, Ezekiel,
 and Jeremiah, changed into magpies, brought up the rear.
 
 When they had reached the frontiers of the kingdom, which are not far
 distant, King Amasis took leave of the bull Apis, and said to his
 daughter:
 
 "My daughter, let us return into my dominions, that I may behead you, as
 it has been determined in my royal breast, because you have pronounced
 the name of Nebuchadnezzar, my enemy, who dethroned me seven years ago.
 When a father has sworn to behead his daughter, he must either fulfill
 his oath, or sink into hell for ever; and I will not damn myself out of
 love for you."
 
 The fair princess Amasidia replied to the King Amasis:
 
 "My dear father, whom it pleases you go and behead, but it shall not be
 me. I am now in the territories of Isis, Osiris, Horus, and Apis. I will
 never forsake my beautiful white bull, and I will continue to kiss him,
 till I have seen his apotheosis in his stable in the holy city of
 Memphis. It is a weakness pardonable in a young lady of high birth."
 
 Scarce had she spoken these words, when the ox Apis cried out:
 
 "My dear Amasidia, I will love you whilst I live!"
 
 This was the first time that the god Apis had been heard to speak during
 the forty thousand years that he had been worshiped.
 
 The serpent and the she-ass cried out, "the seven years are
 accomplished!" And the three magpies repeated, "the seven years are
 accomplished!"
 
 All the priests of Egypt raised their hands to heaven.
 
 The god on a sudden was seen to lose his two hind legs, his two fore
 legs were changed into two human legs; two white strong muscular arms
 grew from his shoulders; his taurine visage was changed to the face of a
 charming hero; and he once more became the most beautiful of mortals.
 
 "I choose," cried he, "rather to be the lover of the beautiful Amasidia
 than a god. I am NEBUCHADNEZZAR, KING OF KINGS!"
 
 This metamorphosis astonished all the world, except the wise Mambres.
 But what surprised nobody was, that Nebuchadnezzar immediately married
 the fair Amasidia in presence of this assembly.
 
 He left his father-in-law in quiet possession of the kingdom of Tanis;
 and made noble provision for the she-ass, the serpent, the dog, the
 pigeon, and even for the raven, the three magpies, and the large fish;
 showing to all the world that he knew how to forgive as well as to
 conquer.
 
 The old woman had a considerable pension placed at her disposal.
 
 The scape-goat was sent for a day into the wilderness, that all past
 sins might be expiated; and had afterwards twelve sprightly goats for
 his companions.
 
 The wise Mambres returned to his palace, and made reflections.
 
 Nebuchadnezzar, after having embraced the magician, his benefactor,
 governed in tranquillity the kingdoms of Memphis, Babylon, Damascus,
 Balbec, Tyre, Syria, Asia Minor, Scythia, the countries of Thiras,
 Mosok, Tubal, Madai, Gog, Magog, Javan, Sogdiana, Aroriana, the Indies,
 and the Isles; and the people of this vast empire cried out aloud every
 morning at the rising of the sun:
 
 _"Long live great Nebuchadnezzar, king of kings, who is no longer an
 ox!"_
 
 Since which time it has been a custom in Babylon, when the sovereign,
 deceived by his satraps, his magicians, treasurers or wives, at length
 acknowledges his errors, and amends his conduct, for all the people to
 cry out at his gate:
 
 _Long live our great king, who is no longer an ox._

      APPROBATION.
 
      I, the underwritten, who have obtained the character of a learned,
      and even of an ingenious man, have read this manuscript, which, in
      spite of myself, I have found to be curious, entertaining, moral,
      philosophical, and capable of affording pleasure even to those who
      hate romances. I have therefore decried it; and have assured the
      cadi-lesquier that it is an abominable performance.

      EPISTLE DEDICATORY TO THE SULTANA SERAA.
 
      _The 18th of the month Schewal, in the 837th year of the Hegira._
 
 
      Delight of the eyes, torment of the heart, and light of the mind, I
      kiss not the dust of thy feet, because thou never walkest; or
      walkest only on the carpets of Iran, or in paths strewn with roses.
 
      I offer thee the translation of a book, written by an ancient sage,
      who, having the happiness to have nothing to do, amused himself in
      composing the _History of Zadig_; a work which performs more than
      it promises.
 
      I beseech thee to read and examine it; for, though thou art in the
      spring of life, and every pleasure courts thee to its embrace;
      though thou art beautiful, and thy beauty be embellished by thy
      admirable talents; though thou art praised from morning to evening,
      and, on all these accounts, hast a right to be devoid of common
      sense, yet thou hast a sound judgment and a fine taste; and I have
      heard thee reason with more accuracy than the old dervises, with
      their long beards and pointed bonnets.
 
      Thou art discreet without being distrustful; gentle without
      weakness; and beneficent with discernment. Thou lovest thy friends,
      and makest thyself no enemies. Thy wit never borrows its charms
      from the shafts of detraction. Thou neither sayest nor doest any
      ill, notwithstanding that both are so much in thy power.
 
      In a word, thy soul hath always appeared to me to be as pure and
      unsullied as thy beauty. Besides, thou hast some little knowledge
      in philosophy, which makes me believe that thou wilt take more
      pleasure than others of thy sex in perusing the work of this
      venerable sage.
 
      It was originally written in the ancient Chaldee, a language which
      neither thou nor I understand. It was afterward translated into the
      Arabic, to amuse the famous sultan Oulougbeg, much about the time
      that the Arabians and the Persians began to write the _Thousand and
      One Nights_, the _Thousand and One Days_, _etc._
 
      Ouloug was fond of reading _Zadig_, but the sultanas were fonder of
      the _Thousand and One_. "How can you prefer," said the wise Ouloug
      to them, "those stories which have neither sense nor meaning?" "It
      is for that very reason," replied the sultanas, "that we prefer
      them."
 
      I flatter myself that thou wilt not resemble these, thy
      predecessors; but that thou wilt be a true Ouloug. I even hope,
      that when thou art tired with those general conversations, which
      differ from the _Thousand and One_ in nothing but in being less
      agreeable, I shall have the honor to entertain thee for a moment
      with a rational discourse.
 
      Hadst thou been Thalestris in the time of Scander, the son of
      Philip; hadst thou been the Queen of Sheba in the time of Solomon;
      these are the very kings that would have paid thee a visit.
 
      I pray the heavenly powers, that thy pleasures may be unmixed, thy
      beauty never fading, and thy happiness without end.
 
                                                               SADI.

 I.
 
 THE BLIND OF ONE EYE.
 
 
 There lived at Babylon, in the reign of King Moabdar, a young man, named
 Zadig, of a good natural disposition, strengthened and improved by
 education. Though rich and young, he had learned to moderate his
 passions. He had nothing stiff or affected in his behavior. He did not
 pretend to examine every action by the strict rules of reason, but was
 always ready to make proper allowances for the weakness of mankind. It
 was a matter of surprise, that, notwithstanding his sprightly wit, he
 never exposed by his raillery those vague, incoherent, and noisy
 discourses; those rash censures, ignorant decisions, coarse jests, and
 all that empty jingle of words which at Babylon went by the name of
 conversation. He had learned, in the first book of Zoroaster, that
 self-love is a foot-ball swelled with wind, from which, when pierced,
 the most terrible tempests issue forth. Above all, Zadig never boasted
 of his conquests among the women, nor affected to entertain a
 contemptible opinion of the fair sex. He was generous, and was never
 afraid of obliging the ungrateful; remembering the grand precept of
 Zoroaster, "When thou eatest, give to the dogs, should they even bite
 thee." He was as wise as it is possible for man to be, for he sought to
 live with the wise. Instructed in the sciences of the ancient Chaldeans,
 he understood the principles of natural philosophy, such as they were
 then supposed to be; and knew as much of metaphysics as hath ever been
 known in any age, that is, little or nothing at all. He was firmly
 persuaded, notwithstanding the new philosophy of the times, that the
 year consisted of three hundred and sixty-five days and six hours, and
 that the sun was the centre of the solar system. When the principal magi
 told him, with a haughty and contemptuous air, that his sentiments were
 of a dangerous tendency, and that it was to be an enemy to the state to
 believe that the sun revolved round its own axis, and that the year had
 twelve months, he held his tongue with great modesty and meekness.
 
 Possessed as he was of great riches, and consequently of many friends,
 blessed with a good constitution, a handsome figure, a mind just and
 moderate, and a heart noble and sincere, he fondly imagined that he
 might easily be happy. He was going to be married to Semira, who, in
 point of beauty, birth, and fortune, was the first match in Babylon. He
 had a real and virtuous affection for this lady, and she loved him with
 the most passionate fondness. The happy moment was almost arrived that
 was to unite them for ever in the bands of wedlock, when happening to
 take a walk together toward one of the gates of Babylon, under the
 palm-trees that adorn the banks of the Euphrates, they saw some men
 approaching, armed with sabres and arrows. These were the attendants of
 young Orcan, the minister's nephew, whom his uncle's creatures had
 flattered into an opinion that he might do everything with impunity. He
 had none of the graces nor virtues of Zadig; but thinking himself a much
 more accomplished man, he was enraged to find that the other was
 preferred before him. This jealousy, which was merely the effect of his
 vanity, made him imagine that he was desperately in love with Semira;
 and accordingly he resolved to carry her off. The ravishers seized her;
 in the violence of the outrage, they wounded her, and made the blood
 flow from a person, the sight of which would have softened the tigers
 of mount Imaus. She pierced the heavens with her complaints. She cried
 out: "My dear husband! they tear me from the man I adore!"
 
 Regardless of her own danger, she was only concerned for the fate of her
 dear Zadig, who, in the meantime, defended himself with all the strength
 that courage and love could inspire. Assisted only by two faithful
 slaves, he put the cowardly ravishers to flight, and carried home
 Semira, insensible and bloody as she was.
 
 "O Zadig," said she, on opening her eyes, and beholding her deliverer,
 "I loved thee formerly as my intended husband, I now love thee as the
 preserver of my honor and my life!"
 
 Never was heart more deeply affected than that of Semira. Never did a
 more charming mouth express more moving sentiments, in those glowing
 words inspired by a sense of the greatest of all favors, and by the most
 tender transports of a lawful passion. Her wound was slight, and was
 soon cured. Zadig was more dangerously wounded. An arrow had pierced him
 near his eye, and penetrated to a considerable depth, Semira wearied
 heaven with her prayers for the recovery of her lover. Her eyes were
 constantly bathed in tears; she anxiously waited the happy moment when
 those of Zadig should be able to meet hers; but an abscess growing on
 the wounded eye, gave everything to fear. A messenger was immediately
 dispatched to Memphis, for the great physician Hermes, who came with a
 numerous retinue. He visited the patient, and declared that he would
 lose his eye. He even foretold the day and hour when this fatal event
 would happen.
 
 "Had it been the right eye," said he, "I could easily have cured it; but
 the wounds of the left eye are incurable."
 
 All Babylon lamented the fate of Zadig, and admired the profound
 knowledge of Hermes. In two days the abscess broke of its own accord,
 and Zadig was perfectly cured. Hermes wrote a book, to prove that it
 ought not to have been cured. Zadig did not read it: but, as soon as he
 was able to go abroad, he went to pay a visit to her in whom all his
 hopes of happiness were centered, and for whose sake alone he wished to
 have eyes. Semira had been in the country for three days past. He
 learned on the road, that that fine lady, having openly declared that
 she had an unconquerable aversion to one-eyed men, had the night before
 given her hand to Orcan. At this news he fell speechless to the ground.
 His sorrows brought him almost to the brink of the grave. He was long
 indisposed; but reason at last got the better of his affliction; and the
 severity of his fate served even to console him.
 
 "Since," said he, "I have suffered so much from the cruel caprice of a
 woman educated at court, I must now think of marrying the daughter of a
 citizen."
 
 He pitched upon Azora, a lady of the greatest prudence, and of the best
 family in town. He married her, and lived with her for three months in
 all the delights of the most tender union. He only observed that she had
 a little levity; and was too apt to find that those young men who had
 the most handsome persons were likewise possessed of the most wit and
 virtue.
 
 
 
 
 II.
 
 THE NOSE.
 
 
 One morning Azora returned from a walk in a terrible passion and
 uttering the most violent exclamations.
 
 "What aileth thee," said he, "my dear spouse? What is it that can thus
 have disturbed thee?"
 
 "Alas!" said she, "thou wouldst have been as much enraged as I am, hadst
 thou seen what I have just beheld. I have been to comfort the young
 widow Cosrou, who, within these two days, hath raised a tomb to her
 young husband, near the rivulet that washes the skirts of this meadow.
 She vowed to heaven, in the bitterness of her grief, to remain at this
 tomb whilst the water of the rivulet should continue to run near it."
 
 "Well," said Zadig, "she is an excellent woman, and loved her husband
 with the most sincere affection."
 
 "Ah!" replied Azora, "didst thou but know in what she was employed when
 I went to wait upon her!"
 
 "In what, pray tell me, beautiful Azora? Was she turning the course of
 the rivulet?"
 
 Azora broke out into such long invectives, and loaded the young widow
 with such bitter reproaches, that Zadig was far from being pleased with
 this ostentation of virtue.
 
 Zadig had a friend named Cador; one of those young men in whom his wife
 discovered more probity and merit than in others. He made him his
 confidant, and secured his fidelity as much as possible by a
 considerable present. Azora, having passed two days with a friend in the
 country, returned home on the third. The servants told her, with tears
 in their eyes, that her husband died suddenly the night before; that
 they were afraid to send her an account of this mournful event; and that
 they had just been depositing his corpse in the tomb of his ancestors,
 at the end of the garden. She wept, she tore her hair, and swore she
 would follow him to the grave. In the evening, Cador begged leave to
 wait upon her, and joined his tears with hers. Next day they wept less,
 and dined together. Cador told her, that his friend had left him the
 greater part of his estate; and that he should think himself extremely
 happy in sharing his fortune with her. The lady wept, fell into a
 passion, and at last became more mild and gentle. They sat longer at
 supper than at dinner. They now talked with greater confidence. Azora
 praised the deceased; but owned that he had many failings from which
 Cador was free.
 
 During supper, Cador complained of a violent pain in his side. The lady,
 greatly concerned, and eager to serve him, caused all kinds of essences
 to be brought, with which she anointed him, to try if some of them might
 not possibly ease him of his pain. She lamented that the great Hermes
 was not still in Babylon. She even condescended to touch the side in
 which Cador felt such exquisite pain.
 
 "Art thou subject to this cruel disorder?" said she to him, with a
 compassionate air.
 
 "It sometimes brings me," replied Cador, "to the brink of the grave; and
 there is but one remedy that can give me relief--and that is, to apply
 to my side the nose of a man who is lately dead."
 
 "A strange remedy, indeed!" said Azora.
 
 "Not more strange," replied he, "than the satchels of Arnou, against the
 apoplexy."
 
 This reason, added to the great merit of the young man, at last
 determined the lady.
 
 "After all," says she, "when my husband shall cross the bridge Tchinavar
 in his journey to the other world, the angel Asrael will not refuse him
 a passage because his nose is a little shorter in the second life than
 it was in the first."
 
 She then took a razor, went to her husband's tomb, bedewed it with her
 tears, and drew near to cut off the nose of Zadig, whom she found
 extended at full length in the tomb. Zadig arose, holding his nose with
 one hand, and putting back the razor with the other.
 
 "Madam," said he, "don't exclaim so violently against the widow Cosrou.
 The project of cutting off my nose is equal to that of turning the
 course of a rivulet."
 
 
 
 
 III.
 
 THE DOG AND THE HORSE.
 
 
 Zadig found by experience, that the first month of marriage, as it is
 written in the book of Zend, is the moon of honey, and that the second
 is the moon of wormwood. He was some time after obliged to repudiate
 Azora, who became too difficult to be pleased; and he then sought for
 happiness in the study of nature.
 
 "No man," said he, "can be happier than a philosopher, who reads in this
 great book, which God hath placed before our eyes. The truths he
 discovers are his own; he nourishes and exalts his soul; he lives in
 peace; he fears nothing from men; and his tender spouse will not come to
 cut off his nose."
 
 Possessed of these ideas, he retired to a country house on the banks of
 the Euphrates. There he did not employ himself in calculating how many
 inches of water flow in a second of time under the arches of a bridge,
 or whether there fell a cube-line of rain in the month of the mouse
 more than in the month of the sheep. He never dreamed of making silk of
 cobwebs, or porcelain of broken bottles: but he chiefly studied the
 properties of plants and animals; and soon acquired a sagacity that made
 him discover a thousand differences where other men see nothing but
 uniformity.
 
 One day, as he was walking near a little wood, he saw one of the queen's
 eunuchs running toward him, followed by several officers, who appeared
 to be in great perplexity, and who ran to and fro like men distracted,
 eagerly searching for something they had lost of great value.
 
 "Young man," said the first eunuch, "hast thou seen the queen's dog?"
 
 "It is a bitch," replied Zadig, with great modesty, "and not a dog."
 
 "Thou art in the right," returned the first eunuch.
 
 "It is a very small she-spaniel," added Zadig; "she has lately whelped;
 she limps on the left fore-foot, and has very long ears."
 
 "Thou hast seen her," said the first eunuch, quite out of breath.
 
 "No," replied Zadig, "I have not seen her, nor did I so much as know
 that the queen had a bitch."
 
 Exactly at the same time, by one of the common freaks of fortune, the
 finest horse in the king's stable had escaped from the jockey in the
 plains of Babylon. The principal huntsman, and all the other officers,
 ran after him with as much eagerness and anxiety as the first eunuch had
 done after the bitch. The principal huntsman addressed himself to Zadig,
 and asked him if he had not seen the king's horse passing by.
 
 "He is the fleetest horse in the king's stable," replied Zadig, "he is
 five feet high, with very small hoofs, and a tail three feet and an half
 in length; the studs on his bit are gold, of twenty-three carats, and
 his shoes are silver of eleven penny-weights."
 
 "What way did he take? where is he?" demanded the chief huntsman.
 
 "I have not seen him," replied Zadig, "and never heard talk of him
 before."
 
 The principal huntsman and the first eunuch never doubted but that
 Zadig had stolen the king's horse and the queen's bitch. They therefore
 had him conducted before the assembly of the grand desterham, who
 condemned him to the knout, and to spend the rest of his days in
 Siberia. Hardly was the sentence passed, when the horse and the bitch
 were both found. The judges were reduced to the disagreeable necessity
 of reversing their sentence; but they condemned Zadig to pay four
 hundred ounces of gold for having said that he had not seen what he had
 seen. This fine he was obliged to pay; after which, he was permitted to
 plead his cause before the counsel of the grand desterham, when he spoke
 to the following effect.
 
 "Ye stars of justice, abyss of sciences, mirrors of truth, who have the
 weight of lead, the hardness of iron, the splendor of the diamond, and
 many of the properties of gold; since I am permitted to speak before
 this august assembly, I swear to you by Oromazes, that I have never seen
 the queen's respectable bitch, nor the sacred horse of the king of
 kings. The truth of the matter is as follows: I was walking toward the
 little wood, where I afterward met the venerable eunuch, and the most
 illustrious chief huntsman. I observed on the sand the traces of an
 animal, and could easily perceive them to be those of a little dog. The
 light and long furrows impressed on little eminences of sand between the
 marks of the paws, plainly discovered that it was a bitch, whose dugs
 were hanging down, and that therefore she must have whelped a few days
 before. Other traces of a different kind, that always appeared to have
 gently brushed the surface of the sand near the marks of the fore-feet,
 showed me that she had very long ears; and as I remarked that there was
 always a slighter impression made on the sand by one foot than by the
 other three, I found that the bitch of our august queen was a little
 lame, if I may be allowed the expression. With regard to the horse of
 the king of kings, you will be pleased to know, that walking in the
 lanes of this wood, I observed the marks of a horse's shoes, all at
 equal distances. This must be a horse, said I to myself, that gallops
 excellently. The dust on the trees in a narrow road that was but seven
 feet wide, was a little brushed off, at the distance of three feet and
 a half from the middle of the road. This horse, said I, has a tail
 three feet and a half long, which, being whisked to the right and left,
 has swept away the dust. I observed under the trees that formed an arbor
 five feet in height, that the leaves of the branches were newly fallen,
 from whence I inferred that the horse had touched them, and that he must
 therefore be five feet high. As to his bit, it must be gold of
 twenty-three carats, for he had rubbed its bosses against a stone which
 I knew to be a touchstone, and which I have tried. In a word, from a
 mark made by his shoes on flints of another kind, I concluded that he
 was shod with silver eleven deniers fine."
 
 All the judges admired Zadig for his acute and profound discernment. The
 news of this speech was carried even to the king and queen. Nothing was
 talked of but Zadig in the anti-chambers, the chambers, and the cabinet;
 and though many of the magi were of opinion that he ought to be burnt as
 a sorcerer, the king ordered his officers to restore him the four
 hundred ounces of gold which he had been obliged to pay. The register,
 the attorneys, and bailiffs, went to his house with great formality to
 carry him back his four hundred ounces. They only retained three hundred
 and ninety-eight of them to defray the expenses of justice; and then
 their servants demanded their fees.
 
 Zadig saw how extremely dangerous it sometimes is to appear too knowing,
 and therefore resolved, that on the next occasion of the like nature he
 would not tell what he had seen.
 
 Such an opportunity soon offered. A prisoner of state made his escape
 and passed under the windows of Zadig's house. Zadig was examined and
 made no answer. But it was proved that he had looked at the prisoner
 from this window. For this crime he was condemned to pay five hundred
 ounces of gold; and, according to the polite custom of Babylon, he
 thanked his judges for their indulgence.
 
 "Great God!" said he to himself, "what a misfortune it is to walk in a
 wood through which the queen's bitch or the king's horse have passed!
 how dangerous to look out at a window! and how difficult to be happy in
 this life!"
 
 
 
 
 IV.
 
 THE ENVIOUS MAN.
 
 
 Zadig resolved to comfort himself by philosophy and friendship for the
 evils he had suffered from fortune. He had in the suburbs of Babylon a
 house elegantly furnished, in which he assembled all the arts and all
 the pleasures worthy the pursuit of a gentleman. In the morning his
 library was open to the learned. In the evening his table was surrounded
 by good company. But he soon found what very dangerous guests these men
 of letters are. A warm dispute arose on one of Zoroaster's laws, which
 forbids the eating of a griffin.
 
 "Why," said some of them, "prohibit the eating of a griffin, if there is
 no such animal in nature?"
 
 "There must necessarily be such an animal," said the others, "since
 Zoroaster forbids us to eat it."
 
 Zadig would fain have reconciled them by saying:
 
 "If there are no griffins, we cannot possibly eat them; and thus either
 way we shall obey Zoroaster."
 
 A learned man, who had composed thirteen volumes on the properties of
 the griffin, and was besides the chief theurgite, hasted away to accuse
 Zadig before one of the principal magi, named Yebor, the greatest
 blockhead, and therefore the greatest fanatic among the Chaldeans. This
 man would have empaled Zadig to do honor to the sun, and would then have
 recited the breviary of Zoroaster with greater satisfaction. The friend
 Cador (a friend is better than a hundred priests) went to Yebor, and
 said to him:
 
 "Long live the sun and the griffins; beware of punishing Zadig; he is a
 saint; he has griffins in his inner court, and does not eat them; and
 his accuser is an heretic, who dares to maintain that rabbits have
 cloven feet, and are not unclean."
 
 "Well," said Yebor, shaking his bald pate, "we must empale Zadig for
 having thought contemptuously of griffins, and the other party for
 having spoken disrespectfully of rabbits."
 
 Cador hushed up the affair by appealing to a person who had great
 interest in the college of the magi. Nobody was empaled. This lenity
 occasioned a great murmuring among some of the doctors, who from thence
 predicted the fall of Babylon.
 
 "Upon what does happiness depend?" said Zadig; "I am persecuted by
 everything in the world, even on account of beings that have no
 existence."
 
 He cursed those men of learning, and resolved for the future to live
 with none but good company.
 
 He assembled at his house the most worthy men, and the most beautiful
 ladies of Babylon. He gave them delicious suppers, often preceded by
 concerts of music, and always animated by polite conversation, from
 which he knew how to banish that affectation of wit, which is the surest
 method of preventing it entirely, and of spoiling the pleasure of the
 most agreeable society. Neither the choice of his friends, nor that of
 the dishes, was made by vanity; for in everything he preferred the
 substance to the shadow; and by these means he procured that real
 respect to which he did not aspire.
 
 Opposite to his house lived one Arimazes, a man whose deformed
 countenance was but a faint picture of his still more deformed mind. His
 heart was a mixture of malice, pride, and envy. Having never been able
 to succeed in any of his undertakings, he revenged himself on all around
 him, by loading them with the blackest calumnies. Rich as he was, he
 found it difficult to procure a set of flatterers. The rattling of the
 chariots that entered Zadig's court in the evening, filled him with
 uneasiness; the sound of his praises enraged him still more. He
 sometimes went to Zadig's house, and sat down at table without being
 desired; where he spoiled all the pleasure of the company, as the
 harpies are said to infect the viands they touch.
 
 It happened that one day he took it in his head to give an entertainment
 to a lady, who, instead of accepting it, went to sup with Zadig. At
 another time, as he was talking with Zadig at court, a minister of state
 came up to them, and invited Zadig to supper, without inviting Arimazes.
 The most implacable hatred has seldom a more solid foundation. This man,
 who in Babylon was called the _envious_, resolved to ruin Zadig,
 because he was called the _happy_. "The opportunity of doing mischief
 occurs a hundred times in a day, and that of doing good but once a year,
 as sayeth the wise Zoroaster."
 
 The envious man went to see Zadig, who was walking in his garden with
 two friends and a lady, to whom he said many gallant things, without any
 other intention than that of saying them. The conversation turned upon a
 war which the king had just brought to a happy conclusion against the
 prince of Hircania, his vassal. Zadig, who had signalized his courage in
 this short war, bestowed great praises on the king, but greater still on
 the lady. He took out his pocket-book, and wrote four lines extempore,
 which he gave to this amiable person to read. His friends begged they
 might see them; but modesty, or rather a well-regulated self-love, would
 not allow him to grant their request. He knew that extemporary verses
 are never approved by any but by the person in whose honor they are
 written. He therefore tore in two the leaf on which he had written them,
 and threw both the pieces into a thicket of rose bushes where the rest
 of the company sought for them in vain. A slight shower falling soon
 after, obliged them to return to the house.
 
 The envious man, who remained in the garden, continued to search, till
 at last he found a piece of the leaf. It had been torn in such a manner,
 that each half of a line formed a complete sense, and even a verse of a
 shorter measure; but what was still more surprising, these short verses
 were found to contain the most injurious reflections on the king. They
 ran thus:
 
      To flagrant crimes
        His crown he owes,
      To peaceful times
        The worst of foes.
 
 The envious man was now happy for the first time in his life. He had it
 in his power to ruin a person of virtue and merit. Killed with this
 fiend-like joy, he found means to convey to the king the satire written
 by the hand of Zadig, who was immediately thrown into prison, together
 with the lady and Zadig's two friends.
 
 His trial was soon finished without his being permitted to speak for
 himself. As he was going to receive his sentence, the envious man threw
 himself in his way, and told him with a loud voice, that his verses were
 good for nothing. Zadig did not value himself on being a good poet; but
 it filled him with inexpressible concern to find that he was condemned
 for high treason; and that the fair lady and his two friends were
 confined in prison for a crime of which they were not guilty. He was not
 allowed to speak, because his writing spoke for him. Such was the law of
 Babylon. Accordingly he was conducted to the place of execution through
 an immense crowd of spectators, who durst not venture to express their
 pity for him, but who carefully examined his countenance to see if he
 died with a good grace. His relations alone were inconsolable; for they
 could not succeed to his estate. Three-fourths of his wealth were
 confiscated into the king's treasury, and the other fourth was given to
 the envious man.
 
 Just as he was preparing for death, the king's parrot flew from its
 cage, and alighted on a rose bush in Zadig's garden. A peach had been
 driven thither by the wind from a neighboring tree, and had fallen on a
 piece of the written leaf of the pocket-book to which it stuck. The bird
 carried off the peach and the paper, and laid them on the king's knee.
 The king took up the paper with great eagerness, and read the words,
 which formed no sense, and seemed to be the endings of verses. He loved
 poetry; and there is always some mercy to be expected from a prince of
 that disposition. The adventure of the parrot caused him to reflect.
 
 The queen, who remembered what had been written on the piece of Zadig's
 pocket-book, ordered it to be brought. They compared the two pieces
 together, and found them to tally exactly. They then read the verses as
 Zadig had written them.
 
      Tyrants are prone to flagrant crimes;
        To clemency his crown he owes;
      To concord and to peaceful times
        Love only is the worst of foes.
 
 The king gave immediate orders that Zadig should be brought before him,
 and that his two friends and the lady should be set at liberty. Zadig
 fell prostrate on the ground before the king and queen, humbly begged
 their pardon for having made such bad verses, and spoke with so much
 propriety, wit, and good sense, that their majesties desired they might
 see him again. He did himself that honor, and insinuated himself still
 farther into their good graces. They gave him all the wealth of the
 envious man; but Zadig restored him back the whole of it; and this
 instance of generosity gave no other pleasure to the envious man than
 that of having preserved his estate. The king's esteem for Zadig
 increased every day. He admitted him into all his parties of pleasure,
 and consulted him in all affairs of state. From that time the queen
 began to regard him with an eye of tenderness, that might one day prove
 dangerous to herself, to the king her august consort, to Zadig, and to
 the kingdom in general. Zadig now began to think that happiness was not
 so unattainable as he had formerly imagined.
 
 
 
 
 V.
 
 THE GENEROUS.
 
 
 The time had now arrived for celebrating a grand festival, which
 returned every five years. It was a custom in Babylon solemnly to
 declare, at the end of every five years, which of the citizens had
 performed the most generous action. The grandees and the magi were the
 judges. The first satrap, who was charged with the government of the
 city, published the most noble actions that had passed under his
 administration. The competition was decided by votes; and the king
 pronounced the sentence. People came to this solemnity from the
 extremities of the earth. The conqueror received from the monarch's
 hands a golden cup adorned with precious stones, his majesty at the same
 time making him this compliment: "Receive this reward of thy generosity,
 and may the gods grant me many subjects like to thee."
 
 This memorable day having come, the king appeared on his throne,
 surrounded by the grandees, the magi, and the deputies of all the
 nations that came to these games, where glory was acquired not by the
 swiftness of horses, nor by strength of body, but by virtue. The first
 satrap recited, with an audible voice, such actions as might entitle
 the authors of them to this invaluable prize. He did not mention the
 greatness of soul with which Zadig had restored the envious man his
 fortune, because it was not judged to be an action worthy of disputing
 the prize.
 
 He first presented a judge, who having made a citizen lose a
 considerable cause by a mistake, for which, after all, he was not
 accountable, had given him the whole of his own estate, which was just
 equal to what the other had lost.
 
 He next produced a young man, who being desperately in love with a lady
 whom he was going to marry, had yielded her up to his friend, whose
 passion for her had almost brought him to the brink of the grave, and at
 the same time had given him the lady's fortune.
 
 He afterwards produced a soldier, who, in the wars of Hircania, had
 given a still more noble instance of generosity. A party of the enemy
 having seized his mistress, he fought in her defence with great
 intrepidity. At that very instant he was informed that another party, at
 the distance of a few paces, were carrying off his mother; he therefore
 left his mistress with tears in his eyes, and flew to the assistance of
 his mother. At last he returned to the dear object of his love, and
 found her expiring. He was just going to plunge his sword in his own
 bosom; but his mother remonstrating against such a desperate deed, and
 telling him that he was the only support of her life, he had the courage
 to endure to live.
 
 The judges were inclined to give the prize to the soldier. But the king
 took up the discourse, and said:
 
 "The action of the soldier, and those of the other two, are doubtless
 very great, but they have nothing in them surprising. Yesterday, Zadig
 performed an action that filled me with wonder. I had a few days before
 disgraced Coreb, my minister and favorite. I complained of him in the
 most violent and bitter terms; all my courtiers assured me that I was
 too gentle, and seemed to vie with each other in speaking ill of Coreb.
 I asked Zadig what he thought of him, and he had the courage to commend
 him. I have read in our histories of many people who have atoned for an
 error by the surrender of their fortune; who have resigned a mistress;
 or preferred a mother to the object of their affection, but never
 before did I hear of a courtier who spoke favorably of a disgraced
 minister, that labored under the displeasure of his sovereign. I give to
 each of those whose generous actions have been now recited, twenty
 thousand pieces of gold; but the cup I give to Zadig."
 
 "May it please your majesty," said Zadig, "thyself alone deservest the
 cup. Thou hast performed an action of all others the most uncommon and
 meritorious, since, notwithstanding thy being a powerful king, thou wast
 not offended at thy slave, when he presumed to oppose thy passion."
 
 The king and Zadig were equally the object of admiration. The judge who
 had given his estate to his client; the lover who had resigned his
 mistress to his friend, and the soldier, who had preferred the safety of
 his mother to that of his mistress, received the king's presents, and
 saw their names enrolled in the catalogue of generous men. Zadig had the
 cup, and the king acquired the reputation of a good prince, which he did
 not long enjoy. The day was celebrated by feasts that lasted longer than
 the law enjoined; and the memory of it is still preserved in Asia. Zadig
 said: "Now I am happy at last." But he found himself fatally deceived.
 
 
 
 
 VI.
 
 THE MINISTER.
 
 
 The king had lost his first minister, and chose Zadig to supply his
 place. All the ladies in Babylon applauded the choice; for, since the
 foundation of the empire, there had never been such a young minister.
 But all the courtiers were filled with jealousy and vexation. The
 envious man, in particular, was troubled with a spitting of blood, and a
 prodigious inflammation in his nose. Zadig, having thanked the king and
 queen for their goodness, went likewise to thank the parrot.
 
 "Beautiful bird," said he, "tis thou that hast saved my life, and made
 me first minister. The queen's bitch and the king's horse did me a great
 deal of mischief; but thou hast done me much good. Upon such slender
 threads as these do the fates of mortals hang! but," added he, "this
 happiness perhaps will vanish very soon."
 
 [Illustration: The cup.--"May it please your majesty," said Zadig,
 "thyself alone deservest the cup."]
 
 "Soon," replied the parrot.
 
 Zadig was somewhat startled at this word. But as he was a good natural
 philosopher, and did not believe parrots to be prophets, he quickly
 recovered his spirits, and resolved to execute his duty to the best of
 his power.
 
 He made every one feel the sacred authority of the laws, but no one felt
 the weight of his dignity. He never checked the deliberations of the
 divan; and every vizier might give his opinion without fear of incurring
 the minister's displeasure. When he gave judgment, it was not he that
 gave it; it was the law; the rigor of which, however, whenever it was
 too severe, he always took care to soften; and when laws were wanting,
 the equity of his decisions was such as might easily have made them pass
 for those of Zoroaster.
 
 It is to him that the nations are indebted for this grand principle, to
 wit, that it is better to run the risk of sparing the guilty than to
 condemn the innocent. He imagined that laws were made as well to secure
 the people from the suffering of injuries as to restrain them from the
 commission of crimes. His chief talent consisted in discovering the
 truth, which all men seek to obscure. This great talent he put in
 practice from the very beginning of his administration.
 
 A famous merchant of Babylon, who died in the Indies, divided his estate
 equally between his two sons, after having disposed of their sister in
 marriage, and left a present of thirty thousand pieces of gold to that
 son who should be found to have loved him best. The eldest raised a tomb
 to his memory; the youngest increased his sister's portion, by giving
 her a part of his inheritance. Every one said that the eldest son loved
 his father best, and the youngest his sister; and that the thirty
 thousand pieces belonged to the eldest.
 
 Zadig sent for both of them, the one after the other. To the eldest he
 said:
 
 "Thy father is not dead; but has survived his last illness, and is
 returning to Babylon."
 
 "God be praised," replied the young man; "but his tomb cost me a
 considerable sum."
 
 Zadig afterwards repeated the same story to the youngest son.
 
 "God be praised," said he; "I will go and restore to my father all that
 I have; but I could wish that he would leave my sister what I have given
 her."
 
 "Thou shalt restore nothing," replied Zadig, "and thou shalt have the
 thirty thousand pieces, for thou art the son who loves his father best."
 
 A widow, having a young son, and being possessed of a handsome fortune,
 had given a promise of marriage to two magi; who were both desirous of
 marrying her.
 
 "I will take for my husband," said she, "the man who can give the best
 education to my beloved son."
 
 The two magi contended who should bring him up, and the cause was
 carried before Zadig. Zadig summoned the two magi to attend him.
 
 "What will you teach your pupil?" said he to the first.
 
 "I will teach him," said the doctor, "the eight parts of speech, logic,
 astrology, pneumatics, what is meant by substance and accident, abstract
 and concrete, the doctrine of the monades, and the pre-established
 harmony."
 
 "For my part," said the second, "I will endeavor to give him a sense of
 justice, and to make him worthy the friendship of good men."
 
 Zadig then cried:
 
 "Whether thou art the child's favorite or not, thou shalt have his
 mother."
 
 
 
 
 VII.
 
 THE DISPUTES AND THE AUDIENCES.
 
 
 In this manner he daily discovered the subtlety of his genius and the
 goodness of his heart. The people at once admired and loved him. He
 passed for the happiest man in the world. The whole empire resounded
 with his name. All the ladies ogled him. All the men praised him for his
 justice. The learned regarded him as an oracle; and even the priests
 confessed that he knew more than the old arch-magi Yebor. They were now
 so far from prosecuting him on account of the griffins, that they
 believed nothing but what he thought credible.
 
 There had continued at Babylon, for the space of fifteen hundred years,
 a violent contest that had divided the empire into two sects. The one
 pretended that they ought to enter the temple of Mithra with the left
 foot foremost; the other held this custom in detestation, and always
 entered with the right foot first. The people waited with great
 impatience for the day on which the solemn feast of the sacred fire was
 to be celebrated, to see which sect Zadig would favor. All the world had
 their eyes fixed on his two feet, and the whole city was in the utmost
 suspense and perturbation. Zadig jumped into the temple with his feet
 joined together; and afterward proved, in an eloquent discourse, that
 the Sovereign of heaven and earth, who accepteth not the persons of men,
 maketh no distinction between the right and the left foot. The envious
 man and his wife alleged that his discourse was not figurative enough,
 and that he did not make the rocks and mountains dance with sufficient
 agility.
 
 "He is dry," said they, "and void of genius. He does not make the sea to
 fly, and stars to fall, nor the sun to melt like wax. He has not the
 true oriental style."
 
 Zadig contented himself with having the style of reason. All the world
 favored him, not because he was in the right road, or followed the
 dictates of reason, or was a man of real merit, but because he was prime
 vizier.
 
 He terminated with the same happy address the grand dispute between the
 black and the white magi. The former maintained that it was the height
 of impiety to pray to God with the face turned toward the east in
 winter; the latter asserted that God abhorred the prayers of those who
 turned toward the west in summer. Zadig decreed that every man should be
 allowed to turn as he pleased.
 
 Thus he found out the happy secret of finishing all affairs, whether of
 a private or a public nature, in the morning. The rest of the day he
 employed in superintending and promoting the embellishments of Babylon.
 He exhibited tragedies that drew tears from the eyes of the spectators,
 and comedies that shook their sides with laughter,--a custom which had
 long been disused, and which his good taste now induced him to revive.
 He never affected to be more knowing in the polite arts than the artists
 themselves. He encouraged them by rewards and honors, and was never
 jealous of their talents. In the evening the king was highly entertained
 with his conversation, and the queen still more.
 
 "Great minister!" said the king.
 
 "Amiable minister!" said the queen; and both of them added, "It would
 have been a great loss to the state had such a man been hanged."
 
 Meanwhile Zadig perceived that his thoughts were always distracted, as
 well when he gave audience as when he sat in judgment. He did not know
 to what to attribute this absence of mind, and that was his only sorrow.
 
 He had a dream, in which he imagined that he laid himself down upon a
 heap of dry herbs, among which there were many prickly ones that gave
 him great uneasiness, and that he afterward reposed himself on a soft
 bed of roses, from which there sprung a serpent that wounded him to the
 heart with its sharp venomed fangs. "Alas," said he, "I have long lain
 on these dry and prickly herbs, I am now on the bed of roses; but what
 shall be the serpent?"
 
 
 
 
 VIII.
 
 JEALOUSY.
 
 
 Zadig's calamities sprung even from his happiness, and especially from
 his merit. He every day conversed with the king and his august consort.
 The charms of Zadig's conversation were greatly heightened by that
 desire of pleasing which is to the mind what dress is to beauty. His
 youth and graceful appearance insensibly made an impression on Astarte,
 which she did not at first perceive. Her passion grew and flourished in
 the bosom of innocence. Without fear or scruple, she indulged the
 pleasing satisfaction of seeing and hearing a man who was so dear to her
 husband, and to the empire in general. She was continually praising him
 to the king. She talked of him to her women, who were always sure to
 improve on her praises. And thus everything contributed to pierce her
 heart with a dart, of which she did not seem to be sensible. She made
 several presents to Zadig, which discovered a greater spirit of
 gallantry than she imagined. She intended to speak to him only as a
 queen satisfied with his services; and her expressions were sometimes
 those of a woman in love.
 
 Astarte was much more beautiful than that Semira who had such a strong
 aversion to one-eyed men, or that other woman who had resolved to cut
 off her husband's nose. Her unreserved familiarity, her tender
 expressions, at which she began to blush; and her eyes, which, though
 she endeavored to divert them to other objects, were always fixed upon
 his, inspired Zadig with a passion that filled him with astonishment. He
 struggled hard to get the better of it. He called to his aid the
 precepts of philosophy, which had always stood him in stead; but from
 thence, though he could derive the light of knowledge, he could procure
 no remedy to cure the disorders of his love-sick heart. Duty, gratitude,
 and violated majesty, presented themselves to his mind, as so many
 avenging gods. He struggled, he conquered. But this victory, which he
 was obliged to purchase afresh every moment, cost him many sighs and
 tears. He no longer dared to speak to the queen with that sweet and
 charming familiarity which had been so agreeable to them both. His
 countenance was covered with a cloud. His conversation was constrained
 and incoherent. His eyes were fixed on the ground; and when, in spite of
 all his endeavors to the contrary, they encountered those of the queen,
 they found them bathed in tears, and darting arrows of flame. They
 seemed to say, We adore each other, and yet are afraid to love; we are
 consumed with a passion which we both condemn.
 
 Zadig left the royal presence full of perplexity and despair, and having
 his heart oppressed with a burden which he was no longer able to bear.
 In the violence of his perturbation he involuntarily betrayed the secret
 to his friend Cador, in the same manner as a man, who, having long
 endured a cruel disease, discovers his pain by a cry extorted from him
 by a more severe attack, and by the cold sweat that covers his brow.
 
 "I have already discovered," said Cador, "the sentiments which thou
 wouldst fain conceal from thyself. The symptoms by which the passions
 show themselves are certain and infallible. Judge, my dear Zadig, since
 I have read thy heart, whether the king will not discover something in
 it that may give him offence. He has no other fault but that of being
 the most jealous man in the world. Thou canst resist the violence of thy
 passion with greater fortitude than the queen, because thou art a
 philosopher, and because thou art Zadig. Astarte is a woman. She suffers
 her eyes to speak with so much the more imprudence, as she does not as
 yet think herself guilty. Conscious of her own innocence, she unhappily
 neglects those external appearances which are so necessary. I shall
 tremble for her so long as she has nothing wherewithal to reproach
 herself. A growing passion which we endeavor to suppress, discovers
 itself in spite of all our efforts to the contrary."
 
 Meanwhile, the queen mentioned the name of Zadig so frequently, and with
 such a blushing and downcast look. She was sometimes so lively, and
 sometimes so perplexed, when she spoke to him in the king's presence,
 and was seized with such a deep thoughtfulness at his going away, that
 the king began to be troubled. He believed all that he saw, and imagined
 all that he did not see. He particularly remarked, that his wife's shoes
 were blue, and that Zadig's shoes were blue; that his wife's ribbons
 were yellow, and that Zadig's bonnet was yellow, and these were terrible
 symptoms to a prince of so much delicacy. In his jealous mind suspicion
 was turned into certainty.
 
 All the slaves of kings and queens are so many spies over their hearts.
 They soon observed that Astarte was tender, and that Moabdar was
 jealous. The envious man persuaded his wife to send anonymously to the
 king her garter, which resembled those of the queen; and to complete the
 misfortune, this garter was blue. The monarch now thought of nothing but
 in what manner he might best execute his vengeance. He one night
 resolved to poison the queen, and in the morning to put Zadig to death
 by the bowstring. The orders were given to a merciless eunuch, who
 commonly executed his acts of vengeance.
 
 There happened at that time to be in the king's chamber a little dwarf,
 who, though dumb, was not deaf. He was allowed, on account of his
 insignificance, to go wherever he pleased; and, as a domestic animal,
 was a witness of what passed in the most profound secrecy.
 
 This little mute was strongly attached to the queen and Zadig. With
 equal horror and surprise, he heard the cruel orders given; but how
 could he prevent the fatal sentence that in a few hours was to be
 carried into execution? He could not write, but he could paint; and
 excelled particularly in drawing a striking resemblance. He employed a
 part of the night in sketching out with his pencil what he meant to
 impart to the queen. The piece represented the king in one corner,
 boiling with rage, and giving orders to the eunuch; a blue bowstring,
 and a bowl on a table, with blue garters and yellow ribbons; the queen
 in the middle of the picture, expiring in the arms of her woman, and
 Zadig strangled at her feet. The horizon represented a rising sun, to
 express that this shocking execution was to be performed in the morning.
 As soon as he had finished the picture, he ran to one of Astarte's
 women, awoke her, and made her understand that she must immediately
 carry it to the queen.
 
 At midnight a messenger knocks at Zadig's door, awakes him, and gives
 him a note from the queen. He doubts whether it is not a dream; and
 opens the letter with a trembling hand. But how great was his surprise,
 and who can express the consternation and despair into which he was
 thrown upon reading these words? "Fly, this instant, or thou art a dead
 man! Fly, Zadig, I conjure thee by our mutual love and my yellow
 ribbons. I have not been guilty, but I find that I must die like a
 criminal."
 
 Zadig was hardly able to speak. He sent for Cador, and, without uttering
 a word, gave him the note. Cador forced him to obey, and forthwith to
 take the road to Memphis.
 
 "Shouldst thou dare," said he, "to go in search of the queen, thou wilt
 hasten her death. Shouldst thou speak to the king, thou wilt infallibly
 ruin her. I will take upon me the charge of her destiny; follow thy own.
 I will spread a report that thou hast taken the road to India. I will
 soon follow thee, and inform thee of all that shall have passed in
 Babylon."
 
 At that instant, Cador caused two of the swiftest dromedaries to be
 brought to a private gate of the palace. Upon one of these he mounted
 Zadig, whom he was obliged to carry to the door, and who was ready to
 expire with grief. He was accompanied by a single domestic, and Cador,
 plunged in sorrow and astonishment, soon lost sight of his friend.
 
 This illustrious fugitive arriving on the side of a hill, from whence he
 could take a view of Babylon, turned his eyes toward the queen's palace,
 and fainted away at the sight; nor did he recover his senses but to shed
 a torrent of tears, and to wish for death. At length, after his thoughts
 had been long engrossed in lamenting the unhappy fate of the loveliest
 woman and the greatest queen in the world, he for a moment turned his
 views on himself, and cried:
 
 "What then is human life? O virtue, how hast thou served me? Two women
 have basely deceived me; and now a third, who is innocent, and more
 beautiful than both the others, is going to be put to death! Whatever
 good I have done hath been to me a continual source of calamity and
 affliction; and I have only been raised to the height of grandeur, to be
 tumbled down the most horrid precipice of misfortune."
 
 Filled with these gloomy reflections, his eyes overspread with the veil
 of grief, his countenance covered with the paleness of death, and his
 soul plunged in an abyss of the blackest despair, he continued his
 journey toward Egypt.
 
 
 
 
 IX.
 
 THE WOMAN BEATER.
 
 
 Zadig directed his course by the stars. The constellation of Orion, and
 the splendid Dogstars, guided his steps toward the pole of Canopæa. He
 admired those vast globes of light which appear to our eyes as so many
 little sparks, while the earth, which in reality is only an
 imperceptible point in nature, appears to our fond imaginations as
 something so grand and noble. He then represented to himself the human
 species, as it really is, as a parcel of insects devouring one another
 on a little atom of clay. This true image seemed to annihilate his
 misfortunes, by making him sensible of the nothingness of his own being,
 and that of Babylon. His soul launched out into infinity, and detached
 from the senses, contemplated the immutable order of the universe. But
 when afterward, returning to himself, and entering into his own heart,
 he considered that Astarte had perhaps died for him, the universe
 vanished from his sight, and he beheld nothing in the whole compass of
 nature but Astarte expiring, and Zadig unhappy.
 
 While he thus alternately gave up his mind to this flux and reflux of
 sublime philosophy and intolerable grief, he advanced toward the
 frontiers of Egypt; and his faithful domestic was already in the first
 village, in search of a lodging.
 
 Meanwhile, as Zadig was walking toward the gardens that skirted the
 village, he saw, at a small distance from the highway, a woman bathed in
 tears and calling heaven and earth to her assistance, and a man in a
 furious passion pursuing her.
 
 This madman had already overtaken the woman, who embraced his knees,
 notwithstanding which he loaded her with blows and reproaches. Zadig
 judged by the frantic behavior of the Egyptian, and by the repeated
 pardons which the lady asked him, that the one was jealous, and the
 other unfaithful. But when he surveyed the woman more narrowly, and
 found her to be a lady of exquisite beauty, and even to have a strong
 resemblance to the unhappy Astarte, he felt himself inspired with
 compassion for her, and horror toward the Egyptian.
 
 "Assist me," cried she to Zadig, with the deepest sighs, "deliver me
 from the hands of the most barbarous man in the world. Save my life."
 
 Moved by these pitiful cries, Zadig ran and threw himself between her
 and the barbarian. As he had some knowledge of the Egyptian language, he
 addressed him in that tongue.
 
 "If," said he, "thou hast any humanity, I conjure thee to pay some
 regard to her beauty and weakness. How canst thou behave in this
 outrageous manner to one of the masterpieces of nature, who lies at thy
 feet, and hath no defence but her tears?"
 
 "Ah, ah!" replied the madman, "thou art likewise in love with her. I
 must be revenged on thee too."
 
 So saying, he left the lady, whom he had hitherto held with his hand
 twisted in her hair, and taking his lance attempted to stab the
 stranger. Zadig, who was in cold blood, easily eluded the blow aimed by
 the frantic Egyptian. He seized the lance near the iron with which it
 was armed. The Egyptian strove to draw it back; Zadig to wrest it from
 the Egyptian; and in the struggle it was broken in two. The Egyptian
 draws his sword; Zadig does the same. They attack each other. The former
 gives a hundred blows at random; the latter wards them off with great
 dexterity. The lady, seated on a turf, re-adjusts her head-dress, and
 looks at the combatants. The Egyptian excelled in strength: Zadig in
 address. The one fought like a man whose arm was directed by his
 judgment; the other like a madman, whose blind rage made him deal his
 blows at random. Zadig closes with him, and disarms him; and while the
 Egyptian, now become more furious, endeavors to throw himself upon him,
 he seizes him, presses him close, and throws him down; and then holding
 his sword to his breast, offers him his life. The Egyptian, frantic with
 rage, draws his poniard, and wounds Zadig at the very instant that the
 conqueror was granting a pardon. Zadig, provoked at such brutal
 behavior, plunged his sword in the bosom of the Egyptian, who giving a
 horrible shriek and a violent struggle, instantly expired. Zadig then
 approached the lady, and said to her with a gentle tone:
 
 "He hath forced me to kill him. I have avenged thy cause. Thou art now
 delivered from the most violent man I ever saw. What further, madam,
 wouldest thou have me do for thee?
 
 "Die, villain," replied she, "thou hast killed my lover. O that I were
 able to tear out thy heart!"
 
 "Why truly, madam," said Zadig, "thou hadst a strange kind of a man for
 a lover; he beat thee with all his might, and would have killed thee,
 because thou hadst entreated me to give thee assistance."
 
 "I wish he were beating me still," replied the lady with tears and
 lamentation. "I well deserved it; for I had given him cause to be
 jealous. Would to heaven that he was now beating me, and that thou wast
 in his place."
 
 Zadig, struck with surprise, and inflamed with a higher degree of
 resentment than he had ever felt before, said:
 
 "Beautiful as thou art, madam, thou deservest that I should beat thee in
 my turn for thy perverse and impertinent behavior. But I shall not give
 myself the trouble."
 
 So saying, he remounted his camel, and advanced toward the town. He had
 proceeded but a few steps, when he turned back at the noise of four
 Babylonian couriers, who came riding at full gallop. One of them, upon
 seeing the woman, cried:
 
 "It is the very same. She resembles the description that was given us."
 
 They gave themselves no concern about the dead Egyptian, but instantly
 seized the lady. She called out to Zadig:
 
 "Help me once more, generous stranger. I ask pardon for having
 complained of thy conduct. Deliver me again, and I will be thine for
 ever."
 
 Zadig was no longer in the humor of fighting for her.
 
 "Apply to another," said he, "thou shalt not again ensnare me in thy
 wiles."
 
 Besides, he was wounded; his blood was still flowing, and he himself had
 need of assistance: and the sight of four Babylonians, probably sent by
 King Moabdar, filled him with apprehension. He therefore hastened toward
 the village, unable to comprehend why four Babylonian couriers should
 come and seize this Egyptian woman, but still more astonished at the
 lady's behavior.
 
 
 
 
 X.
 
 SLAVERY.
 
 
 As he entered the Egyptian village, he saw himself surrounded by the
 people. Every one said:
 
 "This is the man who carried off the beautiful Missouf, and assassinated
 Clitofis."
 
 "Gentleman," said he, "God preserve me from carrying off your beautiful
 Missouf. She is too capricious for me. And with regard to Clitofis, I
 did not assassinate him, I only fought with him in my own defence. He
 endeavored to kill me, because I humbly interceded for the beautiful
 Missouf, whom he beat most unmercifully. I am a stranger, come to seek
 refuge in Egypt; and it is not likely, that in coming to implore your
 protection, I should begin by carrying off a woman, and assassinating a
 man."
 
 The Egyptians were then just and humane. The people conducted Zadig to
 the town-house. They first of all ordered his wound to be dressed, and
 then examined him and his servant apart, in order to discover the truth.
 They found that Zadig was not an assassin; but as he was guilty of
 having killed a man, the law condemned him to be a slave. His two camels
 were sold for the benefit of the town: all the gold he had brought with
 him was distributed among the inhabitants; and his person, as well as
 that of the companion of his journey, was exposed for sale in the
 market-place. An Arabian merchant, named Setoc, made the purchase; but
 as the servant was fitter for labor than the master, he was sold at a
 higher price. There was no comparison between the two men. Thus Zadig
 became a slave subordinate to his own servant. They were linked together
 by a chain fastened to their feet, and in this condition they followed
 the Arabian merchant to his house.
 
 By the way Zadig comforted his servant, and exhorted him to patience;
 but he could not help making, according to his usual custom, some
 reflections on human life. "I see," said he, "that the unhappiness of my
 fate hath an influence on thine. Hitherto everything has turned out to
 me in a most unaccountable manner. I have been condemned to pay a fine
 for having seen the marks of a bitch's feet. I thought that I should
 once have been empaled alive on account of a griffin. I have been sent
 to execution for having made some verses in praise of the king. I have
 been on the point of being strangled, because the queen had yellow
 ribbons; and now I am a slave with thee, because a brutal wretch beat
 his mistress. Come, let us keep a good heart; all this will perhaps have
 an end. The Arabian merchants must necessarily have slaves; and why not
 me as well as another, since, as well as another, I am a man? This
 merchant will not be cruel. He must treat his slaves well if he expects
 any advantage from them."
 
 But while he spoke thus, his heart was entirely engrossed by the fate of
 the queen of Babylon.
 
 Two days after, the merchant Setoc set out for Arabia Deserta, with his
 slaves and his camels. His tribe dwelt near the desert of Oreb. The
 journey was long and painful. Setoc set a much greater value on the
 servant than the master, because the former was more expert in loading
 the camels, and all the little marks of distinction were shown to him. A
 camel having died within two days journey of Oreb, his burden was
 divided and laid on the backs of the servants; and Zadig had his share
 among the rest. Setoc laughed to see all his slaves walking with their
 bodies inclined. Zadig took the liberty to explain to him the cause, and
 inform him of the laws of the balance. The merchant was astonished, and
 began to regard him with other eyes. Zadig, finding he had raised his
 curiosity, increased it still further by acquainting him with many
 things that related to commerce; the specific gravity of metals and
 commodities under an equal bulk; the properties of several useful
 animals; and the means of rendering those useful that are not naturally
 so.
 
 At last Setoc began to consider Zadig as a sage, and preferred him to
 his companion, whom he had formerly so much esteemed. He treated him
 well, and had no cause to repent of his kindness.
 
 As soon as Setoc arrived among his own tribe he demanded the payment of
 five hundred ounces of silver, which he had lent to a Jew in presence of
 two witnesses; but as the witnesses were dead, and the debt could not be
 proved, the Hebrew appropriated the merchant's money to himself, and
 piously thanked God for putting it in his power to cheat an Arabian.
 Setoc imparted this troublesome affair to Zadig, who had now become his
 counsel.
 
 "In what place," said Zadig, "didst thou lend the five hundred ounces to
 this infidel?"
 
 "Upon a large stone," replied the merchant, "that lies near the mountain
 of Oreb."
 
 "What is the character of thy debter?" said Zadig.
 
 "That of a knave," returned Setoc.
 
 "But I ask thee, whether he is lively or phlegmatic; cautious or
 imprudent?"
 
 "He is, of all bad payers," said Setoc, "the most lively fellow I ever
 knew."
 
 "Well," resumed Zadig, "allow me to plead thy cause."
 
 In effect, Zadig having summoned the Jew to the tribunal, addressed the
 judge in the following terms:
 
 "Pillow of the throne of equity, I come to demand of this man, in the
 name of my master, five hundred ounces of silver, which he refuses to
 repay."
 
 "Hast thou any witnesses?" said the judge.
 
 "No, they are dead; but there remains a large stone upon which the money
 was counted; and if it please thy grandeur to order the stone to be
 sought for, I hope that it will bear witness. The Hebrew and I will
 tarry here till the stone arrives. I will send for it at my master's
 expense."
 
 "With all my heart," replied the judge, and immediately applied himself
 to the discussion of other affairs.
 
 When the court was going to break up, the judge said to Zadig:
 
 "Well, friend, hath not thy stone yet arrived?"
 
 The Hebrew replied with a smile:
 
 "Thy grandeur may stay here till to-morrow, and after all not see the
 stone. It is more than six miles from hence and it would require fifteen
 men to move it."
 
 "Well," cried Zadig, "did I not say that the stone would bear witness?
 Since this man knows where it is, he thereby confesses that it was upon
 it that the money was counted."
 
 The Hebrew was disconcerted, and was soon after obliged to confess the
 truth. The judge ordered him to be fastened to the stone, without meat
 or drink, till he should restore the five hundred ounces, which were
 soon after paid.
 
 The slave Zadig and the stone were held in great repute in Arabia.

 XI.
 
 THE FUNERAL PILE.
 
 
 Setoc, charmed with the happy issue of this affair, made his slave his
 intimate friend. He had now conceived as great an esteem for him as ever
 the king of Babylon had done; and Zadig was glad that Setoc had no wife.
 He discovered in his master a good natural disposition, much probity of
 heart, and a great share of good sense; but he was sorry to see that,
 according to the ancient custom of Arabia, he adored the host of heaven;
 that is, the sun, moon, and stars. He sometimes spoke to him on this
 subject with great prudence and discretion. At last he told him that
 these bodies were like all other bodies in the universe, and no more
 deserving of our homage than a tree or a rock.
 
 "But," said Setoc, "they are eternal beings; and it is from them we
 derive all we enjoy. They animate nature; they regulate the seasons;
 and, besides, are removed at such an immense distance from us, that we
 cannot help revering them."
 
 "Thou receivest more advantage," replied Zadig, "from the waters of the
 Red Sea, which carry thy merchandize to the Indies. Why may not it be as
 ancient as the stars? and if thou adorest what is placed at a distance
 from thee, thou shouldest adore the land of the Gangarides, which lies
 at the extremity of the earth."
 
 "No," said Setoc, "the brightness of the stars commands my adoration."
 
 At night Zadig lighted up a great number of candles in the tent where he
 was to sup with Setoc; and the moment his patron appeared, he fell on
 his knees before these lighted tapers, and said:
 
 "Eternal and shining luminaries! be ye always propitious to me."
 
 Having thus said, he sat down at the table, without taking the least
 notice of Setoc.
 
 "What art thou doing?" said Setoc in amaze[TR: amazement?].
 
 "I act like thee," replied Zadig, "I adore these candles, and neglect
 their master and mine."
 
 Setoc comprehended the profound sense of this apologue. The wisdom of
 his slave sunk deep into his soul. He no longer offered incense to the
 creatures, but he adored the eternal Being who made them.
 
 There prevailed at that time in Arabia a shocking custom, sprung
 originally from Scythia, and which, being established in the Indies by
 the credit of the Brahmins, threatened to over-run all the East. When a
 married man died, and his beloved wife aspired to the character of a
 saint, she burned herself publicly on the body of her husband. This was
 a solemn feast, and was called the Funeral Pile of Widowhood; and that
 tribe in which most women had been burned was the most respected. An
 Arabian of Setoc's tribe being dead, his widow, whose name was Almona,
 and who was very devout, published the day and hour when she intended to
 throw herself into the fire, amidst the sound of drums and trumpets.
 
 Zadig remonstrated against this horrible custom. He showed Setoc how
 inconsistent it was with the happiness of mankind to suffer young widows
 to burn themselves--widows who were capable of giving children to the
 state, or at least of educating those they already had; and he convinced
 him that it was his duty to do all that lay in his power to abolish such
 a barbarous practice.
 
 "The women," said Setoc, "have possessed the right of burning themselves
 for more than a thousand years; and who shall dare to abrogate a law
 which time hath rendered sacred? Is there anything more respectable than
 ancient abuses?"
 
 "Reason is more ancient," replied Zadig: "meanwhile, speak thou to the
 chiefs of the tribes, and I will go to wait on the young widow."
 
 Accordingly, he was introduced to her, and after having insinuated
 himself into her good graces by some compliments on her beauty, and told
 her what a pity it was to commit so many charms to the flames, he at
 last praised her for her constancy and courage.
 
 "Thou must surely have loved thy husband," said he to her, "with the
 most passionate fondness."
 
 "Who, I?" replied the lady, "I loved him not at all. He was a brutal,
 jealous, and insupportable wretch; but I am firmly resolved to throw
 myself on his funeral pile."
 
 [Illustration: The funeral pyre.--"The women," said Setoc, "have
 possessed the right of burning themselves for more than a thousand
 years; and who shall dare to abrogate a law which time hath rendered
 sacred? Is there anything more respectable than ancient abuses?"]
 
 "It would appear then," said Zadig, "that there must be a very delicious
 pleasure in being burnt alive."
 
 "Oh! it makes me shudder," replied the lady, "but that must be
 overlooked. I am a devotee; I should lose my reputation; and all the
 world would despise me, if I did not burn myself."
 
 Zadig having made her acknowledge that she burned herself to gain the
 good opinion of others, and to gratify her own vanity, entertained her
 with a long discourse calculated to make her a little in love with life,
 and even went so far as to inspire her with some degree of good will for
 the person who spoke to her.
 
 "And what wilt thou do at last," said he, "if the vanity of burning
 thyself should not continue?"
 
 "Alas!" said the lady, "I believe I should desire thee to marry me."
 
 Zadig's mind was too much engrossed with the idea of Astarte not to
 elude this declaration; but he instantly went to the chiefs of the
 tribes, told them what had passed, and advised them to make a law by
 which a widow should not be permitted to burn herself, till she had
 conversed privately with a young man for the space of an hour. Since
 that time not a single widow hath burned herself in Arabia. They were
 indebted to Zadig alone for destroying in one day a cruel custom that
 had lasted for so many ages; and thus he became the benefactor of
 Arabia.
 
 
 
 
 XII.
 
 THE SUPPER.
 
 
 Setoc, who could not separate himself from this man in whom dwelt
 wisdom, carried Zadig to the great fair of Balzora, whither the richest
 merchants of the earth resorted. Zadig was highly pleased to see so many
 men of different countries united in the same place. He considered the
 whole universe as one large family assembled at Balzora. The second day
 he sat at table with an Egyptian, an Indian, an inhabitant of Cathay, a
 Greek, a Celtic, and several other strangers, who, in their frequent
 voyages to the Arabian Gulf, had learned enough of the Arabic to make
 themselves understood.
 
 The Egyptian seemed to be in a violent passion. "What an abominable
 country," said he, "is Balzora! They refuse me a thousand ounces of gold
 on the best security in the world."
 
 "How!" said Setoc. "On what security have they refused thee this sum?"
 
 "On the body of my aunt," replied the Egyptian. "She was the most
 notable woman in Egypt; she always accompanied me in my journeys; she
 died on the road. I have converted her into one of the nest mummies in
 the world; and in my own country I could obtain any amount by giving her
 as a pledge. It is very strange that they will not here lend me a
 thousand ounces of gold on such a solid security."
 
 Angry as he was, he was going to help himself to a bit of excellent
 boiled fowl, when the Indian, taking him by the hand, cried out in a
 sorrowful tone, "Ah! what art thou going to do?"
 
 "To eat a bit of this fowl," replied the man who owned the mummy.
 
 "Take care that thou dost not," replied the Indian. "It is possible that
 the soul of the deceased may have passed into this fowl; and thou
 wouldst not, surely, expose thyself to the danger of eating thy aunt? To
 boil fowls is a manifest outrage on nature."
 
 "What dost thou mean by thy nature and thy fowls?" replied the choleric
 Egyptian. "We adore a bull, and yet we eat heartily of beef."
 
 "You adore a bull! is it possible?" said the Indian.
 
 "Nothing is more possible," returned the other; "we have done so for
 these hundred and thirty-five thousand years; and nobody amongst us has
 ever found fault with it."
 
 "A hundred and thirty-five thousand years!" said the Indian. "This
 account is a little exaggerated. It is but eighty thousand years since
 India was first peopled, and we are surely more ancient than you are.
 Brahma prohibited our eating of ox-flesh before you thought of putting
 it on your spits or altars."
 
 [Illustration: Oannes--the Fish God.--"Thou art mistaken," said a
 Chaldean. "It is to the fish Oannes that we owe these great advantages;
 and it is just that we should render homage to none but him. All the
 world will tell thee, that he is a divine being, with a golden tail, and
 a beautiful human head; and that for three hours every day he left the
 water to preach on dry land."]
 
 
 
 
      OANNES--THE FISH AVATAR.
 
      "The accompanying engraving of the fish-god is from a drawing by
      Gentil, given in _Calmet's Dictionary_. The god was worshiped under
      the name of Dagon by the Syrians, and Oannes by the Chaldeans. The
      image represented the body of a fish with the head and arms of a
      man; and while all figures of the god are not exactly alike, they
      all combine a human form with that of a fish.
 
      "Owing to the precession of the equinoxes," says the Rev. Mr.
      Maurice in the _Antiquities of India_, "after the rate of
      seventy-two years to a degree, a total alteration has taken place
      through all the signs of the ecliptic, insomuch that those stars
      which formerly were in Aries have now got into Taurus, and those of
      Taurus into Gemini. Now the vernal equinox, after the rate of that
      precession, could not have coincided with the first of May less
      than 4000 years before Christ."
 
      An Avatar in the form of the celestial _Taurus_ (♉) then occurred,
      and Osiris was worshiped in the form of a bull, by credulous
      believers. Next in the course of revolving years, we have the
      celestial _Aries_, (♈) and the god then became incarnate in the
      form of a lamb, and in that form received the adoration of devout
      multitudes. Later still the Zodiacal sign had progressed to
      _Pisces_, (♓) and mankind were then called upon to worship the
      astrological emblem of the amphibious being called Oannes--the
      sacred god of the land and the sea--whose representative on earth
      still claims to be the _Great Fisherman_, and who has entangled in
      the meshes of his net of faith the intellects and consciences of
      innumerable devotees.
 
      "In Berosus and other authors," says Godfrey Higgins in the
      _Anacalypsis_, "the being half man, half fish, called Oannes, is
      said to have come out of the Erythræan Sea, and to have taught the
      Babylonians all kinds of useful knowledge. This is clearly the fish
      Avatar of India; whether or not it be the I-oannes of Jonas I leave
      to the reader. I apprehend it is the same as the Dagon of Pegu and
      the fish sign of the Zodiac. Very little is known about it, but it
      exactly answers the description of an Avatar.
 
      "The apostles of Jesus, I believe, were most of them fishermen.
      There are many stories of miraculous draughts of fish, and other
      matters connected with fishes, in the Gospel histories; and Peter,
      the son of John, I-oannes or Oannes, the great fisherman, inherited
      the power of ruling the church from the Lamb of God. The fisherman
      succeeded to the shepherd. The Pope calls himself the great
      fisherman, and boasts of the contents of his Poitrine.
 
      "In the Pentateuch, which is the sacred book of the Israelites, we
      meet with no Dagon, Fish or God. But we do meet with it in the book
      of Judges. I believe this Dagon to be the fish Avatar of India--the
      Dagon of Syrian in Pegu; in fact the emblem of the entrance of the
      sun into Pisces.
 
      "In the earliest time, perhaps, of which we have any history, God
      the creator was adored under the form or emblem of a Bull. After
      that, we read of him under the form of a calf or two calves,
      afterward in the form of the Ram and the Lamb, and the devotees
      were called lambs: then came the fish or two fishes. It is a fact,
      not a theory, that he was called a fish, and that the devotees were
      called Pisciculi or little fishes. I suppose few persons will
      attribute these appearances of system to accident. As we have
      _lambs_ and _little fishes_ in the followers of the Ram, Aries, and
      the constellation Pisces, it is only in character to have the
      followers of the Bull called _calves_, and I am by no means certain
      that we have not them in the Cyclops.
 
      "At first, no doubt, my reader will be very much surprised at the
      idea of the devotees having converted Jesus into the _fish_ Avatar:
      but why was he called the lamb? And why were his followers called
      his flock, and his sheep, and his lambs? Not many circumstances are
      more striking than that of Jesus Christ being originally worshiped
      under the form of a Lamb--the actual lamb of God which taketh away
      the sins of the world. It does not appear to me to be more
      extraordinary that his followers, as it is admitted that they did,
      should call him a _fish_ and the believers in him pisciculi, than
      that they should call him a lamb, and his followers lambs. He was
      originally represented as a lamb until one of the popes changed his
      effigy to that of a man on a cross. Applying the astronomical
      emblem of Pisces (♓) to Jesus, does not seem more absurd than
      applying the astronomical emblem of the Lamb (♈) They applied to
      him the monogram of Bacchus, ΙΗΣ; the astrological and alchymical
      mark or sign of Aries, or the Ram (♈) and, in short, what was there
      that was Heathenish that they have not applied to him? They have
      actually loaded his simple and sublime religion with every
      absurdity of Gentilism. I know not one absurdity that can be
      excepted."
 
      In one of the windows of the Magnificent Cathedral of the
      Incarnation, erected by Mrs. A.T. Stewart, at Garden City, N.Y., is
      a painting representing the Sea of Tiberias. The "risen Lord,"
      clothed in rich robes of green, scarlet, and gold, is standing on
      the seashore, with four of the apostles. Prominent among them is
      the _great fisherman_ St. Peter, who is grasping the end of a
      seine. In the background is seen the mast and rigging of a fishing
      boat. At the feet of Christ a fire is burning, and on the coals are
      _two fishes_, like the two fishes in the Zodiacal sign _Pisces_
      (♓). The artist has thus reproduced the ancient myth, regardless of
      its astrological origin, and the mythical fishes of the zodiac,
      with other ancient Pagan emblems, now symbolize Christian faith in
      the so-called Cathedral of the Incarnation.--E.
 
 
 
 "This Brahma of yours," said the Egyptian, "is a pleasant sort of an
 animal, truly, to compare with our Apis. What great things hath your
 Brahma done?"
 
 "It was he," replied the Brahmin, "that taught mankind to read and
 write, and to whom the world is indebted for the game of chess."
 
 "Thou art mistaken," said a Chaldean who sat near him. "It is to the
 fish Oannes that we owe these great advantages; and it is just that we
 should render homage to none but him. All the world will tell thee, that
 he is a divine being, with a golden tail, and a beautiful human head;
 and that for three hours every day he left the water to preach on dry
 land. He had several children, who were kings, as every one knows. I
 have a picture of him at home, which I worship with becoming reverence.
 We may eat as much beef as we please; but it is surely a great sin to
 dress fish for the table. Besides, you are both of an origin too recent
 and ignoble to dispute with me. The Egyptians reckon only a hundred and
 thirty-five thousand years, and the Indians but eighty thousand, while
 we have almanacs of four thousand ages. Believe me; renounce your
 follies; and I will give to each of you a beautiful picture of Oannes."
 
 The man of Cathay took up the discourse, and said:
 
 "I have a great respect for the Egyptians, the Chaldeans, the Greeks,
 the Celtics, Brahma, the bull Apis, and the beautiful fish Oannes; but I
 could think that Li, or Tien, as he is commonly called, is superior to
 all the bulls on the earth, or all the fish in the sea. I shall say
 nothing of my native country; it is as large as Egypt, Chaldea, and the
 Indies put together. Neither shall I dispute about the antiquity of our
 nation; because it is of little consequence whether we are ancient or
 not; it is enough if we are happy. But were it necessary to speak of
 almanacs, I could say that all Asia takes ours, and that we had very
 good ones before arithmetic was known in Chaldea."
 
 "Ignorant men, as ye all are," said the Greek; "do you not know that
 Chaos is the father of all; and that form and matter have put the world
 into its present condition?"
 
 The Greek spoke for a long time, but was at last interrupted by the
 Celtic, who, having drank pretty deeply while the rest were disputing,
 imagined he was now more knowing than all the others, and said, with an
 oath, that there were none but Teutat and the mistletoe of the oak that
 were worth the trouble of a dispute; that, for his own part, he had
 always some mistletoe in his pocket, and that the Scythians, his
 ancestors, were the only men of merit that had ever appeared in the
 world; that it was true they had sometimes eaten human flesh, but that,
 notwithstanding this circumstance, his nation deserved to be held in
 great esteem; and that, in fine, if any one spoke ill of Teutat, he
 would teach him better manners.
 
 The quarrel had now become warm, and Setoc feared the table would be
 stained with blood.
 
 Zadig, who had been silent during the whole dispute, arose at last. He
 first addressed himself to the Celtic, as the most furious of the
 disputants. He told him that he had reason on his side, and begged a few
 mistletoes. He then praised the Greek for his eloquence, and softened
 all their exasperated spirits. He said but little to the man of Cathay,
 because he had been the most reasonable of them all. At last he said:
 
 "You were going, my friends, to quarrel about nothing; for you are all
 of one mind."
 
 At this assertion they all cried out in dissent.
 
 "Is it not true," said he to the Celtic, "that you adore not this
 mistletoe, but him that made both the mistletoe and the oak?"
 
 "Most undoubtedly," replied the Celtic.
 
 "And thou, Mr. Egyptian, dost not thou revere, in a certain bull, him
 who created the bulls?"
 
 "Yes," said the Egyptian.
 
 "The fish Oannes," continued he, "must yield to him who made the sea and
 the fishes. The Indian and the Cathaian," added he, "acknowledge a first
 principle. I did not fully comprehend the admirable things that were
 said by the Greek; but I am sure he will admit a superior being on whom
 form and matter depend."
 
 The Greek, whom they all admired, said that Zadig had exactly taken his
 meaning.
 
 "You are all then," replied Zadig, "of one opinion and have no cause to
 quarrel."
 
 All the company embraced him.
 
 Setoc, after having sold his commodities at a very high price, returned
 to his own tribe with his friend Zadig; who learned, upon his arrival,
 that he had been tried in his absence and was now going to be burned by
 a slow fire.
 
 
 
 
 XIII.
 
 THE RENDEZVOUS.
 
 
 During his journey to Balzora the priests of the stars had resolved to
 punish Zadig. The precious stones and ornaments of the young widows whom
 they sent to the funeral pile belonged to them of right; and the least
 they could now do was to burn Zadig for the ill office he had done them.
 Accordingly they accused him of entertaining erroneous sentiments of the
 heavenly host. They deposed against him, and swore that they had heard
 him say that the stars did not set in the sea. This horrid blasphemy
 made the judges tremble; they were ready to tear their garments upon
 hearing these impious words; and they would certainly have torn them had
 Zadig had wherewithal to pay them for new ones. But, in the excess of
 their zeal and indignation, they contented themselves with condemning
 him to be burnt by a slow fire. Setoc, filled with despair at this
 unhappy event, employed all his interest to save his friend, but in
 vain. He was soon obliged to hold his peace. The young widow, Almona,
 who had now conceived a great fondness for life, for which she was
 obliged to Zadig, resolved to deliver him from the funeral pile, of the
 abuse of which he had fully convinced her. She resolved the scheme in
 her own mind, without imparting it to any person whatever. Zadig was to
 be executed the next day. If she could save him at all, she must do it
 that very night; and the method taken by this charitable and prudent
 lady was as follows:
 
 She perfumed herself, she heightened her beauty by the richest and
 gayest apparel, and went to demand an audience of the chief priest of
 the stars. As soon as she was introduced to the venerable old man, she
 addressed him in these terms:
 
 "Eldest son of the great bear, brother of the bull, and cousin of the
 great dog, (such were the titles of this pontiff,) I come to acquaint
 thee with my scruples. I am much afraid that I have committed a heinous
 crime in not burning myself on the funeral pile of my dear husband; for,
 indeed, what had I worth preserving? Perishable flesh, thou seest, that
 is already entirely withered." So saying, she drew up her long sleeves
 of silk, and showed her naked arms, which were of an elegant shape and a
 dazzling whiteness. "Thou seest," said she, that these are little worth.
 The priest found in his heart that they were worth a great deal. He
 swore that he had never in his life seen such beautiful arms. "Alas!"
 said the widow, "my arms, perhaps, are not so bad as the rest; but thou
 wilt confess that my neck is not worthy of the least regard." She then
 discovered the most charming neck that nature had ever formed. Compared
 to it a rose-bud on an apple of ivory would have appeared like madder on
 the box-tree, and the whiteness of new-washed lambs would have seemed of
 a dusky yellow. Her large black eyes, languishing with the gentle lustre
 of a tender fire; her cheeks animated with the finest pink, mixed with
 the whiteness of milk; her nose, which had no resemblance to the tower
 of Mount Lebanon; her lips, like two borders of coral, inclosing the
 nest pearls in the Arabian Sea; all conspired to make the old man fancy
 and believe that he was young again. Almona, seeing his admiration, now
 entreated him to pardon Zadig. "Alas!" said he, "my charming lady,
 should I grant thee his pardon, it would be of no service, as it must
 necessarily be signed by three others, my brethren." "Sign it, however,"
 said Almona. "With all my heart," said the priest. "Be pleased to visit
 me," said Almona, "when the bright star of Sheat shall appear in the
 horizon."
 
 Almona then went to the second pontiff. He assured her that the sun, the
 moon, and all the luminaries of heaven, were but glimmering meteors in
 comparison to her charms. She asked the same favor of him, and he also
 granted it readily. She then appointed the second pontiff to meet her at
 the rising of the star Algenib. From thence she went to the third and
 fourth priest, always taking their signatures, and making an appointment
 from star to star. She then sent a message to the judges, entreating
 them to come to her house on an affair of great importance. They
 obeyed her summons. She showed them the four names, and told them that
 the priests had granted the pardon of Zadig. Each of the pontiffs
 arrived at the hour appointed. Each was surprised at finding his
 brethren there, but still more at seeing the judges also present. Zadig
 was saved; and Setoc was so charmed with the skill and address of Almona
 that he at once made her his wife.

 Business affairs now required Setoc's presence in the island of
 Serendib; but during the first month of his marriage--the month which is
 called the honeymoon--he could not permit himself to leave Almona, nor
 even to think he could ever leave her, and he requested Zadig to make
 the journey in his place. "Alas!" said Zadig, "must I put a still
 greater distance between the beautiful Astarte and myself? But it would
 be ungrateful not to serve my friend, and I will endeavor to do my
 duty."
 
 Setoc and Zadig now took leave of each other with tears in their eyes,
 both swearing an eternal friendship, and promising to always share their
 fortunes with each other. Zadig then, after having thrown himself at the
 feet of his fair deliverer, set out on his journey to Serendib, still
 musing on the unhappy Astarte, and meditating on the severity of
 fortune, which seemed to persistently make him the sport of her cruelty
 and the object of her persecution.
 
 "What!" said he to himself, "fined four hundred ounces of gold for
 having observed a bitch! condemned to lose my head for four bad verses
 in praise of the king! sentenced to be strangled because the queen had
 shoes the color of my turban! reduced to slavery for having succored a
 woman who was beaten! and on the point of being burned for having saved
 the lives of all the young widows of Arabia!"

 THE DANCE.
 
 
 Arriving in due time at the island of Serendib, Zadig's merits were at
 once recognized, and he was popularly regarded as an extraordinary man.
 He became the friend of the wise and learned, the arbitrator of
 disputes, and the advisor of the small number of those who were willing
 to take advice. He was duly presented to the king, who was pleased with
 his affability, and soon chose him for his friend. But this royal favor
 caused Zadig to tremble; for he well remembered the misfortunes which
 the kindness of king Moabdar had formerly brought upon him. "I please
 the king," said he; "shall I not therefore be lost?" Still he could not
 refuse the king's friendship, for it must be confessed that Nabussan,
 king of Serendib, son of Nassanab, son of Nabassun, son of Sanbusna, was
 one of the most amiable princes in Asia.
 
 But this good prince was always flattered, deceived, and robbed. It was
 a contest who should most pillage the royal treasury. The example set by
 the receiver-general of Serendib was universally followed by the
 inferior officers.
 
 This the king knew. He had often changed his treasurers, but had never
 been able to change the established custom of dividing the revenues into
 two unequal parts, of which the smaller came to his majesty, and the
 larger to his officers.
 
 This custom Nabussan explained to Zadig. "You, whose knowledge embraces
 so many subjects," said he, "can you not tell me how to select a
 treasurer who will not rob me?" "Assuredly," said Zadig; "I know a sure
 method for finding you a man who will keep his hands clean."
 
 The king was charmed, and asked, while he embraced him, how this was to
 be done.
 
 "You have only," said Zadig, "to cause all those who apply for the
 office of treasurer to dance. He who dances the lightest will surely
 prove to be the most honest man."
 
 "You jest," said the king. "A strange way, certainly, of choosing a
 receiver of my revenues. What! do you pretend that he who cuts the
 neatest caper will be the most just and skillful financier?"
 
 "I will not answer," returned Zadig, "for his being the most skillful,
 but I assure you he will be the most honest."
 
 Zadig spoke with so much confidence that the king imagined he had some
 supernatural test for selecting honest financiers.
 
 "I do not like the supernatural," said Zadig: "people and books dealing
 in prodigies have always displeased me. If your majesty will permit me
 to make the test, you will be convinced it is the easiest and simplest
 thing possible."
 
 Nabussan consented, and was more astonished to hear that the test was
 simple, than if it had been claimed as a miracle.
 
 "Leave all the details to me," said Zadig: "You will gain more by this
 trial than you imagine."
 
 The same day he made proclamation in the king's name, that all
 candidates for the office of receiver-in-chief of the revenues of his
 gracious majesty Nabussan, son of Nussanab, must present themselves in
 dresses of light silk, on the first day of the month of the crocodile,
 in the king's anti-chamber. The candidates came, accordingly, to the
 number of sixty-four. Musicians were placed in an adjoining room, and
 all was prepared for the dance. As the door of the saloon was closed, it
 was necessary, in order to enter it, to pass through a small gallery
 which was slightly darkened. An usher directed each candidate in
 succession through this obscure passage, in which he was left alone for
 some moments. The king, being aware of the plan, had temptingly spread
 out in this gallery many of his choicest treasures. When all the
 candidates were assembled in the saloon, the king ordered the band to
 play and the dance to begin. Never had dancers performed more
 unwillingly or with less grace. Their heads were down, their backs bent,
 their hands pressed to their sides.
 
 "What rascals!" murmured Zadig.
 
 One alone danced with grace and agility,--his head up, his look assured,
 his body erect, his arms free, his motions natural.
 
 "Ah, the honest man, the excellent man!" cried Zadig.
 
 The king embraced this upright dancer, appointed him treasurer, and
 punished all the others with the utmost justice, for each one had, while
 passing through the gallery, filled his pockets till he could hardly
 walk. His majesty was distressed at this exhibition of dishonesty, and
 regretted that among these sixty-four dancers there should be
 sixty-three thieves. This dark gallery was then named the Corridor of
 Temptation.
 
 In Persia these sixty-three lords would have been impaled; in other
 countries a chamber of justice would have consumed in costs three times
 the money stolen, replacing nothing in the king's coffers; in yet
 another kingdom they would have been honorably acquitted, and the light
 dancer disgraced; in Serendib they were only sentenced to add to the
 public treasure, for Nabussan was very indulgent.
 
 He was also very grateful, and willingly gave Zadig a larger sum than
 any treasurer had ever stolen from the revenue. This wealth Zadig used
 to send a courier to Babylon to learn the fate of queen Astarte. His
 voice trembled when directing the courier. His blood seemed to stagnate
 in his veins. His heart almost ceased to beat. His eyes were suffused
 with tears.
 
 
 
 
 XIII.(2)
 
 BLUE EYES.
 
 
 After the courier had gone, Zadig returned to the palace; and forgetting
 that he was not in his own room, almost unconsciously uttered the word
 LOVE.
 
 "Ah! love," exclaimed the king, "that is indeed the cause of my
 unhappiness. You have divined what it is that causes me pain. You are
 indeed a great man. I hope you will assist me in my search for a woman,
 perfect in all respects, and of whose affection I may feel assured. You
 have proved your ability for this service by selecting for me an honest
 financier, and I have entire confidence in your success."
 
 Zadig, having recovered his composure, promised to serve the king in
 love as he had in finance, although the task seemed to him far more
 difficult.
 
 "The body and the heart," said the king.
 
 At these words Zadig could not refrain from interrupting his majesty:
 "You show good taste," said he, "by not saying the mind and the heart;
 for we hear nothing but these words in the talk of Babylon. We see
 nothing but books which treat of the heart and mind, written by people
 who have neither the one nor the other: but pardon me, sire, and deign
 to continue."
 
 "I have in my palace," said the king, "one hundred women who are all
 called charming, graceful, beautiful, affectionate even, or pretending
 to be so when in my company; but I have too often realized that it is to
 the king of Serendib they pay court, and that they care very little for
 Nabussan. This pretended affection does not satisfy my desires. I would
 find a consort that loves me for myself, and who would willingly be all
 my own. For such a treasure I would joyfully barter the hundred
 beauties whose forced smiles afford me no delight. Let us see if out of
 these hundred queens you can select one true woman to bless me with her
 love."
 
 Zadig replied to him as he had previously done in regard to the
 finances: "Sire, allow me to make the attempt, and permit me to again
 use the treasure formerly displayed in the Corridor of Temptation. I
 will render you a faithful account."
 
 The king willingly acceded to this request, and permitted Zadig to do as
 he desired. He first chose thirty-three of the ugliest little hunchbacks
 that could be procured in Serendib, then thirty-three of the handsomest
 pages to be found, and, lastly, thirty-three bonzes, (priests), the most
 eloquent and robust he could select. He gave them all liberty to enter
 the king's private apartments in the palace, and secure a partner if
 they so desired. Each little hunchback had four thousand gold pieces
 given to him: and on the first day each had secured a companion. The
 pages, who had nothing to give but themselves, did not succeed in many
 cases until the end of two or three days. The priests had still more
 trouble in obtaining partners, but, finally, thirty-three devotees
 joined their fortunes with these pious suitors. The king, through the
 blinds which opened into his apartments, saw all these trials, and was
 astounded. Of these hundred women, ninety-nine discarded his protection.
 There still remained one, however, still quite young, with whom his
 majesty had never conversed. They sent to her one, two, three
 hunchbacks, who displayed before her twenty thousand pieces of gold. She
 still remained firm, and could not refrain from laughing at the idea of
 these cripples, that wealth could change their appearance. They then
 presented before her the two most beautiful pages. She said she thought
 the king was still more beautiful. They attacked her with the most
 eloquent of the priests, and afterward with the most audacious. She
 found the first a prattler, and could not perceive any merit in the
 second.
 
 "The heart," said she, "is everything. I will never yield to the
 hunchbacks' gold, the pages' vanity, or the pompous prattle of the
 priests. I love only Nabussan, son of Nussanab, and I will wait until he
 condescends to love me in return."
 
 The king was transported with joy, astonishment, and love. He took back
 all the money that had brought success to the hunchbacks, and made a
 present of it the beautiful Falide, which was the name of this charming
 lady. He gave her his heart, which she amply deserved, for never were
 glances from female eyes more brilliant than her own, nor the charms of
 youthful beauty more enchanting. Envy, it is true, asserted that she
 courtesied awkwardly; but candor compels the admission that she danced
 like the fairies, acted like the graces, sang like the sirens, and that
 she was in truth the very embodiment of intelligence and virtue.
 Nabussan loved and adored her; but, alas! she had BLUE EYES, and this
 apparently trivial fact was the cause of the gravest misfortunes.
 
 There was an old law in Serendib forbidding the kings to marry those to
 whom the Greeks applied the word [Greek: _boôpis_] _Βοῶπις_.[1] A
 high-priest had established this law thousands of years ago. He had
 anathematized blue eyes in order that he might secure for himself the
 hand of the king's favorite. The various orders of the empire now
 remonstrated with Nabussan for disregarding this organic law and loving
 the beautiful Falide. They publicly asserted that the last days of the
 kingdom had arrived--that this act of royal love was the height of
 sacrilege--that all nature was threatened with a sinister ending--and
 all because Nabussan, son of Nussanab, loved two magnificent blue eyes.
 The cripples, the capitalists, the bonzes and the brunettes filled the
 kingdom with their complaints.
 
 The barbarians of the northern provinces profited by the general
 discontent. They invaded the territory of the good Nabussan and demanded
 a tribute from his subjects. The priests, who possessed half the
 revenues of the state, contented themselves with raising their hands to
 heaven, and refused to put them in their coffers to aid the king. They
 chanted beautiful prayers, and left the state a prey to the invaders.
 
 "Oh! my dear Zadig," sadly cried Nabussan, "can you not rescue me from
 this impending danger?"
 
 "Very willingly," replied Zadig: "you shall have for your defence as
 much money from the priests as you may desire. Leave, I pray you,
 without guard the property of the bonzes, and defend only your own
 possessions."
 
 Nabussan wisely followed this advice. The priests became alarmed, threw
 themselves at his feet and implored his protection. The king replied
 with agreeable music, and chanted forth prayers and invocations to
 heaven with much sweetness and melody; finally, the priests reluctantly
 contributed the money, and the king brought the war to a happy
 termination.
 
 Thus Zadig by his sensible advice and judicious services drew upon
 himself the enmity of the most powerful parties in the state. The bonzes
 and the brunettes swore to destroy him; the capitalists and the cripples
 did not spare him. They caused the good Nabussan to suspect him.
 "Services rendered often remain in the anti-chamber, and distrust enters
 into the cabinet." So said Zoroaster. Every day there were fresh
 accusations: the first is repelled; the second is lightly thought of;
 the third wounds; the fourth kills.
 
 Zadig was dismayed, and having now satisfactorily arranged Setoc's
 affairs, he only thought of leaving the island in safety.
 
 "But where shall I go?" said he. "If I remain in Serendib the priests
 will doubtless have me impaled; in Egypt I would probably be enslaved,
 burnt, according to all appearances, in Arabia; strangled in Babylon.
 However, I must learn what has become of Queen Astarte, and will go on
 and see what sad fate destiny has still in store for me."

 THE ROBBER.
 
 
 Arriving on the frontiers which divide Arabia Petræa from Syria, he
 passed by a very strong castle from which a party of armed Arabians
 sallied forth. They instantly surrounded him and cried:
 
 "All thou hast belongs to us, and thy person is the property of our
 master."
 
 Zadig replied by drawing his sword; his servant, who was a man of
 courage, did the same. They killed the first Arabians that presumed to
 lay hands on them; and though the number was redoubled, they were not
 dismayed, but resolved to perish in the conflict. Two men defended
 themselves against a multitude; but such combat could not last long,
 the master of the castle, whose name was Arbogad, having observed from a
 window the prodigies of valor performed by Zadig, conceived a high
 esteem for this heroic stranger. He descended in haste, and went in
 person to call off his men and deliver the two travelers.
 
 "All that passes over my lands," said he, "belongs to me, as well as
 what I find upon the lands of others; but thou seemest to be a man of
 such undaunted courage, that I will exempt thee from the common law."
 
 He then conducted him to his castle, ordering his men to treat him well;
 and in the evening Arbogad supped with Zadig. The lord of the castle was
 one of those Arabians who are commonly called robbers; but he now and
 then performed some good actions amidst a multitude of bad ones. He
 robbed with a furious rapacity, and granted favors with great
 generosity. He was intrepid in action; affable in company; a debauchee
 at table, but gay in his debauchery; and particularly remarkable for his
 frank and open behavior. He was highly pleased with Zadig, whose lively
 conversation lengthened the repast. At last Arbogad said to him:
 
 "I advise thee to enroll thy name in my catalogue. Thou canst not do
 better. This is not a bad trade, and thou mayest one day become what I
 am at present."
 
 "May I take the liberty of asking thee," said Zadig, "how long thou hast
 followed this noble profession?"
 
 "From my most tender youth," replied the lord, "I was servant to a
 petty, good-natured Arabian, but could not endure the hardships of my
 situation. I was vexed to find that fate had given me no share of the
 earth which equally belongs to all men. I imparted the cause of my
 uneasiness to an old Arabian, who said to me:
 
 "'My son, do not despair; there was once a grain of sand that lamented
 that it was no more than a neglected atom in the deserts; at the end of
 a few years it became a diamond, and it is now the brightest ornament in
 the crown of the king of the Indies.'
 
 [Illustration: Zadig and The Brigand.--"I advise thee to enroll thy name
 in my catalogue. Thou canst not do better," said the robber, "This is
 not a bad trade, and thou mayest one day become what I am at present."]
 
 "This discourse made a deep impression on my mind. I was the grain of
 sand, and I resolved to become the diamond. I began by stealing two
 horses. I soon got a party of companions. I put myself in a condition to
 rob small caravans; and thus, by degrees, I destroyed the difference
 which had formerly subsisted between me and other men. I had my share of
 the good things of this world; and was even recompensed with usury for
 the hardships I had suffered. I was greatly respected, and became the
 captain of a band of robbers. I seized this castle by force. The satrap
 of Syria had a mind to dispossess me of it; but I was too rich to have
 any thing to fear. I gave the satrap a handsome present, by which means
 I preserved my castle, and increased my possessions. He even appointed
 me treasurer of the tributes which Arabia Petræa pays to the king of
 kings. I perform my office of receiver with great punctuality; but take
 the freedom to dispense with that of paymaster.
 
 "The grand Desterham of Babylon sent hither a petty satrap in the name
 of king Moabdar, to have me strangled. This man arrived with his orders.
 I was apprised of all. I caused to be strangled in his presence the four
 persons he had brought with him to draw the noose; after which I asked
 him how much his commission of strangling me might be worth. He replied,
 that his fees would amount to above three hundred pieces of gold. I then
 convinced him that he might gain more by staying with me. I made him an
 inferior robber; and he is now one of my best and richest officers. If
 thou wilt take my advice, thy success may be equal to his. Never was
 there a better season for plunder, since king Moabdar is killed, and all
 Babylon thrown into confusion."
 
 "Moabdar killed!" said Zadig, "and what has become of queen Astarte?"
 
 "I know not," replied Arbogad. "All I know is, that Moabdar lost his
 senses and was killed; that Babylon is a scene of disorder and
 bloodshed; that all the empire is desolated; that there are some fine
 strokes to be made yet; and that, for my own part, I have struck some
 that are admirable."
 
 "But the queen," said Zadig; "for heaven's sake, knowest thou nothing of
 the queen's fate?"
 
 "Yes," replied he, "I have heard something of a prince of Plircania. If
 she was not killed in the tumult, she is probably one of his
 concubines. But I am much fonder of booty than news. I have taken
 several women in my excursions, but I keep none of them. I sell them at
 a high price when they are beautiful, without enquiring who they are. In
 commodities of this kind rank makes no difference, and a queen that is
 ugly will never find a merchant. Perhaps I may have sold queen Astarte;
 perhaps she is dead; but, be it as it will, it is of little consequence
 to me, and I should imagine of as little to thee."
 
 So saying, he drank a large draught, which threw all his ideas into such
 confusion that Zadig could obtain no farther information.
 
 Zadig remained for some time without speech, sense, or motion. Arbogad
 continued drinking, constantly repeated that he was the happiest man in
 the world; and exhorted Zadig to put himself in the same condition. At
 last the soporiferous fume of the wine lulled him into a gentle repose.
 Zadig passed the night in the most violent perturbation.
 
 "What," said he, "did the king lose his senses? and is he killed? I
 cannot help lamenting his fate. The empire is rent in pieces: and this
 robber is happy. O fortune! O destiny! A robber is happy, and the most
 beautiful of nature's works hath perhaps perished in a barbarous manner,
 or lives in a state worse than death. O Astarte! what has become of
 thee?"
 
 At day break, he questioned all those he met in the castle; but they
 were all busy and he received no answer. During the night they had made
 a new capture, and they were now employed in dividing the spoil. All he
 could obtain in this hurry and confusion was an opportunity of
 departing, which he immediately embraced, plunged deeper than ever in
 the most gloomy and mournful reflections.
 
 Zadig proceeded on his journey with a mind full of disquiet and
 perplexity, and wholly employed on the unhappy Astarte on the king of
 Babylon, on his faithful friend Cador, on the happy robber Arbogad, on
 that capricious woman whom the Babylonians had seized on the frontiers
 of Egypt. In a word, on all the misfortunes and disappointments he had
 hitherto suffered.
 
 
 
 
 XV.
 
 THE FISHERMAN.
 
 
 At few leagues distance from Arbogad's castle he came to the banks of a
 small river, still deploring his fate, and considering himself as the
 most wretched of mankind. He saw a fisherman lying on the bank of the
 river, scarcely holding in his weak and feeble hand a net which he
 seemed ready to drop, and lifting up his eyes to heaven.
 
 "I am certainly," said the fisherman, "the most unhappy man in the
 world. I was universally allowed to be the most famous dealer in
 cream-cheese in Babylon, and yet I am ruined. I had the most handsome
 wife that any man in my situation could have; and by her I have been
 betrayed. I had still left a paltry house, and that I have seen pillaged
 and destroyed. At last I took refuge in this cottage, where I have no
 other resource than fishing, and yet I cannot catch a single fish. Oh,
 my net! no more will I throw thee into the water; I will throw myself in
 thy place."
 
 So saying, he arose and advanced forward, in the attitude of a man ready
 to throw himself into the river, and thus to finish his life.
 
 "What," said Zadig, "are there men as wretched as I?"
 
 His eagerness to save the fisherman's life was as sudden as this
 reflection. He runs to him, stops him, and speaks to him with a tender
 and compassionate air. It is commonly supposed that we are less
 miserable when we have companions in our misery. This, according to
 Zoroaster, does not proceed from malice, but necessity. We feel
 ourselves insensibly drawn to an unhappy person as to one like
 ourselves. The joy of the happy would be an insult; but two men in
 distress are like two slender trees, which, mutually supporting each
 other, fortify themselves against the tempest.
 
 "Why," said Zadig to the fisherman, "dost thou sink under thy
 misfortunes?"
 
 "Because," replied he, "I see no means of relief. I was the most
 considerable man in the village of Derlback, near Babylon, and with the
 assistance of my wife I made the best cream-cheese in the empire. Queen
 Astarte, and the famous minister, Zadig, were extremely fond of them. I
 had sent them six hundred cheeses, and one day went to the city to
 receive my money; but, on my arrival at Babylon, was informed that the
 queen and Zadig had disappeared. I ran to the house of Lord Zadig, whom
 I had never seen; and found there the inferior officers of the grand
 Desterham, who being furnished with a royal license, were plundering it
 with great loyalty and order. From thence I flew to the queen's kitchen,
 some of the lords of which told me that the queen was dead; some said
 she was in prison; and others pretended that she had made her escape;
 but they all agreed in assuring me that I would not be paid for my
 cheese. I went with my wife to the house of Lord Orcan, who was one of
 my customers, and begged his protection in my present distress. He
 granted it to my wife, but refused it to me. She was whiter than the
 cream-cheeses that began my misfortune, and the lustre of the Tyrian
 purple was not more bright than the carnation which animated this
 whiteness. For this reason Orcan detained her, and drove me from his
 house. In my despair I wrote a letter to my dear wife. She said to the
 bearer, 'Ha, ha! I know the writer of this a little. I have heard his
 name mentioned. They say he I makes excellent cream-cheeses. Desire him
 to send me some and he shall be paid.'
 
 "In my distress I resolved to apply to justice. I had still six ounces
 of gold remaining. I was obliged to give two to the lawyer whom I
 consulted, two to the procurator who undertook my cause, and two to the
 secretary of the first judge. When all this was done, my business was
 not begun; and I had already expended more money than my cheese and my
 wife were worth. I returned to my own village, with an intention to sell
 my house, in order to enable me to recover my wife.
 
 "My house was well worth sixty ounces of gold; but as my neighbors saw
 that I was poor and obliged to sell it, the first to whom I applied
 offered me thirty ounces, the second twenty, and the third ten. Bad as
 these offers were, I was so blind that I was going to strike a bargain,
 when a prince of Hircania came to Babylon, and ravaged all in his way.
 My house was first sacked and then burned.
 
 "Having thus lost my money, my wife, and my house, I retired into this
 country, where thou now seest me. I have endeavored to gain a
 subsistence by fishing; but the fish make a mock of thee as well as the
 men. I catch none; I die with hunger; and had it not been for thee,
 august comforter, I should have perished in the river."
 
 The fisherman was not allowed to give this long account without
 interruption; at every moment, Zadig, moved and transported, said:
 
 "What! knowest thou nothing of the queen's fate?"
 
 "No my lord," replied the fisherman; "but I know that neither the queen
 nor Zadig have paid me for my cream-cheeses; that I have lost my wife,
 and am now reduced to despair."
 
 "I flatter myself," said Zadig, "that thou wilt not lose all thy money.
 I have heard of this Zadig; he is an honest man; and if he return to
 Babylon, as he expects, he will give thee more than he owes thee. But
 with regard to thy wife, who is not so honest, I advise thee not to seek
 to recover her. Believe me, go to Babylon; I shall be there before thee,
 because I am on horseback, and thou art on foot. Apply to the
 illustrious Cador. Tell him thou hast met his friend. Wait for me at his
 house. Go, perhaps thou wilt not always be unhappy.
 
 "O powerful Oromazes!" continued he, "thou employest me to comfort this
 man. Whom wilt thou employ to give me consolation?"
 
 So saying, he gave the fisherman half the money he had brought from
 Arabia. The fisherman, struck with surprise and ravished with joy,
 kissed the feet of the friend of Cador, and said:
 
 "Thou art surely an angel sent from heaven to save me!" Meanwhile Zadig
 continued to make fresh inquiries and to shed tears. "What! my lord,"
 cried the fisherman, "and art thou then so unhappy, thou who bestowest
 favors?"
 
 "A hundred times more unhappy than thee," replied Zadig.
 
 "But how is it possible," said the good man, "that the giver can be more
 wretched than the receiver?"
 
 "Because," replied Zadig, "thy greatest misery arose from poverty, and
 mine is seated in the heart."
 
 "Did Orcan take thy wife from thee?" said the fisherman.
 
 This word recalled to Zadig's mind the whole of his adventures. He
 repeated the catalogue of his misfortunes, beginning with the queen's
 bitch and ending with his arrival at the castle of the robber Arbogad.
 
 "Ah!" said he to the fisherman, "Orcan deserves to be punished: but it
 is commonly such men as those that are the favorites of fortune.
 However, go thou to the house of Lord Cador, and there await my
 arrival."
 
 They then parted: the fisherman walked, thanking heaven for the
 happiness of his condition; and Zadig rode, accusing fortune for the
 hardness of his lot.

 THE BASILISK.
 
 
 Arriving in a beautiful meadow, he there saw several women, who were
 searching for something with great application. He took the liberty to
 approach one of them, and to ask if he might have the honor to assist
 them in their search.
 
 "Take care that thou dost not," replied the Syrian. "What we are
 searching for can be touched only by women."
 
 "Strange," said Zadig. "May I presume to ask thee what it is that women
 only are permitted to touch?"
 
 "It is a basilisk," said she.
 
 "A basilisk, madam! and for what purpose, pray, dost thou seek for a
 basilisk?"
 
 "It is for our lord and master, Ogul, whose castle thou seest on the
 bank of that river, at the end of that meadow. We are his most humble
 slaves. The lord Ogul is sick. His physician hath ordered him to eat a
 basilisk, stewed in rose-water; and as it is a very rare animal, and can
 only be taken by women, the lord Ogul hath promised to choose for his
 well-beloved wife the woman that shall bring him a basilisk. Let me go
 on in my search; for thou seest what I shall lose if I am forestalled by
 my companions."

      THE BASILISK, OR COCKATRICE.
 
 
      The Basilisk, called "Cockatrice" in "holy writ," was first
      described by certain ancient historians of unquestioned imaginative
      ability, but of very doubtful veracity; and they have also enriched
      the popular mythology with minute descriptions of the Phoenix, the
      Griffin, the Centaur, the Chimera, the Unicorn, and many other
      fanciful and mythical creations.
 
      The learned and pious naturalist, Charles Owen, D.D., of London,
      England, (from whose celebrated _Essay Towards a Natural History of
      Serpents_, published in 1742, the preceding engraving has been
      copied), tells us that "the Basilisk is a serpent of the Draconick
      line--the property of Africa; that in shape it resembles a cock,
      the tail excepted; that the Egyptians say it springs from the egg
      of the bird Ibis, and others, from eggs of a cock; that it is gross
      in body, of fiery eyes and sharp head, on which it wears a crest
      like a cock's comb; that it has the honor to be styled Regulus by
      the Latins--_the little king of serpents_; that it is terrible to
      them, and its voice puts them to flight, that, as tradition adds,
      its eyes and breath are killing; that dreadful things are
      attributed to it by the poets; and that, according to Pliny, the
      venom of the Basilisk is said to be so exalted, that if it bites a
      staff 'twill kill the person that makes use of it; but this,"
      continues the reverend doctor of divinity, "is tradition without a
      voucher."
 
      The "inspired" prophet Isaiah, whose writings are venerated by both
      Jews and Christians, and whose prophetic utterances have so long
      been discussed with more zeal than discretion by the sectarians,
      tells us, (Isaiah xiv. 29), that "Out of the serpent's root shall
      come forth a Cockatrice, and his fruit _shall be_ a fiery, flying
      serpent." This somewhat incoherent prediction has never been
      satisfactorily explained by the learned commentators who are
      specially educated in our colleges for solving theological enigmas,
      and who have failed to show, to the confusion of scientists and the
      admiration of a believing world, how a Cockatrice may emerge from a
      "serpent's root," and why a Cockatrice's "fiery and flying fruit"
      should have formed a theme for prophetic inspiration.--E.
 
 
 
 [Illustration: Zadig discovers Queen Astarte.--"In her hand she held a
 small rod with which she was tracing characters on the fine sand that
 lay between the turf and the brook."]
 
 Zadig left her and the other Assyrians to search for their basilisk, and
 continued his journey through the meadow; when coming to the brink of a
 small rivulet, he found a lady lying on the grass, and who was not
 searching for any thing. Her person seemed majestic; but her face was
 covered with a veil. She was inclined toward the rivulet, and profound
 sighs proceeded from her bosom. In her hand she held a small rod with
 which she was tracing characters on the fine sand that lay between the
 turf and the brook.
 
 Zadig had the curiosity to examine what this woman was writing. He drew
 near. He saw the letter Z, then an A; he was astonished: then appeared a
 D; he started. But never was surprise equal to his, when he saw the two
 last letters of his name. He stood for some time immovable. At last
 breaking silence with a faltering voice:
 
 "Oh! generous lady!" pardon a stranger, an unfortunate man, for
 presuming to ask thee by what surprising adventure I here find the name
 of Zadig traced out by thy divine hand?'
 
 At this voice and these words, the lady lifted up the veil with a
 trembling hand, looked at Zadig, sent forth a cry of tenderness,
 surprise, and joy, and sinking under the various emotions which at once
 assaulted her soul fell speechless into his arms. It was Astarte
 herself; it was the queen of Babylon; it was she whom Zadig adored, and
 whom he had reproached himself for adoring; it was she whose misfortunes
 he had so deeply lamented, and for whose fate he had been so anxiously
 concerned. He was for a moment deprived of the use of his senses, when
 he had fixed his eyes on those of Astarte, which now began to open again
 with a languor mixed with confusion and tenderness:
 
 "O ye immortal powers!" cried he, "who preside over the fates of weak
 mortals; do ye indeed restore Astarte to me? At what a time, in what a
 place, and in what a condition do I again behold her?"
 
 He fell on his knees before Astarte, and laid his face in the dust at
 her feet. The queen of Babylon raised him up, and made him sit by her
 side on the brink of the rivulet. She frequently wiped her eyes, from
 which the tears continued to flow afresh. She twenty times resumed her
 discourse, which her sighs as often interrupted. She asked by what
 strange accident they were brought together, and suddenly prevented his
 answer by other questions. She waived the account of her own
 misfortunes, and desired to be informed of those of Zadig. At last, both
 of them having a little composed the tumult of their souls, Zadig
 acquainted her in a few words by what adventure he was brought into that
 meadow.
 
 "But, O unhappy and respectable queen! by what means do I find thee in
 this lonely place, clothed in the habit of a slave, and accompanied by
 other female slaves, who are searching for a basilisk, which, by order
 of the physician, is to be stewed in rose-water?"
 
 "While they are searching for their basilisk," said the fair Astarte, "I
 will inform thee of all I have suffered, for which heaven has
 sufficiently recompensed me, by restoring thee to my sight. Thou knowest
 that the king, my husband, was vexed to see thee, the most amiable of
 mankind; and that for this reason he one night resolved to strangle thee
 and poison me. Thou knowest how heaven permitted my little mute to
 inform me of the orders of his sublime majesty. Hardly had the faithful
 Cador obliged thee to depart, in obedience to my command, when he
 ventured to enter my apartment at midnight by a secret passage. He
 carried me off, and conducted me to the temple of Oromazes, where the
 magi, his brother, shut me up in that huge statue, whose base reaches to
 the foundation of the temple, and whose top rises to the summit of the
 dome. I was there buried in a manner; but was served by the magi, and
 supplied with all the necessaries of life. At break of day his majesty's
 apothecary entered my chamber with a potion composed of a mixture of
 henbane, opium, hemlock, black hellebore, and aconite; and another
 officer went to thine with a bowstring of blue silk. Neither of us were
 to be found. Cador, the better to deceive the king, pretended to come
 and accuse us both. He said that thou hadst taken the road to the
 Indies, and I that to Memphis; on which the king's guards were
 immediately dispatched in pursuit of us both.
 
 [Illustration: Cador concealing Astarte in the Temple of Oromazes.]
 
 "The couriers who pursured me did not know me. I had hardly ever shown
 my face to any but thee, and to thee only in the presence and by the
 order of my husband. They conducted themselves in the pursuit by the
 description that had been given of my person. On the frontiers of Egypt
 they met with a woman of the same stature with me, and possessed perhaps
 of greater charms. She was weeping and wandering. They made no doubt but
 that this woman was the queen of Babylon, and accordingly brought her to
 Moabdar. Their mistake at first threw the king into a violent passion;
 but having viewed this woman more attentively, he found her extremely
 handsome, and was comforted. She was called Missouf. I have since been
 informed that this name in the Egyptian language signifies the
 capricious fair one. She was so in reality; but she had as much cunning
 as caprice. She pleased Moabdar, and gained such an ascendency over him
 as to make him choose her for his wife. Her character then began to
 appear in its true colors. She gave herself up, without scruple, to all
 the freaks of a wanton imagination. She would have obliged the chief of
 the magi, who was old and gouty, to dance before her; and on his
 refusal, she persecuted him with the most unrelenting cruelty. She
 ordered her master of the horse to make her a pie of sweetmeats. In vain
 did he represent that he was not a pastry-cook. He was obliged to make
 it, and lost his place because it was baked a little too hard. The post
 of master of the horse she gave to her dwarf, and that of Chancellor to
 her page. In this manner did she govern Babylon. Every body regretted
 the loss of me. The king, who till the moment of his resolving to poison
 me and strangle thee had been a tolerably good kind of man, seemed now
 to have drowned all his virtues in his immoderate fondness for this
 capricious fair one. He came to the temple on the great day of the feast
 held in honor of the sacred fire. I saw him implore the gods in behalf
 of Missouf, at the feet of the statue in which I was inclosed. I raised
 my voice; I cried out:
 
 "'The gods reject the prayers of a king who is now become a tyrant, and
 who attempted to murder a reasonable wife, in order to marry a woman
 remarkable for nothing but her folly and extravagance.'
 
 "At these words Moabdar was confounded and his head became disordered.
 The oracle I had pronounced, and the tyranny of Missouf, conspired to
 deprive him of his judgment, and in a few days his reason entirely
 forsook him.
 
 "His madness, which seemed to be the judgment of heaven, was the signal
 for a revolt. The people rose, and ran to arms; and Babylon, which had
 been so long immersed in idleness and effeminacy, became the theatre of
 a bloody civil war. I was taken from the heart of my statue and placed
 at the head of a party. Cador flew to Memphis to bring thee back to
 Babylon. The prince of Hircania, informed of these fatal events,
 returned with his army and made a third party in Chaldea. He attacked
 the king, who fled before him with his capricious Egyptian. Moabdar died
 pierced with wounds. Missouf fell into the hands of the conqueror. I
 myself had the misfortune to be taken by a party of Hircanians, who
 conducted me to their prince's tent, at the very moment that Missouf was
 brought before him. Thou wilt doubtless be pleased to hear that the
 prince thought me more beautiful than the Egyptian; but thou wilt be
 sorry to be informed that he designed me for his seraglio. He told me,
 with a blunt and resolute air, that as soon as he had finished a
 military expedition, which he was just going to undertake, he would come
 to me. Judge how great must have been my grief. My ties with Moabdar
 were already dissolved; I might have been the wife of Zadig; and I was
 fallen into the hands of a barbarian. I answered him with all the pride
 which my high rank and noble sentiment could inspire. I had always heard
 it affirmed that heaven stamped on persons of my condition a mark of
 grandeur, which, with a single word or glance, could reduce to the
 lowliness of the most profound respect those rash and forward persons
 who presume to deviate from the rules of politeness. I spoke like a
 queen, but was treated like a maid-servant. The Hircanian, without even
 deigning to speak to me, told his black eunuch that I was impertinent,
 but that he thought me handsome. He ordered him to take care of me and
 to put me under the regimen of favorites, that, so my complexion being
 improved, I might be the more worthy of his favors when he should be at
 leisure to honor me with them. I told him, that, rather than submit to
 his desires, I would put an end to my life. He replied with a smile,
 that women, he believed, were not so blood-thirsty, and that he was
 accustomed to such violent expressions; and then left me with the air of
 a man who had just put another parrot into his aviary. What a state for
 the first queen in the universe, and, what is more, for a heart devoted
 to Zadig!"
 
 At these words Zadig threw himself at her feet, and bathed them with his
 tears. Astarte raised him with great tenderness, and thus continued her
 story:
 
 "I now saw myself in the power of a barbarian, and rival to the foolish
 woman with whom I was conned. She gave me an account of her adventures
 in Egypt. From the description she gave of your person, from the time,
 from the dromedary on which you were mounted, and from every other
 circumstance, I inferred that Zadig was the man who had fought for her.
 I doubted not but that you were at Memphis, and therefore resolved to
 repair thither. 'Beautiful Missouf,' said I, 'thou art more handsome
 than I, and will please the prince of Hircania much better. Assist me in
 contriving the means of my escape. Thou wilt then reign alone. Thou wilt
 at once make me happy and rid thyself of a rival.'
 
 "Missouf concerted with me the means of my flight; and I departed
 secretly with a female slave. As I approached the frontiers of Arabia, a
 famous robber, named Arbogad, seized me and sold me to some merchants
 who brought me to this castle where ford Ogul resides. He bought me
 without knowing who I was. He is a voluptuary, ambitious of nothing but
 good living, and thinks that God sent him into the world for no other
 purpose than to sit at table. He is so extremely corpulent, that he is
 always in danger of suffocation. His physician, who has but little
 credit with him when he has a good digestion, governs him with a
 despotic sway when he has eaten too much. He has persuaded him that a
 basilisk stewed in rose-water will effect a complete cure. The ford Ogul
 hath promised his hand to the female slave that brings him a basilisk.
 Thou seest that I leave them to vie with each other in meriting this
 honor; and never was I less desirous of finding the basilisk than since
 heaven hath restored thee to my sight."
 
 This account was succeeded by a long conversation between Astarte and
 Zadig, consisting of every thing that their long suppressed sentiments,
 their great sufferings, and their mutual love, could inspire into
 hearts the most noble and tender, and the genii who preside over love
 carried their words to the sphere of Venus.
 
 The women returned to Ogul without having found the basilisk. Zadig was
 introduced to this mighty lord, and spoke to him in the following terms:
 
 "May immortal health descend from heaven to bless all thy days! I am a
 physician. At the first report of thy indisposition I flew to thy
 castle, and have now brought thee a basilisk stewed in rose-water. Not
 that I pretend to marry thee. All I ask is the liberty of a Babylonian
 slave, who hath been in thy possession for a few days; and, if I should
 not be so happy as to cure thee, magnificent Lord Ogul, I consent to
 remain a slave in her place."
 
 The proposal was accepted. Astarte set out for Babylon with Zadig's
 servant, promising, immediately upon her arrival, to send a courier to
 inform him of all that had happened. Their parting was as tender as
 their meeting. The moment of meeting, and that of parting are the two
 greatest epochs of life as sayeth the great book of Zend. Zadig loved
 the queen with as much ardor as he professed; and the queen loved Zadig
 more than she thought proper to acknowledge.
 
 Meanwhile Zadig spoke thus to Ogul:
 
 "My lord, my basilisk is not to be eaten; all its virtues must enter
 through thy pores. I have inclosed it in a little ball, blown up and
 covered with a fine skin. Thou must strike this ball with all thy might,
 and I must strike it back for a considerable time; and by observing this
 regimen for a few days, thou wilt see the effects of my art."
 
 The first day Ogul was out of breath, and thought he should have died
 with fatigue. The second, he was less fatigued, and slept better. In
 eight days he recovered all the strength, all the health, all the
 agility and cheerfulness of his most agreeable years.
 
 "Thou hast played at ball, and hast been temperate," said Zadig. "Know
 that there is no such thing in nature as a basilisk; that temperance and
 exercise are the two great preservatives of health; and that the art of
 reconciling intemperance and health is as chimerical as the
 philosopher's stone, judicial astrology, or the theology of the magi."
 
 Ogul's first physician observing how dangerous this man might prove to
 the medical art, formed a design, in conjunction with the apothecary, to
 send Zadig to search for a basilisk in the other world. Thus, after
 having suffered such a long train of calamities on account of his good
 actions, he was now upon the point of losing his life for curing a
 gluttonous lord. He was invited to an excellent dinner, and was to have
 been poisoned in the second course; but, during the first, he happily
 received a courier from the fair Astarte.
 
 "When one is beloved by a beautiful woman," says the great Zoroaster,
 "he hath always the good fortune to extricate himself out of every kind
 of difficulty and danger."
 
 
 
 
 XVII.
 
 THE COMBATS.
 
 
 The queen was received at Babylon with all those transports of joy which
 are ever felt on the return of a beautiful princess who hath been
 involved in calamities. Babylon was now in greater tranquillity. The
 prince of Hircania had been killed in battle. The victorious Babylonians
 declared that the queen should marry the man whom they should choose for
 their sovereign. They were resolved that the first place in the world,
 that of being husband to Astarte and king of Babylon, should not depend
 on cabals and intrigues. They swore to acknowledge for king the man who,
 upon trial, should be found to be possessed of the greatest valor and
 the greatest wisdom. Accordingly, at the distance of a few leagues from
 the city, a spacious place was marked out for the list, surrounded with
 magnificent amphitheatres. Thither the combatants were to repair in
 complete armor. Each of them had a separate apartment behind the
 amphitheatres, where they were neither to be seen nor known by any one.
 Each was to encounter four knights; and those that were so happy as to
 conquer four, were then to engage with one another: so that he who
 remained the last master of the field, would be proclaimed conqueror at
 the games. Four days after he was to return to the same place, and to
 explain the enigmas proposed by the magi. If he did not explain the
 enigmas, he was not king; and the running at the lances was to begin
 afresh, till a man should be found who was conqueror in both these
 combats; for they were absolutely determined to have a king possessed of
 the greatest wisdom and the most invincible courage. The queen was all
 the while to be strictly guarded. She was only allowed to be present at
 the games, and even there she was to be covered with a veil; but was not
 allowed to speak to any of the competitors, that so they might neither
 receive favor, nor suffer injustice.
 
 These particulars Astarte communicated to her lover, hoping that, in
 order to obtain her, he would show himself possessed of greater courage
 and wisdom than any other person.
 
 Zadig set out on his journey, beseeching Venus to fortify his courage
 and enlighten his understanding. He arrived on the banks of the
 Euphrates on the eve of this great day. He caused his device to be
 inscribed among those of the combatants, concealing his face and his
 name, as the law ordained; and then went to repose himself in the
 apartment that fell to him by lot. His friend, Cador, who after the
 fruitless search he had made for him in Egypt, had now returned to
 Babylon, sent to his tent a complete suit of armor, which was a present
 from the queen; as also from himself, one of the finest horses in
 Persia. Zadig presently perceived that these presents were sent by
 Astarte; and from thence his courage derived fresh strength, and his
 love the most animating hopes.
 
 Next day, the queen being seated under a canopy of jewels, and the
 amphitheatres filled with all the gentlemen and ladies of rank in
 Babylon, the combatants appeared in the circus. Each of them came and
 laid his device at the feet of the grand magi. They drew their devices
 by lot; and that of Zadig was the last. The first who advanced was a
 certain lord, named Itobad, very rich and very vain, but possessed of
 little courage, of less address, and scarcely of any judgment at all.
 His servants had persuaded him that such a man as he ought to be king.
 He had said in reply, "Such a man as I ought to reign;" and thus they
 had armed him cap-a-pie. He wore an armor of gold enameled with green, a
 plume of green feathers, and a lance adorned with green ribbons. It
 was instantly perceived by the manner in which Itobad managed his horse,
 that it was not for such a man as him that heaven reserved the sceptre
 of Babylon. The first knight that ran against him threw him out of his
 saddle: the second laid him flat on his horse's buttocks, with his legs
 in the air, and his arms extended. Itobad recovered himself, but with so
 bad a grace, that the whole amphitheatre burst out a laughing. The third
 knight disdained to make use of his lance; but, making a pass at him,
 took him by the right leg, and wheeling him half round, laid him
 prostrate on the sand. The squires of the games ran to him laughing, and
 replaced him in his saddle. The fourth combatant took him by the left
 leg, and tumbled him down on the other side. He was conducted back with
 scornful shouts to his tent, where, according to the law, he was to pass
 the night; and as he limped along with great difficulty, he said: "What
 an adventure for such a man as I!"
 
 [Illustration: The combats.]
 
 The other knights acquitted themselves with greater ability and success.
 Some of them conquered two combatants; a few of them vanquished three;
 but none but prince of Otamus conquered four. At last Zadig fought in
 his turn. He successively threw four knights off their saddles with all
 the grace imaginable. It then remained to be seen who should be
 conqueror, of Otamus or Zadig. The arms of the first were gold and blue,
 with a plume of the same color; those of the last were white. The wishes
 of all the spectators were divided between the knight in blue and the
 knight in white. The queen, whose heart was in a violent palpitation,
 offered prayers to heaven for the success of the white color.
 
 The two champions made their passes and vaults with so much agility,
 they mutually gave and received such dexterous blows with their lances,
 and sat so firmly in their saddles, that every body but the queen wished
 there might be two kings in Babylon. At length, their horses being tired
 and their lances broken, Zadig had recourse to this stratagem: He passed
 behind the blue prince; springs upon the buttocks of his horse; seizes
 him by the middle; throws him on the earth; places himself in the
 saddle, and wheels around Otamus as he lay extended on the ground. All
 the amphitheatre cried out, "Victory to the white knight!" Otamus rises
 in a violent passion, and draws his sword; Zadig leaps from his horse
 with his sabre in his hand. Both of them are now on the ground, engaged
 in a new combat, where strength and agility triumph by turns. The plumes
 of their helmets, the studs of their bracelets, and the rings of their
 armor are driven to a great distance by the violence of a thousand
 furious blows. They strike with the point and the edge; to the right, to
 the left; on the head, on the breast; they retreat; they advance; they
 measure swords; they close; they seize each other; they bend like
 serpents; they attack like lions; and the fire every moment flashes from
 their blows. At last Zadig, having recovered his spirits, stops; makes a
 feint; leaps upon Otamus; throws him on the ground and disarms him; and
 Otamus cries out:
 
 "It is thou alone, O white knight, that oughtest to reign over Babylon!"
 
 The queen was now at the height of her joy. The knight in blue armor,
 and the knight in white, were conducted each to his own apartment, as
 well as all the others, according to the intention of the law. Mutes
 came to wait upon them, and to serve them at table. It may be easily
 supposed that the queen's little mute waited upon Zadig. They were then
 left to themselves to enjoy the sweets of repose till next morning, at
 which time the conqueror was to bring his device to the grand magi, to
 compare it with that which he had left, and make himself known.
 
 Zadig, though deeply in love, was so much fatigued that he could not
 help sleeping. Itobad, who lay near him, never closed his eyes. He arose
 in the night, entered his apartment, took the white arms and the device
 of Zadig, and put his green armor in their place. At break of day, he
 went boldly to the grand magi, to declare that so great a man as he was
 conqueror. This was little expected; however, he was proclaimed while
 Zadig was still asleep. Astarte, surprised and filled with despair,
 returned to Babylon. The amphitheatre was almost empty when Zadig awoke;
 he sought for his arms but could find none but the green armor. With
 this he was obliged to cover himself, having nothing else near him.
 Astonished and enraged, he put it on in a furious passion and advanced
 in this equipage.
 
 The people that still remained in the amphitheatre and the circus
 received him with hoofs and hisses. They surrounded him, and insulted
 him to his face. Never did man suffer such cruel mortifications. He lost
 his patience; with his sabre he dispersed such of the populace as dared
 to affront him; but he knew not what course to take. He could not see
 the queen; he could not claim the white armor she had sent him without
 exposing her; and thus, while she was plunged in grief, he was filled
 with fury and distraction. He walked on the banks of the Euphrates,
 fully persuaded that his star had destined him to inevitable misery; and
 revolving in his mind all his misfortunes, from the adventure of the
 woman who hated one-eyed men, to that of his armor:
 
 "This," said he, "is the consequence of my having slept too long. Had I
 slept less, I should now have been king of Babylon, and in possession of
 Astarte. Knowledge, virtue, and courage, have hitherto served only to
 make me miserable."
 
 He then let fall some secret murmurings against providence, and was
 tempted to believe that the world was governed by a cruel destiny, which
 oppressed the good, and prospered knights in green armor.
 
 
 
 
 XVIII.
 
 THE HERMIT.
 
 
 One of Zadig's greatest mortifications was his being obliged to wear
 that green armor which had exposed him to such contumelious treatment.
 A merchant happening to pass by, he sold it to him for a trifle, and
 bought a gown and a long bonnet. In this garb he proceeded along the
 banks of the Euphrates, filled with despair, and secretly accusing
 providence, which thus continued to persecute him with unremitting
 severity.
 
 While he was thus sauntering along, he met a hermit whose white and
 venerable beard hung down to his girdle. He held a book in his hand,
 which he read with great attention. Zadig stopped, and made him a
 profound obeisance. The hermit returned the compliment with such a noble
 and engaging air, that Zadig had the curiosity to enter into
 conversation with him. He asked him what book it was that he had been
 reading.
 
 "It is the book of destinies," said the hermit. "Wouldst thou choose to
 look into it?"
 
 He put the book into the hands of Zadig, who, thoroughly versed as he
 was in several languages, could not decipher a single character of it.
 This only redoubled his curiosity.
 
 "Thou seemest," said the good father, "to be in great distress."
 
 "Alas!" replied Zadig, "I have but too much reason."
 
 "If thou wilt permit me to accompany thee," resumed the old man,
 "perhaps I may be of some service to thee. I have often poured the balm
 of consolation into the bleeding heart of the unhappy."
 
 Zadig felt himself inspired with respect for the dignity, the beard, and
 the book of the hermit. He found, in the course of the conversation,
 that he was possessed of superior degrees of knowledge. The hermit
 talked of fate, of justice, of morals, of the chief good, of human
 weakness, and of virtue and vice, with such a spirited and moving
 eloquence, that Zadig felt himself drawn toward him by an irresistible
 charm. He earnestly entreated the favor of his company till their return
 to Babylon.
 
 "I ask the same favor of thee," said the old man. "Swear to me by
 Oromazes that, whatever I do, thou wilt not leave me for some days."
 
 Zadig swore, and they set out together. In the evening the two travelers
 arrived at a superb castle. The hermit entreated a hospitable reception
 for himself and the young man who accompanied him. The porter, whom one
 might have mistaken for a great lord, introduced them with a kind of
 disdainful civility. He presented them to a principal domestic, who
 showed them his master's magnificent apartments. They were admitted to
 the lower end of the table, without being honored with the least mark of
 regard by the lord of the castle; but they were served, like the rest,
 with delicacy and profusion. They were then presented, in a golden basin
 adorned with emeralds and rubies, with water to wash their hands. At
 last they were conducted to bed in a beautiful apartment; and in the
 morning a domestic brought each of them a piece of gold, after which
 they took their leave and departed.
 
 "The master of the house," said Zadig, as they were proceeding on the
 journey, "appears to be a generous man, though somewhat too proud. He
 nobly performs the duties of hospitality."
 
 At that instant he observed that a kind of large pocket, which the
 hermit had, was filled and distended; and upon looking more narrowly, he
 found that it contained the golden basin adorned with precious stones,
 which the hermit had stolen. He durst not then take any notice of it;
 but he was filled with a strange surprise.
 
 About noon the hermit came to the door of a paltry house, inhabited by a
 rich miser, and begged the favor of an hospitable reception for a few
 hours. An old servant, in a tattered garb, received them with a blunt
 and rude air, and led them into the stable, where he gave them some
 rotten olives, sour wine, and mouldy bread. The hermit ate and drank
 with as much seeming satisfaction as he had done the evening before, and
 then addressing himself to the old servant who watched them both to
 prevent them stealing anything, and had rudely pressed them to depart,
 he gave him the two pieces of gold he had received in the morning, and
 thanked him for his great civility.
 
 "Pray," added he, "allow me to speak to thy master."
 
 The servant, filled with astonishment, introduced the two travelers.
 
 "Magnificent lord!" said the hermit, "I cannot but return thee my most
 humble thanks for the noble manner in which thou hast entertained us. Be
 pleased to accept of this golden basin as a small mark of my gratitude."
 
 The miser started, and was ready to fall backwards; but the hermit,
 without giving him time to recover from his surprise, instantly departed
 with his young fellow traveler.
 
 "Father," said Zadig, "what is the meaning of all this? Thou seemest to
 me to be entirely different from other men. Thou stealest a golden basin
 adorned with precious stones, from a lord who received thee
 magnificently, and givest it to a miser who treats thee with
 indignity."
 
 "Son," replied the old man, "this magnificent lord, who receives
 strangers only from vanity and ostentation, will hereby be rendered more
 wise; and the miser will learn to practice the duties of hospitality. Be
 surprised at nothing, but follow me."
 
 Zadig knew not as yet whether he was in company with the most foolish or
 the most prudent of mankind' but the hermit spoke with such an
 ascendency that Zadig, who was moreover bound by his oath, could not
 refuse to follow him.
 
 In the evening they arrived at a house built with equal elegance and
 simplicity, where nothing savored either of prodigality or avarice. The
 master of it was a philosopher who had retired from the world, and who
 cultivated in peace the study of virtue and wisdom, without any of that
 rigid and morose severity so commonly found in men of his character. He
 had chosen to build this fine house in which he received strangers with
 a generosity free from ostentation. He went himself to meet the two
 travelers, whom he led into a commodious apartment, and desired them to
 repose themselves. Soon after he came and invited them to a decent and
 well ordered repast, during which he spoke with great judgment of the
 last revolutions in Babylon. He seemed to be strongly attached to the
 queen, and wished that Zadig had appeared in the lists to contend for
 the crown.
 
 "But the people," added he, "do not deserve to have such a king as
 Zadig."
 
 Zadig blushed and felt his griefs redoubled. They agreed, in the course
 of the conversation, that the things of this world did not always answer
 the wishes of the wise. The hermit maintained that the ways of
 providence were inscrutable; and that men were in the wrong to judge of
 a whole, of which they understood but the smallest part. They talked of
 the passions.
 
 "Ah," said Zadig, "how fatal are their effects!"
 
 "They are the winds," replied the hermit, "that swell the sails of the
 ship; it is true, they sometimes sink her, but without them she could
 not sail at all. The bile makes us sick and choleric but without the
 bile we could not live. Everything in this world is dangerous, and yet
 everything in it is necessary."
 
 The conversation turned on pleasure; and the hermit proved that it was a
 present bestowed by the deity.
 
 "For," said he, "man cannot either give himself sensations or ideas: he
 receives all; and pain and pleasure proceed from a foreign cause as well
 as his being."
 
 Zadig was surprised to see a man who had been guilty of such extravagant
 actions, capable of reasoning with so much judgment and propriety. At
 last, after a conversation equally entertaining and instructive, the
 host led back his two guests to their apartment, blessing heaven for
 having sent him two men possessed of so much wisdom and virtue. He
 offered them money with such an easy and noble air that it could not
 possibly give any offence. The hermit refused it, and said that he must
 now take his leave of him, as he proposed to set out for Babylon in the
 morning before it was light. Their parting was tender. Zadig especially
 felt himself filled with esteem and affection for a man of such an
 amiable character.
 
 When he and the hermit were alone in their apartment they spent a long
 time in praising their host. At break of day the old man awakened his
 companion.
 
 "We must now depart," said he; "but while all the family are still
 asleep, I will leave this man a mark of my esteem and affection."
 
 So saying he took a candle and set fire to the house. Zadig, struck with
 horror, cried aloud, and endeavored to hinder him from committing such a
 barbarous action; but the hermit drew him away by a superior force, and
 the house was soon in flames. The hermit, who, with his companion, was
 already at a considerable distance, looked back to the conflagration
 with great tranquillity.
 
 "Thanks be to God," said he, "the house of my dear host is entirely
 destroyed! Happy man!"
 
 At these words Zadig was at once tempted to burst out in laughing, to
 reproach the reverend father, to beat him, and to run away. But he did
 none of all these; for still subdued by the powerful ascendancy of the
 hermit, he followed him, in spite of himself, to the next stage.
 
 This was at the house of a charitable and virtuous widow, who had a
 nephew fourteen years of age, a handsome and promising youth, and her
 only hope. She performed the honors of the house as well us she could.
 Next day, she ordered her nephew to accompany the strangers to a bridge,
 which being lately broken down, was become extremely dangerous in
 passing. The young man walked before them with great alacrity. As they
 were crossing the bridge, the hermit said to the youth:
 
 "Come, I must show my gratitude to thy aunt."
 
 He then took him by the hair, and plunged him into the river. The boy
 sank, appeared again on the surface of the water, and was swallowed up
 by the current.
 
 "O monster! O thou most wicked of mankind!" cried Zadig.
 
 "Thou promised to behave with greater patience," said the hermit,
 interrupting him. "Know, that under the ruins of that house which
 providence hath set on fire, the master hath found an immense treasure I
 know, that this young man, whose life providence hath shortened, would
 have assassinated his aunt in the space of a year, and thee in that of
 two."
 
 "Who told thee so, barbarian?" cried Zadig, "and though thou hadst read
 this event in thy book of destinies, art thou permitted to drown a youth
 who never did thee any harm?"
 
 While the Babylonian was thus exclaiming, he observed that the old man
 had no longer a beard, and that his countenance assumed the features and
 complexion of youth. The hermit's habit disappeared, and four beautiful
 wings covered a majestic body resplendent with light.
 
 "O sent of heaven! O divine angel!" cried Zadig, humbly prostrating
 himself on the ground, "Hast thou then descended from the empyrean to
 teach a weak mortal to submit to the eternal decrees of providence?"
 
 "Men," said the angel Jesrad, "judge of all without knowing any thing;
 and, of all men, thou best deservest to be enlightened."
 
 Zadig begged to be permitted to speak:
 
 "I distrust myself," said he, "but may I presume to ask the favor of
 thee to clear up one doubt that still remains in my mind. Would it not
 have been better to have corrected this youth, and made him virtuous,
 than to have drowned him?"
 
 [Illustration: The hermit.]
 
      The poem, called _The Hermit_, by Thomas Parnell, D.D., expresses
      views in regard to providence similar to those of Voltaire. The
      same thoughts may also be found in the _Divine Dialogues_ of Henry
      Moore. Indeed this "tale to prose-men known to verse-men fam'd,"
      has been used by many authors. Pope says "the story was written
      originally in Spanish;" Goldsmith, in his _Life of Parnell_,
      intimates that it was originally of Arabian invention, while, in
      fact, it seems to bear internal evidence of Persian or Hindoo
      origin.--E.
 
 "Had he become virtuous," replied Jesrad, "and enjoyed a longer life, it
 would have been his fate to have been assassinated himself, together
 with the wife he would have married, and the child he would have had by
 her."
 
 "But why," said Zadig, "is it necessary that there should be crimes and
 misfortunes, and that these misfortunes should fall on the good?"
 
 "The wicked," replied Jesrad, "are always unhappy. They serve to prove
 and try the small number of the just that are scattered through the
 earth; and there is no evil that is not productive of some good."
 
 "But," said Zadig, "suppose there was nothing but good and no evil at
 all."
 
 "Then," replied Jesrad, "this earth would be another earth: the chain of
 events would be ranged in another order and directed by wisdom. But this
 other order, which would be perfect, can exist only in the eternal abode
 of the Supreme Being, to which no evil can approach. The Deity hath
 created millions of worlds, among which there is not one that resembles
 another. This immense variety is the effect of his immense power. There
 are not two leaves among the trees of the earth, nor two globes in the
 unlimited expanse of heaven, that are exactly similar; and all that thou
 seest on the little atom in which thou art born, ought to be, in its
 proper time and place, according to the immutable decrees of him who
 comprehends all. Men think that this child, who hath just perished, is
 fallen into the water by chance; and that it is by the same chance that
 this house is burned. But there is no such thing as chance. All is
 either a trial, or a punishment, or a reward, or a foresight. Remember
 the fisherman, who thought himself the most wretched of mankind.
 Oromazes sent thee to change his fate. Cease then, frail mortal, to
 dispute against what thou oughtest to adore."
 
 "But," said Zadig--
 
 As he pronounced the word "But," the angel took his flight toward the
 tenth sphere. Zadig on his knees adored providence, and submitted. The
 angel cried to him from on high:
 
 "Direct thy course toward Babylon."
 
 
 
 
 XIX.
 
 THE ENIGMAS.
 
 
 Zadig, entranced as it were, and like a man about whose head the thunder
 had burst, walked at random. He entered Babylon on the very day when
 those who had fought at the tournaments were assembled in the grand
 vestibule of the palace to explain the enigmas, and to answer the
 questions of the grand magi. All the knights were already present,
 except the knight in green armor. As soon as Zadig appeared in the city,
 the people crowded around him; every eye was fixed on him, every mouth
 blessed him, and every heart wished him the empire. The envious man saw
 him pass; he frowned and turned aside. The people conducted him to the
 place where the assembly was held. The queen, when informed of his
 arrival, became a prey to the most violent agitations of hope and fear.
 She was filled with anxiety and apprehension. She could not comprehend
 why Zadig was without arms, nor why Itobad wore the white armor.
 
 When the knights who had fought were directed to appear in the assembly,
 Zadig said. "I have fought as well as the other knights, but another
 here wears my arms; and while I wait for the honor of proving the truth
 of my assertion, I demand the liberty of presenting myself to explain
 the enigmas."
 
 The question was put to vote, and his reputation for probity was so well
 established, that they admitted him without scruple.
 
 The first question proposed by the grand magi, was: "What, of all things
 in the world, is the longest and the shortest, the swiftest and the
 slowest, the most divisible and the most extended, the most neglected
 and the most regretted, without which nothing can be done, which devours
 all that is little, and enlivens all that is great?"
 
 Itobad was to speak. He replied, that so great a man as he did not
 understand enigmas; and that it was sufficient for him to have conquered
 by his strength and valor. Some said that the meaning of the enigma was
 fortune; some, the earth; and others, the light. Zadig said that it was
 time.
 
 "Nothing," added he, "is longer, since it is the measure of eternity.
 Nothing is shorter, since it is insufficient for the accomplishment of
 our projects. Nothing more slow to him that expects, nothing more rapid
 to him that enjoys. In greatness it extends to infinity, in smallness it
 is infinitely divisible. All men neglect it, all regret the loss of it;
 nothing can be done without it. It consigns to oblivion whatever is
 unworthy of being transmitted to posterity, and it immortalizes such
 actions as are truly great."
 
 The assembly acknowledged that Zadig was in the right.
 
 The next question was: "What is the thing which we receive without
 thanks, which we enjoy without knowing how, and which we lose without
 perceiving it?"
 
 Every one gave his own explanation. Zadig alone guessed that it was
 life; and he explained all the other enigmas with the same facility.
 Itobad always said that nothing was more easy, and that he could have
 answered them with the same readiness, had he chosen to have given
 himself the trouble. Questions were then proposed on justice, on the
 sovereign good, and on the art of government. Zadig's answers were
 judged to be the most solid, and the people exclaimed:
 
 "What a pity it is, that so great a genius should be so bad a knight!"
 
 "Illustrious lords," said Zadig, "I have had the honor of conquering in
 the tournaments. It is to me that the white armor belongs. Lord Itobad
 took possession of it during my sleep. He probably thought it would fit
 him better than the green. I am now ready to prove in your presence,
 with my gown and sword, against all that beautiful white armor which he
 took from me, that it is I who have had the honor of conquering the
 brave of Otamus."
 
 Itobad accepted the challenge with the greatest confidence. He never
 doubted but that, armed as he was with a helmet, a cuirass, and
 brassarts, he would obtain an easy victory over a champion in a cap and
 a night-gown. Zadig drew his sword, saluting the queen, who looked at
 him with a mixture of fear and joy. Itobad drew his, without saluting
 any one. He rushed upon Zadig, like a man who had nothing to fear; he
 was ready to cleave him in two. Zadig knew how to ward off his blows, by
 opposing the strongest part of his sword to the weakest of that of his
 adversary, in such a manner that Itobad's sword was broken. Upon which
 Zadig, seizing his enemy by the waist, threw him on the ground; and
 fixing the point of his sword at the extremity of his breast-plate,
 exclaimed: "Suffer thyself to be disarmed, or thou art a dead man."
 
 Itobad greatly surprised at the disgrace that happened to such a man as
 he, was obliged to yield to Zadig, who took from him with great
 composure, his magnificent helmet, his superb cuirass, his fine
 brassarts, his shining cuisses; clothed himself with them, and in this
 dress ran to throw himself at the feet of Astarte. Cador easily proved
 that the armor belonged to Zadig. He was acknowledged king by the
 unanimous consent of the whole nation, and especially by that of
 Astarte, who, after so many calamities, now tasted the exquisite
 pleasure of seeing her lover worthy, in the eyes of the world, to be her
 husband. Itobad went home to be called lord in his own house. Zadig was
 king, and was happy. He recollected what the angel Jesrad had said to
 him. He even remembered the grain of sand that became a diamond. He sent
 in search of the robber Arbogad, to whom he gave an honorable post in
 his army, promising to advance him to the first dignities, if he behaved
 like a true warrior; and threatening to hang him, if he followed the
 profession of a robber.
 
 Setoc, with the fair Almona, was called from the heart of Arabia, and
 placed at the head of the commerce of Babylon. Cador was preferred and
 distinguished according to his great services. He was the friend of the
 king; and the king was then the only monarch on earth that had a friend.
 The little mute was not forgotten. A fine house was given to the
 fisherman; and Orcan was condemned to pay him a large sum of money, and
 to restore him his wife; but the fisherman, who had now become wise,
 took only the money.
 
 The beautiful Semira could not be comforted for having believed that
 Zadig would be blind of an eye; nor did Azora cease to lament her
 attempt to cut off his nose: their griefs, however, he softened by his
 presents. The capricious beauty, Missouf, was left unnoticed. The
 envious man died of rage and shame. The empire enjoyed peace, glory, and
 plenty. This was the happiest age of the earth. It was governed by love
 and justice. The people blessed Zadig, and Zadig blessed heaven.

 THE SAGE AND THE ATHEIST.
 
 
 
 
 INTRODUCTION.
 
 
 You request me, sir, to give you some account of our worthy friend, and
 his singular son. The leisure that the retirement of Lord Peterborough
 now affords me, places it in my power to oblige you. You will be as
 astonished as I was, and perhaps adopt my opinion on the subject.
 
 You scarcely knew the young and unfortunate Johnny, Freind's only son,
 whom his father took with him to Spain when he received the appointment
 of chaplain to our armies, in 1705. You started for Aleppo, before my
 lord besieged Barcelona; yet you were right when you said, John's
 countenance was amiable and interesting, and that he gave proofs of
 intelligence and courage. It was quite true. Every one who knew him,
 loved him. At first he was intended for the church; but, as he
 manifested much aversion for that profession, which, indeed, requires
 great skill, management, and finesse, his prudent father considered it a
 folly and a crime to oppose his inclination.
 
 John was not twenty years old when he assisted, as a volunteer, at the
 attack on Mont-Joui, which was captured, and where the Prince of Hesse
 lost his life. Our poor Johnny was wounded, taken prisoner, and carried
 into the town. The following is an account of his adventures from the
 attack of Mont-Joui till the taking of Barcelona. It is as told by a
 Catalonian lady, a little too free and too simple. Such stories do not
 find a way to the hearts of your wise men. I received it from her when I
 entered Barcelona in the suite of Lord Peterborough. You must read it
 without offence, as a true description of the manners of the country.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER I.
 
 ADVENTURES OF JOHNNY, A YOUNG ENGLISHMAN. WRITTEN BY DONNA LAS NALGAS.
 
 
 When we were informed that the same savages who came through the air to
 seize on Gibraltar, were come to besiege our beautiful Barcelona, we
 began to offer prayers at Notre Dame de Manreze--assuredly the best mode
 of defence.
 
 These people, who come from so far, are called by a name very hard to
 pronounce, that is, English. Our reverend father inquisitor, Don
 Jeronimo Bueno Caracucarador, preached against these brigands. He
 anathematized them in Notre Dame d'Elpino. He assured us that the
 English had monkey-tails, bears' paws, and parrot-heads; that they
 sometimes spoke like men, but invariably made a great hissing; that they
 were moreover notorious heretics; that though the Blessed Virgin was
 often indulgent to poor sinners, she never forgave heretics, and that
 consequently they would all be infallibly exterminated, especially if
 they presumed to appear before Mont-Joui. He had scarcely finished his
 sermon when he heard that Mont-Joui was taken by storm.
 
 The same evening we learned that a young Englishman, who had been
 wounded in the assault, was our prisoner. Throughout the town arose
 cries of victory! victory! And the illuminations were very general.
 
 Donna Boca Vermeja, who had the honor to be the reverend inquisitor's
 favorite, was very desirous to see what the English animal and heretic
 was like. She was my intimate friend. I shared her curiosity. We were
 oblished to wait till his wound was cured; and this did not take very
 long.
 
 [Illustration: Don Jeronimo Bueno Caracucarador.]
 
 Soon after, we learned that he was in the habit of visiting daily at the
 residence of Elbob, my cousin german, who, as every one knows, is the
 best surgeon in the town. My friend Boca Vermeja's impatience to see
 this singular monster increased two-fold. We had no rest ourselves, and
 gave none to our cousin, the surgeon, till he allowed us to conceal
 ourselves in a small closet, which we entered on tiptoe without saying a
 word and scarcely venturing to breathe, just as the Englishman arrived.
 His face was not turned toward us. He took off a small cap which
 enclosed his light hair, which then fell in thick curls down the finest
 neck I ever beheld. His form presented a plumpness, a finish, an
 elegance, approaching, in my opinion, the Apollo Belvidere at Rome--a
 copy of which my uncle the sculptor possesses.
 
 Donna Boca Vermeja was transported with surprise, and delighted. I
 shared her ecstacy, and could not forbear exclaiming: "O che hermoso
 Muchacho!"
 
 These words made the young man turn round. We then saw the face of an
 Adonis on the body of a young Hercules. Donna Boca Vermeja nearly fell
 backwards at the sight:
 
 "St. James!" she exclaimed, "Holy Virgin! is it possible heretics are
 such fine men? How we have been deceived about them."
 
 Donna Boca was soon violently in love with the heretical monster. She is
 handsomer than I am, I must confess; and I must also confess that I
 became doubly jealous of her on that account. I took care to show her
 that to forsake the reverend father inquisitor, Don Jeronimo Bueno
 Caracucarador, for an Englishman, would be a crime falling nothing short
 of damnation.
 
 "Ah! my dear Las Nalgas," she said, (Las Nalgas is my name) "I would
 forsake Melchizedek himself for so fine a young man."
 
 One of the inquisitors who attended four masses daily, to obtain from
 Our Lady of Manreze the destruction of the English, heard of our
 admiration. The Reverend Father Don Caracucarador whipped us both, and
 had our dear Englishman arrested by twenty-four Alguazils of St.
 Hermandad. Johnny killed four; and was at length captured by the
 remaining twenty. He was confined in a very damp cellar, and sentenced
 to be burnt the following Sunday, in full ceremony, clothed in a
 San-bénito, wearing a sugar-loaf cap, in honor of our Savior and the
 Virgin Mary, his mother. Don Caracucarador prepared a fine sermon, but
 had no occasion for it, as the town was taken at four o'clock on the
 Sunday morning.
 
 Here Donna Las Nalgas's tale terminates. This lady was not without a
 description of wit, which in Spain we call agudéza.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER II.
 
 CONTINUATION OF THE ADVENTURES OF JOHN, THE YOUNG ENGLISHMAN; ALSO THOSE
 OF HIS WORTHY FATHER, D.D., M.P., AND F.R.S.
 
 
 You know the skillful conduct of the Earl of Peterborough after he took
 Barcelona, how successfully he prevented pillage, restored order, and
 rescued the Duchess of Popoli from the hands of some drunken Germans,
 who robbed and abused her. Conceive the surprise, grief, rage, and
 tears, of our friend Freind, on learning that John was confined in the
 dungeons of the holy inquisition, and condemned to the stake. You know
 that cold temperaments are frequently most energetic when great events
 call them into action. You should have seen this distracted father, whom
 you were accustomed to think imperturbable, fly to the dungeon of his
 son more rapidly than the horses at Newmarket hasten to the goal. The
 fifty soldiers who went with him were soon out of breath, and always a
 hundred paces behind. At length he reached the cell and entered it. What
 a scene! what tears! what joy! Twenty victims, devoted to the same
 ceremony, are delivered. All the prisoners take arms and fight with our
 soldiers. The buildings of the holy office are destroyed in ten minutes,
 and they breakfasted beside the ruins, on the wine and ham of the
 inquisitors.
 
 [Illustration: Condemned by the Inquisition.--He was confined to a very
 damp cellar, and sentenced to be burnt the following Sunday, in full
 ceremony, clothed in a San-bénito, wearing a sugar-loaf cap, in honor of
 our Savior and the Virgin Mary, his mother.]
 
 In the midst of the roar of cannon, the sound of trumpets and drums,
 announcing our victory to Catalonia, our friend Freind recovered his
 accustomed tranquillity of manner. He was as calm as the sky after a day
 of storm. He was raising to God a heart as serene as his countenance,
 when he perceived a black spectral figure, clad in a surplice, issue
 from a vault, and fall at his feet, crying for mercy.
 
 "Who are you?" said our friend. "Do you come from Hades?"
 
 "Almost," rejoined the other. "I am Don Jeronimo Bueno Caracucarador,
 inquisitor. I solicit most humbly your forgiveness for wishing to roast
 your son in public. I took him for a Jew."
 
 "Supposing that to be the case," said our friend with his customary sang
 froid, "does it become you, Señor Caracucarador, to roast people alive
 because they are descended from a sect that formerly inhabited a rocky
 canton near the Syrian desert? What does it matter to you whether a man
 is circumcised or not? that he observe Easter at the full of the moon,
 or on the following Sunday? It is very bad reasoning to say, 'That man
 is a Jew; therefore I must have him burnt, and take his property.' The
 Royal Society of London do not reason in that way.
 
 "Do you know, Señor Caracucarador, that Jesus Christ was a Jew--that he
 was born, lived, and died a Jew? that he observed the passover like a
 Jew, at the full of the moon? that all his apostles were Jews? that they
 went to the temple after his death, as we are expressly told? that the
 first fifteen secret bishops of Jerusalem were Jews? But my son is no
 Jew; he belongs to the established church. How came it into your head to
 burn him alive?"
 
 The inquisitor, overawed by the learning of Monsieur Freind, and still
 prostrate at his feet, replied:
 
 "Alas! sir, we know nothing about this at the University of Salamanca.
 Forgive me, once more. The true reason is, your son took from me my
 favorite, Donna Boca Vermeja."
 
 "Ah! if he took your favorite, that's another thing. We should never
 take 'our neighbor's goods.' That is not, however, a sufficient reason
 for burning a young man to death. As Leibnitz says, 'The punishment
 should be in proportion to the crime.' You Christians on the other side
 of the British Channel, especially toward the South, make no more of
 roasting each other, be it the Counsellor Dubourg, M. Servetus, or those
 who were burned in the reign of Philippe II., surnamed El Discreto, than
 we do of roasting a joint of beef in London. But bring Miss Boca Vermeja
 before me, that I may learn the truth from her own mouth."
 
 Boca Vermeja appeared weeping, looking the handsomer for her tears, as
 women generally do.
 
 "Is it true, Miss, that you are devotedly attached to M. Caracucarador,
 and that my son has abducted you?"
 
 "Abducted me? The English gentleman! I never met with any one so amiable
 and good-looking as your son. You are very fortunate in being his
 father. I could follow him to the world's end. I always hated that ugly
 inquisitor, who whipped me and Mademoiselle Las Nalgas till he nearly
 brought blood. If you wish to make me happy, you will cause the old
 fellow to be hanged at my bedroom window."
 
 Just as Boca Vermeja was thus speaking, the Earl of Peterborough sent
 for the inquisitor Caracucarador, to have him hanged. You will not be
 surprised to hear that Mr. Freind firmly opposed this measure.
 
 "Let your just displeasure," said he, "give way to generous feelings. A
 man should never be put to death but when it is absolutely necessary for
 the safety of others. The Spaniards say the English are barbarians, who
 kill all the priests that come in their way. This might have injured the
 cause of the arch-duke, for whom you have taken Barcelona. I have
 sufficient satisfaction in rescuing my son, and putting it out of the
 power of this rascally monk to exercise his inquisitorial functions."
 
 In a word, the wise and charitable Freind was contented with getting
 Caracucarador flogged, as he had whipped Miss Boca Vermeja and Miss Las
 Nalgas.
 
 Such clemency affected the Catalonians. The persons rescued from the
 inquisition felt that our religion was better than theirs. Nearly all
 requested to be admitted members of the established church; even some
 bachelors of the University of Salamanca, who chanced to be at
 Barcelona, requested instruction. The greater part soon became
 enlightened, with the exception of a certain Don Inigo-y-Medroso,
 y-Comodios, y-Papalamiendos, who obstinately adhered to his opinions.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER III.
 
 SUMMARY OF THE CONTROVERSY OF THE "BUTS," BETWEEN MR. FREIND AND DON
 INIGO-Y-MEDROSO, Y-COMODIOS, Y-PAPALAMIENDOS, BACHELOR OF SALAMANCA.
 
 
 The following is a summary of the pleasant disputation, which our dear
 friend Freind and the Bachelor Don Papalamiendos held, in the presence
 of the Earl of Peterborough. This familiar conversation was called the
 dialogue of the "Buts." As you read it you will discover why.
 
 THE BACHELOR.--But, sir, notwithstanding all the fine things you have
 said, you must admit that your respectable established church did not
 exist before the time of Don Luther and Don Ecolampade; consequently, it
 is quite new, and can hardly be said to belong to the family.
 
 FREIND.--You might as well say I am not a descendant of my grandfather,
 because another branch of the family, living in Italy, seized on his
 will, and my claims. I have fortunately found them again; and it is now
 quite clear that I am my grandfather's grandson. You and I are, as it
 were, of the same family; but with this difference. We read our
 grandfather's testament in our mother tongue, while you are forbidden to
 read it in yours. You are the slaves of a foreigner; we listen to the
 dictates of reason.
 
 THE BACHELOR.--But suppose your reason should lead you astray? For, in a
 word, you have no faith in our University of Salamanca, which has
 declared the infallibility of the pope, and his indisputable control of
 the past, the present, the future, and the paulo-post-future.
 
 FREIND.--Neither did the apostles. It is written that Peter, who denied
 his master Jesus, was severely rebuked by Paul. I have not examined the
 case to see which was in the wrong; perhaps, as is the case in most
 disputes, neither was right; but I do not find one passage in the Acts
 of the Apostles to prove that Peter was considered the master of his
 companions, and of the paulo-post-future.
 
 THE BACHELOR.--But St. Peter was certainly archbishop of Rome; for
 Sanchez tells us that this great man came there in the reign of Nero,
 and filled the archbishop's throne twenty-five years under the same
 Nero, who only reigned thirteen. Besides, it is a matter of faith, and
 Don Gullandus, the prototype of the inquisition, affirms it (for we
 never read the Holy Bible), that St. Peter was at Rome during a certain
 year, for he dates one of his letters from Babylon. Now, since Babylon
 is visibly the anagram of Rome, it is clear that the pope by divine
 right is lord of the world; moreover, all the licentiates of Salamanca
 have shown that Simon Grace-of-God, first sorcerer and counsellor of
 state at the court of Nero, sent his compliments by his dog to Simon
 Barjona, otherwise called St. Peter, as soon as he came to Rome; that
 St. Peter, who was scarcely less polite, sent also his dog to compliment
 Simon Grace-of-God; and then they diverted themselves by trying which
 could soonest raise from the dead a cousin german of Nero's; that
 Grace-of-God only succeeded in effecting a partial restoration, while
 Barjona won the game by wholly restoring the dead man to life; that
 Grace-of-God sought to have his revenge by flying through the air like
 Saint Dædalus; and that Barjona broke his legs, by making him fall. On
 this account St. Peter received the Martyr's crown, being crucified with
 his heels upward. Therefore we have proved that his holiness the pope
 ought to reign over all who wear crowns; that he is lord of the past,
 the present, and of all the futures in the world.
 
 FREIND.--It is clear these things happened in the days when Hercules
 separated at a stroke the two mountains Calpe and Abyla, and crossed the
 straits of Gibraltar in his goblet. But it is not on such histories,
 however authentic they may be, that we base our religion. We found it on
 the gospel.
 
 THE BACHELOR.--But, sir, on what passages of the gospel? I have read a
 portion of the gospel in our theological tracts. Do you base it on the
 descent of the angel to announce to the Virgin Mary that she had
 conceived by the Holy Ghost? On the journey of the three kings after the
 star? On the massacre of all the children of the country? On the trouble
 the devil took to carry God into the wilderness, to place him on a
 pinnacle of the temple, and on the summit of a mountain from whence he
 beheld all the kingdoms of the world? On the miracle of water changed
 into wine at a village wedding? On the miracle of two thousand pigs
 drowned by the devil in a lake at the command of Jesus? On--?
 
 FREIND.--Sir, we respect these things because they are in the gospel;
 but we never speak of them, because they are too far above our weak
 human reason.
 
 THE BACHELOR.--But they say you never call the Holy Virgin, Mother of
 God?
 
 FREIND.--We revere and cherish her. But we think she cares very little
 for the titles given her in this world. She is never styled the Mother
 of God in the gospel. In the year 431, there was a great dispute at the
 council of Ephesus to ascertain if Mary was Theotocos; and if Jesus
 Christ, being at the same time God and the son of Mary, Mary could be at
 the same time mother of God the Father and God the Son. We do not enter
 into these disputes of Ephesus. The Royal Society at London does not
 concern itself with such controversies.
 
 THE BACHELOR.--But, sir, you talk of Theotocos. What may Theotocos mean,
 if you please?
 
 FREIND.--It means Mother of God. What, are you a Bachelor of Salamanca,
 and don't understand Greek?
 
 THE BACHELOR.--But Greek! Of what use can Greek be to a Spaniard? But,
 sir, do you believe that Jesus Christ has one nature, one person, and
 one will; or two natures, two persons, and two wills; or, one will, one
 nature, and two persons; or, two wills, two persons and one nature;
 or,--?
 
 FREIND.--This, also, belongs to the Ephesian controversy and does not
 concern us.
 
 THE BACHELOR.--But what does concern you, then? Do you suppose there are
 only three persons in God, or that there are three Gods in one person?
 Does the second person proceed from the first person, and the third from
 the two others, or from the second _intrinsecus_, or only from the
 first? Has the father all the attributes of the son except paternity?
 And does the third person proceed by infusion, by identification, or by
 spiration?
 
 FREIND.--This question is not mooted in the gospel. St. Paul never wrote
 the name of the Trinity.
 
 THE BACHELOR.--But, you always refer to the gospel, and never make
 mention of St. Bonaventura, of Albert the Great, of Tambourini, of
 Gullandus, of Escobar.
 
 FREIND.--Because I do not call myself a Dominican, a Franciscan, or a
 Jesuit. I am satisfied with being a Christian.
 
 THE BACHELOR.--But if you are a Christian, tell me if you
 conscientiously think the rest of mankind will be damned?
 
 FREIND.--It does not become me to limit the compassion or the justice of
 God.
 
 THE BACHELOR.--But to come to the point, if you are a Christian, what do
 you believe?
 
 FREIND.--I believe with Jesus Christ that we ought to love God and our
 neighbor, forgive our enemies, and do good for evil. These are the
 maxims of Jesus. So true are they, that no legislator, no philosopher,
 ever had other principles before him, and it is impossible that there
 can be any other. These truths never have and never can meet with
 contradiction, save from our passions.
 
 THE BACHELOR.--But, in regard to the passions, is it true that your
 bishops, priests, and deacons are all married?
 
 FREIND.--Quite true. St. Joseph, who passed for the father of Jesus, was
 married. James the Less, surnamed Oblia, brother of our Lord, was his
 son, who, after the death of Jesus, spent his life in the temple. St.
 Paul--the great St. Paul--was a married man.
 
 THE BACHELOR.--But Grillandus and Molina assert the contrary.
 
 FREIND.--Let them say what they please, I prefer believing St. Paul
 himself on the subject. In _I. Corinthians, ix: 4-7._ he says: "Have we
 not power to eat and to drink? Have we not power to lead about a sister,
 a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the lord, and
 Cephas. Or I only and Barnabas, have we not power to forbear working?
 Who goeth a warfare at any time at his own charges? Who planteth a
 vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof?"
 
 THE BACHELOR.--But, sir, did St. Paul really say that?
 
 FREIND.--Yes, he said that and very much more.
 
 THE BACHELOR.--But, really, that prodigy of the efficacy of grace?--
 
 FREIND.--It is true, sir, that his conversion was a great miracle. I
 admit, from the _Acts of the Apostles_, that he was the most cruel
 satellite of the enemies of Jesus. The _Acts_ say that he assisted at
 the stoning of Stephen. He admits himself, that when the Jews condemned
 to death a follower of Christ, he would see to the execution of the
 sentence, "detuli sententiam", I admit that Abdia, his disciple, and the
 translator Julius, the African, accused him of putting to death James
 Oblia, the brother of our Lord; but his persecutions increase the wonder
 of his conversion, and by no means prevented his having a wife. I assure
 you he was married. St. Clement of Alexandria expressly declares it.
 
 THE BACHELOR.--But St. Paul, then, was a worthy man of God! Really, I am
 grieved to think he assassinated St. Stephen, and St. James, and am
 surprised to find he traveled to the third heaven. But pray continue.
 
 FREIND.--We gather from St. Clement of Alexandria that St. Peter had
 children; one St. Petronilla is mentioned among them. Eusebius, in his
 _History of the Church_ says that St. Nicolas, one of the first
 disciples, had a very handsome wife; and that the disciples blamed him
 for being over-fond and jealous. "Sirs," said he, "let any one take her
 who likes; I give her to you."
 
 In the Jewish economy, which should have lasted for ever, but to which
 nevertheless the Christian dispensation succeeded, marriage was not only
 permitted, but expressly enjoined on priests, since they were always of
 the same race. Celibacy was considered infamous.
 
 It is certain that celibacy could not have been considered a very pure
 and honorable state by the first Christians, since we find among the
 bishops excommunicated by the first councils, chiefly those who oppose
 the marriage of priests; such as Saturnians, Basilidians, Montanists,
 Encrasists, and other ans and ists. This accounts for the wife of
 Gregory of Nazianze bearing another Gregory of Nazianze, and enjoying
 the inestimable felicity of being at one and the same time the wife and
 mother of a canonized saint,--a privilege which even St. Monica, the
 mother of St. Augustin, did not enjoy.
 
 By the same reason I might name as many and even more of the ancient
 bishops who were married, and account for your not having had in the
 earlier ages of the church bishops and popes who indulged in
 fornication, adultery, and even worse crimes. Things are not so now.
 This is also the reason why the Greek church, the mother of the Latin
 church, allows priests to marry. In a word, the reason why I myself am
 married, and have a son, as fine a fellow as you can wish to see.
 
 Besides, my dear bachelor, have you not in your church seven sacraments
 which are outward signs of things invisible? Does not a bachelor of
 Salamanca enjoy the advantage of baptism as soon as he comes into the
 world; of confirmation as soon as he has committed a few follies or
 understands those of others; of communion, though a little different
 from ours, when he is fourteen years of age; of holy orders, when they
 shave the crown of his head and give him a living of twenty, thirty, or
 forty thousand piastres; and lastly of extreme unction, when he is ill?
 Must he then be deprived of the sacrament of marriage, when he is in
 health? Especially when God united Adam and Eve in marriage: Adam, the
 first bachelor in the world, since, according to your schools, he had
 knowledge by infusion; Eve, the first _female_ bachelor, since she
 tasted the tree of knowledge before her husband.
 
 THE BACHELOR.--But, if things are so, I may cease my "Buts." This is
 certain, I adopt your religion; I will belong to the established church
 of England; will marry an honest woman, who at least will pretend to
 love me while I am young, take care of me when I grow old, and whom I
 will bury decently, should I survive her. I think this is better than
 roasting men and enticing girls after the fashion of my cousin Don
 Caracucarador, the inquisitor of the faith.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 This is a faithful summary of the conversation between Mr. Freind and
 the Bachelor Don Papalamiendos, since called by us Papa Dexando. This
 curious dialogue was drawn up by Jacob Hull, one of my lord's
 secretaries.
 
 After this conversation the Bachelor took me aside and said:
 
 "This Englishman, whom I took at first for an anthropagus, must be a
 very good man; for he is a theologian and can keep his temper."
 
 I informed him that Mr. Freind was tolerant, or a quaker, and a
 descendant of the daughter of William Penn, who founded Philadelphia.
 "Quaker, Philadelphia," he cried, "I never heard of those sects."
 
 I gave him some information on the subject. He could scarcely believe
 me. It seemed to him like another universe. And, indeed, he was in the
 right.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER IV.
 
 JOHN RETURNS TO LONDON, AND IS LED INTO BAD COMPANY.
 
 
 While our worthy philosopher Freind was enlightening the priests of
 Barcelona, and his son John delighting the ladies, Lord Peterborough
 lost all favor with the queen and arch-duke for seizing Barcelona for
 them. The courtiers censured him for taking the city contrary to all
 rule, with an army less strong by half than the garrison. At first the
 arch-duke was highly incensed; and our friend was obliged to print an
 apology for the general. Yet this arch-duke, who had come to conquer
 Spain, had not the worth of his chocolate. All Queen Anne had given him
 was squandered.
 
 Montecuculi, in his _Memoirs_, says three things are necessary to
 maintain a war; 1st, money, 2nd, money, and 3rd, money. The arch-duke
 wrote from Guadalaxara, where he was on the 11th of August, 1706, to
 Lord Peterborough, a long letter signed "Yo el Rey," in which he begged
 him to hasten to Genoa and raise on credit £100,000. So our Sartorius,
 from general of an army, thus became a Genoese banker. He communicated
 his distress to our friend Freind. They started for Genoa. I went with
 them, for you know my heart leads me thither. I admired the skill and
 spirit of conciliation my friend displayed in this delicate business. I
 saw at once that intelligence may meet every exigency. Our great Locke
 was a physician; he became the first metaphysician in Europe, and
 restored the value of the British coinage. In three days Freind raised
 the £100,000; but the court of Charles the VI. contrived to squander it
 in three weeks. After this, the general, accompanied by his theologian,
 was obliged to repair to London to justify himself before the parliament
 for conquering Catalonia against all rule, and for ruining himself in
 the common cause. The affair was protracted and vexatious, as are all
 party disputes.
 
 You know that Mr. Freind was a member of parliament before he became a
 priest; and he is the only person who has been allowed to combine
 functions so opposed. One day, when Freind was thinking over a speech he
 intended to deliver in the house (of which he was a most respectable
 member), a Spanish lady was announced as desirous of seeing him on
 particular business. It was Donna Boca Vermeja herself, and in tears.
 Our good friend ordered a luncheon. She took some refreshment, dried her
 eyes, and thus began:
 
 "You will remember, sir, when you went to Genoa, you ordered your son
 John to leave Barcelona for London, and to commence his duties as a
 clerk in the exchequer, a post which your influence had obtained for
 him. He embarked in the Triton with a young bachelor of arts, Don Papa
 Dexando, and others whom you had converted. You may well suppose that I,
 with my dear friend Las Nalgas, accompanied them."
 
 Boca Vermeja then told him, again shedding tears, how John was jealous,
 or affected to be jealous, of the bachelor,--how a certain Madame
 Clive-Hart, a very bold, spiteful, masculine, young married lady, had
 enslaved his mind,--how he lived with libertines who had no fear of
 God,--how, in a word, he neglected Boca Vermeja for the artful
 Clive-Hart; and all because Clive-Hart had a little more red and white
 in her complexion than poor Boca Vermeja.
 
 "I will look into the matter at leisure," said the worthy Mr. Freind. "I
 must now attend parliament, to look after Lord Peterborough's business."
 
 Accordingly, to parliament he went; where I heard him deliver a firm and
 concise discourse, free from commonplace epithets, and circumlocutions.
 He never _invoked_ a law or a testimony. He quoted, enforced, and
 applied them. He did not say they had taken the religion of the court by
 surprise, by accusing lord Peterborough of exposing Queen Anne's troops
 to risk; because it had nothing to do with religion. He did not call a
 conjecture a demonstration, nor forget his respect to an august
 parliament, by using common jokes. He did not call Lord Peterborough his
 client, because client signifies a plebian protected by a senator.
 Freind spoke with confidence and modesty; he was listened to in silence,
 only disturbed by cries of "Hear him, hear him."
 
 The House of Commons passed a vote of thanks to Earl Peterborough,
 instead of condemning him. His lordship obtained the same justice from
 the House of Peers, and prepared to set out with his dear Freind to
 deliver the kingdom of Spain to the arch-duke. This did not take place,
 solely because things do not always turn out as we wish them to.
 
 On leaving the house, our first care was to enquire after the health of
 John. We learnt that he was leading a dissipated and debauched life with
 Mrs. Clive-Hart, and a party of young men,--intelligent,--but atheists,
 who believed:
 
 "That man is in no respect superior to the brutes;--that he lives and
 dies as they do;--that both spring from and both return to the
 earth;--that wisdom and virtue consist in enjoyment and in living with
 those we love, as Solomon says at the end of the 'Coheleth,' which we
 call 'Ecclesiastes.'"
 
 These sentiments were chiefly advanced among them by one Warburton,[1] a
 very forward licentious fellow. I have glanced at some of the poor
 author's MSS., which heaven grant may not one day be printed. Warburton
 pretends that Moses did not believe in the immortality of the soul,
 because he never speaks of it, and considers that to be the only proof
 of his divine mission. This absurd conclusion leads to the supposition
 that the religion of the Jews is false. Infidels thence argue that ours,
 being founded thereon, is false also; and _ours_, which is the best of
 all, being false, all others are, if possible, still more false:
 therefore there is no religion. Hence some conclude that there is no
 God. Let us add to these conclusions, that this little Warburton is an
 intriguing, slandering fellow. See what peril!
 
 But worse than all, John was head over ears in debt, and had a strange
 way of paying. One of his creditors came to him with a claim for a
 hundred guineas, while we were in the house. John, who always appeared
 polite and gentle, fought his creditor, and paid him with a sword-wound.
 It was apprehended the wounded man would die; and John, notwithstanding
 lord Peterborough's protection, ran the risk of imprisonment and
 hanging.
 
 
 [1] In 1737 Bishop Warburton published his famous work, _The Divine
 Legation of Moses_, in which he asserted, "that the doctrine of a future
 state of reward and punishment was omitted in the books of Moses," and
 then proceeded to demonstrate "from that very omission, that a system
 which could dispense with a doctrine, the very bond and cement of human
 society, must have come from God, and that the people to whom it was
 given must have been placed under His immediate superintendence." In
 other words, the divine origin of the Mosaic "system" is demonstrated,
 because Moses did not teach to the chosen people the doctrine of a
 future life beyond the grave. Voltaire clearly saw the fallacy of this
 fantastic argument, and has not failed to severely satirize the right
 reverend author.
 
 Robert Carruthers, Esq., in his _Life of Alexander Pope_ styles Bishop
 Warburton "a learned, turbulent, ambitious adventurer"--"an
 indefatigable and unscrupulous divine," and says of _The Divine Legation
 of Moses_, that it was "so learned, so novel, so paradoxical, so
 arrogant and absurd, that it took the world as it were by storm, and
 challenged universal attention."
 
 Dr. Johnson says that Warburton's "diction is coarse and impure, and his
 sentences are unmeasured;" and a writer in the seventh volume of the
 _Quarterly Review_ (as quoted by George Godfrey Cuningham, Esq., in his
 _Lives of Eminent and illustrious Englishmen_) says: "the rudeness and
 vulgarity of his manners as a controvertist, removed all restraints of
 decency or decorum in scattering his jests about him. His taste seems to
 have been neither just nor delicate." He combined "the powers of a giant
 with the temper of a ruffian."
 
 Gibbon, in his _History of Christianity_, pointedly alludes to the
 author of _The Divine Legation of Moses_, and satirically styles the
 omission of the doctrine of immortality from the law of Moses, as "a
 mysterious dispensation of providence." "The real merit of Warburton,"
 he says, "was degraded by the pride and presumption with which he
 pronounced his infallible decrees."--E.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER V.
 
 THEY WANT TO GET JOHN MARRIED.
 
 
 You remember the anguish of the venerable Freind when he learned that
 John was in the prison of the inquisition at Barcelona. Imagine his rage
 when he learned of the debauchery and dissipation of the unfortunate
 lad, his way of paying debts, and his danger of getting hanged! Yet
 Freind restrained himself. This excellent man's self-command is really
 astonishing. His reason regulates his heart, as a good master rules his
 servants. He does every thing reasonably, and judges wisely with as much
 celerity as hasty people act rashly.
 
 "This is no time to lecture John," said he. "We must snatch him from the
 precipice."
 
 You must know that the day previously, our friend had come into a
 handsome sum, left him by George Hubert, his uncle. He went himself in
 search of our great surgeon, Cheselden. We found him at home, and then
 proceeded together to the wounded creditor. The wound was inspected. It
 was not dangerous. Freind gave the sufferer a hundred guineas as a first
 step, and fifty others by way of reparation, and then asked forgiveness
 for his son. Indeed, he expressed his regret so touchingly, that the
 poor man embraced him, and, weeping, wished to return the money.
 
 This sight moved and surprised young Mr. Cheselden, whose reputation is
 becoming very great, and whose heart is as kind as his hand is skillful.
 
 I was carried beyond myself; never had I admired and loved our friend so
 much.
 
 On returning home, I asked him if he did not intend to send for his son,
 and to admonish him.
 
 "No," said he. "Let him feel his faults before I speak of them. Let us
 sup together to-night. We will see what in honesty I ought to do.
 Examples correct better than reprimands."
 
 While waiting for supper, I called on John. I found him in the state
 which all men experience after their first crime,--that is, pale, with
 sunken eyes and hoarse voice,--absent, and answering at random when
 spoken to.
 
 I told him what his father had just done.
 
 He looked at me steadily, then turned away to dash a tear from his eye.
 I argued well from this, and began to hope that John would yet prove a
 worthy man. I felt ready to clasp him in my arms, when Madame Clive-Hart
 came in, accompanied by a wild fellow, called Birton.
 
 "Well," said the lady, laughing, "have you really killed a man to-day?
 Some tiresome fellow. 'Tis well to rid the world of such people. When
 you are next in the killing mood, pray think of my husband. He plagues
 me to death."
 
 I surveyed this woman from head to foot. She was handsome, but there was
 something sinister in her countenance. John dared not reply, and,
 confused by my presence, looked downward.
 
 "What's the matter?" said Birton. "You look as if you had done something
 wrong. I come to give you absolution. Here is a little book I have just
 bought at Lintot's. It proves as clearly as two and two make four, that
 there is neither God, nor vice, nor virtue,--a very consoling fact! So,
 let us drink together."
 
 On hearing this singular discourse, I withdrew quickly, and represented
 to Mr. Freind how much his son required his advice.
 
 "I see it as clearly as you do," said this kind father; "but let us
 begin by paying his debts."
 
 They were all discharged the next day. John came and threw himself at
 his father's feet. Will you believe it? The father made no reproaches.
 He left him to conscience; only observing, "Remember, my son, there is
 no happiness apart from virtue."
 
 Mr. Freind then saw that the bachelor married Boca Vermeja, who really
 loved him, notwithstanding her tears for John. Women know how to confuse
 such feelings wonderfully. One would almost say that their hearts are a
 bundle of contradictions, perhaps because they were originally formed
 from one of our ribs.
 
 Our generous Freind gave her also a dowry, and took care to secure
 places for his converts. It is not enough to take care of people's
 souls, if we neglect to provide for their present wants.
 
 After performing these good actions, with his astonishing _sang froid_,
 he concluded he had nothing more to do to restore his son to virtue,
 than to marry him to a young person of beauty, virtue, talents, and some
 wealth. This, indeed, was the only way to wean him from the detestable
 Clive-Hart, and others, whom he frequented.
 
 I had heard speak of a Miss Primerose, a young heiress, brought up by
 her relative, Lady Hervey. The Earl of Peterborough introduced me to
 Lady Hervey. I saw Miss Primerose, and considered her a proper person to
 fulfill the wishes of my friend. John, in the midst of his dissipation,
 had great reverence and even affection for his father. He was chiefly
 affected that his father had never blamed him for his follies. Debts
 paid without informing him; wise counsels seasonably given, and without
 reprimand; proofs of friendship given from time to time, yet free from
 the familiarity which might depreciate them. All this went to John's
 heart, for he was both intelligent and sensitive.
 
 Lord Peterborough introduced the father and son to Lady Hervey. I
 perceived that the extreme beauty of John soon made a favorable
 impression on Miss Primerose; for I saw her look stealthily at him and
 blush. John seemed only polite; and Primerose admitted to Lady Hervey
 that she wished his politeness might become love.
 
 The young man soon discovered the worth of this charming girl, though he
 was the complete slave of Clive-Hart. He was like the Indian invited to
 gather celestial fruit, but restrained by the claws of a dragon.
 
 But here the recollection of what I witnessed overwhelms me. Tears
 moisten my paper. When I recover, I will resume my tale.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER VI.
 
 A TERRIBLE ADVENTURE.
 
 
 The marriage of John and the lovely Primerose was about to be
 celebrated. Freind never felt more joy. I shared it. But the occasion
 was changed into one of deep sorrow and suffering.
 
 Clive-Hart loved John, though constantly faithless. They say this is the
 lot of those women who, violating modesty, renounce their honor.
 Especially she deceived John for her dear Birton and for another of the
 same school. They lived together in debauch; and, what is perhaps
 peculiar to our nation, they had all of them sense and worth.
 Unfortunately, they employed their sense against God. Madame
 Clive-Hart's house was a rendezvous for atheists. Well for them had they
 been such atheists as Epicurus, Leontium, Lucretius, Memmius, and
 Spinoza,--the most upright man of Holland,--or Hobbes, so faithful to
 his unfortunate king, Charles I.
 
 But however it may be, Clive-Hart, jealous of the pure and gentle
 Primerose, could not endure the marriage. She devised a vengeance, which
 I conceive to be unsurpassed even in London, where I believe our fathers
 have witnessed crimes of every kind. She learned that Miss Primerose,
 returning from shopping, would pass by her door. She took advantage of
 the opportunity, and had a sewer opened, communicating with her
 premises.
 
 Miss Primerose's carriage, on its return, was obliged to draw up at this
 obstruction. Clive-Hart goes out, and entreats her to alight and take
 some refreshment, while the passage is being cleared. This invitation
 made Miss Primerose hesitate; but she perceived John standing in the
 hall, and, yielding to an impulse stronger than her discretion, she got
 out. John offered her his hand. She enters. Clive-Hart's husband was a
 silly drunkard, as hateful to his wife as he was submissive and
 troublesome by his civility. He presents refreshments to the young lady,
 and drinks after her. Mrs. Clive-Hart takes them away instantly and
 brings others. By this time the street is cleared. Miss Primerose enters
 her carriage, and drives to her mother's.
 
 She soon falls sick, and complains of giddiness. They suppose it is
 occasioned by the motion of the carriage. But the illness increased, and
 the next day she was dying.
 
 Mr. Freind and I hastened to the house. We found the lovely creature
 pale and livid, a prey to convulsions,--her lips open, her eyes glazed,
 and always staring. Black spots disfigured her face and throat. Her
 mother had fainted on her bed. Cheselden employed in vain all the
 resources of his art. I will not attempt to describe Freind's anguish.
 It was intense. I hurried to Clive-Hart's house, and found that the
 husband was just dead, and that the wife had fled.
 
 I sought John. He could not be found. A servant told me that his
 mistress had besought him not to leave her in her misfortune, and that
 they had gone off together, accompanied by Birton, no one knew whither.
 
 Overcome by these rapid and numerous shocks, terrified at the frightful
 suspicions which haunted me, I hastened to the dying lady.
 
 "Yet," said I to myself, "if this abominable woman threw herself on
 John's generosity, it does not follow that he is an accomplice. John is
 incapable of so horrible and cowardly a crime, which he had no interest
 in committing, which deprives him of a charming wife, and renders him
 odious to the human race. Weak, he has allowed himself to be drawn away
 by a wretch, of whose crime he was ignorant. He did not see, as I have
 done, Primerose dying; he never would have deserted her pillow to
 accompany the poisoner of his bride. Oppressed by these thoughts, I
 entered, shuddering, the room which I expected contained a corpse."
 
 She was still living. Old Clive-Hart died soon, because his constitution
 was worn out by debauchery; but young Primerose was sustained by a
 temperament as robust as her blood was pure. She saw me, and enquired,
 in a tender tone, after John. A flood of tears gushed from my eyes. I
 could not reply. I was unable to speak to the father. I was obliged to
 leave her to the faithful hands that served her.
 
 We went to inform his lordship of this disaster. He is as kind to his
 friends as terrible to his foes. Never was there a more compassionate
 man with so stern a countenance. He took as much pains to assist the
 dying lady, and to overtake the abandoned woman, and discover John, as
 he had done to give Spain to the arch-duke. But all our search proved in
 vain. I thought it would kill Freind. Now we flew to the residence of
 Miss Primerose, whose dying was protracted, now to Rochester, Dover,
 Portsmouth. Couriers were dispatched every where. We wandered about at
 random, like dogs that have lost the scent;--while the unfortunate
 mother expected hourly the death of her child.
 
 At length we learned that a handsome lady, accompanied by three young
 men and some servants, had embarked at Newport, in Monmouthshire, in a
 little smuggling vessel that was in the roads, and had sailed for North
 America.
 
 Freind sighed deeply at this intelligence, then suddenly recovering
 himself, and pressing my hand, he said:
 
 "I must go to America."
 
 I replied, weeping with admiration: "I will not leave you. But what can
 you do?"
 
 "Restore my only son," said he, "to virtue and his country, or bury
 myself with him."
 
 Indeed, from our information, we could not doubt but he had fled thither
 with that horrible woman, Birton, and the other villains of the party.
 
 The good father took leave of Lord Peterborough, who returned soon after
 to Catalonia; and we went to Bristol and freighted a ship for the
 Delaware and the bay of Maryland.
 
 Freind, knowing these coasts to be in the heart of the English
 possessions, thought it right to go thither, whether his son had sought
 concealment in the North or South.
 
 He supplied himself with money, letters of credit, and provisions, and
 left a confidential servant in London, to write to him by ships that
 were leaving every week for Maryland or Pennsylvania.
 
 We started. The crew, judging from the placid countenance of my friend,
 thought we were on an excursion of pleasure. But when he was alone with
 me, his sighs expressed the depth of his anguish. At times I
 congratulated myself on the happiness of consoling such a noble mind.
 
 A west wind kept us a long time about the Sorlingues. We were obliged to
 steer for New England. What enquiries we made on every coast! What time
 and toil were thrown away! At length a northeast wind arising, we
 steered for Maryland. There, it was said, John and his companions had
 taken refuge.
 
 The fugitives had sojourned on the coast more than a month, and had
 astonished the whole colony by indulgences in luxury and debauch, till
 then unknown in that part of the world. Then they disappeared; no one
 knew whither.
 
 We advanced into the bay, intending to go to Baltimore for fresh
 information.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER VII.
 
 WHAT HAPPENED IN AMERICA.
 
 
 On the way we found, to the right, a very handsome house. It was low,
 but convenient and neat, placed between a spacious barn and a large
 stable; the whole enclosed by a garden, well stocked with fruits of the
 country. It belonged to an old man, who invited us to alight at his
 retreat. He did not look like an Englishman; his accent showed us he was
 a foreigner. We anchored and went on shore. The old man welcomed us
 cordially, and gave us the best cheer to be had in the New World.
 
 We discreetly insinuated our wish to know to whom we were indebted for
 so kind a reception.
 
 "I am," said he, "of the race you call savages. I was born on the Blue
 Mountains, which bound this country in the west. In my childhood I was
 bitten by a rattlesnake, and abandoned. I was on the point of death. The
 father of the present Lord Baltimore, falling in with me, confided me to
 his physician; and to him I owe my life. I soon discharged the debt; for
 I have saved his in a skirmish with the neighboring tribes. He gave me,
 in return, this habitation."
 
 Mr. Freind enquired if he was of Lord Baltimore's religion?
 
 "How," said he, "would you have me profess another man's religion? I
 have my own."
 
 This short and energetic answer made us reflect a little.
 
 "You have, then," said I, "your own law and your own God?"
 
 "Yes," he replied, with an assurance wholly free from pride. "My God is
 there," and he pointed to heaven. "My law is here," and he put his hand
 on his breast.
 
 My friend was struck with admiration, and, pressing my hand, he said:
 
 "This simple nature reasons more wisely than all the bachelors with whom
 we conversed at Barcelona."
 
 He was anxious to know if he could gain any information respecting his
 son John. It was a weight that oppressed him. He enquired if his host
 had heard speak of some young people, who had made a great noise in the
 neighborhood.
 
 "Indeed I have," said he, "I received them in my house; and they were so
 satisfied with the reception I gave them, that they have carried away
 one of my daughters."
 
 Judge of my friend's distress at this intelligence. In his emotion, he
 could not avoid exclaiming:
 
 "What! Has my son run away with your daughter?"
 
 "Good Englishman," said the host, "do not let that grieve you. I am glad
 to find he is your son. He is handsome, well made, and seems courageous.
 He did not run away with my dear Parouba; for you must know that Parouba
 is her name, because it is mine. Had he taken off Parouba, it would have
 been a robbery; and my five sons, who are now hunting some forty or
 fifty miles from here, would not have endured such an affront. It is a
 great sin to thieve. My daughter went of her own accord with these young
 people. She has gone to see the country, a pleasure one cannot deny to
 one of her age. These travelers will bring her back to me before a month
 is passed. I am sure of it. They promised to do so."
 
 These words would have made me laugh, had not the evident distress of my
 friend severely afflicted me.
 
 In the evening, just as we were about to start to take advantage of the
 wind, one of Parouba's sons arrived out of breath, his face expressing
 horror and despair.
 
 "What is the matter, my son? I thought you were hunting far away. Are
 you wounded by some savage beast?"
 
 "No, father,--not wounded, yet in pain."
 
 "But whence do you come, son?"
 
 "From a distance of forty miles, without stopping; and I am almost
 dead."
 
 The aged father makes him sit down. They give him restoratives. Mr.
 Freind and I, his little brothers and sisters, with the servants, crowd
 around him. When he recovered his breath, he exclaimed:
 
 "Alas, my sister Parouba is a prisoner of war, and will no doubt be
 killed."
 
 The worthy Parouba was grieved at this recital. Mr. Freind, feeling for
 him as a father, was struck to the very heart. At last, the son informed
 us that a party of silly young Englishmen had attacked, for diversion,
 the people of the mountains. He said, they had with them a very
 beautiful lady and her maid; and he knew not how his sister came to be
 with them. The handsome English lady had been scalped and killed; and
 his sister captured.
 
 "I come here for aid against the people of the Blue Mountains. I will
 kill them too, and will retake my dear sister, or perish."
 
 Mr. Friend's habits of self-command supported him in this trying moment.
 
 "God has given me a son," said he. "Let him take both father and son,
 when the eternal decree shall go forth. My friend, I am tempted to think
 God sometimes acts by a special providence, since he avenges in America
 crimes committed in Europe, and since this wicked Clive-Hart died as she
 deserved. Perhaps the Sovereign of the universe does in his government
 punish even in this world crimes committed here. I dare not assert; I
 wish to think so; indeed I should believe it, were not such an opinion
 opposed to all metaphysical laws."
 
 After these sad reflections on an event common in America, Freind
 resumed his usual demeanor.
 
 "I have a good ship," said he to his host, "with abundant stores. Let us
 go up the gulf as near as we may to the Blue Mountains. My most anxious
 business now is to save your daughter. Let us go to your countrymen, say
 I bear the pipe of peace--that I am the grandson of Penn. That name
 alone will suffice."
 
 At the name of Penn, so much revered throughout North America, the
 worthy Parouba and his son felt the greatest respect and the greatest
 hope. We embarked, and in thirty-six hours reached Baltimore.
 
 We were scarcely in sight of this almost desert place, when we saw in
 the distance a numerous band of mountaineers descending to the plain,
 armed with axes, tomahawks, and those muskets which Europeans so
 foolishly sold to them, to procure skins. Already you might hear their
 frightful howlings. From another side we saw four persons approaching on
 horseback, accompanied by others on foot. We were taken for people of
 Baltimore, come there for the purpose of fighting. The horsemen galloped
 toward us, sword in hand. Our companions prepared to receive them. Mr.
 Freind, observing them steadily, shuddered for a moment; but soon
 resuming his sang-froid.
 
 "Do not stir, my friends," said he. "Leave all to me."
 
 He advanced alone and unarmed toward the party. In a moment, we saw the
 chief let fall the bridle from his horse, spring to the ground, and fall
 prostrate. We uttered a cry of surprise, and advanced. It was John
 himself, who, bathed in tears, had fallen at the feet of his father.
 Neither of them was able to speak. Birton, and the two horsemen with
 him, alighted. But Birton, in his characteristic way, said:
 
 "My dear Freind, I did not expect to see you here. You and I seem born
 for adventures. I am glad to see you."
 
 Freind, without deigning to reply, looked toward the army of
 mountaineers, now approaching us. He walked toward them, accompanied by
 Parouba, who acted as interpreter.
 
 "Fellow countrymen," said Parouba, "behold a descendant of Penn, who
 brings you the pipe of peace."
 
 At these words, the eldest of the tribe raising his hands and eyes to
 heaven, exclaimed:
 
 "A son of Penn! He is welcome! May the Penns live for ever! The great
 Penn is our Manitou, our god. He and his were the only Europeans who did
 not deceive us, and seize on our land. He bought the territory we gave
 up to him; he paid for it liberally; he maintained peace among us; he
 brought us remedies for the few diseases we had caught from the
 Europeans. He taught us new arts. We never dug up against him and
 against his children the hatchet of war. For the Penns we always
 entertain respect."
 
 Freind immediately sent for thirty hams, as many pies and fowls, with
 two hundred bottles of Pontac, from the ship. He seated himself close to
 the chief of the Blue Mountains. John and his companions assisted at the
 festival. John would rather have been a hundred feet under the earth.
 His father said nothing to him; and this silence increased his
 confusion.
 
 Birton, who cared for nothing, seemed very jovial. Freind, before he
 began to eat, said to Parouba:
 
 "One person, very dear to you, is waiting here. I mean your daughter."
 
 The chief of the Blue Mountains ordered her to be brought. She had
 suffered no injury; she smiled to her brother and father, as if she had
 only returned from a walk.
 
 I took advantage of the freedom of the meal, to enquire why the warriors
 of the Blue Mountains had put to death Madame Clive-Hart, and had done
 nothing to Parouba's daughter.
 
 "Because we are just," returned the chief. "That proud English woman
 belonged to the party that attacked us. She killed one of our men by
 firing a pistol behind him. We did nothing to Parouba, as soon as we
 ascertained that she was a daughter of our tribes, and only came here
 for diversion. Every one should be treated according to his desert."
 
 Freind was affected by this maxim, but he represented to them that the
 custom of burning captives at the stake, was degrading to worthy people;
 and that, with so much virtue, they should be less ferocious.
 
 The chief then asked us what we did with those whom we killed in battle.
 
 "We bury them."
 
 "I understand. You leave them for worms to eat. Cannibals think proper
 to give themselves the preference. Their stomachs are a more honorable
 grave."
 
 Birton supported with pleasure the opinions of the mountaineer. He said,
 the custom of boiling and roasting a neighbor must be both ancient and
 natural, since it prevailed in both hemispheres; and therefore it must
 be an innate idea;--that men were hunted before beasts, because it was
 easier to kill men than wolves;--that if the Jews, in their books, so
 long unknown, imagined that a certain Cain killed a certain Abel, it
 could only be with a view to eat him--that the same Jews admit they had
 often fed on human flesh;--that the best historians describe the Jews as
 eating the bleeding flesh of Romans, whom they massacred in Egypt,
 Cyprus, and Asia, in their revolts against the emperors Trajan and
 Adrian.
 
 We allowed him to indulge in these coarse jokes, which, though
 unfortunately true at the bottom, had neither Grecian wit nor Roman
 urbanity.
 
 Freind, without answering him, addressed the natives. Parouba
 translated, phrase by phrase. Tillotson himself never spoke with more
 force. The insinuating Smaldridge never displayed more touching graces.
 The great secret of eloquence is to convince. He proved to them,
 accordingly, that the execrable custom of burning captives, inspired a
 ferocity destructive to the human race; for this reason, they were
 strangers to the comforts of society and the tillage of the ground.
 
 At last, they all swore by their great Manitou, that they would not burn
 men and women again.
 
 Thus, from a single conversation, Freind became their legislator, like
 an Orpheus taming tigers. In vain may the Jesuits describe their
 miracles in letters which are rarely curious or edifying; they can never
 equal our good friend.
 
 After loading the chiefs of the Blue Mountains with presents, he
 conducted the worthy Parouba back to his residence. Young Parouba, with
 his sister, accompanied us. The others went hunting in the distant
 forest.
 
 John, Birton, and his companions, also embarked in the ship.
 
 Freind persisted in his plan of not reproaching his son, whenever the
 young scamp did wrong. He left him to self-examination, and to consume
 his heart, as Pythagoras has it. Nevertheless, he took up the letter
 thrice, which had been received from England, and looked at his son as
 he read it. The young man would then cast his eyes on the ground; and
 respect and repentance might be read on his face.
 
 Birton continued as gay and noisy as if he had just returned from the
 play. He was in character like the late Duke of Rochester, extreme in
 debauchery, bravery, sentiments, language, and, in his Epicurean
 philosophy, attaching himself only to the extraordinary and soon
 disgusted even then; having the turn of mind that mistakes probabilities
 for demonstrations; more wise and eloquent than any young man of his
 age; but too indolent to be profound in any thing.
 
 While dining with us on board, Mr. Freind said to me:
 
 "Indeed, my dear friend, I hope God will inspire these young people with
 purer morals, and that Clive-Hart's terrible example will be a lesson to
 them."
 
 Birton, hearing these words, said, in a disdainful tone:
 
 "For a long time I had been dissatisfied with that wicked Clive-Hart.
 Indeed, I scarcely care more for her than I do for a trussed fowl. But
 do you believe there exists (I don't know where) a being perpetually
 occupied in punishing the wicked men and women who people and depopulate
 the four quarters of our little world? Do you forget that the terrible
 Mary, daughter of Henry VIII., was happy till her death? and yet she had
 caused the execution of eight hundred citizens, of both sexes, on the
 pretext that they did not believe in transubstantiation and the pope.
 Her father, nearly as cruel, and her husband, more profoundly wicked,
 spent their lives in enjoyment. Pope Alexander IV., worse than these,
 was still more fortunate. All his crimes succeeded. He died at the age
 of seventy-two, rich and powerful, courted by the kings of the age.
 Where, then, is this just and avenging God?"
 
 Mr. Freind, with austerity and calmness, replied:
 
 "It seems to me, sir, you ought not to say 'there is no God.' Remember,
 Locke and Newton never pronounced that word but in a tone of reverence,
 that every one remarked."
 
 "What care I," returned Birton, "for two men's grimaces? How did Newton
 look, when he wrote his _Commentary on the Apocalypse_? Or Locke, when
 he wrote the _Dialogue between a Parrot and the Prince Maurice_?"
 
 Then Freind repeated the golden words which should be graven on every
 heart:
 
 "Let us forget the dreams of great men; and remember the truths they
 have taught us."
 
 This reply gave way to a well-sustained conversation, more interesting
 than that of the bachelor of Salamanca. I sat in a corner and took
 notes. The company drew round the disputants. The worthy Parouba, his
 son, and daughter, John's debauched companions, and John himself, with
 his head resting on his hands,--all listened with eager attention.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER VIII.
 
 DIALOGUE BETWEEN FREIND AND BIRTON ON ATHEISM.
 
 
 FREIND.--I will not repeat to you, sir, the metaphysical arguments of
 our celebrated Clarke; I only exhort you to read them again. They are
 rather intended to convince than affect you. I shall confine myself to
 arguments calculated to touch your heart.
 
 BIRTON.--You will gratify me very much. I like to be amused and
 interested. I hate sophisms. Metaphysical arguments seem to me like
 balloons filled with air used between the disputants. The bladders
 burst; and nothing remains.
 
 FREIND.--It is possible there may be some obscurity--some bladders--in
 the deep things of Clarke, the respectable Arian. Perhaps he was
 deceived on the subject of actual infinity. Perhaps, when he took upon
 himself to comment on God, he follows too closely a commentator of
 Homer, who attributes ideas to his author which he never entertained.
 
 At the words "infinity," "Homer," "commentators," the worthy Parouba and
 his daughter, and even a few of the English, seemed disposed to go and
 take an airing on the deck. But Freind promising to be intelligible,
 they consented to remain. I explained in a whisper to Parouba scientific
 expressions, which a native of the Blue Mountains was not likely to
 understand so well as a doctor of Oxford or Cambridge.
 
 FREIND.--It would be sad, indeed, if we could not be sure of the
 existence of God without being metaphysicians. In all England, scarcely
 a hundred minds would be found capable of fathoming the mysteries of the
 _for_ and _against_; and the rest of the world would be enveloped in
 ignorance,--a prey to brutal passions,--swayed by instinct alone,--and
 only capable of reasoning on the vulgar notions of their carnal
 interests. To find out God, I only require you to make one effort,--to
 open your eyes.
 
 BIRTON.--I see your aim. You are returning to the worn-out arguments
 that the sun turns on its axis in twenty-five days and a half, in spite
 of the absurd inquisition of Rome;--that the light comes to us reflected
 from Saturn in fifteen minutes, in spite of the absurd supposition of
 Descartes;--that every fixed star is a sun, like ours, surrounded by
 planets; that the countless stars, scattered through space, obey
 mathematical laws, discovered and proved by the great Newton;--that a
 catechist announces God to children, and that Newton reveals him to the
 sage, as a philosophical Frenchman said, who was persecuted in his own
 country for asserting as much. Do not trouble yourself to bring before
 me the ceaseless order which prevails in all parts of the universe. All
 that exists must have order of some sort. Rarefied matter must take a
 higher place than denser substances. The strongest press upon the
 weakest. Bodies moved with a greater impulse, progress more rapidly than
 those moved with less. Things arrange themselves in this way of their
 own accord. In vain, after drinking a pint of wine, like Esdras, would
 you talk to me for a hundred and sixty hours together without shutting
 the mouth, I should not be convinced. Do you wish me to adopt an eternal
 being, infinite and immutable, who saw fit, (I do not know when,) to
 create from nothing, things which change every moment, and spiders to
 disembowel flies? Would you have me suppose, with the gossip Niewentyt,
 that God gave us ears that we might have faith? since faith cometh by
 hearing. No! No! I will not believe these quacks who have sold their
 drugs at a good price to fools. I keep to the little book of a
 Frenchman, who maintains that nothing exists nor can exist but nature;
 that nature does all, and is _all_; that it is impossible and
 contradictory that any thing can exist beyond ALL. In a word, I only
 believe in nature.
 
 FREIND.--What if I tell you there is no such thing as nature; and that
 in us, around us, a thousand millions of leagues from us, all is art,
 without any exception.
 
 BIRTON.--What? All art! That's something new.
 
 FREIND.--Few observe that. Nothing, however, is more true. I shall
 always say, make use of your eyes, and you will recognize and adore God.
 Think how those vast globes, which you see revolve in their immense
 orbits, observe deep mathematical laws. There is then a great calculator
 whom Plato called the eternal geometrician. You admire those newly
 invented machines, called orreries, because Lord Orrery invented them by
 imitating the maker. It is a feeble copy of our planetary system and its
 revolutions; also the periods of the changes of the solstice and equinox
 which bring us from day to day a new polar planet. This period, this
 slow course of about twenty-six thousand years, could not be effected in
 our feeble hands by human orreries. The machine is very imperfect; it
 must be turned by a handle; yet it is a _chef-d'œuvre_ of the skill
 of our artisans. Conceive, then, the power and patience, the genius, of
 the eternal architect, if we may apply such terms to the supreme being.
 
 When I described an orrery to Parouba, he said:
 
 "If the copy indicates genius, how much more must there be in the
 original?"
 
 All present, English and American, felt the force of these words, and
 raised their hands to heaven.
 
 Birton remained thoughtful. Then he cried:
 
 "What, all art? Nature the result of art? Can it be possible?"
 
 FREIND.--Now, consider yourself; examine with what art, never
 sufficiently explored, all is constructed within and without for all
 your wishes and actions. I do not pretend now to lecture on anatomy. You
 know well enough there is not one superfluous vessel, nor one that does
 not, in the exercise of its functions, depend on neighboring vessels. So
 artificial is the arrangement throughout the body, that there is not a
 single vein without valves and sluices, making a passage for the blood.
 From the roots of the hair to the toes, all is art, design, cause, and
 effect. Indeed, we cannot suppress feelings of indignation toward those
 who presume to deny final causes, and have the rashness to say that the
 mouth was not made to eat and speak with--that the eyes are not
 admirably contrived for seeing, the ears for hearing, the nerves for
 feeling. Such audacity is madness. I cannot conceive it.
 
 Let us admit that every animal renders testimony to the supreme
 fabricator.
 
 The smallest herb perplexes human intellect. So true is this that the
 aggregate toil of all men could not create a straw unless the seed be
 sown in the earth. Let it not be said that the seed must rot in the
 earth to produce. Such nonsense should not be listened to now.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 The company felt the force of these proofs more forcibly than the
 others, because they were more palpable. Birton murmured: "Must I then
 acknowledge God? We shall see. It is not yet proved."
 
 John remained thoughtful, and seemed affected.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 FREIND.--No, my friends. We make nothing, we can do nothing. It is in
 our power to arrange, unite, calculate, weigh, measure, but, _to make_!
 What a word! The essential Being, existing by Himself, alone can make.
 This is why quacks, who labor at the philosopher's stone, prove
 themselves such fools. They boast that they create gold, and they cannot
 even create clay. Let us then confess, my friends, that there is a
 necessary and incomprehensible Being who made us.
 
 BIRTON.--If he exist, where is he? Why is he concealed? Has any one ever
 seen him? Should the creator of good hide himself?
 
 FREIND.--Did you ever see Sir Christopher Wren, the architect of Saint
 Paul's, when you were in London? Yet it is clear that church is the work
 of a great architect.
 
 BIRTON.--Every one knows that Wren erected, at a great expense, the vast
 edifice in which Burgess, when he preaches, sends us to sleep. We know
 very well why and how our fathers built it. But why and how did God make
 the universe from nothing? You know well the ancient maxim: "Nothing can
 create nothing; nothing returns to nothing." No one ever doubted that
 truth. Your Bible itself says that your God made heaven and earth,
 though the heaven, that is, the assemblage of stars, is as superior to
 the earth, as the earth itself is to one blade of grass. But your Bible
 does not tell us that God made heaven and earth from nothing. It does
 not pretend that the Lord made woman from nothing. She was kneaded in a
 very singular way, from a rib taken from her husband's side. According
 to the Bible, chaos existed before the world; therefore matter must be
 as eternal as your God.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 A slight murmur then went round the company; "Birton might be right,"
 they said.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 FREIND.--I think I have proved to you that there is a supreme
 intelligence; an eternal power to whom we owe our passing existence. I
 have not engaged to tell you the how and the why. God has given me
 sufficient reason to know that he exists, but not enough to discover
 whether matter has been subject to him from eternity, or whether he
 created it in time. What have you to do with the creation of matter,
 provided you acknowledge a God the ruler of matter and of yourself? You
 ask me where God is? I do not know. I ought not to know. I know that he
 is; I know that he is my maker; that he makes all, and that we ought to
 depend on his goodness.
 
 BIRTON.--His goodness! Are you jesting with me? Did you not tell me to
 make use of my eyes? Make use of yours. Glance at the world, and then
 talk of the goodness of God.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 Mr. Freind saw that he had now reached the most difficult part of the
 dispute, and that Birton was preparing a rude assault. He saw that the
 hearers, especially the Americans, together with himself, required a
 little respite. Recommending himself therefore to God, they went on deck
 for exercise. When tea was served, the disputation was renewed.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER IX.
 
 ON ATHEISM.
 
 
 BIRTON.--You must not expect such success, sir, on the subject of
 goodness, as you have had on ingenuity and power. First, I shall touch
 on the misconstructions of our globe, in many instances opposed to the
 cleverness so much boasted of; then I intend to dwell on the perpetual
 crimes and misfortunes of the inhabitants; and you will judge of the
 great ruler's paternal affection for them.
 
 I shall begin by telling you that in Gloucestershire, my county, when we
 breed horses, we rear them with care, in fine pasturage and good
 stables, with hay and oats. Pray, what shelter and food had these poor
 Americans, when we discovered their continent? They were obliged to
 scour over thirty or forty miles for food. All the northern coast of the
 old world is exposed to the same cruel necessity; and from Swedish
 Laponia to the Sea of Japan, a hundred tribes spend a life as short as
 it is wretched, in the most complete want, amidst eternal snows.
 
 Fine climates are continually exposed to destructive scourges. There we
 walk over burning precipices, covered by fertile plains, which prove but
 deadly snares. There is no hell but this, doubtless; and it opens a
 hundred times beneath our feet.
 
 They tell us of an universal deluge, an event physically impossible, and
 at which all sensible people laugh. But they console us by saying it
 only lasted ten months. I wonder it did not put out the fires which have
 since destroyed so many flourishing towns. Your St. Augustin tells us of
 a hundred cities burnt or swallowed up in Lydia, by an earthquake.
 Volcanoes have several times devastated lovely Italy. As a crowning
 misfortune, the inhabitants of the Arctic Circle are not exempt from
 these subterranean fires. The Icelander, always in alarm, has hunger
 staring him in the face, and a hundred feet of flame or ice to the right
 or left, under their Mount Hecla; for the great volcanoes are always
 found among terrible mountains.
 
 It is in vain to say that mountains of two thousand toises in elevation
 are nothing on a globe nine thousand miles in diameter, or like the
 irregularities of an orange compared with the bulk of that fruit--that
 it is scarcely one foot to every three thousand feet. Alas! What then
 are we, if high mountains are but as figures one foot high for every
 three thousand feet, or four inches for every nine thousand inches? We
 are then animals absolutely imperceptible; yet we are liable to be
 crushed by all that surrounds us, though our infinite littleness, so
 closely bordering on nothing, might seem to secure us from all
 accidents. Besides the countless cities, destroyed and re-destroyed like
 as many ant-hills, what shall we say to the seas of sand that cross the
 centre of Africa, and whose burning waves, raised by the wind, have
 buried entire armies? What is the use of the vast deserts on the borders
 of Syria,--deserts so horrible that the ferocious animals, called Jews,
 imagined they had reached Paradise when they passed from these scenes of
 horror into a little corner of land where they could cultivate a few
 acres? It is not enough that man (the noble creature) should be so ill
 lodged, clothed, and fed, for so many ages. He comes into the world to
 live for a few days, perplexed by deceitful hopes and real vexations.
 His body, contrived with useless art, is a prey to all the ills
 resulting from that very art. He lives between the dangers of poison and
 plague. No one can remember the list of ills we are subject to; and the
 modest doctors of Switzerland pretend they can cure them all.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 While Birton said this, the company listened with attention and even
 emotion. Parouba said "Let us see how the doctor will get over this."
 
 Even John said in a low tone: "On my word, he is right. I was a fool to
 be so soon touched by my father's conversation."
 
 Mr. Freind waited till their imaginations were a little recovered from
 the assault, and then resumed the discussion.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 FREIND.--A young theologian would answer these sad truths by sophisms,
 backed with quotations from St. Basil and St. Cyril. For my part, I
 shall admit that there are many physical evils in the world. I will not
 even lessen the number, though Mr. Birton has seen fit to exaggerate. I
 ask you, my dear Parouba, is not your climate made for you? It cannot
 be injurious, since neither you nor your companions wish to leave it.
 Esquimaux, Icelanders, Laplanders, Asiatics, and Indians, never think of
 leaving theirs. The reindeer, which God has sent to clothe and feed
 them, die when transported to another zone. Laplanders themselves die in
 southern climates. The south of Siberia is too warm for them; here they
 would be burnt. It is evident that God made every kind of animal and
 vegetable for the clime in which it thrives. Negroes, a race of men so
 different to ours, are so thoroughly formed for their country, that
 thousands of them have preferred death to slavery elsewhere. The camel
 and ostrich are quite at home in the sands of Africa. The bull abounds
 in fertile countries, where the grass is ever fresh for his nourishment.
 Cinnamon and spice only grow in India. Barley is only useful in those
 countries where God has appointed it to grow. From one end of America to
 the other, you have different kinds of food. The vine cannot be brought
 to perfection in England, nor in Sweden and Canada. This is the reason
 that in some countries the elements of religious rites consist in bread
 and wine; and they do well to thank God for the food and beverage his
 goodness has provided; and Americans would do well to thank him for
 their Indian corn and arrow-root. Throughout the world God has suited
 all animals, from the snail to man, to the countries in which he has
 placed them. Let us not reproach Providence when we owe him praises.
 
 But to consider scourges, such as inundations, volcanoes, earthquakes.
 If you confine your attention to the accidents which sometimes happen to
 the wheels of the eternal machine, you may well consider God as a
 tyrant; but observe his ceaseless benefits, and he becomes a
 compassionate father. You have quoted Augustin and his account of the
 destruction of a hundred cities; but remember the African rhetorician
 often contradicts himself and was prodigal of exaggerations in his
 writings. He wrote of earthquakes as he did of the efficacy of grace,
 and the damnation of children dying without baptism. Has he not said in
 his thirty-seventh sermon, that he had seen people at Ethiopia with one
 eye in the middle of the forehead like the Cyclops, and a whole race
 without heads?
 
 We, who are not fathers of the church, ought not to go beyond nor to
 stop short of truth; and the truth is, that of the houses destroyed, we
 cannot reckon that more than one out of every hundred thousand, is
 destroyed by the fires necessary to the due performance of the
 operations of the world.
 
 So essential to the nature of the universe is fire, that but for it
 there would be no sun nor stars, no animals, vegetables, or minerals.
 The fire, placed under the earth, is subject to fixed natural laws. Some
 disasters may nevertheless occur. You cannot say a man is a poor artisan
 when an immense machine, formed by him, lasts unimpaired for years. If a
 man invented a hydraulic engine to water a province, would you disparage
 his work because it destroys some insects?
 
 I have shown you that the machine of the world is the work of an
 intelligent and powerful being; you, who are intelligent, ought to
 admire him,--you, who are laden with his gifts, ought to adore him.
 
 But how, you inquire, can the wretches who are condemned to languish
 under incurable evils--how can they admire and love? I must tell you,
 that such ills are generally brought on ourselves, or come to us from
 our fathers, who abused their bodies, and not from the great fabricator.
 No disease but decrepitude was known in America till we introduced
 strong liquors, the source of all evils.
 
 Let us remember that in Milton's Poem, the simple Adam is made to
 inquire if he will live long. Yes, is the reply, if you take nothing to
 excess. Observe this rule, my friends. Can you require that God should
 let you live for ages, as the reward of your gluttony, your drunkenness,
 your incontinence, and your indulgence in infamous passions, which
 corrupt the blood and necessarily shorten life?
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 I approved of this reply. Parouba liked it; but Birton was not moved. I
 read in John's eyes that he was still doubtful. Birton rejoined in these
 terms:
 
 BIRTON.--Since you have made use of common arguments, with a few novel
 remarks, I may be allowed to follow your plan. If so good and powerful a
 God existed, surely he would not have suffered evil to enter the world,
 nor have devoted his creatures to grief and crime. If he cannot prevent
 evil, he is not almighty; if he will not, he is cruel.
 
 The annals of the Brahmins only extend back 8,000 years; those of the
 Chinese only 5,000. Our knowledge is but of yesterday; but, in that
 brief space, all is horror. Murder has been the practice from one end of
 the earth to the other; and men have been weak enough to give to those
 men who slew the greatest number of their fellow creatures, the titles
 of heroes, demi-gods, and even gods.
 
 In America there were left two great nations, beginning to enjoy the
 sweets of peace and civilization, when the Spaniards came there to slay
 eleven millions. They hunted men down with dogs; and King Ferdinand of
 Castile gave those dogs pensions for their services.
 
 The heroes who subdued the New World, massacred innocent and helpless
 babes, murdered peaceable and defenceless Indians, and committed the
 most inhuman barbarities! They roasted King Guatimozin, in Mexico, on a
 gridiron. They hastened to Peru to convert the Inca, Atahualpa. A
 priest, named Almagro, son of a priest condemned to be hanged in Spain
 for highway robbery, went there with one Pizarro, to inform the Emperor
 of the Peruvians, by the voice of another priest, that a third priest,
 named Alexander IV., polluted by incest, assassination, and homicide,
 had given, with his full consent (_proprio motu_) and with full power,
 not only Peru, but one half of the New World, to the King of Spain; and
 that Atahualpa ought instantly to submit, under pain of suffering the
 indignation of the apostles Peter and Paul. But as this king knew as
 little of Latin as the priest who read the papal bull, he was instantly
 declared heretical and incredulous.
 
 They burned Atahualpa, as they had burned Guatimozin. They slew his
 people; and all to gain that hard and yellow earth which has only served
 to depopulate and impoverish Spain; for it has made her neglect the
 cultivation of the earth, which really nourishes man.
 
 Now, my dear Mr. Freind, if the fantastic and ridiculous being men call
 the devil, had wished to make men in his image, would he have made them
 otherwise? Do not, then, attribute such an abominable work to God.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 This speech brought the party round again to Birton's views. I saw John
 rejoice in himself; even young Parouba heard with horror of the priest
 Almagro--of the priest who read the Latin bull--of the priest Alexander
 IV.---of all Christians who committed, under pretence of devotion, such
 crimes to obtain gold. I confess, I trembled for Freind. I despaired of
 his cause. He replied, however, without embarrassment.
 
 FREIND.--Remember, my friends, there is a God. This I proved to you, you
 agreed to it, and after being driven to admit that he exists, you strive
 to find out his imperfections, vices, and wickedness.
 
 I am far from asserting, with some reasoners, that private ills form the
 general good. This is too ridiculous a sentiment. I admit, with grief,
 that the world contains much moral and physical evil: but, since it is
 certain that God exists, it is also certain that all these evils cannot
 prevent God's existence. He cannot be cruel. What interest could make
 him so? There are horrible evils in the world, my friends. Let us not
 swell their number. It is impossible that God can be other than good;
 but men are perverse, and make a detestable use of the liberty that God
 has given and ought to have given,--that is, the power of exercising
 their wills, without which they would be simple machines, formed by a
 wicked being, to be broken at his caprice.
 
 All enlightened Spaniards agree that a small number of their ancestors
 abused this liberty so far as to commit crimes that make human nature
 shudder. The second Don Carlos did what he could to repair the
 atrocities committed by the Spaniards under Ferdinand and Charles V.
 
 If there be crime in the world, my friends, there is virtue as well.
 
 BIRTON.--Ah! ha! virtue! A good joke! I should like to see this virtue.
 Where is she to be found?
 
 At these words I could not contain myself.
 
 "You may find her," said I, "in the worthy Mr. Freind, in Parouba, even
 in yourself when your heart is cleansed of its vices."
 
 He blushed; and John also. The latter looked down and seemed to feel
 remorse. His father surveyed him with compassion and resumed.
 
 FREIND.--Yes, dear friends. If there have always been crimes; there have
 always been virtues too. Athens had such men as Socrates, as well as
 such as Anitus. Rome had Catos, as well as Syllas. Nero frightened the
 world by his atrocities, but Titus, Trajan, and the Antonines, consoled
 it by their benevolence, My friend will explain to Parouba who these
 great men were. Fortunately, I have Epictetus in my pocket. Epictetus
 was a slave, but the equal of Marcus Aurelius in mind. Listen; and may
 all who pretend to teach men hear what Epictetus says to himself,--"God
 made me; I feel this; and shall I dare to dishonor him by infamous
 thoughts, criminal actions, and base desires?" His mind agreed with his
 conversation. Marcus Aurelius, on the throne of Europe and two parts of
 our hemisphere, did not think otherwise than the slave Epictetus. The
 one was never humiliated by meanness, nor the other dazzled by
 greatness; and when they wrote their thoughts it was for the use of
 their disciples, and not to be extolled in the papers. Pray, in your
 opinion, were not Locke, Newton, Tillotson, Penn, Clarke, the good man
 called "The Man of Ross," and many others, in and beyond your island,
 models of virtue?
 
 You have alluded to the cruel and unjust wars of which so many nations
 have been guilty. You have described the abominations of Christians in
 Mexico and Peru; you might add the St. Bartholomew of France and the
 Irish massacre. But are there not people who have always held in
 abhorrence the shedding of blood? Have not the Brahmins in all ages
 given this example to the world? and, even in this country, have we not
 near us, in Pennsylvania, our Philadelphians, whom they attempt in vain
 to ridicule by the name of Quakers, and who have always hated war?
 
 Have we not the Carolinas, where the great Locke dictated laws? In these
 two lands of virtue, all citizens are equal; all consciences are free;
 all religions good; provided they worship God. There all men are
 brethren. You have seen, Mr. Birton, the inhabitants of the Blue
 Mountains lay down their arms before a descendant of Penn. They felt the
 force of virtue. You persist in disavowing it. Because the earth
 produces poisons as well as wholesome plants, will you prefer the
 poisons?
 
 BIRTON.--Oh, sir, your poisons are not to the point. If God made them,
 they are his work. He is master, and does all. His hand directs
 Cromwell's, when he signs the death warrant of Charles I. His arm
 conducts the headsman's, who severs his head from the body. No, I cannot
 admit that God is a homicide.
 
 FREIND.--Nor I. Pray, hear me. You will admit that God governs by
 general laws. According to these laws, Cromwell, a monster of fanaticism
 and envy, determines to sacrifice Charles I. to his own interest, which,
 no doubt, all men seek to promote, though they do not understand it
 alike. According to the laws of motion established by God, the
 executioner cuts off his head. But assuredly it is not God who commits
 the assassination by a particular act of his will. God was not Cromwell,
 nor Ravaillac, nor Balthazar Gerard, nor the preaching friar, James
 Clement. God does not permit, nor command, nor authorize crime. But he
 has made man; he has established laws of motion; and these eternal laws
 are equally executed by the good man who stretches out his hand to the
 poor, and by the hand of a villain who assassinates his brother. In the
 same way that God did not extinguish the sun, or swallow up Spain, to
 punish Cortez, Almagro, and Pizarro, so, also, he does not send a
 company of angels to London, nor make a hundred thousand pipes of
 Burgundy to descend from heaven to delight the hearts of his dear
 Englishmen, when they do good. His general providence would become
 ridiculous, if thus made manifest to every individual; and this is so
 striking, that God never punishes a criminal immediately, by a decided
 stroke of his power. He lets the sun shine on the evil and the good. If
 some wretches expire in their crimes, it is by the general laws that
 govern the world. I have read in a great book, by a Frenchman called
 Mézeray, that God caused our Henry V. to suffer a painful death, because
 he dared to sit on the throne of a Christian king.
 
 The physical part of a bad action is the effect of the primary laws
 given to matter by the hand of God. All moral evil is the effect of the
 liberty which man abuses.
 
 In a word, without plunging into the fogs of metaphysics, let us
 remember that the existence of God is proved. We have no longer to argue
 on that point. Take God from the world, and does the assassination of
 Charles I. become more lawful? Do you feel less aversion toward his
 executioner? God exists. Enough. If he exists, he is just. Be, then,
 just also.
 
 BIRTON.--Your argument has strength and force, though it does not
 altogether exonerate God from being the author of physical and moral
 evil. I see your way of justifying him makes an impression on the
 assembly; but might it not be contrived that these laws should not
 involve such particular misfortunes? You have proved to me a powerful
 and eternal God, and I was almost on the point of believing. But I have
 some terrible objections to make. Come, John, courage; let us not be
 cast down.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER X.
 
 ON ATHEISM.
 
 
 Night closed in beautifully. The atmosphere presented a vault of
 transparent azure, spangled with golden stars. Such a spectacle always
 affects man, and inspires him with pleasant reveries. The worthy Parouba
 admired the heavens, like a German when he beholds St. Peter's at Rome,
 or the Opera at Naples, for the first time.
 
 "What a boldly arched vault," said he to Freind.
 
 "It is no arch at all," replied Freind. "The blue dome you behold is
 nothing more than a collection of vapors, which God has so disposed and
 combined with the mechanism of your eyes, that, wherever you may be, you
 are still in the centre of your promenade, and perceive what is called
 heaven, arched above your head."
 
 "And those stars, Mr. Freind?"
 
 "As I have already said, they are so many suns, round which other worlds
 revolve. Far from being attached to that blue vault, remember that they
 are at various and prodigious distances from us. That star is twelve
 hundred millions of miles from our sun."
 
 Then, showing him the telescope he had brought, he pointed out to him
 the planets;--Jupiter, with his four moons; Saturn, with his five moons
 and mysterious ring.
 
 "It is the same light," said he, "which proceeds from all these
 luminaries, and comes to us from this planet, in a quarter of an hour,
 and from that star, in six months."
 
 Parouba was deeply impressed, and said: "The heavens proclaim a God."
 All the crew looked on with admiration. But the pertinacious Birton,
 unmoved, continued as follows:
 
 BIRTON.--Be it so! There is a God, I grant it. But what is that to you
 and me? What connection is there between the superior Being and worms of
 the earth? What relation is there between his essence and ours?
 Epicurus, when he supposed a God in the planets, did well to conclude
 that he took no part in our horrors and follies; that we could neither
 please nor offend him; that he had no need of us; nor we of him. You
 admit a God, more worthy of the human mind than the God of Epicurus, or
 the gods of the east and west: but if you assert, with so many others,
 that God made the world and man for his own glory; that he formerly
 required sacrifices of oxen for his glory; that he appeared for his
 glory in our biped form, you would, I think, be asserting an absurdity.
 The love of glory is nothing but pride. A proud man is a conceited
 fellow, such as Shakespeare would introduce in his plays. This epithet
 cannot suit God--it does not agree with the divine nature--any more than
 injustice, cruelty or inconstancy. If God condescended to regulate the
 universe, it could only be to make others happy. Has he done so?
 
 FREIND.--He has doubtless succeeded with all just spirits. They will be
 happy one day; if they are not so now.
 
 BIRTON.--Happy! How? When? Who told you so?
 
 FREIND.--His justice.
 
 BIRTON.--Will you tell me that we shall live eternally--that we have
 immortal souls, after admitting that the Jews, whom you boast of having
 succeeded, did not entertain this notion of immortality up to the time
 of Herod? This idea of an immortal soul was invented by the Brahmins,
 adopted by the Persians, Chaldeans, and Greeks, and was for a long time
 unknown to the insignificant and superstitious Jewish tribes. Alas! sir,
 how do we know that we have souls? or how do we know but other animals,
 who have similar passions, wills, appetites, and memories, so
 incomprehensible to us, have not souls as well?
 
 Hitherto I have thought that there is in nature a power by which we have
 the faculty of life in all our body,--walking with our feet,--taking
 with our hands,--seeing with our eyes, feeling with our nerves,
 thinking with our brain,--and that all this is called the soul, which is
 merely a vague word, signifying the unknown principle of our faculties.
 With you, I will call God the intelligent principle animating nature;
 but has he condescended to reveal himself to us?
 
 FREIND. Yes, by his works.
 
 BIRTON.--Has he revealed his laws, or spoken to us?
 
 FREIND.--Yes, by the voice of conscience. Is it true, that, if you
 killed your Father and mother, your conscience would be a prey to a
 remorse as terrible as it would be involuntary? Is not this truth avowed
 and felt throughout the world? To come down to lesser crimes,--do they
 not all revolt us at the first glance,--make us turn pale when we commit
 them for the first time,--and leave in our hearts the stings of
 repentance?
 
 BIRTON.--I must confess it.
 
 FREIND.--God, in thus speaking to your heart, has commanded you to
 abstain from crime. As for equivocal actions, which some condemn and
 others approve, what can we do better than follow the grand rule of
 Zoroaster,--"When you are not sure whether the action you are about to
 commit is good or bad, abstain from it."
 
 BIRTON.--An admirable maxim, and doubtless the most beautiful ever
 advanced in morals. I admit that, from time to time, God has raised up
 men to teach virtue to their degraded fellows. I apologize to you for
 speaking lightly of virtue.
 
 FREIND.--Rather apologize to the Supreme Being, who can reward and
 punish eternally.
 
 BIRTON.--What! will God punish me for yielding to passions he has given
 me?
 
 FREIND.--He has given you passions, with which you can do both good and
 evil. I do not tell you he will punish eternally; nor how he will
 punish; for no one can know that. The Brahmins were the first to
 conceive a place of imprisonment for those who had revolted from God;
 they were shut up in a description of hell, called Onderah, but were
 gradually liberated at various periods. Hence we have our mixture of
 virtues, vices, pleasures, and calamities. This conceit is
 ingenious;--and that of Pandora and Prometheus more so. Less polished
 nations have vulgurly imitated the same fable. These inventions are the
 fancies of Eastern philosophy. All I can say is, that if by abusing
 your liberty you have done evil, you cannot say God will not punish you.
 
 BIRTON.--I have tried to convince myself that he could not; but in vain.
 I confess I have abused my liberty, and that God may well punish me. But
 I cannot be punished when I have ceased to exist.
 
 FREIND.--The best course is to do well, while you exist.
 
 BIRTON.--To do well! Well, I confess I think you are right. It is the
 best course.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 I wish, my dear friend, you had witnessed the effect of Freind's
 discourse on both the English and Americans. The light saucy Birton
 became thoughtful and modest. John fell at his father's feet, with tears
 in his eyes, and his father embraced him. I shall now proceed to relate
 the last scene of this interesting disputation.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 BIRTON.--I conceive that the great master of the universe is eternal;
 but we, who are but of yesterday, may we presume to expect immortality?
 All beings around us perish, from the insect devoured by the swallow, to
 the elephant, eaten by worms.
 
 FREIND.--Nothing perishes; but all things change. The genus of animals
 and vegetables subsist, develop, and multiply. Why can you not allow
 that God might preserve the principle which makes us act and think, of
 whatever nature it may be? God preserve me from making a system; but
 certainly there is in us something that wills and thinks. This
 something, formerly called a monad, is imperceptible. God has given it
 us, or, rather, God has given us to it. Are you sure he cannot preserve
 it in being? Can you give me any proof?
 
 BIRTON.--No! I have sought for a proof in all the atheistical books
 within my reach; and especially in the third _Book of Lucrece_; but I
 never found any thing but conjectures.
 
 FREIND.--And shall we on simple conjecture give ourselves up to fatal
 passions, and live like brutes, with no other restraint upon us than the
 fear of men, rendered eternally cruel to each other by their mutual
 dread? For we always wish to destroy what we fear. Think, sir! think
 seriously, my son John. To expect neither reward nor punishment is the
 true spirit of atheism. What is the use of a God who has no power over
 you? As though one should say, "There is a very powerful king in
 China," I reply, "Success to him, let him keep in his territory,--I, in
 mine. I care no more for him than he cares for me. He has no more
 control over me than a canon of Windsor over a member of parliament."
 Then should I be a God to myself,--Sacrificing the whole world to my
 caprice? And, recognizing no law, I should only consider myself? If
 others are sheep, I should become the wolf. If they choose to play the
 chicken, I should play the fox.
 
 I will presume, (God forbid it), that all Englishmen are atheists. I
 will allow that there may be some peaceable citizens, quiet by nature,
 rich enough to be honest, regulated by honor, and so attentive to
 demeanor, that they contrive to live together in society. They cultivate
 the arts which improve morals; they live at peace in the innocent gaiety
 of honest people. But the poor and needy atheist, sure of impunity,
 would be a fool if he did not assassinate or steal to get money. Then
 would all the bonds of society be sundered. All secret crimes would
 inundate the world, and, like locusts, though at first imperceptible,
 would overspread the earth. The common people would become hordes of
 thieves, like those of our day, of whom not a tenth part are hung at our
 sessions. They would pass their wretched lives in taverns, with bad
 women. They would fight together, and fall down drunk amidst the pewter
 pots with which they break each other's heads. Nor would they rise but
 to steal and murder again,---to recommence the same round of hideous
 brutality. Who, then, would restrain great kings in their fury? An
 atheist king is more dangerous than a fanatical Ravaillac.
 
 Atheism abounded in Italy during the fifteenth century. What was the
 consequence? It was as common a matter to poison another, as to invite
 him to supper. The stroke of the stiletto was as frequent as an embrace.
 There were then professors of crime; as we now have professors of music
 and mathematics. Churches, even, were the favorite scenes of murder, and
 princes were slain at the altar. In this way, Pope Sextus IV. and
 archbishop of Pisa put to death two of the most accomplished princes of
 Europe. Explain, my dear friend, to Parouba and his children, what I
 mean by a pope and an archbishop; but tell them we have no such monsters
 now. But to resume: A Duke of Milan was also slain in a church. Every
 one knows the astonishing horrors of Alexander VI. Had such morals
 continued, Italy would have been more desolate than Peru after the
 invasion.
 
 Faith, then, in a God who rewards good actions, punishes the bad, and
 forgives lesser faults, is most useful to mankind. It is the only
 restraint on powerful men, who insolently commit crimes on the public,
 and on others who skillfully perpetrate offences. I do not tell you to
 mingle, with this necessary faith, superstitious notions that disgrace
 it. Atheism is a monster that would prey on mankind only to satisfy its
 voracity. Superstition is another phantom, preying upon men as a deity.
 I have often observed that an atheist may be cured; but we rarely cure
 superstition radically. The atheist is generally an inquiring man, who
 is deceived; the superstitious man is a brutal fool, having no ideas of
 his own. An atheist might assault Ephigenia when on the point of
 marrying Achilles; but a fanatic would piously sacrifice her on the
 altar, and think he did service to Jupiter. An atheist would steal a
 golden vessel from the altar to feast his favorites, but the fanatic
 would celebrate an _auto-da-fe_ in the same church, and sing hymns while
 he was causing Jews to be burned alive. Yes, my friends, superstition
 and atheism are the two poles of a universe in confusion. Tread these
 paths with a firm step; believe in a good God, and _be_ good. This is
 all that the great philosophers, Penn and Locke, require of their
 people.
 
 Answer me, Mr. Birton,--and you, my friends,--what harm can the worship
 of God, joined to the happiness of a virtuous life, do you? We might be
 seized with mortal sickness, even now while I am speaking; who, then,
 would not wish to have lived innocently? Read, in Shakespeare, the death
 of our wicked Richard III., and see how the ghosts of those he had
 murdered haunted his imagination. Witness the death of Charles IX. after
 the horrors of St. Bartholomew. In vain his chaplain assured him he had
 done well. His blood started from every pore; all the blood he had shed
 cried out against him! Believe me, all these monsters were tortured by
 remorse, and died in despair.
 
 Birton and his friends could contain themselves no longer. They fell at
 Freind's feet, "Yes," said Birton, "I believe in God, and I believe
 you."
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER XI.
 
 RETURN TO ENGLAND--JOHN'S MARRIAGE.
 
 
 We were already near Parouba's house; and we supped there. John could
 eat nothing. He sat apart in tears. His father went to console him.
 
 "Ah!" said John, "I do not deserve such a father. I shall die of shame
 for yielding to the fascination of that wicked Clive-Hart. I am the
 cause of Miss Primerose's death; just now, when you talked of poison, I
 shuddered; for I thought I saw Clive-Hart presenting the horrible
 draught to Primerose. How could I have so far lost myself as to
 accompany so vile a creature? I was blind. I did not discover my error
 till she was taken by the savages. In a fit of rage she almost admitted
 her guilt. From that moment, I have loathed her; and, for a punishment,
 the form of Primerose is ever before me, and seems to say, 'I died
 because I loved you.'" His father said a blameless life could alone
 repair his past errors.
 
 The next day we sailed for England, after giving presents to the
 Paroubas. Tears mingled with our adieus; and Birton, who had been only
 giddy, already seemed a reasonable person.
 
 When we were out at sea, Freind said to John, in my presence: "Do you
 still cherish the memory of the amiable Primerose?" These words so wrung
 the heart of the young man, that I feared he would throw himself into
 the sea.
 
 "Console yourself, then," said Freind. "Miss Primerose is alive, and
 loves you still."
 
 Freind had received certain information on this subject from his
 servant, who had written to him punctually by every ship. Mr. Mead, who
 has since acquired so great a reputation by his skill in the
 counteraction of poisons, had saved the young lady's life. In a moment,
 John passed from despair to extreme joy. I will not attempt to describe
 the change. It was the happiest moment of his life. Birton and his
 friends shared his joy. What more shall I say? The worthy Freind was as
 a father to all. The wedding was celebrated at Dr. Mead's. Birton, now
 another man, also married; and he and John are now among the best people
 in England.
 
 Admit, that a wise man can instruct fools.

 PRINCESS OF BABYLON
 
 [Illustration: The Phœnix][1]
 
 
 
 
 I.
 
 ROYAL CONTEST FOR THE HAND OF FORMOSANTA.
 
 
 The aged Belus, king of Babylon, thought himself the first man upon
 earth; for all his courtiers told him so, and his historians proved it.
 We know that his palace and his park, situated at a few parafangs from
 Babylon, extended between the Euphrates and the Tigris, which washed
 those enchanted banks. His vast house, three thousand feet in front,
 almost reached the clouds. The platform was surrounded with a balustrade
 of white marble, fifty feet high, which supported colossal statues of
 all the kings and great men of the empire. This platform, composed of
 two rows of bricks, covered with a thick surface of lead from one
 extremity to the other, bore twelve feet of earth; and upon the earth
 were raised groves of olive, orange, citron, palm, cocoa, and cinnamon
 trees, and stock gillyflowers, which formed alleys that the rays of the
 sun could not penetrate.
 
 The waters of the Euphrates running, by the assistance of pumps, in a
 hundred canals, formed cascades of six thousand feet in length in the
 park, and a hundred thousand _jets d'eau_, whose height was scarce
 perceptible. They afterward flowed into the Euphrates, from whence they
 came. The gardens of Semiramis, which astonished Asia several ages
 after, were only a feeble imitation of these ancient prodigies, for in
 the time of Semiramis, every thing began to degenerate amongst men and
 women.
 
 But what was more admirable in Babylon, and eclipsed every thing else,
 was the only daughter of the king, named Formosanta. It was from her
 pictures and statues, that in succeeding times Praxiteles sculptured his
 Aphrodita, and the Venus of Medicis. Heavens! what a difference between
 the original and the copies! so that king Belus was prouder of his
 daughter than of his kingdom. She was eighteen years old. It was
 necessary she should have a husband worthy of her; but where was he to
 be found? An ancient oracle had ordained, that Formosanta could not
 belong to any but him who could bend the bow of Nimrod.
 
 This Nimrod, "a mighty hunter before the Lord," (_Gen. x:9_), had left a
 bow seventeen Babylonian feet in length, made of ebony, harder than the
 iron of mount Caucasus, which is wrought in the forges of Derbent; and
 no mortal since Nimrod could bend this astonishing bow.
 
 It was again said, "that the arm which should bend this bow would kill
 the most terrible and ferocious lion that should be let loose in the
 Circus of Babylon." This was not all. The bender of the bow, and the
 conquerer of the lion, should overthow all his rivals; but he was above
 all things to be very sagacious, the most magnificent and most virtuous
 of men, and possess the greatest curiosity in the whole universe.
 
 Three kings appeared, who were bold enough to claim Formosanta. Pharaoh
 of Egypt, the Shah of India, and the great Khan of the Scythians. Belus
 appointed the day and place of combat, which was to be at the extremity
 of his park, in the vast expanse surrounded by the joint waters of the
 Euphrates and the Tigris. Round the lists a marble amphitheatre was
 erected, which might contain five hundred thousand spectators. Opposite
 the amphitheatre was placed the king's throne. He was to appear with
 Formosanta, accompanied by the whole court; and on the right and left
 between the throne and the amphitheatre, there were other thrones and
 seats for the three kings, and for all the other sovereigns who were
 desirous to be present at this august ceremony.
 
 The king of Egypt arrived the first, mounted upon the bull Apis, and
 holding in his hand the cithern of Isis. He was followed by two thousand
 priests, clad in linen vestments whiter than snow, two thousand eunuchs,
 two thousand magicians, and two thousand warriors.
 
 The king of India came soon after in a car drawn by twelve elephants. He
 had a train still more numerous and more brilliant than Pharaoh of
 Egypt.
 
 The last who appeared was the king of the Scythians. He had none with
 him but chosen warriors, armed with bows and arrows. He was mounted upon
 a superb tiger, which he had tamed, and which was as tall as any of the
 finest Persian horses. The majestic and important mien of this king
 effaced the appearance of his rivals; his naked arms, as nervous as they
 were white, seemed already to bend the bow of Nimrod.
 
 These three lovers immediately prostrated themselves before Belus and
 Formosanta. The king of Egypt presented the princess with two of the
 finest crocodiles of the Nile, two sea horses, two zebras, two Egyptian
 rats, and two mummies, with the books of the great Hermes, which he
 judged to be the scarcest things upon earth.
 
 The king of India offered her a hundred elephants, each bearing a wooden
 gilt tower, and laid at her feet the _vedam_, written by the hand of
 Xaca himself.
 
 The king of the Scythians, who could neither write nor read, presented a
 hundred warlike horses with black fox skin housings.
 
 The princess appeared with a downcast look before her lovers, and
 reclined herself with such a grace as was at once modest and noble.
 
 Belus ordered the kings to be conducted to the thrones that were
 prepared for them. "Would I had three daughters," said he to them, "I
 should make six people this day happy!" He then made the competitors
 cast lots which should try Nimrod's bow first. Their names inscribed
 were put into a golden casque. That of the Egyptian king came out first,
 then the name of the King of India appeared. The king of Scythia,
 viewing the bow and his rivals, did not complain at being the third.
 
 Whilst these brilliant trials were preparing, twenty thousand pages and
 twenty thousand youthful maidens distributed, without any disorder,
 refreshments to the spectators between the rows of seats. Every one
 acknowledged that the gods had instituted kings for no other cause than
 every day to give festivals, upon condition they should be
 diversified--that life is too short for any other purpose--that
 lawsuits, intrigues, wars, the altercations of theologists, which
 consume human life, are horrible and absurd--that man is born only for
 happiness that he would not passionately and incessantly pursue
 pleasure, were he not designed for it--that the essence of human nature
 is to enjoy ourselves, and all the rest is folly. This excellent moral
 was never controverted but by facts.
 
 Whilst preparations were making for determining the fate of Formosanta,
 a young stranger, mounted upon an unicorn, accompanied by his valet,
 mounted on a like animal, and bearing upon his hand a large bird,
 appeared at the barrier. The guards were surprised to observe in this
 equipage, a figure that had an air of divinity. He had, as hath been
 since related, the face of Adonis upon the body of Hercules; it was
 majesty accompanied by the graces. His black eye-brows and flowing fair
 tresses, wore a mixture of beauty unknown at Babylon, and charmed all
 observers. The whole amphitheatre rose up, the better to view the
 stranger. All the ladies of the court viewed him with looks of
 astonishment. Formosanta herself, who had hitherto kept her eyes fixed
 upon the ground, raised them and blushed. The three kings turned pale.
 The spectators, in comparing Formosanta with the stranger, cried out,
 "There is no other in the world, but this young man, who can be so
 handsome as the princess."
 
 The ushers, struck with astonishment, asked him if he was a king? The
 stranger replied, that he had not that honor, but that he had come from
 a distant country, excited by curiosity, to see if there were any king
 worthy of Formosanta. He was introduced into the first row of the
 amphitheatre, with his valet, his two unicorns, and his bird. He
 saluted, with great respect, Belus, his daughter, the three kings, and
 all the assembly. He then took his seat, not without blushing. His two
 unicorns lay down at his feet; his bird perched upon his shoulder; and
 his valet, who carried a little bag, placed himself by his side.
 
 The trials began. The bow of Nimrod was taken out of its golden case.
 The first master of the ceremonies, followed by fifty pages, and
 preceded by twenty trumpets, presented it to the king of Egypt, who made
 his priests bless it; and supporting it upon the head of the bull Apis,
 he did not question his gaining this first victory. He dismounted, and
 came into the middle of the circus. He tries, exerts all his strength,
 and makes such ridiculous contortions, that the whole amphitheatre
 re-echoes with laughter, and Formosanta herself could not help smiling.
 
 His high almoner approached him:
 
 "Let your majesty give up this idle honor, which depends entirely upon
 the nerves and muscles. You will triumph in every thing else. You will
 conquer the lion, as you are possessed of the favor of Osiris. The
 Princess of Babylon is to belong to the prince who is most sagacious,
 and you have solved enigmas. She is to wed the most virtuous: you are
 such, as you have been educated by the priests of Egypt. The most
 generous is to marry her, and you have presented her with two of the
 handsomest crocodiles, and two of the finest rats in all the Delta. You
 are possessed of the bull Apis, and the books of Hermes, which are the
 scarcest things in the universe. No one can hope to dispute Formosanta
 with you."
 
 "You are in the right," said the King of Egypt, and resumed his throne.
 
 The bow was then put in the hands of the king of India. It blistered his
 hands for a fortnight; but he consoled himself in presuming that the
 Scythian King would not be more fortunate than himself.
 
 The Scythian handled the bow in his turn. He united skill with strength.
 The bow seemed to have some elasticity in his hands. He bent it a
 little, but he could not bring it near a curve. The spectators, who had
 been prejudiced in his favor by his agreeable aspect, lamented his ill
 success, and concluded that the beautiful princess would never be
 married.
 
 The unknown youth leaped into the arena and addressing himself to the
 king of Scythia said:
 
 "Your majesty need not be surprised at not having entirely succeeded.
 These ebony bows are made in my country. There is a peculiar method in
 using them. Your merit is greater in having bent it, than if I were to
 curve it."
 
 He then took an arrow and placing it upon the string, bent the bow of
 Nimrod, and shot the arrow beyond the gates. A million hands at once
 applauded the prodigy. Babylon re-echoed with acclamations; and all the
 ladies agreed it was fortunate for so handsome a youth to be so strong.
 
 He then took out of his pocket a small ivory tablet, wrote upon it with
 a golden pencil, fixed the tablet to the bow, and then presented it to
 the princess with such a grace as charmed every spectator. He then
 modestly returned to his place between his bird and his valet. All
 Babylon was in astonishment; the three kings were confounded, whilst the
 stranger did not seem to pay the least attention to what had happened.
 
 Formosanta was still more surprised to read upon the ivory tablet, tied
 to the bow, these lines, written in the best Chaldean:
 
      L'arc de Nembrod est celui de la guerre;
      L'arc de l'amour est celui du bonheur;
      Vous le portez. Par vous ce Dieu vainqueur
      Est devenu le maitre de la terre.
      Trois Rois puissants, trois rivaux aujourd'hui,
      Osent pretendre a l'honneur de vous plaire.
      Je ne sais pas qui votre cœur prefere,
      Mais l'univers sera jaloux de lui.
 
     [The bow of Nimrod is that of war;
      The bow of love is that of happiness
      Which you possess. Through you this conquering God
      Has become master of the earth.
      Three powerful kings,--three rivals now,
      Dare aspire to the honor of pleasing you.
      I know not whom your heart may prefer,
      But the universe will be jealous of him.]
 
 This little madrigal did not displease the princess; but it was
 criticised by some of the lords of the ancient court, who said that, in
 former times, Belus would have been compared to the sun, and Formosanta
 to the moon; his neck to a tower, and her breast to a bushel of wheat.
 They said the stranger had no sort of imagination, and that he had lost
 sight of the rules of true poetry, but all the ladies thought the verses
 very gallant. They were astonished that a man who handled a bow so well
 should have so much wit. The lady of honor to the princess said to her:
 
 "Madam, what great talents are here entirely lost? What benefit will
 this young man derive from his wit, and his skill with Nimrod's bow?"
 
 "Being admired!" said Formosanta.
 
 "Ah!" said the lady, "one more madrigal, and he might well be beloved."
 
 The king of Babylon, having consulted his sages, declared that though
 none of these kings could bend the bow of Nimrod, yet, nevertheless, his
 daughter was to be married, and that she should belong to him who could
 conquer the great lion, which was purposely kept in training in his
 great menagerie.
 
 The king of Egypt, upon whose education all the wisdom of Egypt had been
 exhausted, judged it very ridiculous to expose a king to the ferocity of
 wild beasts in order to be married. He acknowledged that he considered
 the possession of Formosanta of inestimable value; but he believed that
 if the lion should strangle him, he could never wed this fair
 Babylonian. The king of India held similar views to the king of Egypt.
 They both concluded that the king of Babylon was laughing at them, and
 that they should send for armies to punish him--that they had many
 subjects who would think themselves highly honored to die in the service
 of their masters, without it costing them a single hair of their sacred
 heads,--that they could easily dethrone the king of Babylon, and then
 they would draw lots for the fair Formosanta.
 
 This agreement being made, the two kings sent each an express into his
 respective country, with orders to assemble three hundred thousand men
 to carry off Formosanta.
 
 However, the king of Scythia descended alone into the arena, scimitar in
 hand. He was not distractedly enamored with Formosanta's charms. Glory
 till then had been his only passion, and it had led him to Babylon. He
 was willing to show that if the kings of India and Egypt were so prudent
 as not to tilt with lions, he was courageous enough not to decline the
 combat, and he would repair the honor of diadems. His uncommon valor
 would not even allow him to avail himself of the assistance of his
 tiger. He advanced singly, slightly armed with a shell casque ornamented
 with gold, and shaded with three horses' tails as white as snow.
 
 One of the most enormous and ferocious lions that fed upon the
 Antilibanian mountains was let loose upon him. His tremendous paws
 appeared capable of tearing the three kings to pieces at once, and his
 gullet to devour them. The two proud champions fled with the utmost
 precipitancy and in the most rapid manner to each other. The courageous
 Scythian plunged his sword into the lion's mouth; but the point meeting
 with one of those thick teeth that nothing can penetrate, was broken;
 and the monster of the woods, more furious from his wound, had already
 impressed his fearful claws into the monarch's sides.
 
 The unknown youth, touched with the peril of so brave a prince, leaped
 into the arena swift as lightning, and cut off the lion's head with as
 much dexterity as we have lately seen, in our carousals, youthful
 knights knock off the heads of black images.
 
 Then drawing out a small box, he presented it to the Scythian king,
 saying to him.
 
 "Your majesty will here find the genuine dittany, which grows in my
 country. Your glorious wounds will be healed in a moment. Accident alone
 prevented your triumph over the lion. Your valor is not the less to be
 admired."
 
 The Scythian king, animated more with gratitude than jealousy, thanked
 his benefactor; and, after having tenderly embraced him, returned to his
 seat to apply the dittany to his wounds.
 
 The stranger gave the lion's head to his valet, who, having washed it at
 the great fountain which was beneath the amphitheatre, and drained all
 the blood, took an iron instrument out of his little bag, with which
 having drawn the lion's forty teeth, he supplied their place with forty
 diamonds of equal size.
 
 His master, with his usual modesty, returned to his place; he gave the
 lion's head to his bird:--"Beauteous bird," said he, "carry this small
 homage, and lay it at the feet of Formosanta."
 
 [Illustration: "The unknown youth, touched with the peril of so brave a
 prince, leaped into the arena swift as lightning, and cut off the lion's
 head."]
 
 The bird winged its way with the dreadful triumph in one of its talons,
 and presented it to the princess; bending with humility his neck, and
 crouching before her. The sparkling diamonds dazzled the eyes of every
 beholder. Such magnificence was unknown even in superb Babylon. The
 emerald, the topaz, the sapphire, and the pyrope, were as yet considered
 as the most precious ornaments. Belus and the whole court were struck
 with admiration. The bird which presented this present surprised them
 still more. It was of the size of an eagle, but its eyes were as soft
 and tender as those of the eagle are fierce and threatening. Its bill
 was rose color, and seemed somewhat to resemble Formosanta's handsome
 mouth. Its neck represented all the colors of Iris, but still more
 striking and brilliant. Gold, in a thousand shades, glittered upon its
 plumage. Its feet resembled a mixture of silver and purple. And the
 tails of those beautiful birds, which have since drawn Juno's car, did
 not equal the splendor of this incomparable bird.
 
 The attention, curiosity, astonishment, and ecstasy of the whole court
 were divided between the jewels and the bird. It had perched upon the
 balustrade between Belus and his daughter Formosanta. She petted it,
 caressed it, and kissed it. It seemed to receive her attentions with a
 mixture of pleasure and respect. When the princess gave the bird a kiss,
 it returned the embrace, and then looked upon her with languishing eyes.
 She gave it biscuits and pistachios, which it received in its
 purple-silvered claw, and carried to its bill with inexpressible grace.
 
 Belus, who had attentively considered the diamonds, concluded that
 scarce any one of his provinces could repay so valuable a present. He
 ordered that more magnificent gifts should be prepared for the stranger
 than those destined for the three monarchs, "This young man," said he,
 "is doubtless son to the emperor of China; or of that part of the world
 called Europe, which I have heard spoken of; or of Africa, which is said
 to be in the vicinity of the kingdom of Egypt."
 
 He immediately sent his first equerry to compliment the stranger, and
 ask him whether he was himself the sovereign, or son to the sovereign of
 one of those empires; and why, being possessed of such surprising
 treasures, he had come with nothing but his valet and a little bag?
 
 Whilst the equerry advanced toward the amphitheatre to execute his
 commission, another valet arrived upon an unicorn. This valet,
 addressing himself to the young man, said. "Ormar, your father is
 approaching the end of his life: I am come to acquaint you with it."
 
 The stranger raised his eyes to heaven, whilst tears streamed from them,
 and answered only by saying, "_Let us depart_."
 
 The equerry, after having paid Belus's compliments to the conqueror of
 the lion, to the giver of the forty diamonds, and to the master of the
 beautiful bird, asked the valet, "Of what kingdom was the father of this
 young hero sovereign?"
 
 The valet replied:
 
 "His father is an old shepherd, who is much beloved in his district."
 
 During this conversation, the stranger had already mounted his unicorn.
 He said to the equerry:
 
 "My lord, vouchsafe to prostrate me at the feet of King Belus and his
 daughter. I must entreat her to take particular care of the bird I leave
 with her, as it is a nonpareil like herself."
 
 In uttering these last words he set off, and flew like lightning. The
 two valets followed him, and in an instant he was out of sight.
 
 Formosanta could not refrain from shrieking. The bird, turning toward
 the amphitheatre where his master had been seated, seemed greatly
 afflicted to find him gone; then viewing steadfastly the princess, and
 gently rubbing her beautiful hand with his bill, he seemed to devote
 himself to her service.
 
 Belus, more astonished than ever, hearing that this very extraordinary
 young man was the son of a shepherd, could not believe it. He dispatched
 messengers after him; but they soon returned with the information, that
 the three unicorns, upon which these men were mounted, could not be
 overtaken; and that, according to the rate they went, they must go a
 hundred leagues a day.
 
 Every one reasoned upon this strange adventure, and wearied themselves
 with conjectures. How can the son of a shepherd make a present of forty
 large diamonds? How comes it that he is mounted upon an unicorn? This
 bewildered them, and Formosanta, whilst she caressed her bird, was sunk
 into a profound reverie.
 
 
 [1] The phœix--born of myth and fable--was supposed to have originated
 in Arabia. In size it resembled an eagle, and was said to exist singly.
 At the end of six hundred years, it built for itself a nest filled with
 myrrh and the choicest spices. This was ignited by the ardent rays of
 the sun, and in it the phœnix was consumed in flames of fragrance. It
 was believed, however, that it soon rose again, from its own ashes, in
 renewed youth, strength, and beauty; and therefore it was considered by
 the ancients as symbolical of "the resurrection" and also of
 immortality.--E.
 
 
 
 
 II.
 
 THE KING OF BABYLON CONVENES HIS COUNCIL, AND CONSULTS THE ORACLE.
 
 
 Princess Aldea, Formosanta's cousin-german, who was very well shaped,
 and almost as handsome as the King's daughter, said to her:
 
 "Cousin, I know not whether this demi-god be the son of a shepherd, but
 methinks he has fulfilled all the conditions stipulated for your
 marriage. He has bent Nimrod's bow; he has conquered the lion; he has a
 good share of sense, having written for you extempore a very pretty
 madrigal. After having presented you with forty large diamonds, you
 cannot deny that he is the most generous of men. In his bird he
 possessed the most curious thing upon earth. His virtue cannot be
 equaled, since he departed without hesitation as soon as he learned his
 father was ill, though he might have remained and enjoyed the pleasure
 of your society. The oracle is fulfilled in every particular, except
 that wherein he is to overcome his rivals. But he has done more; he has
 saved the life of the only competitor he had to fear; and when the
 object is to surpass the other two, I believe you cannot doubt but that
 he will easily succeed."
 
 "All that you say is very true," replied Formosanta: "but is it possible
 that the greatest of men, and perhaps the most amiable too, should be
 the son of a shepherd?"
 
 The lady of honor, joining in the conversation, said that the title of
 shepherd was frequently given to kings--that they were called shepherds
 because they attended very closely to their flocks--that this was
 doubtless a piece of ill-timed pleasantry in his valet--that this young
 hero had not come so badly equipped, but to show how much his personal
 merit alone was above the fastidious parade of kings. The princess made
 no answer, but in giving her bird a thousand tender kisses.
 
 A great festival was nevertheless prepared for the three kings, and for
 all the princes who had come to the feast. The king's daughter and niece
 were to do the honors. The king distributed presents worthy the
 magnificence of Babylon. Belus, during the time the repast was being
 served, assembled his council to discuss the marriage of the beautiful
 Formosanta, and this is the way he delivered himself as a great
 politician:
 
 "I am old: I know not what is best to do with my daughter, or upon whom
 to bestow her. He who deserves her is nothing but a mean shepherd. The
 kings of India and Egypt are cowards. The king of the Scythians would be
 very agreeable to me, but he has not performed any one of the conditions
 imposed. I will again consult the oracle. In the meantime, deliberate
 among you, and we will conclude agreeably to what the oracle says; for a
 king should follow nothing but the dictates of the immortal gods."
 
 He then repaired to the temple: the oracle answered in few words
 according to custom: _Thy daughter shall not be married until she hath
 traversed the globe_. In astonishment, Belus returned to the council,
 and related this answer.
 
 All the ministers had a profound respect for oracles. They therefore all
 agreed, or at least appeared to agree, that they were the foundation of
 religion--that reason should be mute before them--that it was by their
 means that kings reigned over their people--that without oracles there
 would be neither virtue nor repose upon earth.
 
 At length, after having testified the most profound veneration for them,
 they almost all concluded that this oracle was impertinent, and should
 not be obeyed--that nothing could be more indecent for a young woman,
 and particularly the daughter of the great king of Babylon, than to run
 about, without any particular destination--that this was the most
 certain method to prevent her being married, or else engage her in a
 clandestine, shameful, and ridiculous union that,--in a word, this
 oracle had not common sense.
 
 The youngest of the ministers, named Onadase, who had more sense than
 the rest, said that the oracle doubtless meant some pilgrimage of
 devotion, and offered to be the princess's guide. The council approved
 of his opinion, but every one was for being her equerry. The king
 determined that the princess might go three hundred parasangs upon the
 road to Arabia, to the temple whose saint had the reputation of
 procuring young women happy marriages, and that the dean of the council
 should accompany her. After this determination they went to supper.

 III.
 
 ROYAL FESTIVAL GIVEN IN HONOR OF THE KINGLY VISITORS. THE BIRD CONVERSES
 ELOQUENTLY WITH FORMOSANTA.
 
 
 In the centre of the gardens, between two cascades, an oval saloon,
 three hundred feet in diameter was erected, whose azure roof,
 intersected with golden stars, represented all the constellations and
 planets, each in its proper station; and this ceiling turned about, as
 well as the canopy, by machines as invisible as those which direct the
 celestial spheres. A hundred thousand flambeaux, inclosed in rich
 crystal cylinders, illuminated the gardens and the dining-hall. A
 buffet, with steps, contained twenty thousand vases and golden dishes;
 and opposite the buffet, upon other steps, were seated a great number of
 musicians. Two other amphitheatres were decked out; the one with the
 fruits of each season, the other with crystal decanters, that sparkled
 with the choicest wines.
 
 The guests took their seats round a table divided into compartments that
 resembled flowers and fruits, all in precious stones. The beautiful
 Formosanta was placed between the kings of India and Egypt--the amiable
 Aldea next the king of Scythia. There were about thirty princes, and
 each was seated next one of the handsomest ladies of the court. The king
 of Babylon, who was in the middle, opposite his daughter, seemed divided
 between the chagrin of being yet unable to effect her marriage, and the
 pleasure of still beholding her. Formosanta asked leave to place her
 bird upon the table next her; the king approved of it.
 
 The music, which continued during the repast, furnished every prince
 with an opportunity of conversing with his female neighbor. The festival
 was as agreeable as it was magnificent. A ragout was served before
 Formosanta, which her father was very fond of. The princess said it
 should be carried to his majesty. The bird immediately took hold of it,
 and carried it in a miraculous manner to the king. Never was any thing
 more astonishing witnessed. Belus caressed it as much as his daughter
 had done. The bird afterward took its flight to return to her. It
 displayed, in flying, so fine a tail, and its extended wings set forth
 such a variety of brilliant colors--the gold of its plumage made such a
 dazzling eclat, that all eyes were fixed upon it. All the musicians were
 struck motionless, and their instruments afforded harmony no longer.
 None ate, no one spoke, nothing but a buzzing of admiration was to be
 heard. The Princess of Babylon kissed it during the whole supper,
 without considering whether there were any kings in the world. Those of
 India and Egypt felt their spite and indignation rekindle with double
 force, and they resolved speedily to set their three hundred thousand
 men in motion to obtain revenge.
 
 As for the king of Scythia, he was engaged in entertaining the beautiful
 Aldea. His haughty soul despising, without malice, Formosanta's
 inattention, had conceived for her more indifference than resentment.
 "She is handsome," said he, "I acknowledge: but she appears to me one of
 those women who are entirely taken up with their own beauty, and who
 fancy that mankind are greatly obliged to them when they deign to appear
 in public. I should prefer an ugly complaisant woman, that exhibited
 some amiability, to that beautiful statue. You have, madam, as many
 charms as she possesses, and you, at least, condescend to converse with
 strangers. I acknowledge to you with the sincerity of a Scythian, that I
 prefer you to your cousin."
 
 He was, however, mistaken in regard to the character of Formosanta. She
 was not so disdainful as she appeared. But his compliments were very
 well received by the princess Aldea. Their conversation became very
 interesting. They were well contented, and already certain of one
 another before they left the table. After supper the guests walked in
 the groves. The king of Scythia and Aldea did not fail to seek for a
 place of retreat. Aldea, who was sincerity itself, thus declared herself
 to the prince:
 
 "I do not hate my cousin, though she be handsomer than myself, and is
 destined for the throne of Babylon. The honor of pleasing you may very
 well stand in the stead of charms. I prefer Scythia with you, to the
 crown of Babylon without you. But this crown belongs to me by right, if
 there be any right in the world; for I am of the elder branch of the
 Nimrod family, and Formosanta is only of the younger. Her grandfather
 dethroned mine, and put him to death."
 
 "Such, then, are the rights of inheritance in the royal house of
 Babylon!" said the Scythian. "What was your grandfather's name?"
 
 "He was called Aldea, like me. My father bore the same name. He was
 banished to the extremity of the empire with my mother; and Belus, after
 their death, having nothing to fear from me, was willing to bring me up
 with his daughter. But he has resolved that I shall never marry."
 
 "I will avenge the cause of your grandfather--of your father and also
 your own cause," said the king of Scythia. "I am responsible for your
 being married. I will carry you off the day after to-morrow by
 day-break--for we must dine to-morrow with the king of Babylon--and I
 will return and support your rights with three hundred thousand men."
 
 "I agree to it," said the beauteous Aldea: and, after having mutually
 pledged their words of honor, they separated.
 
 The incomparable Formosanta, before retiring to rest, had ordered a
 small orange tree, in a silver case, to be placed by the side of her
 bed, that her bird might perch upon it. Her curtains had long been
 drawn, but she was not in the least disposed to sleep. Her heart was
 agitated, and her imagination excited. The charming stranger was ever in
 her thoughts. She fancied she saw him shooting an arrow with Nimrod's
 bow. She contemplated him in the act of cutting off the lion's head. She
 repeated his madrigal. At length, she saw him retiring from the crowd
 upon his unicorn. Tears, sighs, and lamentations overwhelmed her at this
 reflection. At intervals, she cried out: "Shall I then never see him
 more? Will he never return?"
 
 "He will surely return," replied the bird from the top of the orange
 tree. "Can one have seen you once, and not desire to see you again?"
 
 "Heavens! eternal powers! my bird speaks the purest Chaldean." In
 uttering these words she drew back the curtain, put out her hand to him,
 and knelt upon her bed, saying:
 
 "Art thou a god descended upon earth? Art thou the great Oromasdes
 concealed under this beautiful plumage? If thou art, restore me this
 charming young man."
 
 "I am nothing but a winged animal," replied the bird; "but I was born at
 the time when all animals still spoke; when birds, serpents, asses,
 horses, and griffins, conversed familiarly with man. I would not speak
 before company, lest your ladies of honor should have taken me for a
 sorcerer. I would not discover myself to any but you."
 
 Formosanta was speechless, bewildered, and intoxicated with so many
 wonders. Desirous of putting a hundred questions to him at once, she at
 length asked him how old he was.
 
 "Only twenty-seven thousand nine hundred years and six months. I date my
 age from the little revolution of the equinoxes, and which is
 accomplished in about twenty-eight thousand of your years. There are
 revolutions of a much greater extent, so are there beings much older
 than me. It is twenty-two thousand years since I learnt Chaldean in one
 of my travels. I have always had a very great taste for the Chaldean
 language, but my brethren, the other animals, have renounced speaking in
 your climate."
 
 "And why so, my divine bird?"
 
 "Alas! because men have accustomed themselves to eat us, instead of
 conversing and instructing themselves with us. Barbarians! should they
 not have been convinced, that having the same organs with them, the same
 sentiments, the same wants, the same desires, we have also what is
 called a soul, the same as themselves;--that we are their brothers, and
 that none should be dressed and eaten but the wicked? We are so far your
 brothers, that the Supreme Being, the Omnipotent and Eternal Being,
 having made a compact with men, expressly comprehended us in the treaty.
 He forbade you to nourish yourselves with our blood, and we to suck
 yours.
 
 "The fables of your ancient Locman, translated into so many languages,
 will be a testimony eternally subsisting of the happy commerce you
 formerly carried on with us. They all begin with these words: 'In the
 time when beasts spoke.' It is true, there are many families among you
 who keep up an incessant conversation with their dogs; but the dogs have
 resolved not to answer, since they have been compelled by whipping to go
 a hunting, and become accomplices in the murder of our ancient and
 common friends, stags, deers, hares, and partridges.
 
 "You have still some ancient poems in which horses speak, and your
 coachmen daily address them in words; but in so barbarous a manner, and
 in uttering such infamous expressions, that horses, though formerly
 entertaining so great a kindness for you, now detest you.
 
 "The country which is the residence of your charming stranger, the most
 perfect of men, is the only one in which your species has continued to
 love ours, and to converse with us; and this is the only country in the
 world where men are just."
 
 "And where is the country of my dear incognito? What is the name of his
 empire? For I will no more believe he is a shepherd than that you are a
 bat."
 
 "His country, is that of the Gangarids, a wise, virtuous, and invincible
 people, who inhabit the eastern shore of the Ganges. The name of my
 friend is Amazan. He is no king; and I know not whether he would so
 humble himself as to be one. He has too great a love for his fellow
 countrymen. He is a shepherd like them. But do not imagine that those
 shepherds resemble yours; who, covered with rags and tatters, watch
 their sheep, who are better clad than themselves; who groan under the
 burden of poverty, and who pay to an extortioner half the miserable
 stipend of wages which they receive from their masters. The Gangaridian
 shepherds are all born equal, and own the innumerable herds which cover
 their vast fields and subsist on the abundant verdure. These flocks are
 never killed. It is a horrid crime, in that favored country, to kill and
 eat a fellow creature. Their wool is finer and more brilliant than the
 finest silk, and constitutes the greatest traffic of the East. Besides,
 the land of the Gangarids produces all that can flatter the desires of
 man. Those large diamonds that Amazan had the honor of presenting you
 with, are from a mine that belongs to him. An unicorn, on which you saw
 him mounted, is the usual animal the Gangarids ride upon. It is the
 finest, the proudest, most terrible, and at the same time most gentle
 animal that ornaments the earth. A hundred Gangarids, with as many
 unicorns,[1] would be sufficient to disperse innumerable armies. Two
 centuries ago, a king of India was mad enough to attempt to conquer
 this nation. He appeared, followed by ten thousand elephants and a
 million of warriors. The unicorns pierced the elephants, just as I have
 seen upon your table beads pierced in golden brochets. The warriors fell
 under the sabres of the Gangarids like crops of rice mowed by the people
 of the East. The king was taken prisoner, with upwards of six thousand
 men. He was bathed in the salutary water of the Ganges, and followed the
 regimen of the country, which consists only of vegetables, of which
 nature hath there been amazingly liberal to nourish every breathing
 creature. Men who are fed with carnivorous aliments, and drenched with
 spirituous liquors, have a sharp adust blood, which turns their brains a
 hundred different ways. Their chief rage is a fury to spill their
 brother's blood, and, laying waste fertile plains, to reign over
 church-yards. Six full months were taken up in curing the king of India
 of his disorder. When the physicians judged that his pulse had become
 natural, they certified this to the council of the Gangarids. The
 council then followed the advice of the unicorns and humanely sent back
 the king of India, his silly court, and impotent warriors, to their own
 country. This lesson made them wise, and from that time the Indians
 respected the Gangarids, as ignorant men, willing to be instructed,
 revere the philosophers they cannot equal.
 
 "Apropos, my dear bird," said the princess to him, "do the Gangarids
 profess any religion? have they one?"
 
 "Yes, we meet to return thanks to God on the days of the full moon; the
 men in a great temple made of cedar, and the women in another, to
 prevent their devotion being diverted. All the birds assemble in a
 grove, and the quadrupeds on a fine down. We thank God for all the
 benefits he has bestowed upon us. We have in particular some parrots
 _that preach wonderfully well_.
 
 "Such is the country of my dear Amazan; there I reside. My friendship
 for him is as great as the love with which he has inspired you. If you
 will credit me, we will set out together, and you shall pay him a
 visit."
 
 "Really, my dear bird, this is a very pretty invitation of yours,"
 replied the princess smiling, and who flamed with desire to undertake
 the journey, but did not dare say so.
 
 "I serve my friend," said the bird; "and, after the happiness of loving
 you, the greatest pleasure is to assist you."
 
 Formosanta was quite fascinated. She fancied herself transported from
 earth. All she had seen that day, all she then saw, all she heard, and
 particularly what she felt in her heart, so ravished her as far to
 surpass what those fortunate Mussulmen now feel, who, disencumbered from
 their terrestrial ties, find themselves in the ninth heaven in the arms
 of their Houris, surrounded and penetrated with glory and celestial
 felicity.
 
 
 [1] Pliny, the Roman naturalist, describes the unicorn as "a very
 ferocious beast, similar in the rest of its body to a horse, with the
 head of a deer, the feet of an elephant, the tail of a boar, a deep
 bellowing voice, and a single black horn, two cubits in length, standing
 out in the middle of its forehead." A familiar representation of this
 "ferocious beast" may be seen on the English coat of arms.--E.
 
 
 
 
 IV.
 
 THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD IS KILLED BY THE KING OF EGYPT. FORMOSANTA BEGINS A
 JOURNEY. ALDEA ELOPES WITH THE KING OF SCYTHIA.
 
 
 Formosanta passed the whole night in speaking of Amazan. She no longer
 called him any thing but her shepherd; and from this time it was that
 the names of shepherd and lover were indiscriminately used throughout
 every nation.
 
 Sometimes she asked the bird whether Amazan had had any other
 mistresses. It answered, "No," and she was at the summit of felicity.
 Sometimes she asked how he passed his life; and she, with transport,
 learned, that it was employed in doing good; in cultivating arts, in
 penetrating into the secrets of nature, and improving himself. She at
 times wanted to know if the soul of her lover was of the same nature as
 that of her bird; how it happened that it had lived twenty thousand
 years, when her lover was not above eighteen or nineteen. She put a
 hundred such questions, to which the bird replied with such discretion
 as excited her curiosity. At length sleep closed their eyes, and yielded
 up Formosanta to the sweet delusion of dreams sent by the gods, which
 sometimes surpass reality itself, and which all the philosophy of the
 Chaldeans can scarce explain.
 
 Formosanta did not awaken till very late. The day was far advanced when
 the king, her father, entered her chamber. The bird received his majesty
 with respectful politeness, went before him, fluttered his wings,
 stretched his neck, and then replaced himself upon his orange tree. The
 king seated himself upon his daughter's bed, whose dreams had made her
 still more beautiful. His large beard approached her lovely face, and
 after having embraced her, he spoke to her in these words:
 
 "My dear daughter, you could not yesterday find a husband agreeable to
 my wishes; you nevertheless must marry; the prosperity of my empire
 requires it. I have consulted the oracle, which you know never errs, and
 which directs all my conduct. His commands are, that you should traverse
 the globe. You must therefore begin your journey."
 
 "Ah! doubtless to the Gangarids," said the princess; and in uttering
 these words, which escaped her, she was sensible of her indiscretion.
 The king, who was utterly ignorant of geography, asked her what she
 meant by the Gangarids? She easily diverted the question. The king told
 her she must go on a pilgrimage, that he had appointed the persons who
 were to attend her--the dean of the counsellors of state, the high
 almoner, a lady of honor, a physician, an apothecary, her bird, and all
 necessary domestics.
 
 Formosanta, who had never been out of her father's palace, and who, till
 the arrival of the three kings and Amazan, had led a very insipid life,
 according to the _etiquette_ of rank and the parade of pleasure, was
 charmed at setting out upon a pilgrimage. "Who knows," said she,
 whispering to her heart, "if the gods may not inspire Amazan with the
 like desire of going to the same chapel, and I may have the happiness of
 again seeing the pilgrim?" She affectionately thanked her father, saying
 she had always entertained a secret devotion for the saint she was going
 to visit.
 
 Belus gave an excellent dinner to his guests, who were all men. They
 formed a very ill assorted company--kings, ministers, princes,
 pontiffs--all jealous of each other; all weighing their words, and
 equally embarassed with their neighbors and themselves. The repast was
 very gloomy, though they drank pretty freely. The princesses remained in
 their apartments, each meditating upon her respective journey. They
 dined at their little cover. Formosanta afterward walked in the gardens
 with her dear bird, which, to amuse her, flew from tree to tree,
 displaying his superb tail and divine plumage.
 
 The king of Egypt, who was heated with wine, not to say drunk, asked one
 of his pages for a bow and arrow. This prince was, in truth, the most
 unskillful archer in his whole kingdom. When he shot at a mark, the
 place of the greatest safety was generally the spot he aimed at. But the
 beautiful bird, flying as swiftly as the arrow, seemed to court it, and
 fell bleeding in the arms of Formosanta. The Egyptian, bursting into a
 foolish laugh, retired to his place. The princess rent the skies with
 her moans, melted into tears, tore her hair, and beat her breast. The
 dying bird said to her, in a low voice:
 
 "Burn me, and fail not to carry my ashes to the east of the ancient city
 of Aden or Eden, and expose them to the sun upon a little pile of cloves
 and cinnamon." After having uttered these words it expired. Formosanta
 was for a long time in a swoon, and revived again only to burst into
 sighs and groans. Her father, partaking of her grief, and imprecating
 the king of Egypt, did not doubt but this accident foretold some fatal
 event. He immediately went to consult the oracle, which replied: _A
 mixture of everything--life and death, infidelity and constancy, loss
 and gain, calamities and good fortune_. Neither he nor his council could
 comprehend any meaning in this reply; but, at length, he was satisfied
 with having fulfilled the duties of devotion.
 
 His daughter was bathed in tears, whilst he consulted the oracle. She
 paid the funeral obsequies to the bird, which it had directed, and
 resolved to carry its remains into Arabia at the risk of her life. It
 was burned in incombustible flax, with the orange-tree on which it used
 to perch. She gathered up the ashes in a little golden vase, set with
 rubies, and the diamonds taken from the lion's mouth. Oh! that she
 could, instead of fulfilling this melancholy duty, have burned alive the
 detestable king of Egypt! This was her sole wish. She, in spite, put to
 death the two crocodiles, his two sea horses, his two zebras, his two
 rats, and had his two mummies thrown into the Euphrates. Had she
 possessed his bull Apis, she would not have spared him.
 
 The king of Egypt, enraged at this affront, set out immediately to
 forward his three hundred thousand men. The king of India, seeing his
 ally depart, set off also on the same day, with a firm intention of
 joining his three hundred thousand Indians to the Egyptian army, the
 king of Scythia decamped in the night with the princess Aldea, fully
 resolved to fight for her at the head of three hundred thousand
 Scythians, and to restore to her the inheritance of Babylon, which was
 her right, as she had descended from the elder branch of the Nimrod
 family.
 
 As for the beautiful Formosanta, she set out at three in the morning
 with her caravan of pilgrims, flattering herself that she might go into
 Arabia, and execute the last will of her bird; and that the justice of
 the gods would restore her the dear Amazan, without whom life had become
 insupportable.
 
 When the king of Babylon awoke, he found all the company gone.
 
 "How mighty festivals terminate," said he; "and what a surprising vacuum
 they leave when the hurry is over."
 
 But he was transported with a rage truly royal, when he found that the
 princess Aldea had been carried off. He ordered all his ministers to be
 called up, and the council to be convened. Whilst they were dressing, he
 failed not to consult the oracle; but the only answer he could obtain
 was in these words, so celebrated since throughout the universe: _When
 girls are not provided for in marriage by their relatives, they marry
 themselves_.
 
 Orders were immediately issued to march three hundred thousand men
 against the king of Scythia. Thus was the torch of a most dreadful war
 lighted up, which was caused by the amusements of the finest festival
 ever given upon earth. Asia was upon the point of being over-run by four
 armies of three hundred thousand men each. It is plain that the war of
 Troy, which astonished the world some ages after, was mere child's play
 in comparison to this; but it should also be considered, that in the
 Trojans quarrel, the object was nothing more than a very immoral old
 woman, who had contrived to be twice run away with; whereas, in this
 case, the cause was tripartite--two girls and a bird.
 
 The king of India went to meet his army upon the large fine road which
 then led straight to Babylon, at Cachemir. The king of Scythia flew with
 Aldea by the fine road which led to Mount Imaus. Owing to bad
 government, all these fine roads have disappeared in the lapse of time.
 The king of Egypt had marched to the west, along the coast of the little
 Mediterranean sea, which the ignorant Hebrews have since called the
 Great Sea.
 
 [Illustration: Consulting the Oracle.]
 
 As to the charming Formosanta, she pursued the road to Bassora, planted
 with lofty palm trees, which furnished a perpetual shade, and fruit at
 all seasons. The temple in which she was to perform her devotions, was
 in Bassora itself. The saint to whom this temple had been dedicated, was
 somewhat in the style of him who was afterward adored at Lampsacus, and
 was generally successful in procuring husbands for young ladies. Indeed,
 he was the holiest saint in all Asia.
 
 Formosanta had no sort of inclination for the saint of Bassora. She only
 invoked her dear Gangaridian shepherd, her charming Amazan. She proposed
 embarking at Bassora, and landing in Arabia Felix, to perform what her
 deceased bird had commanded.
 
 At the third stage, scarce had she entered into a fine inn, where her
 harbingers had made all the necessary preparations for her, when she
 learned that the king of Egypt had arrived there also. Informed by his
 emissaries of the princess's route, he immediately altered his course,
 followed by a numerous escort. Having alighted, he placed sentinels at
 all the doors; then repaired to the beautiful Formosanta's apartment,
 when he addressed her by saying:
 
 "Miss, you are the lady I was in quest of. You paid me very little
 attention when I was at Babylon. It is just to punish scornful
 capricious women. You will, if you please, be kind enough to sup with me
 to-night; and I shall behave to you according as I am satisfied with
 you."
 
 Formosanta saw very well that she was not the strongest. She judged that
 good sense consisted in knowing how to conform to one's situation. She
 resolved to get rid of the king of Egypt by an innocent stratagem. She
 looked at him through the corners of her eyes, (which in after ages has
 been called ogling,) and then she spoke to him, with a modesty, grace,
 and sweetness, a confusion, and a thousand other charms, which would
 have made the wisest man a fool, and deceived the most discerning:
 
 "I acknowledge, sir, I always appeared with a downcast look, when you
 did the king, my father, the honor of visiting him. I had some
 apprehensions for my heart. I dreaded my too great simplicity. I
 trembled lest my father and your rivals should observe the preference I
 gave you, and which you so highly deserved. I can now declare my
 sentiments. I swear by the bull Apis, which after you is the thing I
 respect the most in the world, that your proposals have enchanted me. I
 have already supped with you at my father's, and I will sup with you
 again, without his being of the party. All that I request of you is,
 that your high almoner should drink with us. He appeared to me at
 Babylon to be an excellent guest. I have some Chiras wine remarkably
 good. I will make you both taste it. I consider you as the greatest of
 kings, and the most amiable of men."
 
 This discourse turned the king of Egypt's head. He agreed to have the
 almoner's company.
 
 "I have another favor to ask of you," said the princess, "which is to
 allow me to speak to my apothecary. Women have always some little ails
 that require attention, such as vapors in the head, palpitations of the
 heart, colics, and the like, which often require some assistance. In a
 word, I at present stand in need of my apothecary, and I hope you will
 not refuse me this slight testimony of confidence."
 
 "Miss," replied the king of Egypt, "I know life too well to refuse you
 so just a demand. I will order the apothecary to attend you whilst
 supper is preparing. I imagine you must be somewhat fatigued by the
 journey; you will also have occasion for a chambermaid; you may order
 her you like best to attend you. I will afterward wait your commands and
 convenience."
 
 He then retired, and the apothecary and the chambermaid, named Irla,
 entered. The princess had an entire confidence in her. She ordered her
 to bring six bottles of Chiras wine for supper, and to make all the
 sentinels, who had her officers under arrest, drink the same. Then she
 recommended her apothecary to infuse in all the bottles certain
 pharmaceutic drugs, which make those who take them sleep twenty-four
 hours, and with which he was always provided. She was implicitly obeyed.
 The king returned with his high almoner in about half an hour's time.
 The conversation at supper was very gay. The king and the priest emptied
 the six bottles, and acknowledged there was not such good wine in
 Egypt. The chambermaid was attentive to make the servants in waiting
 drink. As for the princess, she took great care not to drink any
 herself, saying that she was ordered by her physician a particular
 regimen. They were all presently asleep.
 
 The king of Egypt's almoner had one of the finest beards that a man of
 his rank could wear. Formosanta lopped it off very skillfully; then
 sewing it to a ribbon, she put it on her own chin. She then dressed
 herself in the priest's robes, and decked herself in all the marks of
 his dignity, and her waiting maid clad herself like the sacristan of the
 goddess Isis. At length, having furnished herself with his urn and
 jewels, she set out from the inn amidst the sentinels, who were asleep
 like their master. Her attendant had taken care to have two horses ready
 at the door. The princess could not take with her any of the officers of
 her train. They would have been stopped by the great guard.
 
 Formosanta and Irla passed through several ranks of soldiers, who,
 taking the princess for the high priest, called her, "My most Reverend
 Father in God," and asked his blessing. The two fugitives arrived in
 twenty-four hours at Bassora, before the king awoke. They then threw off
 their disguise, which might have created some suspicion. They fitted out
 with all possible expedition a ship, which carried them, by the Straits
 of Ormus, to the beautiful banks of Eden in Arabia Felix. This was that
 Eden, whose gardens were so famous, that they have since been the
 residence of the best of mankind. They were the model of the Elysian
 fields, the gardens of the Hesperides, and also those of the Fortunate
 Islands. In those warm climates men imagined there could be no greater
 felicity than shades and murmuring brooks. To live eternally in heaven
 with the Supreme Being, or to walk in the garden of paradise, was the
 same thing to those who incessantly spoke without understanding one
 another, and who could scarce have any distinct ideas or just
 expressions.
 
 As soon as the princess found herself in this land, her first care was
 to pay her dear bird the funeral obsequies he had required of her. Her
 beautiful hands prepared a small quantity of cloves and cinnamon. What
 was her surprise, when, having spread the ashes of the bird upon this
 funeral pyre, she saw it blaze of itself! All was presently consumed.
 In the place of the ashes there appeared nothing but a large egg, from
 whence she saw her bird issue more brilliant than ever. This was one of
 the most happy moments the princess had ever experienced in her whole
 life. There was but another that could ever be dearer to her; it was the
 object of her wishes, but almost beyond her hopes.
 
 "I plainly see," said she, to the bird, "you are the phœnix which I
 have heard so much spoken of. I am almost ready to expire with joy and
 astonishment. I did not believe in your resurrection; but it is my good
 fortune to be convinced of it."
 
 "Resurrection, in fact," said the phœnix to her, "is one of the most
 simple things in the world. There is nothing more in being born twice
 than once. Every thing in this world is the effect of resurrection.
 Caterpillars are regenerated into butterflies; a kernel put into the
 earth is regenerated into a tree. All animals buried in the earth
 regenerate into vegetation, herbs, and plants, and nourish other
 animals, of which they speedily compose part of the substance. All
 particles which compose bodies are transformed into different beings. It
 is true, that I am the only one to whom Oromasdes[1] has granted the
 favor of regenerating in my own form."
 
 Formosanta, who from the moment she first saw Amazan and the phœnix,
 had passed all her time in a round of astonishment, said to him:
 
 "I can easily conceive that the Supreme Being may form out of your ashes
 a phœnix nearly resembling yourself; but that you should be precisely
 the same person, that you should have the same soul, is a thing, I
 acknowledge, I cannot very clearly comprehend. What became of your soul
 when I carried you in my pocket after your death?"
 
 "Reflect one moment! Is it not as easy for the great Oromasdes to
 continue action upon a single atom of my being, as to begin afresh this
 action? He had before granted me sensation, memory, and thought. He
 grants them to me again. Whether he united this favor to an atom of
 elementary fire, latent within me, or to the assemblage of my organs,
 is, in reality, of no consequence. Men, as well as phœnixes, are
 entirely ignorant how things come to pass, but the greatest favor the
 Supreme Being has bestowed upon me, is to regenerate me for you. Oh!
 that I may pass the twenty-eight thousand years which I have still to
 live before my next resurrection, with you and my dear Amazan."
 
 "My dear phœnix, remember what you first told me at Babylon, which I
 shall never forget, and which flattered me with the hope of again seeing
 my dear shepherd, whom I idolize; 'we must absolutely pay the Gangarids
 a visit together,' and I must carry Amazan back with me to Babylon."
 
 "This is precisely my design," said the phœnix. "There is not a
 moment to lose. We must go in search of Amazan by the shortest road,
 that is, through the air. There are in Arabia Felix two griffins,[2] who
 are my particular friends, and who live only a hundred and fifty
 thousand leagues from here. I am going to write to them by the pigeon
 post, and they will be here before night. We shall have time to make you
 a convenient palankeen, with drawers, in which you may place your
 provisions. You will be quite at your ease in this vehicle, with your
 maid. These two griffins are the most vigorous of their kind. Each of
 them will support one of the poles of the canopy between their claws.
 But, once for all, time is very precious."
 
 He instantly went with Formosanta to order the carriage at an
 upholsterer's of his acquaintance. It was made complete in four hours.
 In the drawers were placed small fine loaves, biscuits superior to those
 of Babylon, large lemons, pine-apples, cocoa, and pistachio nuts, Eden
 wine, which is as superior to that of Chiras, as Chiras is to that of
 Surinam.
 
 The two griffins arrived at Eden at the appointed time. The vehicle was
 as light as it was commodious and solid, and Formosanta and Irla placed
 themselves in it. The two griffins carried it off like a feather. The
 phœnix sometimes flew after it, and sometimes perched upon its roof.
 The two griffins winged their way toward the Ganges with the velocity of
 an arrow which rends the air. They never stopped but a moment at night
 for the travelers to take some refreshment, and the carriers to take a
 draught of water.
 
 They at length reached the country of the Gangarids. The princess's
 heart palpitated with hope, love, and joy. The phœnix stopped the
 vehicle before Amazan's house; but Amazan had been absent from home
 three hours, without any one knowing whither he had gone.
 
 There are no words, even in the Gangaridian language, that could express
 Formosanta's extreme despair.
 
 "Alas! this is what I dreaded," said the phœnix: "the three hours
 which you passed at the inn, upon the road to Bassora, with that
 wretched king of Egypt, have perhaps been at the price of the happiness
 of your whole life. I very much fear we have lost Amazan, without the
 possibility of recovering him."
 
 He then asked the servants if he could salute the mother of Amazan? They
 answered, that her husband had died only two days before, and she could
 speak to no one. The phœnix, who was not without influence in the
 house, introduced the princess of Babylon into a saloon, the walls of
 which were covered with orange-tree wood inlaid with ivory. The inferior
 shepherds and shepherdesses, who were dressed in long white garments,
 with gold colored trimmings, served up, in a hundred plain porcelain
 baskets, a hundred various delicacies, amongst which no disguised
 carcasses were to be seen. They consisted of rice, sago, vermicelli,
 macaroni, omelets, milk, eggs, cream, cheese, pastry of every kind,
 vegetables, fruits, peculiarly fragrant and grateful to the taste, of
 which no idea can be formed in other climates; and they were accompanied
 with a profusion of refreshing liquors superior to the finest wine.
 
 Whilst the princess regaled herself, seated upon a bed of roses, four
 peacocks, who were luckily mute, fanned her with their brilliant wings;
 two hundred birds, one hundred shepherds and shepherdesses, warbled a
 concert in two different choirs; the nightingales, thistlefinches,
 linnets, chaffinches, sung the higher notes with the shepherdesses, and
 the shepherds sung the tenor and bass. The princess acknowledged, that
 if there was more magnificence at Babylon, nature was infinitely more
 agreeable among the Gangarids; but whilst this consolatory and
 voluptuous music was playing, tears flowed from her eyes, whilst she
 said to the damsel Irla:
 
 "These shepherds and shepherdesses, these nightingales, these linnets,
 are making love; and for my part, I am deprived of the company of the
 Gangaridian hero, the worthy object of my most tender thoughts."
 
 Whilst she was taking this collation, her tears and admiration kept pace
 with each other, and the phœnix addressed himself to Amazan's mother,
 saying:
 
 "Madam, you cannot avoid seeing the princess of Babylon; you know--"
 
 "I know every thing," said she, "even her adventure at the inn, upon the
 road to Bassora. A blackbird related the whole to me this morning; and
 this cruel blackbird is the cause of my son's going mad, and leaving his
 paternal abode."
 
 "You have not been informed, then, that the princess regenerated me?"
 
 "No, my dear child, the blackbird told me you were dead, and this made
 me inconsolable. I was so afflicted at this loss, the death of my
 husband, and the precipitate flight of my son, that I ordered my door to
 be shut to every one. But since the princess of Babylon has done me the
 honor of paying me a visit, I beg she may be immediately introduced. I
 have matters of great importance to acquaint her with, and I choose you
 should be present."
 
 She then went to meet the princess in another saloon. She could not walk
 very well. This lady was about three hundred years old; but she had
 still some agreeable vestiges of beauty. It might be conjectured, that
 about her two hundred and fortieth, or two hundred and fiftieth year,
 she must have been a most charming woman. She received Formosanta with a
 respectful nobleness, blended with an air of interest and sorrow, which
 made a very lively impression upon the princess.
 
 Formosanta immediately paid her the compliments of condolence upon her
 husband's death.
 
 "Alas!" said the widow, "you have more reason to lament his death than
 you imagine."
 
 "I am, doubtless, greatly afflicted," said Formosanta; "he was father
 to--." Here a flood of tears prevented her from going on. "For his sake
 only I undertook this journey, in which I have so narrowly escaped many
 dangers. For him I left my father, and the most splendid court in the
 universe. I was detained by a King of Egypt, whom I detest. Having
 escaped from this tyrant, I have traversed the air in search of the only
 man I love. When I arrive, he flies from me!" Here sighs and tears
 stopped her impassioned harangue.
 
 His mother then said to her:
 
 "When the king of Egypt made you his prisoner,--when you supped with him
 at an inn upon the road to Bassora,--when your beautiful hands filled
 him bumpers of Chiras wine, did you observe a blackbird that flew about
 the room?"
 
 "Yes, really," said the princess, "I now recollect there was such a
 bird, though at that time I did not pay it the least attention. But in
 collecting my ideas, I now remember well, that at the instant when the
 king of Egypt rose from the table to give me a kiss, the blackbird flew
 out at the window giving a loud cry, and never appeared after."
 
 "Alas! madam," resumed Amazan's mother, "this is precisely the cause of
 all our misfortunes; my son had dispatched this blackbird to gain
 intelligence of your health, and all that passed at Babylon. He proposed
 speedily to return, throw himself at your feet, and consecrate to you
 the remainder of his life. You know not to what a pitch he adores you.
 All the Gangarids are both loving and faithful; but my son is the most
 passionate and constant of them all. The blackbird found you at an inn,
 drinking very cheerfully with the king of Egypt and a vile priest; he
 afterward saw you give this monarch who had killed the phœnix,--the
 man my son holds in utter detestation,--a fond embrace. The blackbird,
 at the sight of this, was seized with a just indignation. He flew away
 imprecating your fatal error. He returned this day, and has related
 every thing. But, just heaven, at what a juncture! At the very time that
 my son was deploring with me the loss of his father and that of the wise
 phœnix, the very instant I had informed him that he was your cousin
 german--"
 
 "Oh heavens! my cousin, madam, is it possible? How can this be? And am I
 so happy as to be thus allied to him, and yet so miserable as to have
 offended him?"
 
 "My son is, I tell you," said the Gangaridian lady, "your cousin, and I
 shall presently convince you of it; but in becoming my relation, you rob
 me of my son. He cannot survive the grief that the embrace you gave to
 the king of Egypt has occasioned him."
 
 "Ah! my dear aunt," cried the beautiful Formosanta, "I swear by him and
 the all-powerful Oromasdes, that this embrace, so far from being
 criminal, was the strongest proof of love your son could receive from
 me. I disobeyed my father for his sake. For him I went from the
 Euphrates to the Ganges. Having fallen into the hands of the worthless
 Pharaoh of Egypt, I could not escape his clutches but by artifice. I
 call the ashes and soul of the phœnix, which were then in my pocket,
 to witness. He can do me justice. But how can your son, born upon the
 banks of the Ganges, be my cousin? I, whose family have reigned upon the
 banks of the Euphrates for so many centuries?"
 
 "You know," said the venerable Gangaridian lady to her, "that your grand
 uncle, Aldea, was king of Babylon, and that he was dethroned by Belus's
 father?"
 
 "Yes, madam."
 
 "You know that this Aldea had in marriage a daughter named Aldea,
 brought up in your court? It was this prince, who, being persecuted by
 your father, took refuge under another name in our happy country. He
 married me, and is the father of the young prince Aldea Amazan, the most
 beautiful, the most courageous, the strongest, and most virtuous of
 mortals; and at this hour the most unhappy. He went to the Babylonian
 festival upon the credit of your beauty; since that time he idolizes
 you, and now grieves because he believes that you have proved unfaithful
 to him. Perhaps I shall never again set eyes upon my dear son."
 
 She then displayed to the princess all the titles of the house of Aldea.
 Formosanta scarce deigned to look at them.
 
 "Ah! madam, do we examine what is the object of our desire? My heart
 sufficiently believes you. But where is Aldea Amazan? Where is my
 kinsman, my lover, my king? Where is my life? What road has he taken? I
 will seek for him in every sphere the Eternal Being hath framed, and of
 which he is the greatest ornament. I will go into the star Canope, into
 Sheath, into Aldebaran; I will go and tell him of my love and convince
 him of my innocence."
 
 The phœnix justified the princess with regard to the crime that was
 imputed to her by the blackbird, of fondly embracing the king of Egypt;
 but it was necessary to undeceive Amazan and recall him. Birds were
 dispatched on every side. Unicorns sent forward in every direction. News
 at length arrived that Amazan had taken the road toward China.
 
 "Well, then," said the princess, "let us set out for China. I will seek
 him in defiance of both difficulty and danger. The journey is not long,
 and I hope I shall bring you back your son in a fortnight at farthest."
 
 At these words tears of affection streamed from his mother's eyes and
 also from those of the princess. They most tenderly embraced, in the
 great sensibility of their hearts.
 
 The phœnix immediately ordered a coach with six unicorns. Amazan's
 mother furnished two thousand horsemen, and made the princess, her
 niece, a present of some thousands of the finest diamonds of her
 country. The phœnix, afflicted at the evil occasioned by the
 blackbird's indiscretion, ordered all the blackbirds to quit the
 country; and from that time none have been met with upon the banks of
 the Ganges.
 
 
 [1] The god Ormuzd, (called Oromasdes by the Greeks), was regarded by
 the Magi as the source of all good. His followers were in reality
 worshipers of nature, and used neither temples, altars, nor statues, but
 performed their simple rites on mountain tops. They adored Oromasdes as
 the source of all light and purity, and regarded the sun and fire as
 symbols of the divinity. They were, in the language of Wadsworth:
 
                    "--zealous to reject
       Altar and Image, and the inclusive walls
       And roofs of temples built by human hands,--
       The loftiest heights ascending,
       Presented sacrifice to Moon and Stars
       And to the Winds and mother Elements,
       And the whole circle of the Heavens, for him
       A sensitive existence and a God."
 
 Byron, in Childe Harold, contrasts the "unwalled temples," of the
 worshipers of Nature, with the "idol-dwellings," where images are
 adored:
 
      "Not vainly did the early Persian make
       His altar the high places and the peak
       Of earth-o'er-gazing mountains, and thus take
       A fit and unwalled temple, there to seek
       The Spirit, in whose honor shrines are weak,
       Upreared of human hands. Come and compare
       Columns and idol-dwellings, Goth or Greek,
       With Nature's realms of worship, earth and air,
       Nor fix on fond abodes to circumscribe thy prayer."
 
 In Moore's Lalla Rookh will be found an exquisite sketch of the Magi, or
 ancient Fire Worshipers,--
 
      "Those slaves of Fire, that morn and even
       Hal their creator's dwelling-place
       Among the living lights of heaven."--E.
 
 
 [2] On ancient coins and armorial bearings, the Griffin is represented
 as having the head and wings of an eagle, joined to the body and paws of
 a lion, thus representing strength and swiftness combined. It was
 supposed to watch over mines of gold, and also whatever was secretly
 hidden. It built its nest like a bird, using gold as the material, and
 hence it was necessary to vigilantly guard its treasures from the
 rapacity of mankind--who, says Milton, in _Paradise Lost_, "by stealth
 purloined its guarded gold." The poets intimate that the chariot of
 Apollo, the god of the sun, was drawn by griffins.--E.

 FORMOSANTA VISITS CHINA AND SCYTHIA IN SEARCH OF AMAZAN.
 
 
 The unicorns, in less than eight days, carried Formosanta, Irla, and the
 phœnix, to Cambalu, the capital of China. This city was larger than
 that of Babylon, and in appearance quite different. These fresh objects,
 these strange manners, would have amused Formosanta could any thing but
 Amazan have engaged her attention.
 
 As soon as the emperor of China learned that the princess of Babylon was
 at the city gates, he dispatched four thousand Mandarins in ceremonial
 robes to receive her. They all prostrated themselves before her, and
 presented her with an address written in golden letters upon a sheet of
 purple silk. Formosanta told them, that if she were possessed of four
 thousand tongues, she would not omit replying immediately to every
 Mandarin; but that having only one, she hoped they would be satisfied
 with her general thanks. They conducted her, in a respectful manner, to
 the emperor.
 
 He was the wisest, most just and benevolent monarch upon earth. It was
 he who first tilled a small field with his own imperial hands, to make
 agriculture respectable to his people. Laws in all other countries were
 shamefully confined to the punishment of crimes: he first allotted
 premiums to virtue. This emperor had just banished from his dominions a
 gang of foreign Bonzes, who had come from the extremities of the West,
 with the frantic hope of compelling all China _to think like
 themselves_; and who, under pretence of teaching truths, had already
 acquired honors and riches. In expelling them, he delivered himself in
 these words, which are recorded in the annals of the empire:
 
 _"You may here do us much harm as you have elsewhere. You have come to
 preach dogmas of intolerance, to the most tolerant nation upon earth. I
 send you back, that I may never be compelled to punish you. You will be
 honorably conducted to my frontiers. You will be furnished with every
 thing necessary to return to the confines of the hemisphere from whence
 you came. Depart in peace, if you can be at peace, and never return."_
 
 The princess of Babylon heard with pleasure of this speech and
 determination. She was the more certain of being well received at court,
 as she was very far from entertaining any dogmas of intolerance. The
 emperor of China, in dining with her _tête-à-tête_, had the politeness
 to banish all disagreeable _etiquette_. She presented the phœnix to
 him, who was gently caressed by the emperor, and who perched upon his
 chair. Formosanta, toward the end of the repast, ingenuously acquainted
 him with the cause of her journey, and entreated him to search for the
 beautiful Amazan in the city of Cambalu; and in the meanwhile she
 acquainted the emperor with her adventures, without concealing the fatal
 passion with which her heart burned for this youthful hero.
 
 "He did me the honor of coming to my court," said the emperor of China.
 "I was enchanted with this amiable Amazan. It is true that he is deeply
 afflicted; but his graces are thereby the more affecting. Not one of my
 favorites has more wit. There is not a gown Mandarin who has more
 knowledge,--not a military one who has a more martial or heroic air. His
 extreme youth adds an additional value to all his talents. If I were so
 unfortunate, so abandoned by the Tien and Changti, as to desire to be a
 conqueror, I would wish Amazan to put himself at the head of my armies,
 and I should be sure of conquering the whole universe. It is a great
 pity that his melancholy sometimes disconcerts him."
 
 "Ah! sir," said Formosanta, with much agitation and grief, blended with
 an air of reproach, "why did you not request me to dine with him? This
 is a cruel stroke you have given me. Send for him immediately, I entreat
 you."
 
 "He set out this very morning," replied the emperor, "without
 acquainting me with his destination."
 
 Formosanta, turning toward the phœnix, said to him:
 
 "Did you ever know so unfortunate a damsel as myself?" Then resuming the
 conversation, she said:
 
 "Sir, how came he to quit in so abrupt a manner, so polite a court, in
 which, methinks, one might pass one's life?"
 
 "The case was as follows," said he. "One of the most amiable of the
 princesses of the blood, falling desperately in love with him, desired
 to meet him at noon. He set out at day-break, leaving this billet for
 my kinswoman, whom it hath cost a deluge of tears:
 
      "Beautiful princess of the mongolian race. You are deserving of a
      heart that was never offered up at any other altar. I have sworn to
      the immortal gods never to love any other than Formosanta, princess
      of Babylon, and to teach her how to conquer one's desires in
      traveling. She has had the misfortune to yield to a worthless king
      of Egypt. I am the most unfortunate of men; having lost my father,
      the phœnix, and the hope of being loved by Formosanta. I left my
      mother in affliction, forsook my home and country, being unable to
      live a moment in the place where I learned that Formosanta loved
      another than me. I swore to traverse the earth, and be faithful.
      You would despise me, and the gods punish me, if I violated my
      oath. Choose another lover, madam, and be as faithful as I am."
 
 "Ah! give me that miraculous letter," said the beautiful Formosanta; "it
 will afford me some consolation. I am happy in the midst of my
 misfortunes. Amazan loves me! Amazan, for me, renounces the society of
 the princesses of China. There is no one upon earth but himself endowed
 with so much fortitude. He sets me a most brilliant example. The
 phœnix knows I did not stand in need of it. How cruel it is to be
 deprived of one's lover for the most innocent embrace given through pure
 fidelity. But, tell me, whither has he gone? What road has he taken?
 Deign to inform me, and I will immediately set out."
 
 The emperor of China told her, that, according to the reports he had
 received, her lover had taken the road toward Scythia. The unicorns were
 immediately harnessed, and the princess, after the most tender
 compliments, took leave of the emperor, and resumed her journey with the
 phœnix, her chambermaid Irla, and all her train.
 
 As soon as she arrived in Scythia, she was more convinced than ever how
 much men and governments differed, and would continue to differ, until
 noble and enlightened minds should by degrees remove that cloud of
 darkness which has covered the earth for so many ages; and until there
 should be found in barbarous climes, heroic souls, who would have
 strength and perseverance enough to transform brutes into men. There are
 no cities in Scythia, consequently no agreeable arts. Nothing was to be
 seen but extensive fields, and whole tribes whose sole habitations were
 tents and chars. Such an appearance struck her with terror. Formosanta
 enquired in what tent or char the king was lodged? She was informed that
 he had set out eight days before with three hundred thousand cavalry to
 attack the king of Babylon, whose niece, the beautiful princess Aldea,
 he had carried off.
 
 "What! did he run away with my cousin?" cried Formosanta. "I could not
 have imagined such an incident. What! has my cousin, who was too happy
 in paying her court to me, become a queen, and I am not yet married?"
 She was immediately conducted, by her desire, to the queen's tent.
 
 Their unexpected meeting in such distant climes--the uncommon
 occurrences they mutually had to impart to each other, gave such charms
 to this interview, as made them forget they never loved one another.
 They saw each other with transport; and a soft illusion supplied the
 place of real tenderness. They embraced with tears, and there was a
 cordiality and frankness on each side that could not have taken place in
 a palace.
 
 Aldea remembered the phœnix and the waiting maid Irla. She presented
 her cousin with zibelin skins, who in return gave her diamonds. The war
 between the two kings was spoken of. They deplored the fate of soldiers
 who were forced into battle, the victims of the caprice of princes, when
 two honest men might, perhaps, settle the dispute in less than an hour,
 without a single throat being cut. But the principal topic was the
 handsome stranger, who had conquered lions, given the largest diamonds
 in the universe, written madrigals, and had now become the most
 miserable of men from believing the statements of a blackbird.
 
 "He is my dear brother," said Aldea. "He is my lover," cried Formosanta.
 "You have, doubtless, seen him. Is he still here? for, cousin, as he
 knows he is your brother, he cannot have left you so abruptly as he did
 the king of China.
 
 "Have I seen him? good heavens! yes. He passed four whole days with me.
 Ah! cousin, how much my brother is to blame. A false report has
 absolutely turned his brain. He roams about the world, without knowing
 whither he is destined. Imagine to yourself his distraction of mind,
 which is so great, that he has refused to meet the handsomest lady in
 all Scythia. He set out yesterday, after writing her a letter which has
 thrown her into despair. As for him, he has gone to visit the
 Cimmerians."
 
 "God be thanked!" cried Formosanta, "another refusal in my favor. My
 good fortune is beyond my hopes, as my misfortunes surpass my greatest
 apprehensions. Procure me this charming letter, that I may set out and
 follow him, loaded with his sacrifices. Farewell, cousin. Amazan is
 among the Cimmerians, and I fly to meet him."
 
 Aldea judged that the princess, her cousin, was still more frantic than
 her brother Amazan. Hut as she had herself been sensible of the effects
 of this epidemic contagion, having given up the delights and
 magnificence of Babylon for a king of Scythia; and as the women always
 excuse those follies that are the effects of love, she felt for
 Formosanta's affliction, wished her a happy journey, and promised to be
 her advocate with her brother, if ever she was so fortunate as to see
 him again.
 
 
 
 
 VI.
 
 THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER JOURNEY.
 
 
 From Scythia the princess of Babylon, with her phœnix, soon arrived
 at the empire of the Cimmerians, now called Russia; a country indeed
 much less populous than Scythia, but of far greater extent.
 
 After a few days' journey, she entered a very large city, which has of
 late been greatly improved by the reigning sovereign. The empress,
 however, was not there at that time, but was making a journey through
 her dominions, on the frontiers of Europe and Asia, in order to judge of
 their state and condition with her own eyes,--to enquire into their
 grievances, and to provide the proper remedies for them.
 
 The principal magistrate of that ancient capital, as soon as he was
 informed of the arrival of the Babylonian lady and the phœnix, lost
 no time in paying her all the honors of his country; being certain that
 his mistress, the most polite and generous empress in the world, would
 be extremely well pleased to find that he had received so illustrious a
 lady with all that respect which she herself, if on the spot, would have
 shown her.
 
 The princess was lodged in the palace, and entertained with great
 splendor and elegance. The Cimmerian lord, who was an excellent natural
 philosopher, diverted himself in conversing with the phœnix, at such
 times as the princess chose to retire to her own apartment. The
 phœnix told him, that he had formerly traveled among the Cimmerians,
 but that he should not have known the country again.
 
 "How comes it," said he, "that such prodigious changes have been brought
 about in so short a time? Formerly, when I was here, about three hundred
 years ago, I saw nothing but savage nature in all her horrors. At
 present, I perceive industry, arts, splendor, and politeness."
 
 "This mighty revolution," replied the Cimmerian, "was begun by one man,
 and is now carried to perfection by one woman;--a woman who is a greater
 legislator than the Isis of the Egyptians, or the Ceres of the Greeks.
 Most law-givers have been, unhappily, of a narrow genius and an
 arbitrary disposition, which conned their views to the countries they
 governed. Each of them looked upon his own race as the only people
 existing upon the earth, or as if they ought to be at enmity with all
 the rest. They formed institutions, introduced customs, and established
 religions exclusively for themselves. Thus the Egyptians, so famous for
 those heaps of stones called pyramids, have dishonored themselves with
 their barbarous superstitions. They despise all other nations as
 profane; refuse all manner of intercourse with them; and, excepting
 those conversant in the court, who now and then rise above the
 prejudices of the vulgar, there is not an Egyptian who will eat off a
 plate that has ever been used by a stranger. Their priests are equally
 cruel and absurd. It were better to have no laws at all, and to follow
 those notions of right and wrong engraven on our hearts by nature, than
 to subject society to institutions so inhospitable.
 
 "Our empress has adopted quite a different system. She considers her
 vast dominions, under which all the meridians on the globe are united,
 as under an obligation of correspondence with all the nations dwelling
 under those meridians. The first and most fundamental of her laws, is an
 universal toleration of all religions, and an unbounded compassion for
 every error. Her penetrating genius perceives, that though the modes of
 religious worship differ, yet morality is every where the same. By this
 principle, she has united her people to all the nations on earth, and
 the Cimmerians will soon consider the Scandinavians and the Chinese as
 their brethren. Not satisfied with this, she has resolved to establish
 this invaluable toleration, the strongest link of society, among her
 neighbors. By these means, she obtained the title of the parent of her
 country; and, if she persevere, will acquire that of the benefactress of
 mankind.
 
 "Before her time, the men, who were unhappily possessed of power, sent
 out legions of murderers to ravage unknown countries, and to water with
 the blood of the children the inheritance of their fathers. Those
 assassins were called heroes, and their robberies accounted glorious
 achievements. But our sovereign courts another sort of glory. She has
 sent forth her armies to be the messengers of peace; not only to prevent
 men from being the destroyers, but to oblige them to be the benefactors
 of one another. Her standards are the ensigns of public tranquillity."
 
 The phœnix was quite charmed with what he heard from this nobleman.
 He told him, that though he had lived twenty-seven thousand nine hundred
 years and seven months in this world, he had never seen any thing like
 it. He then enquired after his friend Amazan. The Cimmerian gave the
 same account of him that the princess had already heard from the Chinese
 and the Scythians. It was Amazan's constant practice to run away from
 all the courts he visited, the instant any lady noticed him in
 particular and seemed anxious to make his acquaintance. The phœnix
 soon acquainted Formosanta with this fresh instance of Amazan's
 fidelity--a fidelity so much the more surprising, since he could not
 imagine his princess would ever hear of it.
 
 Amazan had set out for Scandinavia, where he was entertained with sights
 still more surprising. In this place, he beheld monarchy and liberty
 subsisting together in a manner thought incompatible in other states;
 the laborers of the ground shared in the legislature with the grandees
 of the realm. In another place he saw what was still more extraordinary;
 a prince equally remarkable for his extreme youth and uprightness, who
 possessed a sovereign authority over his country, acquired by a solemn
 contract with his people.
 
 Amazan beheld a philosopher on the throne of Sarmatia, who might be
 called a king of anarchy; for he was the chief of a hundred thousand
 petty kings, one of whom with his single voice could render ineffectual
 the resolution of all the rest. Eolus had not more difficulty to keep
 the warring winds within their proper bounds, than this monarch to
 reconcile the tumultuous discordant spirits of his subjects. He was the
 master of a ship surrounded with eternal storms. But the vessel did not
 founder, for he was an excellent pilot.
 
 In traversing those various countries, so different from his own, Amazan
 persevered in rejecting all the advances made to him by the ladies,
 though incessantly distracted with the embrace given by Formosanta to
 the king of Egypt, being resolved to set Formosanta an amazing example
 of an unshaken and unparalleled fidelity.
 
 The princess of Babylon was constantly close at his heels, and scarcely
 ever missed of him but by a day or two; without the one being tired of
 roaming, or the other losing a moment in pursuing him.
 
 Thus he traversed the immense continent of Germany, where he beheld with
 wonder the progress which reason and philosophy had made in the north.
 Even their princes were enlightened, and had become the patrons of
 freedom of thought. Their education had not been trusted to men who had
 an interest in deceiving them, or who were themselves deceived. They
 were brought up in the knowledge of universal morality, and in the
 contempt of superstition.
 
 They had banished from all their estates a senseless custom which had
 enervated and depopulated the southern countries. This was to bury alive
 in immense dungeons, infinite numbers of both sexes who were eternally
 separated from one another, and sworn to have no communication together.
 This madness had contributed more than the most cruel wars to lay waste
 and depopulate the earth.
 
 In opposing these barbarous institutions, so inimical to the laws of
 nature and the best interests of society, the princes of the north had
 become the benefactors of their race. They had likewise exploded other
 errors equally absurd and pernicious. In short, men had at last
 ventured to make use of their reason in those immense regions; whereas
 it was still believed almost every where else, that they could not be
 governed but in proportion to their ignorance.

 AMAZAN VISITS ALBION.
 
 
 From Germany, Amazan arrived at Batavia; where his perpetual chagrin was
 in a good measure alleviated, by perceiving among the inhabitants a
 faint resemblance to his happy countrymen, the Gangarids. There he saw
 liberty, security, and equality,--with toleration in religion; but the
 ladies were so indifferent, that none made him any advances; an
 experience he had not met with before. It is true, however, that had he
 been inclined to address them, they would not have been offended;
 though, at the same time, not one would have been the least in love; but
 he was far from any thoughts of making conquests.
 
 Formosanta had nearly caught him in this insipid nation. He had set out
 but a moment before her arrival.
 
 Amazan had heard so much among the Batavians in praise of a certain
 island called Albion, that he was led by curiosity to embark with his
 unicorns on board a ship, which, with a favorable easterly wind, carried
 him in a few hours to that celebrated country, more famous than Tyre, or
 Atlantis.
 
 The beautiful Formosanta, who had followed him, as it were on the scent,
 to the banks of the Volga, the Vistula, the Elbe, and the Weser, and had
 never been above a day or two behind him, arrived soon after at the
 mouth of the Rhine, where it disembogues its waters into the German
 Ocean.
 
 Here she learned that her beloved Amazan had just set sail for Albion.
 She thought she saw the vessel on board of which he was, and could not
 help crying out for joy; at which the Batavian ladies were greatly
 surprised, not imagining that a young man could possibly occasion so
 violent a transport. They took, indeed, but little notice of the
 phœnix, as they reckoned his feathers would not fetch near so good a
 price as those of their own ducks, and other water fowl. The princess
 of Babylon hired two vessels to carry herself and her retinue to that
 happy island, which was soon to possess the only object of her desires,
 the soul of her life, and the god of her idolatry.
 
 An unpropitious wind from the west suddenly arose, just as the faithful
 and unhappy Amazan landed on Albion's sea-girt shore, and detained the
 ships of the Babylonian princess just as they were on the point of
 sailing. Seized with a deep melancholy, she went to her room, determined
 to remain there till the wind should change; but it blew for the space
 of eight days, with an unremitting violence. The princess, during this
 tedious period, employed her maid of honor, Irla, in reading romances;
 which were not indeed written by the Batavians; but as they are the
 factors of the universe, they traffic in the wit as well as commodities
 of other nations. The princess purchased of Mark Michael Rey, the
 bookseller, all the novels which had been written by the Ausonians and
 the Welch, the sale of which had been wisely prohibited among those
 nations to enrich their neighbors, the Batavians. She expected to find
 in those histories some adventure similar to her own, which might
 alleviate her grief. The maid of honor read, the phœnix made
 comments, and the princess, finding nothing in the _Fortunate Country
 Maid_, in _Tansai_, or in the _Sopha_, that had the least resemblance to
 her own affairs, interrupted the reader every moment, by asking how the
 wind stood.
 
 
 
 
 VIII.
 
 AMAZAN LEAVES ALBION TO VISIT THE LAND OF SATURN.
 
 
 In the mean time Amazan was on the road to the capital of Albion, in his
 coach and six unicorns, all his thoughts employed on his dear princess.
 At a small distance he perceived a carriage overturned in a ditch. The
 servants had gone in different directions in quest of assistance, but
 the owner kept his seat, smoking his pipe with great tranquillity,
 without manifesting the smallest impatience. His name was my lord
 What-then, in the language from which I translate these memoirs.
 
 Amazan made all the haste possible to help him, and without assistance
 set the carriage to rights, so much was his strength superior to that of
 other men. My lord What-then took no other notice of him, than saying,
 "a stout fellow, by Jove!" In the meantime the neighboring people,
 having arrived, flew into a great passion at being called out to no
 purpose, and fell upon the stranger. They abused him, called him an
 outlandish dog, and challenged him to strip and box.
 
 Amazan seized a brace of them in each hand, and threw them twenty paces
 from him; the rest seeing this, pulled off their hats, and bowing with
 great respect, asked his honor for something to drink. His honor gave
 them more money than they had ever seen in their lives before. My lord
 What-then now expressed great esteem for him, and asked him to dinner at
 his country house, about three miles off. His invitation being accepted,
 he went into Amazan's coach, his own being out of order from the
 accident.
 
 After a quarter of an hour's silence, my lord What-then, looking upon
 Amazan for a moment, said. "How d'ye do?" which, by the way, is a phrase
 without any meaning, adding, "You have got six fine unicorns there."
 After which he continued smoking as usual.
 
 The traveler told him his unicorns were at his service, and that he had
 brought them from the country of the Gangarids. From thence he took
 occasion to inform him of his affair with the princess of Babylon, and
 the unlucky kiss she had given the king of Egypt; to which the other
 made no reply, being very indifferent whether there were any such people
 in the world, as a king of Egypt, or a princess of Babylon.
 
 He remained dumb for another quarter of an hour; after which he asked
 his companion a second time how he did, and whether they had any good
 roast beef among the Gangarids.
 
 Amazan answered with his wonted politeness, "that they did not eat their
 brethren on the banks of the Ganges." He then explained to him that
 system which many ages afterward was surnamed the Pythagorean
 philosophy. But my lord fell asleep in the meantime, and made but one
 nap of it till he came to his own house.
 
 He was married to a young and charming woman, on whom nature had
 bestowed a soul as lively and sensible as that of her husband was dull
 and stupid. A few gentlemen of Albion had that day come to dine with
 her; among whom there were characters of all sorts; for that country
 having been almost always under the government of foreigners, the
 families that had come over with these princes had imported their
 different manners. There were in this company some persons of an amiable
 disposition, others of superior genius, and a few of profound learning.
 
 The mistress of the house had none of that awkward stiffness, that false
 modesty, with which the young ladies of Albion were then reproached. She
 did not conceal by a scornful look and an affected taciturnity, her
 deficiency of ideas: and the embarrassing humility of having nothing to
 say. Never was a woman more engaging. She received Amazan with a grace
 and politeness that were quite natural to her. The extreme beauty of
 this young stranger, and the involuntary comparison she could not help
 making between him and her prosaic husband, did not increase her
 happiness or content.
 
 Dinner being served, she placed Amazan at her side, and helped him to a
 variety of puddings, he having informed her that the Gangarids never
 dined upon any thing which had received from the gods the celestial gift
 of life. The events of his early life, the manners of the Gangarids, the
 progress of arts, religion, and government, were the subjects of a
 conversation equally agreeable and instructive all the time of the
 entertainment, which lasted till night: during which my lord What-then
 did nothing but push the bottle about, and call for the toast.
 
 After dinner, while my lady was pouring out the tea, still feeding her
 eyes on the young stranger, he entered into a long conversation with a
 member of parliament; for every one knows that there was, even then, a
 parliament called Wittenagemot, or the assembly of wise men. Amazan
 enquired into the constitution, laws, manners, customs, forces, and
 arts, which made this country so respectable; and the member answered
 him in the following manner.
 
 "For a long time we went stark naked, though our climate is none of the
 hottest. We were likewise for a long time enslaved by a people who came
 from the ancient country of Saturn, watered by the Tiber. But the
 mischief we have done one another has greatly exceeded all that we
 ever suffered from our first conquerors. One of our princes carried his
 superstition to such a pitch, as to declare himself the subject of a
 priest, who dwells also on the banks of the Tiber, and is called the Old
 Man of the Seven Mountains. It has been the fate of the seven mountains
 to domineer over the greatest part of Europe, then inhabited by brutes
 in human shape.
 
 [Illustration: Religious wars in Albion.]
 
 "To those times of infamy and debasement, succeeded the ages of
 barbarity and confusion. Our country, more tempestuous than the
 surrounding ocean, has been ravaged and drenched in blood by our civil
 discords. Many of our crowned heads have perished by a violent death.
 Above a hundred princes of the royal blood have ended their days on the
 scaffold, whilst the hearts of their adherents have been torn from their
 breasts, and thrown in their faces. In short, it is the province of the
 hangman to write the history of our island, seeing that this personage
 has finally determined all our affairs of moment.
 
 "But to crown these horrors, it is not very long since some fellows
 wearing black mantles, and others who cast white shirts over their
 jackets, having become aggressive and intolerent, succeeded in
 communicating their madness to the whole nation. Our country was then
 divided into two parties, the murderers and the murdered, the
 executioners and the sufferers, plunderers and slaves; and all in the
 name of God, and whilst they were seeking the Lord.
 
 "Who would have imagined, that from this horrible abyss, this chaos of
 dissension, cruelty, ignorance, and fanaticism, a government should at
 last spring up, the most perfect, it may be said, now in the world; yet
 such has been the event. A prince, honored and wealthy, all-powerful to
 do good, but without power to do evil, is at the head of a free,
 warlike, commercial, and enlightened nation. The nobles on one hand, and
 the representatives of the people on the other, share the legislature
 with the monarch.
 
 "We have seen, by a singular fatality of events, disorder, civil wars,
 anarchy and wretchedness, lay waste the country, when our kings aimed at
 arbitrary power: whereas tranquillity, riches, and universal happiness,
 have only reigned among us, when the prince has remained satisfied with
 a limited authority. All order had been subverted whilst we were
 disputing about mysteries, but was re-established the moment we grew
 wise enough to despise them. Our victorious fleets carry our flag on
 every ocean; our laws place our lives and fortunes in security; no judge
 can explain them in an arbitrary manner, and no decision is ever given
 without the reasons assigned for it. We should punish a judge as an
 assassin, who should condemn a citizen to death without declaring the
 evidence which accused him, and the law upon which he was convicted.
 
 "It is true, there are always two parties among us, who are continually
 writing and intriguing against each other, but they constantly re-unite,
 whenever it is needful to arm in defence of liberty and our country.
 These two parties watch over one another, and mutually prevent the
 violation of the sacred _deposit_ of the laws. They hate one another,
 but they love the state. They are like those jealous lovers, who pay
 court to the same mistress, with a spirit of emulation.
 
 "From the same fund of genius by which we discovered and supported the
 natural rights of mankind, we have carried the sciences to the highest
 pitch to which they can attain among men. Your Egyptians, who pass for
 such great mechanics--your Indians, who are believed to be such great
 philosophers--your Babylonians, who boast of having observed the stars
 for the course of four hundred and thirty thousand years--the Greeks,
 who have written so much, and said so little, know in reality nothing in
 comparison to our inferior scholars, who have studied the discoveries of
 Our great masters. We have ravished more secrets from nature in the
 space of an hundred years, that the human species had been able to
 discover in as many ages.
 
 "This is a true account of our present state. I have concealed from you
 neither the good nor the bad; neither our shame nor our glory; and I
 have exaggerated nothing."
 
 At this discourse Amazan felt a strong desire to be instructed in those
 sublime sciences his friend had spoken of; and if his passion for the
 princess of Babylon, his filial duty to his mother whom he had quitted,
 and his love for his native country, had not made strong remonstrances
 to his distempered heart, he would willingly have spent the remainder of
 his life in Albion. But that unfortunate kiss his princess had given
 the king of Egypt, did not leave his mind at sufficient ease to study
 the abstruse sciences.
 
 "I confess," said he, "having made a solemn vow to roam about the world,
 and to escape from myself. I have a curiosity to see that ancient land
 of Saturn--that people of the Tiber and of the Seven Mountains, who have
 been heretofore your masters. They must undoubtedly be the first people
 on earth."
 
 "I advise you by all means," answered the member, "to take that journey,
 if you have the smallest taste for music or painting. Even we ourselves
 frequently carry our spleen and melancholy to the Seven Mountains. But
 you will be greatly surprised when you see the descendants of our
 conquerors."
 
 This was a long conversation, and Amazan had spoken in so agreeable a
 manner; his voice was so charming; his whole behavior so noble and
 engaging, that the mistress of the house could not resist the pleasure
 of having a little private chat with him in her turn. She accordingly
 sent him a little billet-doux intimating her wishes in the most
 agreeable language. Amazan had once more the courage to resist the
 fascination of female society, and, according to custom, wrote the lady
 an answer full of respect,--representing to her the sacredness of his
 oath, and the strict obligation he was under to teach the princess of
 Babylon to conquer her passions by his example; after which he harnessed
 his unicorns and departed for Batavia, leaving all the company in deep
 admiration of him, and the lady in profound astonishment. In her
 confusion she dropped Amazan's letter. My lord What-then read it next
 morning:
 
 "D--n it," said he, shrugging up his shoulders, "what stuff and nonsense
 have we got here?" and then rode out a fox hunting with some of his
 drunken neighbors.
 
 Amazan was already sailing upon the sea, possessed of a geographical
 chart, with which he had been presented by the learned Albion he had
 conversed with at lord What-then's. He was extremely astonished to find
 the greatest part of the earth upon a single sheet of paper.
 
 His eyes and imagination wandered over this little space; he observed
 the Rhine, the Danube, the Alps of Tyrol, there specified under their
 different names, and all the countries through which he was to pass
 before he arrived at the city of the Seven Mountains. But he more
 particularly fixed his eyes upon the country of the Gangarids, upon
 Babylon, where he had seen his dear princess, and upon the country of
 Bassora, where she had given a fatal kiss to the king of Egypt. He
 sighed, and tears streamed from his eyes at the unhappy remembrance. He
 agreed with the Albion who had presented him with the universe in
 epitome, when he averred that the inhabitants of the banks of the Thames
 were a thousand times better instructed than those upon the banks of the
 Nile, the Euphrates, and the Ganges.
 
 As he returned into Batavia, Formosanta proceeded toward Albion with her
 two ships at full sail. Amazan's ship and the princess's crossed one
 another and almost touched; the two lovers were close to each other,
 without being conscious of the fact. Ah! had they but known it! But this
 great consolation tyrannic destiny would not allow.
 
 
 
 
 IX.
 
 AMAZAN VISITS ROME.
 
 
 No sooner had Amazan landed on the flat muddy shore of Batavia, than he
 immediately set out toward the city of the Seven Mountains. He was
 obliged to traverse the southern part of Germany. At every four miles he
 met with a prince and princess, maids of honor, and beggars. He was
 greatly astonished every where at the coquetries of these ladies and
 maids of honor, in which they indulged with German good faith. After
 having cleared the Alps he embarked upon the sea of Dalmatia, and landed
 in a city that had no resemblance to any thing he had heretofore seen.
 The sea formed the streets, and the houses were erected in the water.
 The few public places, with which this city was ornamented, were filled
 with men and women with double faces--that which nature had bestowed on
 them, and a pasteboard one, ill painted, with which they covered their
 natural visage; so that this people seemed composed of spectres. Upon
 the arrival of strangers in this country, they immediately purchase
 these visages, in the same manner as people elsewhere furnish themselves
 with hats and shoes. Amazan despised a fashion so contrary to nature. He
 appeared just as he was.
 
 Many ladies were introduced, and interested themselves in the handsome
 Amazan. But he fled with the utmost precipitancy, uttering the name of
 the incomparable princess of Babylon, and swearing by the immortal gods,
 that she was far handsomer than the Venetian girls.
 
 "Sublime traitoress," he cried, in his transports, "I will teach you to
 be faithful!"
 
 Now the yellow surges of the Tiber, pestiferous fens, a few pale
 emaciated inhabitants clothed in tatters which displayed their dry
 tanned hides, appeared to his sight, and bespoke his arrival at the gate
 of the city of the Seven Mountains,--that city of heroes and legislators
 who conquered and polished a great part of the globe.
 
 He expected to have seen at the triumphal gate, five hundred battalions
 commanded by heroes, and in the senate an assembly of demi-gods giving
 laws to the earth. But the only army he found consisted of about thirty
 tatterdemalions, mounting guard with umbrellas for fear of the sun.
 Having arrived at a temple which appeared to him very fine, but not so
 magnificent as that of Babylon, he was greatly astonished to hear a
 concert performed by men with female voices.
 
 "This," said he, "is a mighty pleasant country, which was formerly the
 land of Saturn. I have been in a city where no one showed his own face;
 here is another where men have neither their own voices nor beards."
 
 He was told that these eunuchs had been trained from childhood, that
 they might sing the more agreeably the praises of a great number of
 persons of merit. Amazan could not comprehend the meaning of this.
 
 They then explained to him very pleasantly, and with many
 gesticulations, according to the custom of their country, the point in
 question. Amazan was quite confounded.
 
 "I have traveled a great way," said he, "but I never before heard such a
 whim."
 
 After they had sung a good while, the Old Man of the Seven Mountains
 went with great ceremony to the gate of the temple. He cut the air in
 four parts with his thumb raised, two fingers extended and two bent, in
 uttering these words in a language no longer spoken: "_To the city and
 to the universe_." Amazan could not see how two fingers could extend so
 far.
 
 He presently saw the whole court of the master of the world file off.
 This court consisted of grave personages, some in scarlet, and others in
 violet robes. They almost all eyed the handsome Amazan with a tender
 look; and bowed to him, while commenting upon his personal appearance.
 
 The zealots whose vocation was to show the curiosities of the city to
 strangers, very eagerly offered to conduct him to several ruins, in
 which a muleteer would not choose to pass a night, but which were
 formerly worthy monuments of the grandeur of a royal people. He moreover
 saw pictures of two hundred years standing, and statues that had
 remained twenty ages, which appeared to him masterpieces of their kind.
 
 "Can you still produce such work?" said Amazan.
 
 "No, your excellency," replied one of the zealots; "but we despise the
 rest of the earth, because we preserve these rarities. We are a kind of
 old clothes men, who derive our glory from the cast-off garbs in our
 warehouses."
 
 Amazan was willing to see the prince's palace, and he was accordingly
 conducted thither. He saw men dressed in violet colored robes, who were
 reckoning the money of the revenues of the domains of lands, some
 situated upon the Danube, some upon the Loire, others upon the
 Guadalquivir, or the Vistula.
 
 "Oh! Oh!" said Amazan, having consulted his geographical map, "your
 master, then, possesses all Europe, like those ancient heroes of the
 Seven Mountains?"
 
 "He should possess the whole universe by divine right," replied a
 violet-livery man; "and there was even a time when his predecessors
 nearly compassed universal monarchy, but their successors are so good as
 to content themselves at present with some monies which the kings, their
 subjects, pay to them in the form of a tribute."
 
 "Your master is then, in fact, the king of kings. Is that his title?"
 said Amazan.
 
 [Illustration: The Old Man of The Seven Mountains.--"The Old Man of the
 Seven Mountains went with great ceremony to the gate of the temple. He
 cut the air in four parts with his thumb raised, two fingers extended
 and two bent, in uttering these words in a language no longer spoken:
 'To the city and to the universe.'"]
 
 "Your excellency, his title is _the servant of servants_! He was
 originally a fisherman and porter, wherefore the emblems of his dignity
 consist of keys and nets; but he at present issues orders to every
 king in Christendom. It is not a long while since he sent one hundred
 and one mandates to a king of the Celts, and the king obeyed."
 
 
 
      THE SERVANT OF SERVANTS.
 
      The personal service of Pius IX. as it existed in 1873, without
      counting Swiss gensdarmes, palatine guards, &c., is thus described
      by the author of _The Religion of Rome_, page 21.
 
      "The pope for his own exclusive personal service has four palatine
      cardinals, three prelates and a master, ten prelates of the private
      chamber, amongst whom are a cup-bearer, and a keeper of the
      wardrobe; then two hundred and fifteen domestic prelates. Then
      follow two hundred and forty-nine supernumerary prelates of the
      private chamber, four private chamberlains of the sword and cloak,
      Roman patricians, one of whom is a master of Santo Ospizto.
 
      "What things are these? what service do these private chamberlains
      render? what is the use of this cloak and sword? We will undertake
      to say that they do not know themselves. Let us proceed. Then come
      next a quarter-master major, a correspondent general of the post,
      and one hundred and thirty fresh private chamberlains of the sword
      and cloak! Oh! it is a labor to count them! Next come two hundred
      and sixty-five honorary monsignori _extra urbem_, six honorary
      chamberlains of the sword and cloak, then eight private chaplains.
      What a number of _private_ affairs must the pope have? Then
      eighty-one honorary chaplains _extra urbem_; then--but enough,
      enough, enough!
 
      "No! not enough for the pope. Then come two private monsignori of
      the tonsure--still private!--then eighteen supernumeraries: two
      adjutants of the chamber, a private steward--again private!--then
      nineteen ushers, participants, and twenty-four supernumeraries.
      Then--ah! there are no more. Let us cast up those we have named;
      they amount only to a bagatelle of one thousand and twenty-five
      persons! And take note, that there are not included in this list
      the palatine administration, and the tribunal of the majordomo, the
      Swiss guards, the gensdarmes, etc., etc.
 
      "If it be difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
      heaven, how shall he who inhabits the Vatican enter there?--who has
      treasures of all sorts, money, precious gems, precious and
      countless works of art, vessels of silver and gold, and who has on
      his head not one crown but three? who causes himself to be borne on
      the shoulders of men; who causes them to kiss his feet; who has
      millions of income, and a thousand persons to attend upon him?
 
      "There is, in fact, nothing to be compared with the effrontery with
      which the Vatican enacts the comedy of poverty. Yes, it has reason
      to believe still in miracles; it is an actual miracle which the
      Roman court works, in drawing from the pockets of the poor the
      obolus necessary to buy them bread, to spend it before their faces
      in Sybaritic luxury, in a palace of _The Thousand and One Nights_.
      On the day of Epiphany, the Jesuits sent to the Vatican some
      hundreds of women and children of the Trastevere, to carry to the
      pope a gift of money. The children to succor the poverty of the
      pope, who consumes on himself and household enough to maintain a
      whole city, gave him the money which they had received in gifts
      from their parents, and the women of the Trastevere, the few pence
      that they had laid aside for the needs of their families.
 
      "But what is most extraordinary is, that these women and children
      who bestowed their charity on the pope, went to do it into halls
      full of gold, marble, precious stones, velvet, silk, embroidery,
      paintings, and statues, into the Vatican, that gigantic palace,
      which occupies a space of fifteen hundred feet in length, and eight
      hundred in breadth, with twenty courts, two hundred staircases,
      eleven thousand rooms, galleries and halls full of treasures, and
      the construction of which has cost hundreds of millions. These
      children and these women passing through so much wealth never were
      struck with the idea that Pius IX. ought to be something more than
      a beggar; that there is no monarch in the world who has an abode
      like the popes of Rome--the very sight of the gifts sent by all the
      world to Pius IX. being enough to strike them dumb with
      astonishment.
 
      "Now these women and these children don't comprehend this, and here
      is the miracle. This Pius IX. ought to go into the cottages of
      these poor women and take them money, instead of their going to
      carry it into the luxurious palace of the pope.
 
      "The miracle becomes still greater every time that the Pope,
      replying to those who bring money, talks of Jesus; for Jesus was in
      a stable, not in a palace of eleven thousand rooms. Jesus would at
      once have sent away the Swiss, the gensdarmes, the palatine guards,
      the chamberlains private and not private, etc., and would have said
      to the people of the Trastevere, and of the quarters of the poor:
      'Come here into the Vatican, poor people, leave those wretched
      cabins where you suffer so much; come to me; I have eleven thousand
      rooms to offer you, one of which is quite enough for me, and so I
      will divide these amongst those who have none.' This would have
      been said by Christ, whom Pius IX. invokes so often, calling
      himself His vicar or steward. But try, ye poor, to enter into the
      Vatican, and you will find at once at the door a Swiss, who will
      chase you away by blows of his halberd. He will let in anyone who
      comes to bring money, but not a soul who comes to ask for it."--E.
 
 
 
 "Your fisherman must then have sent five or six hundred thousand men to
 put these orders in execution?"
 
 "Not at all, your excellency. Our holy master is not rich enough to keep
 ten thousand soldiers on foot: but he has five or six hundred thousand
 divine prophets dispersed in other countries. These prophets of various
 colors are, as they ought to be, supported at the expense of the people
 where they reside. They proclaim, from heaven, that my master may, with
 his keys, open and shut all locks, and particularly those of strong
 boxes. A Norman priest, who held the post of confident of this king's
 thoughts, convinced him he ought to obey, without questioning, the one
 hundred and one thoughts of my master; for you must know that one of the
 prerogatives of the Old Man of the Seven Mountains is never to err,
 whether he deigns to speak or deigns to write."
 
 "In faith," said Amazan, "this is a very singular man; I should be
 pleased to dine with him."
 
 "Were your excellency even a king, you could not eat at his table. All
 that he could do for you, would be to allow you to have one served by
 the side of his, but smaller and lower. But if you are inclined to have
 the honor of speaking to him, I will ask an audience for you on
 condition of the _buona mancia_, which you will be kind enough to give
 me." "Very readily," said the Gangarid. The violet-livery man bowed: "I
 will introduce you to-morrow," said he. "You must make three very low
 bows, and you must kiss the feet of the Old Man of the Seven Mountains."
 At this information Amazan burst into so violent a fit of laughing that
 he was almost choked; which, however, he surmounted, holding his sides,
 whilst the violent emotions of the risible muscles forced the tears down
 his cheeks, till he reached the inn, where the fit still continued upon
 him.
 
 At dinner, twenty beardless men and twenty violins produced a concert.
 He received the compliments of the greatest lords of the city during the
 remainder of the day; but from their extravagant actions, he was
 strongly tempted to throw two or three of these violet-colored gentry
 out of the window. He left with the greatest precipitation this city of
 the masters of the world, where young men were treated so whimsically,
 and where he found himself necessitated to kiss an old man's toe, as if
 his cheek were at the end of his foot.
 
 
 
 
 X.
 
 AN UNFORTUNATE ADVENTURE IN GAUL.
 
 
 In all the provinces through which Amazan passed, he remained ever
 faithful to the princess of Babylon, though incessantly enraged at the
 king of Egypt. This model of constancy at length arrived at the new
 capital of the Gauls. This city, like many others, had alternately
 submitted to barbarity, ignorance, folly, and misery. The first name it
 bore was Dirt and Mire; it then took that of Isis, from the worship of
 Isis, which had reached even here. Its first senate consisted of a
 company of watermen. It had long been in bondage, and submitted to the
 ravages of the heroes of the Seven Mountains; and some ages after, some
 other heroic thieves who came from the farther banks of the Rhine, had
 seized upon its little lands.
 
 Time, which changes all things, had formed it into a city, half of which
 was very noble and very agreeable, the other half somewhat barbarous and
 ridiculous. This was the emblem of its inhabitants. There were within
 its walls at least a hundred thousand people, who had no other
 employment than play and diversion. These idlers were the judges of
 those arts which the others cultivated. They were ignorant of all that
 passed at court; though they were only four short miles distant from it:
 but it seemed to them at least six hundred thousand miles off.
 Agreeableness in company, gaiety and frivolty, formed the important and
 sole considerations of their lives. They were governed like children,
 who are extravagantly supplied with gewgaws, to prevent their crying. If
 the horrors were discussed, which two centuries before had laid waste
 their country, or if those dreadful periods were recalled, when one half
 of the nation massacred the other for sophisms, they, indeed, said,
 "this was not well done;" then, presently, they fell to laughing again,
 or singing of catches.
 
 [Illustration: Kissing an old man's toe.]
 
 
 
      KISSING THE POPE'S FOOT.
 
      On page 181 of _The Religion of Rome_, the author asks the
      questions: "Why does the pope cause his foot, or rather his
      slipper, to be kissed? And when did this custom begin?" His
      explanation is as follows:
 
      "Theophilus Rainaldo and the Bollandist fathers, as well as other
      Roman Catholic authors, tell us a gallant story of Pope St. Leo I.,
      called the Great, which, if it were true, might show the origin of
      the practice. They say that a young and very handsome devotee was
      admitted on Easter day, to kiss the hand of Pope St. Leo after the
      mass. The pope felt himself very much excited by this kiss, and
      remembering the words of the Savior, 'If thy hand offend thee, cut
      it off, and cast it from thee' (Matt. v. 30), he at once cut off
      his hand. But as he was unable to perform mass with only one hand,
      the people were in a great rage. The pope therefore prayed to God
      to restore his hand, and God complied: his hand was again united to
      the stump. And to avoid such dilemmas in future, Leo ordered that
      thereafter no one should kiss his hand, but only his foot. A very
      little common sense is sufficient to make us understand that such
      was not the origin of this custom.
 
      "The first who invented this degrading act of kissing feet was the
      Emperor Caligula. He, in his quality of Pontifex Maximus, ordered
      the people to kiss his foot. Succeeding emperors refused such an
      act of base slavery. But Heliogabalus, as emperor, and Pontifex
      Maximus, again introduced it. After him, the custom fell into
      disuse; but the Christian emperors retaining some of the wicked
      fables given to the pagan emperors, permitted the kissing of the
      foot as a compliment on the presentation of petitions. We may cite
      a few instances. The acts of the Council of Chalcedon say that
      Fazius, Bishop of Tyre, in his petition to the emperor, said, 'I
      supplicate, prostrate, at your immaculate and divine feet.'
      Bassianus, Bishop of Ephesus, says, 'I prostrate myself at your
      feet.' Eunomius, Bishop of Nicomedia, says, 'I prostrate myself
      before the footsteps of your power.' The Abbot Saba says, 'I am
      come to adore the footsteps of your piety. Prococius, in his
      _History of Mysteries_, says that the Emperor Justinian, at the
      instigation of the proud Theodora, his wife, was the first amongst
      the Christian emperors who ordered prostrations before himself and
      his wife, and the kissing of their feet.
 
      "The ecclesiastics, the bishops, and, finally, the popes, were not
      exempt from paying this homage to the emperors. The prelates of
      Syria held this language to the Emperor Justinian. 'The pope of
      holy memory, and the archbishop of ancient Rome, has come to your
      pious conversation, and has been honored by your holy feet.' Pope
      Gregory I., writing to Theodorus, the physician of the Emperor
      Mauritius, in the year A.D. 593, said: 'My tongue cannot
      sufficiently express the great benefits that I have received from
      God Almighty and from our great emperor, for which I can only love
      him and kiss his feet.' In the year A.D. 681 Pope Agathon, sending
      his legates to the sixth council, writes to the Emperor Constantine
      Pogonatus: 'As prostrate in your presence, and embracing your feet,
      I implore you,' etc. In the seventh century, therefore, not only
      did the popes not have their feet kissed, but they themselves were
      obliged to kiss those of the emperor. Becoming sovereigns of Rome,
      they soon began to adopt the same custom. Pope Eugenius II., who
      died in 827, was the first who made it the law to kiss the papal
      foot. From that time it was necessary to kneel before the popes.
      Gregory VII. ordered all princes to submit to this practice.
 
      "From what we have said it is clear that the origin of feet-kissing
      was entirely pagan and idolatrous. That this custom is in total
      contradiction to the precepts of the Gospel would be a waste of
      words to assert. Jesus Christ was so far from desiring people to
      kiss his feet, that he set himself on one occasion to wash the feet
      of his disciples. These are the words of the Gospel: 'He riseth
      from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel and
      girded himself. After that he poured water into a basin, and began
      to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel
      wherewith he was girded.'
 
      "This act of Jesus Christ is in perfect keeping (John xiii. 4.5)
      with all his precepts, with his inculcations of modesty, equality,
      humility, and with his condemnation of those who set themselves
      above others. Who would have said that a day would come in which
      those claiming to be his vicars should cause people to kiss their
      feet? How thoroughly has Catholicism borrowed from paganism its
      idolatries? And notwithstanding this flagrant violation of the
      religion of Christ, what a herd of people go and press their lips
      on the slipper of the pope, as was done formerly to the Roman
      emperors, the pontifices maximi, that is to say, the priests of
      Jove."--E.
 
 
 
 
 In proportion as the idlers were polished, agreeable, and amiable, it
 was observed that there was a greater and more shocking contrast between
 them and those who were engaged in business.
 
 Among the latter, or such as pretended so to be, there was a gang of
 melancholy fanatics, whose absurdity and knavery divided their
 character,--whose appearance alone diffused misery,--and who would have
 overturned the world, had they been able to gain a little credit. But
 the nation of idlers, by dancing and singing, forced them into obscurity
 in their caverns, as the warbling birds drive the croaking bats back to
 their holes and ruins.
 
 A smaller number of those who were occupied, were the preservers of
 ancient barbarous customs, against which nature, terrified, loudly
 exclaimed. They consulted nothing but their worm-eaten registers. If
 they there discovered a foolish or horrid custom, they considered it as
 a sacred law. It was from this vile practice of not daring to think for
 themselves, but extracting their ideas from the ruins of those times
 when no one thought at all, that in the metropolis of pleasure there
 still remained some shocking manners. Hence it was that there was no
 proportion between crimes and punishments. A thousand deaths were
 sometimes inflicted upon an innocent victim, to make him acknowledge a
 crime he had not committed.
 
 The extravagancies of youth were punished with the same severity as
 murder or parricide. The idlers screamed loudly at these exhibitions,
 and the next day thought no more about them, but were buried in the
 contemplation of some new fashion.
 
 This people saw a whole age elapse, in which the fine arts attained a
 degree of perfection that far surpassed the most sanguine hopes.
 Foreigners then repaired thither, as they did to Babylon, to admire the
 great monuments of architecture, the wonders of gardening, the sublime
 efforts of sculpture and painting. They were charmed with a species of
 music that reached the heart without astonishing the ears.
 
 True poetry, that is to say, such as is natural and harmonious, that
 which addresses the heart as well as the mind, was unknown to this
 nation before this happy period. New kinds of eloquence displayed
 sublime beauties. The theatres in particular reëchoed with masterpieces
 that no other nation ever approached. In a word, good taste prevailed in
 every profession to that degree, that there were even good writers among
 the Druids.
 
 So many laurels that had branched even to the skies, soon withered in an
 exhausted soil. There remained but a very small number, whose leaves
 were of a pale dying verdure. This decay was occasioned by the facility
 of producing; laziness preventing good productions, and by a satiety of
 the brilliant, and a taste for the whimsical. Vanity protected arts that
 brought back times of barbarity; and this same vanity, in persecuting
 persons of real merit, forced them to quit their country. The hornets
 banished the bees.
 
 There were scarce any real arts, scarce any real genius, talent now
 consisted in reasoning right or wrong upon the merit of the last age.
 The dauber of a sign-post criticised with an air of sagacity the works
 of the greatest painters; and the blotters of paper disfigured the works
 of the greatest writers. Ignorance and bad taste had other daubers in
 their pay. The same things were repeated in a hundred volumes under
 different titles. Every work was either a dictionary or a pamphlet. A
 Druid gazetteer wrote twice a week the obscure annals of an unknown
 people possessed with the devil, and of celestial prodigies operated in
 garrets by little beggars of both sexes. Other Ex-Druids, dressed in
 black, ready to die with rage and hunger, set forth their complaints in
 a hundred different writings, that they were no longer allowed to cheat
 mankind--this privilege being conferred on some goats clad in grey; and
 some Arch-Druids were employed in printing defamatory libels.
 
 Amazan was quite ignorant of all this, and even if he had been
 acquainted with it, he would have given himself very little concern
 about it, having his head filled with nothing but the princess of
 Babylon, the king of Egypt, and the inviolable vow he had made to
 despise all female coquetry in whatever country his despair should drive
 him.
 
 The gaping ignorant mob, whose curiosity exceeds all the bounds of
 nature and reason, for a long time thronged about his unicorns. The more
 sensible women forced open the doors of his _hotel_ to contemplate his
 person.
 
 [Illustration: Gaiety and frivolity.--"There are within its walls at
 least a hundred thousand people, who had no other employment than play
 and diversion."]
 
 He at first testified some desire of visiting the court; but some of the
 idlers, who constituted good company and casually went thither, informed
 him that it was quite out of fashion, that times were greatly changed,
 and that all amusements were confined to the city. He was invited that
 very night to sup with a lady whose sense and talents had reached
 foreign climes, and who had traveled in some countries through which
 Amazan had passed. This lady gave him great pleasure, as well as the
 society he met at her house. Here reigned a decent liberty, gaiety
 without tumult, silence without pedantry, and wit without asperity. He
 found that _good company_ was not quite ideal, though the title was
 frequently usurped by pretenders. The next day he dined in a society far
 less amiable, but much more voluptuous. The more he was satisfied with
 the guests, the more they were pleased with him. He found his soul
 soften and dissolve, like the aromatics of his country, which gradually
 melt in a moderate heat, and exhale in delicious perfumes.
 
 After dinner he was conducted to a place of public entertainment which
 was enchanting; but condemned, however, by the Druids, because it
 deprived them of their auditors, which, therefore, excited their
 jealousy. The representation here consisted of agreeable verses,
 delightful songs, dances which expressed the movements of the soul, and
 perspectives that charmed the eye in deceiving it. This kind of pastime,
 which included so many kinds, was known only under a foreign name. It
 was called an _Opera_, which formerly signified, in the language of the
 Seven Mountains, work, care, occupation, industry, enterprise, business.
 This exhibition enchanted him. A female singer, in particular, charmed
 him by her melodious voice, and the graces that accompanied her. This
 child of genius, after the performance, was introduced to him by his new
 friends. He presented her with a handful of diamonds; for which she was
 so grateful, that she could not leave him all the rest of the day. He
 supped with her and her companions, and during the delightful repast he
 forgot his sobriety, and became heated and oblivious with wine. What an
 instance of human frailty!
 
 The beautiful princess of Babylon arrived at this juncture, with her
 phœnix, her chambermaid Irla, and her two hundred Gangaridian
 cavaliers mounted on their unicorns. It was a long while before the
 gates were opened. She immediately asked, if the handsomest, the most
 courageous, the most sensible, and the most faithful of men was still in
 that city? The magistrates readily concluded that she meant Amazan. She
 was conducted to his _hotel_. How great was the palpitation of her
 heart!--the powerful operation of the tender passion. Her whole soul was
 penetrated with inexpressible joy, to see once more in her lover the
 model of constancy. Nothing could prevent her entering his chamber; the
 curtains were open; and she saw the beautiful Amazan asleep and
 stupefied with drink.
 
 Formosanta expressed her grief with such screams as made the house echo.
 She swooned into the arms of Irla. As soon as she had recovered her
 senses, she retired from this fatal chamber with grief blended with
 rage.
 
 "Oh! just heaven; oh, powerful Oromasdes!" cried the beautiful princess
 of Babylon, bathed in tears. "By whom, and for whom am I thus betrayed?
 He that could reject for my sake so many princesses, to abandon me for
 the company of a strolling Gaul! No! I can never survive this affront."
 
 "This is the disposition of all young people," said Irla to her, "from
 one end of the world to the other. Were they enamoured with a beauty
 descended from heaven, they would at certain moments forget her
 entirely."
 
 "It is done," said the princess, "I will never see him again whilst I
 live. Let us depart this instant, and let the unicorns be harnessed."
 
 The phœnix conjured her to stay at least till Amazan awoke, that he
 might speak with him.
 
 "He does not deserve it," said the princess. "You would cruelly offend
 me. He would think that I had desired you to reproach him, and that I am
 willing to be reconciled to him. If you love me, do not add this injury
 to the insult he has offered me."
 
 The phœnix, who after all owed his life to the daughter of the king
 of Babylon, could not disobey her. She set out with all her attendants.
 
 "Whither are you going?" said Irla to her.
 
 "I do not know," replied the princess; "we will take the first road we
 find. Provided I fly from Amazan for ever, I am satisfied."
 
 [Illustration: Ancient barbarous customs.]
 
      ANCIENT BARBAROUS CUSTOMS.
 
      William Howitt, in a note to his translation of _The Religion of
      Rome_, (page 19), points out very clearly the evils which have
      resulted to man from the sinister teaching of the upholders of
      ancient barbarous customs:--
 
      "If anyone would satisfy himself of what Popery is at its centre;
      what it does where it has had its fullest sway, let him make a tour
      into the mountains in the vicinity of Rome, and see in a country
      exceedingly beautiful by nature, what is the condition of an
      extremely industrious population. In the rock towns of the Alban,
      Sabine, and Volscian hills, you find a swarming throng of men,
      women, and children, asses, pigs, and hens, all groveling in
      inconceivable filth, squalor, and poverty. Filth in the streets, in
      the houses, everywhere; fleas, fever, and small-pox, and the
      densest ignorance darkening minds of singular natural cleverness. A
      people brilliant in intellect, totally uneducated, and steeped in
      the grossest superstition.
 
      "These dens of dirt, disease and, till lately, or brigandage, are
      the evidences of a thousand years of priestly government! They, and
      the country around them, are chiefly the property of the great
      princely and ducal families which sprung out of the papal neposm of
      Rome, and have by successive popes, their founders, been loaded
      with the wealth of the nation. These families live in Rome, in
      their great palaces, amidst every luxury and splendor, surrounded
      by the finest works of art, and leave their tenants and dependents
      without any attention from them. Some steward or middleman screws
      the last soldo from them for rent; and when crops fail, lifts not a
      finger to alleviate their misery.
 
      "And the Papal Government, too--a government pretendedly based on
      the direct ordination of Him who went about doing good--what has it
      done for them? Nothing but debauch their minds with idle ceremonies
      and unscriptural dogmas,--legends, priests, monks and beggary! The
      whole land is a land of beggars, made so by inculcated notions of a
      spurious charity. Every countrywoman, many men, and every child,
      boy or girl, are literally beggars--beggars importunate,
      unappeasable, irrepressible! What a condition of mind for a
      naturally noble and capable people to be reduced to by--a
      religion!"
 
 
 
 The phœnix, who was wiser than Formosanta, because he was divested of
 passion, consoled her upon the road. He gently insinuated to her that it
 was shocking to punish one's self for the faults of another; that Amazan
 had given her proofs sufficiently striking and numerous of his fidelity,
 so that she should forgive him for having forgotten himself for one
 moment in social company; that this was the only time in which he had
 been wanting of the grace of Oromasdes; that it would render him only
 the more constant in love and virtue for the future; that the desire of
 expiating his fault would raise him beyond himself; that it would be the
 means of increasing her happiness; that many great princesses before her
 had forgiven such slips, and had had no reason to be sorry afterward;
 and he was so thoroughly possessed of the art of persuasion, that
 Formosanta's mind grew more calm and peaceable. She was now sorry she
 had set out so soon. She thought her unicorns went too fast, but she did
 not dare return. Great was the conflict between her desire of forgiving
 and that of showing her rage--between her love and vanity. However, her
 unicorns pursued their pace; and she traversed the world, according to
 the prediction of her father's oracle.
 
 When Amazan awoke, he was informed of the arrival and departure of
 Formosanta and the phœnix. He was also told of the rage and
 distraction of the princess, and that she had sworn never to forgive
 him.
 
 "Then," said he, "there is nothing left for me to do, but follow her,
 and kill myself at her feet."
 
 The report of this adventure drew together his festive companions, who
 all remonstrated with him. They said that he had much better stay with
 them; that nothing could equal the pleasant life they led in the centre
 of arts and refined delicate pleasures; that many strangers, and even
 kings, preferred such an agreeable enchanting repose to their country
 and their thrones. Moreover, his vehicle was broken, and another was
 being made for him according to the newest fashion; that the best tailor
 of the whole city had already cut out for him a dozen suits in the
 latest style; that the most vivacious, amiable, and fashionable ladies,
 at whose houses dramatic performances were represented, had each
 appointed a day to give him a regale. The girl from the opera was in the
 meanwhile drinking her chocolate, laughing, singing, and ogling the
 beautiful Amazan--who by this time clearly perceived she had no more
 sense than a goose.
 
 A sincerity, cordiality, and frankness, as well as magnanimity and
 courage, constituted the character of this great prince, he related his
 travels and misfortunes to his friends. They knew that he was
 cousin-german to the princess. They were informed of the fatal kiss she
 had given the king of Egypt. "Such little tricks," said they, "are often
 forgiven between relatives, otherwise one's whole life would pass in
 perpetual uneasiness."
 
 Nothing could shake his design of pursuing Formosanta; but his carriage
 not being ready, he was compelled to remain three days longer among the
 idlers, who were still feasting and merry-making. He at length took his
 leave of them, by embracing them and making them accept some of his
 diamonds that were the best mounted, and recommending to them a
 constant pursuit of frivolity and pleasure, since
 they were thereby made more agreeable and happy.
 
 "The Germans," said he, "are the greyheads of Europe; the people of
 Albion are men formed; the inhabitants of Gaul are the children,--and I
 love to play with children."
 
 
 
 
 XI.
 
 AMAZAN AND FORMOSANTA BECOME RECONCILED.
 
 
 The guides had no difficulty in following the route the princess had
 taken. There was nothing else talked of but her and her large bird. All
 the inhabitants were still in a state of fascination. The banks of the
 Loire, of the Dordogue--the Garonne, and the Gironde, still echoed with
 acclamation.
 
 When Amazan reached the foot of the Pyrenees, the magistrates and Druids
 of the country made him dance, whether he would or not, a _Tambourin_;
 but as soon as he cleared the Pyrenees, nothing presented itself that
 was either gay or joyous. If he here and there heard a peasant sing,
 it was a doleful ditty. The inhabitants stalked with much gravity,
 having a few strung beads and a girted poniard. The nation dressed in
 black, and appeared to be in mourning.
 
 [Illustration: Dancing a tambourin.--"When Amazan reached the foot of
 the Pyrenees, the magistrates and druids of the country made him dance,
 whether he would or not, a Tambourin; but as soon as he cleared the
 Pyrenees, nothing presented itself that was either gay or joyous."]
 
 If Amazan's servants asked passengers any questions, they were answered
 by signs; if they went into an inn, the host acquainted his guests in
 three words, that there was nothing in the house, but that the things
 they so pressingly wanted might be found a few miles off.
 
 When these votaries to taciturnity were asked if they had seen the
 beautiful princess of Babylon pass, they answered with less brevity than
 usual: "We have seen her--she is not so handsome--there are no beauties
 that are not tawny--she displays a bosom of alabaster, which is the most
 disgusting thing in the world, and which is scarce known in our
 climate."
 
 Amazan advanced toward the province watered by the Betis. The Tyrians
 discovered this country about twelve thousand years ago, about the time
 they discovered the great Atlantic Isle, inundated so many centuries
 after. The Tyrians cultivated Betica, which the natives of the country
 had never done, being of opinion that it was not their place to meddle
 with anything, and that their neighbors, the Gauls, should come and reap
 their harvests. The Tyrians had brought with them some Palestines, or
 Jews, who, from that time, have wandered through every clime where money
 was to be gained. The Palestines, by extraordinary usury, at fifty per
 cent., had possessed themselves of almost all the riches of the country.
 This made the people of Betica imagine the Palestines were sorcerers;
 and all those who were accused of witchcraft were burnt, without mercy,
 by a company of Druids, who were called the Inquisitors, or the
 _Anthropokaies_. These priests immediately put their victims in a
 masquerade habit, seized upon their effects, and devoutly repeated the
 Palestines' own prayers, whilst burning them by a slow fire, _por l'amor
 de Dios_.
 
 The princess of Babylon alighted in that city which has since been
 called Sevilla. Her design was to embark upon the Betis to return by
 Tyre to Babylon, and see again king Belus, her father; and forget, if
 possible, her perdious lover--or, at least, to ask him in marriage. She
 sent for two Palestines, who transacted all the business of the court.
 They were to furnish her with three ships. The phœnix made all the
 necessary contracts with them, and settled the price after some little
 dispute.
 
 The hostess was a great devotee, and her husband, who was no less
 religious, was a Familiar: that is to say, a spy of the Druid
 Inquisitors or _Anthropokaies_.
 
 He failed not to inform them, that in his house was a sorceress and two
 Palestines, who were entering into a compact with the devil, disguised
 like a large gilt bird.
 
 The Inquisitors having learned that the lady possessed a large quantity
 of diamonds, swore point blank that she was a sorceress. They waited
 till night to imprison the two hundred cavaliers and the unicorns,
 (which slept in very extensive stables), for the Inquisitors are
 cowards.
 
 Having strongly barricaded the gates, they seized the princess and Irla;
 but they could not catch the phœnix, who flew away with great
 swiftness. He did not doubt of meeting with Amazan upon the road from
 Gaul to Sevilla.
 
 He met him upon the frontiers of Betica, and acquainted him with the
 disaster that had befallen the princess.
 
 Amazan was struck speechless with rage. He armed himself with a steel
 cuirass damasquined with gold, a lance twelve feet long, two javelins,
 and an edged sword called the Thunderer, which at one single stroke
 would rend trees, rocks, and Druids. He covered his beautiful head with
 a golden casque, shaded with heron and ostrich feathers. This was the
 ancient armor of Magog, which his sister Aldea gave him when upon his
 journey in Scythia. The few attendants he had with him all mounted their
 unicorns.
 
 Amazan, in embracing his dear phœnix, uttered only these melancholy
 expressions: "I am guilty! Had I not dined with the child of genius from
 the opera, in the city of the idlers, the princess of Babylon would not
 have been in this alarming situation. Let us fly to the
 _Anthropokaies_." He presently entered Sevilla. Fifteen hundred
 Alguazils guarded the gates of the inclosure in which the two hundred
 Gangarids and their unicorns were shut up, without being allowed
 anything to eat. Preparations were already made for sacrificing the
 princess of Babylon, her chambermaid Irla, and the two rich Palestines.
 
 The high _Anthropokaie_, surrounded by his subaltern _Anthropokaies_,
 was already seated upon his sacred tribunal. A crowd of Sevillians,
 wearing strung beads at their girdles, joined their two hands, without
 uttering a syllable, when the beautiful Princess, the maid Irla, and the
 two Palestines were brought forth, with their hands tied behind their
 backs and dressed in masquerade habits.
 
 The phœnix entered the prison by a dormer window, whilst the
 Gangarids began to break open the doors. The invincible Amazan shattered
 them without. They all sallied forth armed, upon their unicorns, and
 Amazan put himself at their head. He had no difficulty in overthrowing
 the Alguazils, the Familiars, or the priests called _Anthropokaies_.
 Each unicorn pierced dozens at a time. The thundering Amazan cut to
 pieces all he met. The people in black cloaks and dirty frize ran away,
 always keeping fast hold of their blest beads, _por l'amor de Dios_.
 
 Amazan collared the high Inquisitor upon his tribunal, and threw him
 upon the pile, which was prepared about forty paces distant; and he also
 cast upon it the other Inquisitors, one after the other. He then
 prostrated himself at Formosanta's feet. "Ah! how amiable you are," said
 she; "and how I should adore you, if you had not forsaken me for the
 company of an opera singer."
 
 Whilst Amazan was making his peace with the princess, whilst his
 Gangarids cast upon the pile the bodies of all the _Anthropokaies_, and
 the flames ascended to the clouds, Amazan saw an army that approached
 him at a distance. An aged monarch, with a crown upon his head, advanced
 upon a car drawn by eight mules harnessed with ropes. An hundred other
 cars followed. They were accompanied by grave looking men in black
 cloaks or frize, mounted upon very fine horses. A multitude of people,
 with greasy hair, followed silently on foot.
 
 Amazan immediately drew up his Gangarids about him, and advanced with
 his lance couched. As soon as the king perceived him, he took off his
 crown, alighted from his car, and embraced Amazan's stirrup, saying to
 him: "Man sent by the gods, you are the avenger of human kind, the
 deliverer of my country. These sacred monsters, of which you have
 purged the earth, were my masters, in the name of the Old Man of the
 Seven Mountains. I was forced to submit to their criminal power. My
 people would have deserted me, if I had only been inclined to moderate
 their abominable crimes. From this moment I breathe, I reign, and am
 indebted to you for it."
 
 He afterward respectfully kissed Formosanta's hand, and entreated her to
 get into his coach (drawn by eight mules) with Amazan, Irla, and the
 phœnix.
 
 The two Palestine bankers, who still remained prostrate on the ground
 through fear and terror, now raised their heads. The troop of unicorns
 followed the king of Betica into his palace.
 
 As the dignity of a king who reigned over a people of characteristic
 brevity, required that his mules should go at a very slow pace, Amazan
 and Formosanta had time to relate to him their adventures. He also
 conversed with the phœnix, admiring and frequently embracing him. He
 easily comprehended how brutal and barbarous the people of the west
 should be considered, who ate animals, and did not understand their
 language; that the Gangarids alone had preserved the nature and dignity
 of primitive man; but he particularly agreed, that the most barbarous of
 mortals were the _Anthropokaies_, of whom Amazan had just purged the
 earth. He incessantly blessed and thanked him. The beautiful Formosanta
 had already forgotten the affair in Gaul, and had her soul filled with
 nothing but the valor of the hero who had preserved her life. Amazan
 being made acquainted with the innocence of the embrace she had given to
 the king of Egypt, and being told of the resurrection of the phœnix,
 tasted the purest joy, and was intoxicated with the most violent love.
 
 They dined at the palace, but had a very indifferent repast. The cooks
 of Betica were the worst in Europe. Amazan advised the king to send for
 some from Gaul. The king's musicians performed, during the repast, that
 celebrated air which has since been called _the Follies of Spain_. After
 dinner, matters of business came upon the carpet.
 
 The king enquired of the handsome Amazan, the beautiful Formosanta, and
 the charming phœnix, what they proposed doing. "For my part," said
 Amazan, "my intention is to return to Babylon, of which I am the
 presumptive heir, and to ask of my uncle Belus the hand of my
 cousin-german, the incomparable Formosanta."
 
 "My design certainly is," said the princess, "never to separate from my
 cousin-germain. But I imagine he will agree with me, that I should
 return first to my father, because he only gave me leave to go upon a
 pilgrimage to Bassora, and I have wandered all over the world."
 
 "For my part," said the phœnix, "I will follow every where these two
 tender, generous lovers."
 
 "You are in the right," said the king of Betica; "but your return to
 Babylon is not so easy as you imagine. I receive daily intelligence from
 that country by Tyrian ships, and my Palestine bankers, who correspond
 with all the nations of the earth. The people are all in arms toward the
 Euphrates and the Nile. The king of Scythia claims the inheritance of
 his wife, at the head of three hundred thousand warriors on horseback.
 The kings of Egypt and India are also laying waste the banks of the
 Tygris and the Euphrates, each at the head of three hundred thousand
 men, to revenge themselves for being laughed at. The king of Ethiopia is
 ravaging Egypt with three hundred thousand men, whilst the king of Egypt
 is absent from his country. And the king of Babylon has as yet only six
 hundred thousand men to defend himself.
 
 "I acknowledge to you," continued the king, "when I hear of those
 prodigious armies which are disembogued from the east, and their
 astonishing magnificence--when I compare them to my trifling bodies of
 twenty or thirty thousand soldiers, which it is so difficult to clothe
 and feed; I am inclined to think the eastern subsisted long before the
 western hemisphere. It seems as if we sprung only yesterday from chaos
 and barbarity."
 
 "Sire," said Amazan, "the last comers frequently outstrip those who
 first began the career. It is thought in my country that man was first
 created in India; but this I am not certain of."
 
 "And," said the king of Betica to the phœnix, "what do you think?"
 
 "Sire," replied the phœnix, "I am as yet too young to have any
 knowledge concerning antiquity. I have lived only about twenty-seven
 thousand years; but my father, who had lived five times that age, told
 me he had learned from his father, that the eastern country had always
 been more populous and rich than the others. It had been transmitted to
 him from his ancestors, that the generation of all animals had begun
 upon the banks of the Ganges. For my part, said he, I have not the
 vanity to be of this opinion. I cannot believe that the foxes of Albion,
 the marmots of the Alps, and the wolves of Gaul, are descended from my
 country. In the like manner, I do not believe that the firs and oaks of
 your country descended from the palm and cocoa trees of India."
 
 "But from whence are we descended, then?" said the king.
 
 "I do not know," said the phœnix; "all I want to know is, whither the
 beautiful princess of Babylon and my dear Amazan may repair."
 
 "I very much question," said the king, "whether with his two hundred
 unicorns he will be able to destroy so many armies of three hundred
 thousand men each."
 
 "Why not?" said Amazan. The king of Betica felt the force of this
 sublime question, "Why not?" but he imagined sublimity alone was not
 sufficient against innumerable armies.
 
 "I advise you," said he, "to seek the king of Ethiopia. I am related to
 that black prince through my Palestines. I will give you recommendatory
 letters to him. As he is at enmity with the king of Egypt, he will be
 but too happy to be strengthened by your alliance. I can assist you with
 two thousand sober, brave men; and it will depend upon yourself to
 engage as many more of the people who reside, or rather skip, about the
 foot of the Pyrenees, and who are called Vasques or Vascons. Send one of
 your warriors upon an unicorn, with a few diamonds. There is not a
 Vascon that will not quit the castle, that is, the thatched cottage of
 his father, to serve you. They are indefatigable, courageous, and
 agreeable; and whilst you wait their arrival, we will give you
 festivals, and prepare your ships. I cannot too much acknowledge the
 service you have done me."
 
 Amazan realized the happiness of having recovered Formosanta, and
 enjoyed in tranquillity her conversation, and all the charms of
 reconciled love,--which are almost equal to a growing passion.
 
 A troop of proud, joyous Vascons soon arrived, dancing a _tambourin_.
 The haughty and grave Betican troops were now ready. The old sun-burnt
 king tenderly embraced the two lovers. He sent great quantities of arms,
 beds, chests, boards, black clothes, onions, sheep, fowls, flour, and
 particularly garlic, on board the ships, and wished them a happy voyage,
 invariable love, and many victories.
 
 Proud Carthage was not then a sea-port. There were at that time only a
 few Numidians there, who dried fish in the sun. They coasted along
 Bizacenes, the Syrthes, the fertile banks where since arose Cyrene and
 the great Chersonese.
 
 They at length arrived toward the first mouth of the sacred Nile. It was
 at the extremity of this fertile land that the ships of all commercial
 nations were already received in the port of Canope, without knowing
 whether the god Canope had founded this port, or whether the inhabitants
 had manufactured the god--whether the star Canope had given its name to
 the city, or whether the city had bestowed it upon the star. All that
 was known of this matter was, that the city and the star were both very
 ancient; and this is all that can be known of the origin of things, of
 what nature soever they may be.
 
 It was here that the king of Ethiopia, having ravaged all Egypt, saw the
 invincible Amazan and the adorable Formosanta come on shore. He took one
 for the god of war, and the other for the goddess of beauty. Amazan
 presented to him the letter of recommendation from the king of Spain.
 The king of Ethiopia immediately entertained them with some admirable
 festivals, according to the indispensable custom of heroic times. They
 then conferred about their expedition to exterminate the three hundred
 thousand men of the king of Egypt, the three hundred thousand of the
 emperor of the Indies, and the three hundred thousand of the great Khan
 of the Scythians, who laid siege to the immense, proud, voluptuous city
 of Babylon.
 
 The two hundred Spaniards, whom Amazan had brought with him, said that
 they had nothing to do with the king of Ethiopia's succoring Babylon;
 that it was sufficient their king had ordered them to go and deliver it;
 and that they were formidable enough for this expedition.
 
 The Vascons said they had performed many other exploits; that they
 would alone defeat the Egyptians, the Indians, and the Scythians; and
 that they would not march unless the Spaniards were placed in the
 rear-guard.
 
 The two hundred Gangarids could not refrain from laughing at the
 pretensions of their allies, and they maintained that with only one
 hundred unicorns, they could put to flight all the kings of the earth.
 The beautiful Formosanta appeased them by her prudence, and by her
 enchanting discourse. Amazan introduced to the black monarch his
 Gangarids, his unicorns, his Spaniards, his Vascons, and his beautiful
 bird.
 
 Every thing was soon ready to march by Memphis, Heliopolis, Arsinoe,
 Petra, Artemitis, Sora, and Apamens, to attack the three kings, and to
 prosecute this memorable war, before which all the wars ever waged by
 man sink into insignificance.
 
 Fame with her hundred tongues has proclaimed the victories Amazan gained
 over the three kings, with his Spaniards, his Vascons, and his unicorns.
 He restored the beautiful Formosanta to her father. He set at liberty
 all his mistress's train, whom the king of Egypt had reduced to slavery.
 The great Khan of the Scythians declared himself his vassal; and his
 marriage was confirmed with princess Aldea. The invincible and generous
 Amazan, was acknowledged the heir to the kingdom of Babylon, and entered
 the city in triumph with the phœnix, in the presence of a hundred
 tributary kings. The festival of his marriage far surpassed that which
 king Belus had given. The bull Apis was served up roasted at table. The
 kings of Egypt and India were cup-bearers to the married pair; and these
 nuptials were celebrated by five hundred illustrious poets of Babylon.
 
 Oh, Muses! daughters of heaven, who are constantly invoked at the
 beginning of a work, I only implore you at the end. It is needless to
 reproach me with saying grace, without having said _benedicite_. But,
 Muses! you will not be less my patronesses. Inspire, I pray you, the
 _Ecclesiastical Gazetteer_, the illustrious orator of the
 _Convulsionnaires_, to say every thing possible against _The Princess of
 Babylon_, in order that the work may be condemned by the Sorbonne, and,
 therefore, be universally read. And prevent, I beseech you, O chaste and
 noble Muses, any supplemental scribblers spoiling, by their fables, the
 truths I have taught mortals in this faithful narrative.

 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.
 
 
 
 
 I.
 
 NATIONAL POVERTY.
 
 
 An old man, who is forever _pitying the present times, and extolling the
 past_, was saying to me: "Friend, France is not so rich as it was under
 Henry the IVth."
 
 "And why?"
 
 "Because the lands are not so well cultivated; because hands are wanting
 for the cultivation; and because the day-laborer having raised the price
 of his work, many land owners let their inheritances he fallow."
 
 "Whence comes this scarcity of hands?"
 
 "From this, that whoever finds in himself anything of a spirit of
 industry, takes up the trades of embroiderer, chaser, watchmaker, silk
 weaver, attorney, or divine. It is also because the revocation of the
 Edict of Nantes has left a great void in the kingdom; because nuns and
 beggars of all kinds have greatly multiplied; because the people in
 general avoid as much as possible the hard labor of cultivation, for
 which we are born by God's destination, and which we have rendered
 ignominious by our own opinions; so very wise are we!
 
 "Another cause of our poverty lies in our new wants. We pay our
 neighbors four millions of livres on one article, and five or six upon
 another, such, for example, as a stinking powder for stuffing up our
 noses brought from America. Our coffee, tea, chocolate, cochineal,
 indigo, spices, cost us above sixty millions a year. All these were
 unknown to us in the reign of Henry the IVth, except the spices, of
 which, however, the consumption was not so great as it is now. We burn a
 hundred times more wax-lights than were burnt then; and get more than
 the half of the wax from foreign countries, because we neglect our own
 hives. We see a hundred times more diamonds in the ears, round the
 necks, and on the hands of our city ladies of Paris, and other great
 towns, than were worn by all the ladies of Henry the IVth's court, the
 Queen included. Almost all the superfluities are necessarily paid for
 with ready specie.
 
 "Observe especially that we pay to foreigners above fifteen millions of
 annuities on the _Hôtel-de-Ville_; and that Henry the IVth, on his
 accession, having found two millions of debt in all on this imaginary
 _Hôtel_, very wisely paid off a part, to ease the state of this burden.
 
 "Consider that our civil wars were the occasion of the treasures of
 Mexico being poured into the kingdom, when Don Philip _el Discreto_ took
 it into his head to buy France, and that since that time, our foreign
 wars have eased us of a good half of our money.
 
 "These are partly the causes of our poverty; a poverty which we hide
 under varnished ceilings, or with the help of our dealers in fashion. We
 are poor with taste. There are some officers of revenue, there are
 contractors or jobbers, there are merchants, very rich; their children,
 their sons-in-law, are also very rich, but the nation in general is
 unfortunately not so."
 
 This old man's discourse, well or ill grounded, made a deep impression
 on me; for the curate of my parish, who had always had a friendship for
 me, had taught me a little of geometry and of history: and I begin to
 reflect a little, which is very rare in my province. I do not know
 whether he was right or not in every thing, but being very poor, I could
 very easily believe that I had a great many companions of my misery.
 
 
 
 
 II.
 
 DISASTER OF THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.
 
 
 I very readily make known to the _universe_ that I have a landed estate
 which would yield me forty crowns a year, were it not for the tax laid
 on it.
 
 There came forth several edicts from certain persons, who, having
 nothing better to do, govern the state at their fire-side, the preamble
 of these edicts was, "that the legislative and executive was born, _jure
 divino_, the co-proprietor of my land;" and that I owe it at least the
 half of what I possess. The enormity of this legislative and executive
 power made me bless myself. What would it be if that power which
 presides over "the essential order of society," were to take the whole
 of my little estate? The one is still more divine than the other.
 
 The comptroller general knows that I used to pay, in all, but twelve
 livres; that even this was a heavy burden on me, and that I should have
 sunk under it, if God had not given me the talent of making wicker
 baskets, which helped to carry me through my trials. But how should I,
 on a sudden, be able to give the king twenty crowns?
 
 The new ministers also said in their preamble, that it was not fit to
 tax anything but the land, because every thing arises from the land,
 even rain itself, and consequently that nothing was properly liable to
 taxation, but the fruits of the land.
 
 During the last war, one of their collectors came to my house, and
 demanded of me, for my quota, three measures of corn, and a sack of
 beans, the whole worth twenty crowns, to maintain the war--of which I
 never knew the reason, having only heard it said, that there was nothing
 to be got by it for our country, and a great deal to lose. As I had not
 at that time either corn, or beans, or money, the legislative and
 executive power had me dragged to prison; and the war went on as well as
 it could.
 
 On my release from the dungeon, being nothing but skin and bone, whom
 should I meet but a jolly fresh colored man in a coach and six? He had
 six footmen, to each of whom he gave for his wages more than the double
 of my revenue. His head-steward, who, by the way, looked in as good
 plight as himself, had of him a salary of two thousand livres, and
 robbed him every year of twenty thousand more. His mistress had in six
 months stood him in forty thousand crowns. I had formerly known him when
 he was less well to pass than myself. He owned, by way of comfort to me,
 that he enjoyed four hundred thousand livres a year.
 
 "I suppose, then," said I, "that you pay out of this income two hundred
 thousand to the state, to help to support that advantageous war we are
 carrying on; since I, who have but just a hundred and twenty livres a
 year, am obliged to pay half of them."
 
 "I," said he, "I contribute to the wants of the state? You are surely
 jesting, my friend. I have inherited from an uncle his fortune of eight
 millions, which he got at Cadiz and at Surat; I have not a foot of land;
 my estate lies in government contracts, and in the funds. I owe the
 state nothing. It is for you to give half of your substance,--you who
 are a proprietor of land. Do you not see, that if the minister of the
 revenue were to require anything of me in aid of our country, he would
 be a blockhead, that could not calculate? for every thing is the produce
 of the land. Money and the paper currency are nothing but pledges of
 exchange. If, after having laid the sole tax, the tax that is to supply
 the place of all others, on those commodities, the government were to
 ask money of me; do you not see, that this would be a double load? that
 it would be asking the same thing twice over? My uncle sold at Cadiz to
 the amount of two millions of your corn, and of two millions of stuffs
 made of your wool; upon these two articles he gained cent. per cent. You
 must easily think that this profit came out of lands already taxed. What
 my uncle bought for tenpence of you, he sold again for above fifty
 livres at Mexico; and thus he made a shift to return to his own country
 with eight millions clear.
 
 "You must be sensible, then, that it would be a horrid injustice to
 re-demand of him a few farthings on the tenpence he paid you. If twenty
 nephews like me, whose uncles had gained each eight millions at Buenos
 Ayres, at Lima, at Surat, or at Pondicherry, were, in the urgent
 necessities of the state, each to lend to it only two hundred thousand
 livres, that would produce four millions. But what horror would that
 be! Pay then thou, my friend, who enjoyest quietly the neat and clear
 revenue of forty crowns; serve thy country well, and come now and then
 to dine with my servants in livery."
 
 This plausible discourse made me reflect a good deal, but I cannot say
 it much comforted me.
 
 
 
 
 III.
 
 CONVERSATION WITH A GEOMETRICIAN.
 
 
 It sometimes happens that a man has no answer to make, and yet is not
 persuaded. He is overthrown without the feeling of being convinced. He
 feels at the bottom of his heart a scruple, a repugnance, which hinders
 him from believing what has been proved to him. A geometrician
 demonstrates to you, that between a circle and a tangent, you may thread
 a number of curves, and yet cannot get one straight line to pass. Your
 eyes, your reason, tell you the contrary. The geometrician gravely
 answers you, that it is an infinitesimal of the second order. You stare
 in stupid silence, and quit the field all astonished, without having any
 clear idea, without comprehending anything, and without having any reply
 to make.
 
 Consult but a geometrician of more candor, and he explains the mystery
 to you.
 
 "We suppose," says he, "what cannot be in nature, lines which have
 length without breadth. Naturally and philosophically speaking, it is
 impossible for one real line to penetrate another. No curve, nor no
 right line can pass between two real lines that touch one another. These
 theorems that puzzle you are but sports of the imagination, ideal
 chimeras. Whereas true geometry is the art of measuring things actually
 existent."
 
 I was perfectly well satisfied with the confession of the sensible
 mathematician, and, with all my misfortune, could not help laughing on
 learning that there was a quackery even in that science, which is called
 the sublime science. My geometrician was a kind of philosophical
 patriot, who had deigned to chat with me sometimes in my cottage. I said
 to him:
 
 "Sir, you have tried to enlighten the cockneys of Paris, on a point of
 the greatest concern to mankind, that of the duration of human life. It
 is to you alone that the ministry owes its knowledge of the due rate of
 annuities for lives, according to different ages. You have proposed to
 furnish the houses in town with what water they may want, and to deliver
 us at length from the shame and ridicule of hearing water cried about
 the streets, and of seeing women inclosed within an oblong hoop,
 carrying two pails of water, both together of about thirty pounds
 weight, up to a fourth story. Be so good, in the name of friendship, to
 tell me, how many two-handed bipeds there may be in France?"
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--It is assumed, that there may be about twenty
 millions, and I am willing to adopt this calculation as the most
 probable, till it can be verified, which it would be very easy to do,
 and which, however, has not hitherto been done, because _one does not
 always think of every thing_.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--How many acres, think you, the whole territory
 of France contains?
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--One hundred and thirty millions, of which almost the
 half is in roads, in towns, villages, moors, heaths, marshes, sands,
 barren lands, useless convents, gardens of more pleasure than profit,
 uncultivated grounds, and bad grounds ill cultivated. We might reduce
 all the land which yields good returns to seventy-five millions of
 square acres; but let us state them at fourscore millions. One cannot do
 too much for one's country.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--How much may you think each acre brings in
 yearly, one year with another, in corn, seeds of all kinds, wine,
 fish-ponds, wood, metals, cattle, fruit, wool, silk, oil, milk, clear of
 all charges, without reckoning the tax?
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--Why, if they produce each twenty-five livres, (about
 twenty English shillings), it is a great deal; but not to discourage our
 countrymen, let us put them at thirty livres. There are acres which
 produce constantly regenerating value, and which are estimated at three
 hundred livres: there are others which only produce three livres. The
 mean proportion between three and three hundred is thirty; for you must
 allow that three is to thirty as thirty is to three hundred. If, indeed,
 there were comparatively many acres at thirty livres, and very few at
 three hundred, our account would not hold good; but, once more, I would
 not be over punctilious.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--Well, sir; how much will these fourscore
 millions of acres yield of revenue, estimated in money?
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--The account is ready made; they will produce two
 thousand four hundred millions of livres of the present currency.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--I have read that Solomon possessed, of his own
 property, twenty-five thousand millions of livres, in ready money; and
 certainly there are not two thousand four hundred millions of specie
 circulating in France, which, I am told, is much greater and much richer
 than Solomon's country.
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--There lies the mystery. There may be about nine
 hundred millions circulating throughout the kingdom; and this money,
 passing from hand to hand, is sufficient to pay for all the produce of
 the land, and of industry. The same crown may pass ten times from the
 pocket of the cultivator, into that of the ale-housekeeper, and of the
 tax-gatherer.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--I apprehend you. But you told me that we are,
 in all, about twenty millions of inhabitants, men, women, old and young.
 How much, pray, do you allow for each?
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--One hundred and twenty livres, or forty crowns.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--You have just guessed my revenue. I have four
 acres, which, reckoning the fallow years with those of produce, bring me
 in one hundred and twenty livres; which is little enough, God knows.
 
 But if every individual were to have his contingent, would that be no
 more than five louis d'ors a year?
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--Certainly not, according to our calculation, which I
 have a little amplified. Such is the state of human nature. Our life and
 our fortune have narrow limits. In Paris, they do not, one with another,
 live above twenty-two or twenty-three years, and, one with another,
 have not, at the most, above a hundred and twenty livres a year to
 spend. So that your food, your raiment, your lodging, your movables, are
 all represented by the sum of one hundred and twenty livres.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--Alas! What have I done to you, that you thus
 abridge me of my fortune and life? Can it then be true, that I have but
 three and twenty years to live, unless I rob my fellow-creatures of
 their share?
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--This is incontestable in the good city of Paris. But
 from these twenty-three years you must deduct ten, at the least, for
 your childhood, as childhood is not an enjoyment of life; it is a
 preparation; it is the porch of the edifice; it is the tree that has not
 yet given fruits; it is the dawn of a day. Then again, from the thirteen
 years which remain to you, deduct the time of sleep, and that of
 tiresomeness of life, and that will be at least a moiety. You will then
 have six years and a half left to pass in vexation, in pain, in some
 pleasures, and in hopes.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--Merciful heaven! At this rate, your account
 does not allow us above three years of tolerable existence.
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.---That is no fault of mine. Nature cares very little
 for individuals. There are insects which do not live above one day, but
 of which the species is perpetual. Nature resembles those great princes,
 who reckon as nothing the loss of four hundred thousand men, so they but
 accomplish their august designs.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--Forty Crowns and three years of life! What
 resource can you imagine against two such curses?
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--As to life, it would be requisite to render the air
 of Paris more pure--that men should eat less and take more
 exercise--that mothers should suckle their own children--that people
 should be no longer so ill-advised as to dread inoculation. This is what
 I have already said; and as to fortune, why, even marry and rear a
 family.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--How! Can the way to live more at ease be to
 associate to my own bad circumstances those of others?
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--Five or six bad circumstances put together form a
 tolerable establishment. Get a good wife, and we will say only two sons
 and two daughters; this will make seven hundred and twenty livres for
 your little family, that is to say, if distributive justice were to take
 place, and that each individual had an hundred and twenty livres a year.
 Your children, in their infancy, stand you in almost nothing; when grown
 up they will ease and help you. Their mutual aid will save you a good
 part of your expenses, and you may live very happy, like a philosopher.
 Always provided, however, that those worthy gentlemen who govern the
 state have not the barbarity to extort from each of you twenty crowns a
 year. But the misfortune is, we are no longer in the golden age, where
 the men, born all equals, had an equal part in the nutritive productions
 of uncultivated land. The case is now far from being so good a one, as
 that every two-handed biped possesses land to the value of an hundred
 and twenty livres a year.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--'Sdeath! You ruin us. You said but just now,
 that in a country of fourscore millions of inhabitants, each of them
 ought to enjoy an hundred and twenty livres a year, and now you take
 them away from us again!
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--I was computing according to the registers of the
 golden age, but we must reckon according to that of iron. There are many
 inhabitants who have but the value of ten crowns a year, others no more
 than four or five, and above six millions of men who have absolutely
 nothing.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--Nothing? Why they would perish of hunger in
 three days' time.
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--Not in the least. The others, who possess their
 portions, set them to work, and share with them. It is from this
 arrangement that the pay comes for the divine, the confectioner, the
 apothecary, the preacher, the actor, the attorney, and the
 hackney-coachman. You thought yourself very ill off, to have no more
 than a hundred and twenty livres a year, reduced to a hundred and eight
 by your tax of twelve livres. But consider the soldiers who devote their
 blood to their country at the rate of fourpence a day. They have not
 above sixty-three livres a year for their livelihood, and yet they make
 a comfortable shift, by a number of them joining their little stock and
 living in common.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--So then an ex-Jesuit has more than five times
 the pay of a soldier. And yet the soldiers have done more service to the
 state under the eyes of the king at Fontenoy, at Laufelt, at the siege
 of Fribourg, than the reverend Father Le Valette ever did in his life.
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--Nothing can be truer: nay, every one of these
 turned-adrift Jesuits, having now become free, has more to spend than
 what he cost his convent. There are even some among them who have gained
 a good deal of money by scribbling pamphlets against the parliaments, as
 for example, the reverend father Patouillet, and the reverend father
 Monote. In short, in this world every one sets his wits to work for a
 livelihood. One is at the head of a manufactory of stuffs; another of
 porcelain; another undertakes the opera; another the _Ecclesiastical
 Gazette_; another a tragedy in familiar life, or a novel or romance in
 the English style; this maintains the stationer, the ink-maker, the
 bookseller, the hawker, who might else be reduced to beggary. There is
 nothing, then, but the restitution of the hundred and twenty livres to
 those who have nothing, that makes the state flourish.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--A pretty way of flourishing, truly!
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--And yet there is no other. In every country it is the
 rich that enable the poor to live. This is the sole source of the
 industry of commerce. The more industrious a nation itself is, the more
 it gains from foreign countries. Could we, on our foreign trade, get ten
 millions a year by the balance in our favor, there would, in twenty
 years, be two hundred millions more in the nation. This would afford ten
 livres a head more, on the supposition of an equitable distribution;
 that is to say, that the dealers would make each poor person earn ten
 livres the more, once paid, in the hopes of making still more
 considerable gains. But commerce, like the fertility of the earth, has
 its bounds, otherwise its progression would be _ad infinitum_. Nor,
 besides, is it clear, that the balance of our trade is constantly
 favorable to us; there are times in which we lose.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--I have heard much talk of population. If our
 inhabitants were doubled, so that we numbered forty millions of people
 instead of twenty, what would be the consequence?
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--It would be this: that, one with another, each would
 have, instead of forty, but twenty crowns to live upon; or that the land
 should produce double the crops it now does; or that there should be
 double the national industry, or of gain from foreign countries; or that
 half of the people should be sent to America; or that one half of the
 nation should eat the other.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--Let us then remain satisfied with our twenty
 millions of inhabitants, and with our hundred and twenty livres a head,
 distributed as it shall please the Lord. Yet this situation is a sad
 one, and your iron age is hard indeed.
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--There is no nation that is better off; and there are
 many that are worse. Do you believe that there is in the North
 wherewithal to afford to each inhabitant the value of an hundred and
 twenty of our livres a year? If they had had the equivalent of this, the
 Huns, the Vandals, and the Franks would not have deserted their country,
 in quest of establishments elsewhere, which they conquered, fire and
 sword in hand.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--If I were to listen to you, you would persuade
 me presently that I am happy with my hundred and twenty livres.
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--If you would but think yourself happy, you would then
 be so.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--A man cannot imagine what actually is not,
 unless he be mad.
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--I have already told you, that in order to be more at
 your ease, and more happy than you are, you should take a wife; to which
 I tack, however, this clause, that she has, as well as you, one hundred
 and twenty livres a year; that is to say, four acres at ten crowns an
 acre. The ancient Romans had each but one. If your children are
 industrious, they can each earn as much by their working for others.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--So that they may get money, without others
 losing it.
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--Such is the law of all nations: there is no living
 but on these terms.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--And must my wife and I give each of us the
 half of our produce to the legislative and executive power, and the new
 ministers of state rob us of the price of our hard labor, and of the
 substance of our poor children, before they are able to get their
 livelihood? Pray, tell me, how much money will these new ministers of
 ours bring into the king's coffers, by this _jure divino_ system?
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--You pay twenty crowns on four acres, which bring you
 in forty. A rich man, who possesses four hundred acres will, by the new
 tariff, pay two thousand crowns; and the whole fourscore millions of
 acres will yield to the king, twelve hundred millions of livres a year,
 or four hundred millions of crowns.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--That appears to me impracticable and
 impossible.
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--And very much you are in the right to think so: and
 this impossibility is a geometrical demonstration that there is a
 fundamental defect in the calculation of our new ministers.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--Is not there also demonstrably a prodigious
 injustice in taking from me the half of my corn, of my hemp, of the wool
 of my sheep, etc., and, at the same time, to require no aid from those
 who shall have gained ten, twenty, or thirty thousand livres a year, by
 my hemp, of which they will have made linen,--by my wool, of which they
 will have made cloth,--by my corn, which they will have sold at so much
 more than it cost them?
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--The injustice of this administration is as evident as
 its calculation is erroneous. It is right to favor industry; but opulent
 industry ought to contribute to support the state. This industry will
 have certainly taken from you a part of your one hundred and twenty
 livres, and appropriated that part to itself, in selling you your shirts
 and your coat twenty times dearer than they would have cost you, if you
 had made them yourself. The manufacturer who shall have enriched
 himself, at your expense, will, I allow, have also paid wages to his
 workmen, who had nothing of themselves, but he will, every year, have
 sunk, and put by a sum that will, at length, have produced to him thirty
 thousand livres a year. This fortune then he will have acquired at your
 expense. Nor can you ever sell him the produce of your land dear enough
 to reimburse you for what he will have got by you; for were you to
 attempt such an advance of your price, he would procure what he wanted
 cheaper from other countries. A proof of which is, that he remains
 constantly possessor of his thirty thousand livres a year, and you of
 your one hundred and twenty livres, that often diminish, instead of
 increasing.
 
 It is then necessary and equitable, that the refined industry of the
 trader should pay more than the gross industry of the farmer. The same
 is to be said of the collectors of the revenue. Your tax had previously
 been but twelve livres, before our great ministers were pleased to take
 from you twenty crowns. On these twelve livres, the collector retained
 tenpence, or ten _sols_ for himself. If in your province there were five
 hundred thousand souls, he will have gained two hundred and fifty
 thousand livres a year. Suppose he spends fifty thousand, it is clear,
 that at the end of ten years he will be two millions in pocket. It is
 then but just that he should contribute his proportion, otherwise, every
 thing would be perverted, and go to ruin.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--I am very glad you have taxed the officer of
 the revenue. It is some relief to my imagination. But since he has so
 well increased his superfluity, what shall I do to augment my small
 modicum?
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--I have already told you, by marrying, by laboring, by
 trying to procure from your land some sheaves of corn in addition to
 what it previously produced.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--Well! granted then that I shall have been duly
 industrious; that all my countrymen will have been so too; and that the
 legislative and executive power shall have received a good round tax;
 how much will the nation have gained at the end of the year?
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--Nothing at all; unless it shall have carried on a
 profitable foreign trade. But life will have been more agreeable in it.
 Every one will, respectively, in proportion, have had more clothes, more
 linen, more movables than he had before. There will have been in the
 nation a more abundant circulation. The wages would have been, in
 process of time, augmented, nearly in proportion to the number of the
 sheaves of corn, of the tods of wool, of the ox-hides, of the sheep and
 goats, that will have been added, of the clusters of grapes that will
 have been squeezed in the wine-press. More of the value of commodities
 will have been paid to the king in money, and the king will have
 returned more value to those he will have employed under his orders; but
 there will not be half a crown the more in the kingdom.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.---What will then remain to the government at
 the end of the year?
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--Once more, nothing. This is the case of government in
 general. It never lays by anything. It will have got its living, that is
 to say, its food, raiment, lodging, movables. The subject will have done
 so too. Where a government amasses treasure, it will have squeezed from
 the circulation so much money as it will have amassed. It will have made
 so many wretched, as it will have put by forty crowns in its coffers.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--At this rate, then, Henry IV. was but a
 mean-spirited wretch, a miser, a plunderer, for I have been told that he
 had chested up in the Bastile, above fifty millions of livres according
 to our present currency.
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--He was a man as good, and as prudent, as he was
 brave. He was preparing to make a just war, and by amassing in his
 coffers twenty-two millions of the currency of that time, besides which
 he had twenty more to receive, which he left in circulation, he spared
 the people above a hundred millions that it would have cost, if he had
 not taken those useful measures. He made himself morally sure of success
 against an enemy who had not taken the like precaution. The
 probabilities were prodigiously in his favor. His twenty-two millions,
 in bank, proved that there was then in this kingdom, twenty-two millions
 of surplusage of the territorial produce, so that no one was a sufferer.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--My father then told me the truth, when he said
 that the subject was in proportion more rich under the administration of
 the Duke of Sully than under that of our new ministers, who had laid on
 the _single_ tax, the _sole_ tax, and who, out of my forty crowns, have
 taken away twenty. Pray, tell me, is there another nation in the world
 that enjoys this precious advantage of the _sole tax_?
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--Not one opulent nation. The English, who are not much
 giving to laughing, could not, however, help bursting out, when they
 heard that men of intelligence, among us, had proposed this kind of
 administration. The Chinese exact a tax from all the foreign trading
 ships that resort to Canton. The Dutch pay, at Nangazaqui, when they are
 received in Japan, under pretext that they are not Christians. The
 Laplanders, and the Samoieds, are indeed subjected to a sole tax in
 sables or marten-skins. The republic of St. Marino pays nothing more
 than tithes for the maintenance of that state in its splendor.
 
 There is, in Europe, a nation celebrated for its equity and its valor,
 that pays no tax. This is Switzerland. But thus it has happened. The
 people have put themselves in the place of the Dukes of Austria and of
 Zeringue. The small cantons are democratical, and very poor. Each
 inhabitant pays but a trifling sum toward the support of this little
 republic. In the rich cantons, the people are charged, for the state,
 with those duties which the Archdukes of Austria and the lords of the
 land used to exact. The protestant cantons are, in proportion, twice as
 rich as the catholic, because the state, in the first, possesses the
 lands of the monks. Those who were formerly subjects to the Archdukes of
 Austria, to the Duke of Zeringue, and to the monks, are now the subjects
 of their own country. They pay to that country the same tithes, the same
 fines of alienation, that they paid to their former masters; and as the
 subjects, in general, have very little trade, their merchandise is
 liable to no charges, except some small staple duties. The men make a
 trade of their courage, in their dealings with foreign powers, and sell
 themselves for a certain term of years, which brings some money into
 their country at our expense: and this example is as singular a one in
 the civilized world, as is the sole tax now laid on by our new
 legislators.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--So, sir, the Swiss are not plundered, _jure
 divino_, of one-half of their goods; and he that has four cows in
 Switzerland is not obliged to give two of them to the state?
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--Undoubtedly, not. In one canton, upon thirteen tons
 of wine, they pay one, and drink the other twelve. In another canton,
 they pay the twelfth, and drink the remaining eleven.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--Why am not I a Swiss? That cursed tax, that
 single and singularly iniquitous tax, that has reduced me to beggary!
 But then again, three or four hundred taxes, of which it is impossible
 for me to retain or pronounce the bare names, are they more just and
 more tolerable? Was there ever a legislator, who, in founding a state,
 wished to create counselors to the king, inspectors of coal-meters,
 gaugers of wine, measurers of wood, searchers of hog-tongues,
 comptrollers of salt butter? or to maintain an army of rascals, twice as
 numerous as that of Alexander, commanded by sixty generals, who lay the
 country under contribution, who gain, every day, signal victories, who
 take prisoners, and who sometimes sacrifice them in the air, or on a
 boarded stage, as the ancient Scythians did, according to what my vicar
 told me?
 
 Now, was such a legislation, against which so many outcries were raised,
 and which caused the shedding of so many tears, much better than the
 newly imposed one, which at one stroke, cleanly and quietly takes away
 half of my subsistence? I am afraid, that on a fair liquidation, it will
 be found that under the ancient system of the revenue, they used to
 take, at times and in detail, three-quarters of it.
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--_Iliacos intra muros peccatur et extra. Est modus in
 retus. Caveas fine quidnimie._
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--I have learned a little of history, and
 something of geometry; but I do not understand a word of Latin.
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--The sense is, pretty nearly, as follows. _There is
 wrong on both sides. Keep to a medium in every thing. Nothing too much._
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--I say, nothing too much; that is really my
 situation; but the worst of it is, I have not enough.
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--I allow that you must perish of want, and I too, and
 the state too, if the new administration should continue only two years
 longer; but it is to be hoped heaven will have mercy on us.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS.--We pass our lives in hope, and die hoping to
 the last. Adieu, sir, you have enlightened me, but my heart is grieved.
 
 THE GEOMETRICIAN.--This is, indeed, often the fruit of knowledge.
 
 [Illustration: Palace of the barefooted Carmelites.--"What would you
 please to have, my son?"--"A morsel of bread, my reverend father. The
 new edicts have stripped me of everything."--"Son, know that we
 ourselves beg charity; we do not bestow it."]
 
 
 
 
 IV.
 
 AN ADVENTURE WITH A CARMELITE.
 
 
 When I had thanked the academician of the Academy of Sciences, for
 having set me right, I went away quite out of heart, praising
 providence, but muttering between my teeth these doleful words: "_What!
 to have no more than forty crowns a year to live on, nor more than
 twenty-two years to live!_ Alas! may our life be yet shorter, since it
 is to be so miserable!"
 
 As I was saying this, I found myself just opposite a very superb house.
 Already was I feeling myself pressed by hunger. I had not so much as the
 hundred and twentieth part of the sum that by right belongs to each
 individual. But as soon as I was told that this was the palace of my
 reverend fathers, the bare-footed Carmelites, I conceived great hopes,
 and said to myself, since these saints are humble enough to go
 bare-footed, they will be charitable enough to give me a dinner.
 
 I rang. A Carmelite came to the door.
 
 "What would you please to have, my son?"
 
 "A morsel of bread, my reverend father. The new edicts have stripped me
 of every thing."
 
 "Son, know that we ourselves beg charity; we do not bestow it."[1]
 
 "What! while your holy institute forbids you to wear shoes, you have the
 house of a prince, and can you refuse to me a meal?"
 
 "My son, it is true, we go without stockings and shoes; that is an
 expense the less; we feel no more cold in our feet than in our hands.
 As to our fine house, we built it very easily, as we have a hundred
 thousand livres a year of income from houses in the same street."
 
 "So, then! you suffer me to die of hunger, while you have an income of a
 hundred thousand livres! I suppose you pay fifty thousand of these to
 the new government?"
 
 "Heaven preserve us from paying a single farthing! It is only the
 produce of the land cultivated by laborious hands, callous with work,
 and moistened with tears, that owes taxes to the legislative and
 executive power. The alms which have been bestowed upon us, have enabled
 us to build those houses, by the rent of which we get a hundred thousand
 livres a year. But these alms, coming from the fruits of the earth, and
 having, consequently, already paid the tax, ought not to pay twice. They
 have sanctified the faithful believers, who have impoverished themselves
 to enrich us, and we continue to beg charity, and to lay under
 contribution the Fauxbourg of St. Germain, in order to sanctify a still
 greater number of the faithful believers."[2]
 
 Having thus spoken, the Carmelite politely shut the door in my face.
 
 I then passed along and stopped before the _Hôtel_ of the _Mousquetaires
 gris_, and related to those gentlemen what had just happened to me. They
 gave me a good dinner and half a crown, (_un ecu_). One of them proposed
 to go directly and set fire to the convent; but a musqueteer, more
 discreet than he, remonstrated with him, insisting that the time for
 action had not yet arrived, and implored him to wait patiently a little
 longer.[3]
 
 
 [1] Victor Hugo in his poem, _Christ at the Vatican_, (translated by
 G.B. Burleigh,) rebukes this inhuman spirit of monkish greed and
 avarice, which always receives but neves gives in return. In the poem,
 Christ is represented as saying:
 
                                "----I have said,
      'I will have mercy and not sacrifice;'--
      Have said, 'Give freely what, without a price,
      Was given to you.' To my redeemed, instead,
      You sell baptism upon their natal bed;
      Sell to the sinner void indulgences;
      To lovers sell the natural right to wed;
      Sell to the dying the privilege of decease,
      And sell your funeral masses to the dead!
      Your prayers and masses and communions sell;
      Beads, benedictions, crosses; in your eyes
      Nothing is sacred,--all is merchandise."--E.
 
 
 [2] In a recent number of _The Nineteenth Century_, Mr. Alex. A. Knox,
 in an able criticism on the writings of Voltaire, says very truly:
 
 "It should not be forgotten that in his day a very large portion of the
 soil of France was in the hands of the clergy, free from all burdens,
 save in so far as the clergy chose to execute them by the way of
 'gratuitous gifts.' The condition of the French peasant was frightful.
 Arthur Young, Dr. Moore, and others have described it at a somewhat
 later date, but it was even so in Voltaire's time. Of course the
 'clerical immunities' were far from being the only cause of all this
 misery; but they were a frightful addition to it."
 
 [3] The degradation of labor, and the corruption and injustice of the
 papal priesthood, were the inciting causes of the great revolution in
 France, which at length overturned the monarchy, and convulsed, for so
 long a period, every nation in Europe. In reading this romance of the
 hardships of the laborer, we may learn to comprehend the true principles
 of Voltaire, and recognize his great benevolence and sympathy with
 suffering and distress. We may also listen to the first faint mutterings
 of the terrible storm of blood and retribution, that was so soon to
 burst over unhappy France, and overwhelm in its lurid course all ranks
 and conditions of mankind--the innocent and the guilty, the oppressed
 and the oppressor, the peasant and the priest.--E.
 
 
 
 
 V.
 
 AUDIENCE OF THE COMPTROLLER GENERAL.
 
 
 I went, with my half-crown, to present a petition to the comptroller
 general, who was that day giving audience.
 
 His anti-chamber was filled with people of all kinds. There were there
 especially some with more bluff faces, more prominent bellies, and more
 arrogant looks than my man of eight millions. I durst not draw near to
 them; I saw them, but they did not observe me.
 
 A monk, a great man for tithes, had begun a suit at law against certain
 subjects of the state, whom he called his tenants. He had already a
 larger income than the half of his parishioners put together, and was
 moreover lord of the manor. His claim was, that whereas his vassals had,
 with infinite pains, converted their heaths into vineyards, they owed
 him a tithe of the wine, which, taking into the account the price of
 labor, of the vine-props, of the casks and cellarage, would carry off
 above a quarter of the produce.
 
 "But," said he, "as the tithes are due, _jure divino_, I demand the
 quarter of the substance of my tenants, in the name of God."
 
 The minister of the revenue said to him, "I see how charitable you are."
 
 A farmer-general, extremely well-skilled in assessments, interposed,
 saying:
 
 "Sir, that village can afford nothing to this monk; as I have, but the
 last year, made the parishioners pay thirty-two taxes on their wine,
 besides their over-consumption of the allowance for their own drinking.
 They are entirely ruined. I have seized and sold their cattle and
 movables, and yet they are still my debtors. I protest, then, against
 the claim of the reverend father."
 
 "You are in the right," answered the minister of the revenue, "to be his
 rival; you both equally love your neighbor, and you both edify me."
 
 A third, a monk and lord of the manor, whose tenants were in mortmain,
 was waiting for a decree of the council that should put him in
 possession of all the estate of a Paris cockney, who having,
 inadvertently, lived a year and a day in a house subject to this
 servitude, and inclosed within the hands of this priest, had died at the
 year's end. The monk was claiming all the estate of this cockney, and
 claiming it _jure divino_.
 
 The minister found by this, that the heart of this monk was as just and
 as tender as those of the others.
 
 A fourth, who was comptroller of the royal domains, presented a specious
 memorial, in which he justified himself for his having reduced twenty
 families to beggary. They had inherited from their uncles, their aunts,
 their brothers, or cousins; and were liable to pay the duties. The
 officers of the domain had generously proved to them, that they had not
 set the full value on their inheritances,--that they were much richer
 than they believed, and, consequently, having condemned them to a triple
 fine, ruined them in charges, and threw the heads of the families into
 jail, he had bought their best possessions without untying his
 purse-strings.
 
 The comptroller general said to him, in a tone indeed rather bitter:
 
 _"Euge, controlleur bone et fidelis, quia supra pauca fuisti fidelis,
 fermier-general te constituam."_
 
 But to a master of the requests, who was standing at his side, he said
 in a low voice:
 
 "We must make these blood-suckers, sacred and profane, disgorge. It is
 time to give some relief to the people, who, without our care, and our
 equity, would have nothing to live upon in this world at least, however
 they might fare in the other."
 
 Some, of profound genius, presented projects to him. One of them had
 imagined a scheme to lay a tax on wit. "All the world," said he, "will
 be eager to pay, as no one cares to pass for a fool."
 
 The minister declared to him, "I exempt you from the tax."
 
 Another proposed to lay the _only_ tax upon songs and laughing, in
 consideration that we were the merriest nation under the sun, and that a
 song was a relief and comfort for every thing. But the minister
 observed, that of late there were hardly any songs of pleasantry made;
 and he was afraid that, to escape the tax, we would become too serious.
 
 The next that presented himself, was a trusty and loyal subject, who
 offered to raise for the king three times as much, by making the nation
 pay three times less. The minister advised him to learn arithmetic.
 
 A fourth proved to the king in the way of _friendship_, that he could
 not raise above seventy-five millions, but that he was going to procure
 him two hundred and twenty-five. "You will oblige me in this," said the
 minister, "as soon as we shall have paid the public debts."
 
 At length, who should appear but a deputy of the new author, who makes
 the legislative power co-proprietor of all our lands, _jure divino_, and
 who was giving the king twelve hundred millions of revenue. I knew the
 man again who had flung me into prison for not having paid my twenty
 crowns, and throwing myself at the feet of the comptroller general, I
 implored his justice; upon which, he burst out a laughing, and telling
 me, it was a trick that had been played me, he ordered the doers of this
 mischief in jest to pay me a hundred crowns damages, and exempted me
 from the land-tax for the rest of my life. I said to him, "God bless
 your honor!"
 
 
 
 
 VI.
 
 THE MAN OF FORTY CROWNS MARRIES, BECOMES A FATHER, AND DESCANTS UPON THE
 MONKS.
 
 
 The Man of Forty Crowns having improved his understanding, and having
 accumulated a moderate fortune, married a very pretty girl, who had an
 hundred crowns a year of her own. As soon as his son was born, he felt
 himself a man of some consequence in the state. He was famous for making
 the best baskets in the world, and his wife was an excellent seamstress.
 She was born in the neighborhood of a rich abbey of a hundred thousand
 livres a year. Her husband asked me one day, why those gentlemen, who
 were so few in number, had swallowed so many of the forty crown lots?
 "Are they more useful to their country than I am?" "No, dear neighbor."
 "Do they, like me, contribute at least to the population of it?" "No."
 "Do they cultivate the land? Do they defend the state when it is
 attacked?" "No, they pray to God for us." "Well, then, I will pray to
 God for us." "Well, then, I will pray to God for them, in return."
 
 QUESTION.--How many of these useful gentry, men and women, may the
 convents in this kingdom contain?
 
 ANSWER.--By the lists of the superintendents, taken toward the end of
 the last century, there were about ninety thousand.
 
 QUESTION.--According to our ancient account, they ought not, at forty
 crowns a head, to possess above ten millions eight hundred thousand
 livres. Pray, how much have they actually?
 
 ANSWER.--They have to the amount of fifty millions, including the
 masses, and alms to the mendicant monks, who really lay a considerable
 tax on the people. A begging friar of a convent in Paris, publicly
 bragged that his wallet was worth fourscore thousand livres a year.
 
 QUESTION.--Let us now consider how much the repartition of fifty
 millions among ninety thousand shaven crowns gives to each? Let us see,
 is it not five hundred and fifty-five livres?
 
 ANSWER.--Yes, and a considerable sum it is in a numerous society, where
 the expenses even diminish by the quantity of consumers; for ten persons
 may live together much cheaper than if each had his separate lodging and
 table.
 
 QUESTION.--So that the ex-Jesuits, to whom there is now assigned a
 pension of four hundred livres, are then really losers by the bargain.
 
 ANSWER.--I do not think so; for they are almost all of them retired
 among their friends, who assist them. Several of them say masses for
 money, which they did not do before; others get to be preceptors; some
 are maintained by female bigots; each has made a shift for himself: and,
 perhaps, at this time, there are few of them, who have tasted of the
 world, and of liberty, that would resume their former chains. The
 monkish life, whatever they may say, is not at all to be envied. It is a
 maxim well known, that the monks are a kind of people who assemble
 without knowing, live without loving, and die without regretting each
 other.
 
 QUESTION.--You think, then, that it would be doing them a great service,
 to strip them of all their monks' habits?
 
 ANSWER.--They would undoubtedly gain much by it, and the state still
 more. It would restore to the country a number of subjects, men and
 women, who have rashly sacrificed their liberty, at an age to which the
 laws do not allow a capacity of disposing of tenpence a year income. It
 would be taking these corpses out of their tombs, and afford a true
 resurrection. Their houses might become hospitals, or be turned into
 places for manufactures. Population would be increased. All the arts
 would be better cultivated. One might at least diminish the number of
 these voluntary victims by fixing the number of novices. The country
 would have subjects more useful, and less unhappy. Such is the opinion
 of all the magistrates, such the unanimous wish of the public, since its
 understanding is enlightened. The example of England, and other states,
 is an evident proof of the necessity of this reformation. What would
 England do at this time, if, instead of forty thousand seamen, it had
 forty thousand monks? The more they are multiplied, the greater need
 there is of a number of industrious subjects. There are undoubtedly
 buried in the cloisters many talents, which are lost to the state. To
 make a kingdom nourish, there should be the fewest priests and the most
 artisans possible. So far ought the ignorance and barbarism of our
 forefathers to be from being any rule for us, that they ought rather to
 be an admonition to us, to do what they would do, if they were in our
 place, with our improvements in knowledge.
 
 QUESTION.--It is not then out of hatred to monks that you wish to
 abolish them, but out of love to your country? I think as you do. I
 would not have my son a monk. And if I thought I was to rear children
 for nothing better than a cloister, I would not wish to become a father.
 
 ANSWER.--Where in fact, is that good father of a family that would not
 groan to see his son and daughter lost to society? This is seeking the
 safety of the soul. It may be so, but a soldier that seeks the safety of
 his body, when his duty is to fight, is punished. We are all soldiers of
 the state; we are in the pay of society; we become deserters when we
 quit it.
 
 Why, then, has monkishness prevailed? Because, since the days of
 Constantine, the government has been everywhere absurd and detestable;
 because the Roman empire came to have more monks than soldiers; because
 there were a hundred thousand of them in Egypt alone; because they were
 exempt from labor and taxes; because the chiefs of those barbarous
 nations which destroyed the empire, having turned Christians, in order
 to govern Christians, exercised the most horrid tyranny; because, to
 avoid the fury of these tyrants, people threw themselves in crowds into
 cloisters, and so, to escape one servitude, put themselves into another;
 because the popes, by instituting so many different orders of sacred
 drones, contrived to have so many subjects to themselves in other
 states; because a peasant likes better to be called reverend father, and
 to give his benedictions, than to follow a plough's tail; because he
 does not know that the plough is nobler than a monk's habit; because he
 had rather live at the expense of fools than by a laborious occupation;
 in short, because he does not know that, in making a monk of himself, he
 is preparing for himself unhappy days, of which the sad groundwork will
 be nothing but a _tedium vitæ_ and repentance.
 
 QUESTION.--I am satisfied. Let us have no monks, for the sake of their
 own happiness, as well as ours. But I am sorry to hear it said by the
 landlord of our village, who is father to four boys and three girls,
 that he does not know how to dispose of his daughters, unless he makes
 nuns of them.
 
 ANSWER.--This too often repeated plea is at once inhuman, detrimental to
 the country, and destructive to society. Every time that it can be said
 of any condition of life whatever, that if all the world were to embrace
 it mankind would perish, it is proved that that condition is a worthless
 one, and that whoever embraces it does all the mischief to mankind that
 in him lies.
 
 Now, it being a clear consequence that if all the youth of both sexes
 were to shut themselves up in cloisters the world would perish, monkery
 is, if it were but in that light alone, the enemy to human nature,
 independently of the horrid evils it has formerly caused.
 
 QUESTION.--Might not as much be said of soldiers?
 
 [Illustration: Entering the convent.--"There is a necessity for houses
 of retreat for old age, for infirmity, for deformity. But by the most
 detestable of all abuses, these foundations are for well-made persons.
 Let a hump-backed woman present herself to enter into a cloister, and
 she will be rejected with contempt, unless she will give an immense
 portion to the house."]
 
 ANSWER. Certainly not; for if every subject carried arms in his turn, as
 formerly was the practice in all republics, and especially in that of
 Rome, the soldier is but the better farmer for it. The soldier, as a
 good subject ought to do, marries, and fights for his wife and children.
 Would it were the will of heaven that every laborer was a soldier and a
 married man! They would make excellent subjects. But a monk, merely in
 his quality of a monk, is good for nothing but to devour the substance
 of his countryman. There is no truth more generally acknowledged.
 
 QUESTION.--But, sir, the daughters of poor gentlemen, who cannot portion
 them off in marriage, what are they to do?
 
 ANSWER.---Do! They should do, as has a thousand times been said, like
 the daughters in England, in Scotland, Ireland, Switzerland, Holland,
 half Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Tartary, Turkey, Africa, and in
 almost all the rest of the globe. They will prove much better wives,
 much better mothers, when it shall have been the custom, as in Germany,
 to marry women without fortune. A woman, industrious and a good
 economist, will do more good in a house, than a daughter of a farmer of
 the revenue, who spends more in superfluities than she will have brought
 of income to her husband.
 
 There is a necessity for houses of retreat for old age, for infirmity,
 for deformity. But by the most detestable of all abuses, these
 foundations are for well-made persons. Let a hump-backed old woman
 present herself to enter into a cloister, and she will be rejected with
 contempt, unless she will give an immense portion to the house. But what
 do I say? Every nun must bring her dower with her; she is else the
 refuse of the convent. Never was there a more intolerable abuse.
 
 QUESTION.--Thank you, sir. I swear to you that no daughter of mine shall
 be a nun. They shall learn to spin, to sew, to make lace, to embroider,
 to render themselves useful. I look on the vows of convents to be crimes
 against one's country and one's self. Now, sir, I beg you will explain
 to me, how comes it that a certain writer, in contradiction to human
 kind, pretends that monks are useful to the population of a state,
 because their buildings are kept in better repair than those of the
 nobility, and their lands better cultivated?
 
 ANSWER.---He has a mind to divert himself; he knows but too well, that
 ten families who have each five thousand livres a year in land, are a
 hundred, nay, a thousand times more useful than a convent that enjoys
 fifty thousand livres a year, and which has always a secret hoard. He
 cries up the fine houses built by the monks, and it is precisely those
 fine houses that provoke the rest of the subjects; it is the very cause
 of complaint to all Europe. The vow of poverty condemns those palaces,
 as the vow of humility protests against pride, and as the vow of
 extinguishing one's race is in opposition to nature.
 
 QUESTION.--Bless me! Who can this be that advances so strange a
 proposition?
 
 ANSWER. It is the _friend of mankind_, [Monsieur le M. de Mirabeau, in
 his book entitled _L'Ami des Hommes_. It is against this marquis that the
 jest on the _only tax_ is leveled; a tax proposed by him], or rather the
 friend of the monks.
 
 QUESTION.--I begin to think it advisable to be very distrustful of
 books.
 
 ANSWER.--The best way is to make use, with regard to them, of the same
 caution, as with men. Choose the most reasonable, examine them, and
 never yield unless to evidence.
 
 
 
 
 VII.
 
 ON TAXES PAID TO A FOREIGN POWER.
 
 
 About a month ago, the Man of Forty Crowns came to me, holding both his
 sides, which seemed ready to burst with laughing. In short, he laughed
 so heartily that I could not help laughing also, without knowing at
 what. So true it is, that man is born an imitative animal, that instinct
 rules us, and that the great emotions of the soul are catching. _Ut
 ridentibus arrident, ita flentibus adflent, Humani vultus._
 
 When he had had his laugh out, he told me that he had just come from
 meeting with a man who called himself the prothonotary of the Holy See,
 and that this personage was sending away a great sum of money to an
 Italian, three hundred leagues off, in the name and behalf of a
 Frenchman, on whom the king had bestowed a small fief or fee; because
 the said Frenchman could never enjoy this benefit of the king's
 conferring, if he did not give to this Italian the first year's income.
 
 "The thing," said I, "is very true; but it is not quite such a laughing
 matter either. It costs France about four hundred thousand livres a
 year, in petty duties of this kind; and in the course of two centuries
 and a half, that this custom has lasted, we have already sent to Italy
 fourscore millions."
 
 "Heavenly Father!" he exclaimed, "how many forty crowns would that make?
 Some Italian, then, subdued us, I suppose, two centuries and a half ago,
 and laid that tribute upon us!"
 
 "In good faith," answered I, "he used to impose on us in former times,
 in a much more burthensome way. That is but a trifle in comparison to
 what, for a long time, he levied on our poor nations of Europe."
 
 Then I related to him how those holy usurpations had taken place, and
 came to be established. He knows a little of history, and does not want
 for sense. He easily conceived that we had been slaves, and that we were
 still dragging a little bit of our chain that we could not get rid of.
 He spoke much and with energy, against this abuse; but with what respect
 for religion in general. With what reverence did he express himself for
 the bishops! How heartily did he wish them many forty crowns a year,
 that they might spend them in their dioceses in good works.
 
 He also wished that all the country vicars might have a number of forty
 crowns, that they might live with decency.
 
 "It is a sad thing," said he, "that a vicar should be obliged to dispute
 with his flock for two or three sheaves of corn, and that he should not
 be amply paid by the country. These eternal contests for imaginary
 rights, for the tithes, destroy the respect that is owing to them. The
 unhappy cultivator who shall have already paid to the collectors his
 tenth penny, and the twopence a livre, and the tax, and the capitation,
 and the purchase of his exemption from lodging soldiers,--after he shall
 have lodged soldiers,--for this unfortunate man, I say, to see the vicar
 take away in addition the tithe of his produce, he can no longer look on
 him as his pastor, but as one that flays him alive,--that tears from
 him the little skin that is left him. He feels but too sensible, that
 while they are, _jure divino_, robbing him of his tenth sheaf, they have
 the diabolical cruelty not to give him credit for all that it will have
 cost him to make that sheaf grow. What then remains to him for himself
 and family? Tears, want, discouragement, despair, and thus he dies of
 fatigue and misery. If the vicar were paid by the country, he would be a
 comfort to his parishioners, instead of being looked on by them as their
 enemy."
 
 The worthy man melted as he uttered these words; he loved his country,
 and the public good was his idol. He would sometimes emphatically say,
 "What a nation would the French be if it pleased!" We went to see his
 son, whom the mother, a very neat and clean woman, was nursing. "Alas!"
 said the father, "here thou art, poor child, and hast nothing to pretend
 to but twenty-three years of life, and forty crowns a year."
 
 
 
 
 VIII.
 
 ON PROPORTIONS.
 
 
 The produce of the extremes is equal to the produce of the means: but
 two sacks of corn stolen, are not, to those who stole them, as the loss
 of their lives is to the interest of the person from whom they were
 stolen.
 
 The prior of ----, from whom two of his domestic servants in the country
 had stolen two measures of corn, has just had the two delinquents
 hanged. This execution has cost him more than all his harvest has been
 worth to him; and since that time he has not been able to get a servant.
 
 If the laws had ordained that such as stole their master's corn should
 work in his grounds, during their lives in fetters, and with a bell at
 their neck fixed to a collar, the prior would have been a considerable
 gainer by it.
 
 "Terror should be preventively employed against crimes;" very true: but
 work, on compulsion, and lasting shame, strike more terror than the
 gallows.
 
 [Illustration: The rack.--"I was summoned to give evidence against a
 miller, who has been put to the torture, ordinary and extraordinary, and
 who has been found innocent. I saw him faint away under redoubled
 tortures. I heard the crash of his bones. His outcries and screams of
 agony are not yet out of my ears; they haunt me. I shed tears for pity,
 and shudder with horror."]
 
 There was, some months ago at London, a malefactor who had been
 condemned to be transported to America to work there at the sugar works
 with the negroes. In England, any criminal, as in many other countries,
 may get a petition presented to the king, either to obtain a free
 pardon, or a mitigation of the sentence. This one presented a petition
 to be hanged, alleging that he mortally hated work, and that he had
 rather suffer strangling for a minute, than to make sugar all his
 lifetime.
 
 Others may think otherwise, every one to his taste. But it has been
 already said, and cannot be too often repeated, that a man hanged is
 good for nothing, and that punishments ought to be useful.
 
 Some years ago, in Turkey, two young men were condemned to be impaled,
 for having, (without taking off their caps,) stood to see the procession
 of the Lama pass by. The Emperor of China, who is a man of very good
 sense, said, that for his part, he should have condemned them to walk
 bareheaded, in every public procession, for three months afterwards.
 
 "Proportion punishments to crimes," says the Marquis Beccaria; but those
 who made the laws were not geometricians.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 I hate the laws of Draco, which punish equally crimes and faults,
 wickedness and folly. Let us,--especially in all litigations,--in all
 dissensions, in all quarrels,--distinguish the aggressor from the party
 offended, the oppressor from the oppressed. An offensive war is the
 procedure of a tyrant; he who defends himself is in the character of a
 just man.
 
 As I was absorbed in these reflections, the Man of Forty Crowns came to
 me all in tears. I asked, with emotion, if his son, who was by right to
 live twenty-three years, was dead?
 
 "No," said he, "the little one is very well, and so is my wife; but I
 was summoned to give evidence against a miller, who has been put to the
 torture, ordinary and extraordinary, and who has been found innocent. I
 saw him faint away under redoubled tortures. I heard the crash of his
 bones. His outcries and screams of agony are not yet out of my ears;
 they haunt me. I shed tears for pity, and shudder with horror."
 
 His tears drew mine. I trembled, too, like him; for I have naturally an
 extreme sensibility.
 
 My memory then represented to me the dreadful fate of the Calas family!
 A virtuous mother in irons,--her children in tears, and forced to fly,
 her house given up to pillage,--a respectable father of a family broken
 with torture, agonizing on a wheel, and expiring in the flames; a son
 loaded with chains, and dragged before the judges, one of whom said to
 him:
 
 _"We have just now broken your father on the wheel; we will break you
 alive too."_
 
 I remembered the family of Sirven, who one of my friends met with among
 the mountains covered with ice, as they were flying from the persecution
 of a judge as ignorant as he was unjust. This judge (he told me) had
 condemned an innocent family to death on a supposition, without the
 least shadow of proof, that the father and mother, assisted by two of
 their daughters, had cut the throat of the third, and drowned her
 besides, for going to mass. I saw in judgments of this kind, at once an
 excess of stupidity, of injustice, and of barbarity.
 
 The Man of Forty Crowns joined with me in pitying human nature. I had in
 my pocket the discourse of an attorney-general of Dauphiny, which turned
 upon very important matters. I read to him the following passages:
 
 "Certainly those must have been truly great men, who, at first, dared to
 take upon themselves the office of governing their fellow creatures, and
 to set their shoulders to the burthen of the public welfare; who, for
 the sake of the good they meant to do to men, exposed themselves to
 their ingratitude, and for the public repose renounced their own; who
 made themselves, as one may say, middle-men between their
 fellow-creatures and Providence, to compose for them, by artifice, a
 happiness which Providence seems otherwise to have refused to them by
 any other means.
 
 "What magistrate, was ever so careless of his responsibilities and
 duties to humanity as to entertain such ideas? Could he, in the solitude
 of his closet, without shuddering with horror and pity, cast his eyes on
 those papers, the unfortunate monuments of gilt or of innocence? Should
 he not think he hears a plaintive voice and groans issue from those
 fatal writings, and press him to decide the destiny of a subject, of a
 husband, of a father, or of a whole family? What judge can be so
 unmerciful (if he is charged with but one single process) as to pass in
 cold blood before the door of a prison? Is it I (must he say to himself)
 who detain in that execrable place my fellow-creature, perhaps my
 countryman, one of humankind, in short? Is it I that confine him every
 day,--that shut those execrable doors upon him? Perhaps despair will
 have seized him. He sends up to heaven my name loaded with his curses;
 and doubtless calls to witness against me that great Judge of the world,
 who observes us, and will judge us both."
 
 "Here a dreadful sight presents itself on a sudden to my eyes: The
 judge, tired with interrogating bywords, has recourse to interrogation
 by tortures. Impatient in his inquiries and researches, and perhaps
 irritated at their inutility, he has brought to him torches, chains,
 levers, and all those instruments invented for producing pain. An
 executioner comes to interpose in the functions of the magistracy, and
 terminates by violence a judicial interrogation.
 
 "Gentle philosophy! Thou who never seekest truth but with attention and
 patience, couldst thou expect, in an age that takes thy name, that such
 instruments would be employed to discover that truth?
 
 "Can it be really true, that our laws approve this inconceivable method,
 and that custom consecrates it?
 
 "Their laws imitate their prejudices; their public punishments are as
 cruel as their private vengeance; and the acts of their reason are
 scarce less unmerciful than those of their passions. What can be the
 cause of this strange contrariety? It is because our prejudices are
 ancient, and our morality new; it is because we are as penetrated with
 our opinions as we are inattentive to our ideas; it is because our
 passion for pleasures hinders us from reflecting on our wants, and that
 we are more eager to live than to direct ourselves right; it is, in a
 word, because our morals are gentle without being good; it is because we
 are polite, and are not so much as humane."
 
 These fragments, which eloquence had dictated to humanity, filled the
 heart of my friend with a sweet consolation. He admired with tenderness.
 
 "What!" said he, "are such masterpieces as these produced in a province?
 I had been told that Paris was all the world, or the only place in it."
 
 "It is," said I, "the only place for producing comic operas; but there
 are at this time, in the provinces, magistrates who think, with the same
 virtue and express themselves with the same force. Formerly, the oracles
 of justice, like those of morality, were nothing but matter of mere
 ridicule. Dr. Balordo declaimed at the bar, and Harlequin in the pulpit.
 Philosophy has at length come, and has said, 'Do not speak in public,
 unless to set forth new and useful truths, with the eloquence of
 sentiment and of reason.'"
 
 But, say the praters, if we have nothing new to say, what then? Why,
 hold your tongues, replies philosophy. All those vain discourses for
 parade, that contain nothing but phrases, are like the fire on the eve
 of St. John's, kindled on that day of the year in which there is the
 least want of it to heat one's self--it causes no pleasure, and not so
 much as the ashes of it remain.
 
 Let all France read good books. But notwithstanding all the progress of
 the human understanding, there are few that read; and among those who
 sometimes seek instruction, the reading for the most part is very ill
 chosen. My neighbors, men and women, pass their time, after dinner, at
 playing an English game, which I have much difficulty to pronounce,
 since they call it whist. Many good citizens, many thick heads, who take
 themselves for good heads, tell you, with an air of importance, that
 books are good for nothing. But, Messieurs, the critics, do not you know
 that you are governed only by books? Do not you know that the statutes,
 the military code, and the gospel, are books on which you continually
 depend? Read; improve yourselves. It is reading alone that invigorates
 the understanding; conversation dissipates it; play contracts it.
 
 Thus it was that the Man of Forty Crowns proceeded to form, as one may
 say, his head and his heart. He not only succeeded to the inheritance of
 his two fair cousins, but he came also to a fortune left by a very
 distant relation, who had been a sub-farmer of the military hospitals,
 where he had fattened himself on the strict abstinence to which he had
 put the wounded soldiers. This man never would marry, he never would own
 any of his relations. He lived in the height of debauchery, and died at
 Paris of a surfeit. He was, as any one may see, a very useful member of
 the state.
 
 Our new philosopher was obliged to go to Paris to get possession of the
 inheritance of this relative. At first, the farmers of the domain
 disputed it with him. He had the good luck, however, to gain his cause,
 and the generosity to give to the poor of his neighborhood, who had not
 their contingent of forty crowns a year, a part of the spoils of the
 deceased son of fortune. After which he set himself about satisfying his
 passion for having a library.
 
 He read every morning and made extracts. In the evening, he consulted
 the learned to know in what language the serpent had talked to our good
 mother; whether the soul is in the callous body, or in the pineal gland;
 whether St. Peter lived five and twenty years at Rome; what specific
 difference there is between a throne and a dominion; and why the negroes
 have a flat nose. He proposed to himself, besides, never to govern the
 state, nor to write any pamphlets against new dramatic pieces. He was
 called Mr. Andrew, which was his Christian name. Those who have known
 him, do justice to his modesty and to his qualities, both natural and
 acquired.
 
 
 
 
 IX.
 
 A GREAT QUARREL.
 
 
 During the stay of Mr. Andrew at Paris, there happened a very important
 quarrel. The point was, to decide whether Marcus Antoninus was an honest
 man, and whether he was in hell, or in purgatory, or in limbo, waiting
 till the day of resurrection. All the men of sense took the part of
 Marcus Antoninus. They said: Antoninus has been always just, temperate,
 chaste, and beneficent. It is true, he has not so good a place in
 paradise as St. Anthony; for proportions ought to be observed, as has
 been before recommended. But certainly the soul of Antoninus is not
 roasting on a spit in hell. If he is in purgatory, he ought to be
 delivered out of it; there need only be masses said for him. Let the
 Jesuits, who have no longer anything to do, say three thousand masses
 for the repose of the soul of Marcus Antoninus. Putting each mass at
 fifteen pence, they will get two thousand two hundred and fifty livres
 by it. Besides, some respect is owing to a crowned head. He should not
 be lightly damned.
 
 The party opposed to these good people pretended, on the contrary, that
 no compounding for salvation ought to be allowed to Marcus Antoninus;
 that he was a heretic; that the Carpocratians and the Alcgi were not so
 bad as he; that he had died without confession; that it was necessary to
 make an example; that it was right to damn him, if but to teach better
 manners to the emperors of China and Japan,--to those of Persia, Turkey,
 and Morocco,--to the kings of England, Sweden, Denmark, and Prussia, to
 the stadtholder of Holland,--to the avoyers of the Canton of Berne, who
 no more go to confession than did the Emperor Marcus Antoninus; that, in
 short, there is an unspeakable pleasure in passing sentence against a
 dead sovereign, which one could not fulminate against him in his
 lifetime, for fear of losing one's ears.
 
 This quarrel became as furious as was formerly that of the Ursulines and
 the Annonciades. In short, it was feared that it would come to a schism,
 as in the time of the hundred and one Mother Goose's tales, and of
 certain bills payable to the bearer in the other world. To be sure, a
 schism is something very terrible. The meaning of the word is a division
 in opinion, and till this fatal moment all men had been agreed to think
 the same thing.
 
 Mr. Andrew, who was an excellent member of society, invited the chiefs
 of the two parties to sup with him. He is one of the best companions
 that we have. His humor is gentle and lively; his gaiety is not noisy;
 he is open, frank, and easy. He has not that sort of wit which seems to
 aim at stifling that of others. The authority which he conciliates to
 himself is due to nothing but his graceful manner, to his moderation,
 and to a round good-natured face, which is quite persuasive. He could
 have brought to sup cheerfully together a Corsican and a Genoese,--a
 representative of Geneva and a negative man, the mufti and an
 archbishop. He managed so dextrously, as to make the first stroke that
 the disputants of both parties aimed at each other fall to the ground,
 by turning off the discourse, and by telling a very diverting tale,
 which pleased equally the damning and the damned. In short, when they
 had got a little good-humored and elevated with wine, he made them sign
 an agreement, that the soul of Marcus Antoninus should remain in _status
 quo_--that is to say, nobody knows where,--till the day of final
 judgment.
 
 The souls of the doctors of divinity returned quietly to their limbos
 after supper, and all was calm. This adjustment of the quarrel did great
 honor to the Man of Forty Crowns; and, since then, whenever any very
 peevish virulent dispute arose among men of letters, or among men not of
 letters, the advice given was, "_Gentlemen, go and sup at Master
 Andrew's!_"
 
 
 
 
 X.
 
 A RASCAL REPULSED.
 
 
 The reputation which Mr. Andrew had acquired for pacifying quarrels,--by
 giving good suppers,--drew upon him last week a singular visit. A dark
 complexioned man, shabbily enough dressed, rather crook-backed, with his
 head leaning toward one shoulder, a haggard eye, and dirty hands, asked
 to be invited to a supper with his enemies.
 
 "Who are your enemies?" said Mr. Andrew, "and who are you?"
 
 "Alas, sir," said he, "I am forced to confess that I am taken for one of
 those wretches that compose libels to get bread, and who are forever
 crying out,--'Religion,--Religion,--Religion,' in order to come at some
 little benefice. I am accused of having caluminated some of the most
 truly religious subjects, the most sincere adorers of divinity, and the
 most honest men of the kingdom. It is true, sir, that in the heat of
 composition, there often fall from the pen of those of my trade, certain
 little inadvertencies or slips, which are taken for gross errors; and
 some liberties taken with the truth, which are termed impudent lies. Our
 zeal is looked upon in the light of a horrid mixture of villainy and
 fanaticism. It has been alleged, that while we are insnaring the easy
 faith of some silly old women, we are the scorn and execration of all
 the men of worth who can read.
 
 "My enemies are the principal members of the most illustrious academies
 of Europe, writers much esteemed, and beneficent members of society. I
 have but just published a book under the title of _Anti-philosophical_.
 I had nothing but the best intentions, and yet no one would buy my book.
 Those to whom I made presents of it, threw it into the fire, telling me
 it was not only anti-reasonable, but anti-christian, and extremely
 anti-decent."
 
 "Well, then!" said Mr. Andrew to him, "follow the example of those to
 whom you presented your libel, throw it into the fire, and let no more
 be said of it. It is unnecessary to ask you to sup with men of wit, who
 can never be your enemies, since they will never read you."
 
 "Could not you, sir, at least," said the hypocrite to him, "reconcile me
 with the relations of the deceased Monsieur de Montesquieu, to whose
 memory I offered an indignity, that I might give honor and glory to the
 reverend father Rout."
 
 "Zounds!" said Mr. Andrew, "the reverend father Rout has been dead this
 long time; go and sup with him."
 
 
 
 
 XI.
 
 THE GOOD SENSE OF MR. ANDREW.
 
 
 But how greatly did the sense of Mr. Andrew improve in vigor from the
 time he procured a library! He lives with books as with men, and is
 careful in his choice of them. What a pleasure it is to gain
 instruction, to enlarge one's mind by studying the best works of the
 greatest authors.
 
 He congratulates himself on being born at a time when human reason is
 tending toward perfection. "How unhappy should I have been," he used to
 say, "if the age I live in had been that in which they used to condemn
 to the galleys those who wrote against the categories of Aristotle."
 
 Distress had weakened the springs of Mr. Andrew's soul; but good fortune
 restored their elasticity. There are many Andrews in the world to whom
 nothing is wanting but a turn of the wheel of fortune to make of them
 men of true merit. He is now well acquainted with all the affairs of
 Europe, and especially with the progress of the human understanding.
 
 He recently remarked to me, that Reason travels by slow journeys from
 north to south, in company with her two intimate friends, Experience and
 Toleration. Agriculture and Commerce attend them. When Reason presented
 herself in Italy, the congregation of the Index sternly repulsed her.
 All she could do, was to secretly send some of her agents, who, in spite
 of her enemies, do some good. Let but some years more pass, and it is to
 be hoped that the country of the Scipios will no longer be that of
 harlequins in monks' habits.
 
 She has sometimes met with cruel foes in France; but she has now so many
 friends in that kingdom, that she stands a good chance of at length
 becoming first minister there.
 
 When she presented herself in Bavaria and Austria, she found two or
 three great wig-blocks that stared at her with stupid and astonished
 eyes. Their greeting was: "Madam, we never heard of you; we do not know
 you." Her answer to which was: "Gentlemen, in time you will come to know
 me, and to love me. I have been well received at Berlin, at Moscow, at
 Copenhagen, at Stockholm. It is long ago that I have been naturalized by
 Act of Parliament in England, through the labors of Locke, Gordon,
 Trenchard, Lord Shaftsbury, and a number of others of the same nation.
 You will, some day or other, confer on me the like grant. I am the
 daughter of Time. I expect every thing from my father."
 
 When she passed over the frontiers of Spain and Portugal, she blessed
 God on observing that the fires of the Inquisition were less frequently
 kindled. She rejoiced on seeing the Jesuits expelled; but was afraid
 that, while the country had been cleared of the foxes, it was still left
 exposed to the ravages of wolves.
 
 If she makes any fresh attempts to gain entrance into Italy it is
 thought she will begin by establishing herself at Venice; and that she
 will take up her abode in the kingdom of Naples, in spite of the
 liquefaction of the saint's blood in that country, which awakens in her
 mind mournful reflections on human credulity. It is pretended, that she
 has an infallible secret for untying the strings of a crown, which are
 entangled, nobody knows how, in those of a mitre.
 
 
 
 
 XII.
 
 The GOOD SUPPER AT MR. ANDREW'S.
 
 
 We supped at Mr. Andrew's yesterday, together with a Doctor Sorbonne,
 with Monsieur Pinto, the celebrated Jew, with the Chaplain of the
 Protestant chapel of the Dutch Embassador, the secretary of the Prince
 Galitzin of the Greek church, a Calvinist Swiss Captain, two
 philosophers, and three Ladies of great wit.
 
 The supper was a very long one; and yet, so polite it must be owned we
 are grown--so much is one afraid at supper to give any cause of offence
 to one's brethren, that there was no more disputing upon religion than
 as if not one of those at table had ever had any. It is not so with the
 Regent Coge, and the ex-Jesuit Patouillet, and with all the animals of
 that kind. Those pitiful creatures will say more stupidly abusive things
 in one pamphlet of two pages, than the best company in Paris can say
 agreeable and instructive ones in a supper of four hours. And what is
 stranger yet, they dare not tell a man to his face, what they have the
 impudence to print.
 
 The conversation turned at first on a piece of pleasantry in the Persian
 Letters, in which it is repeated, after a number of grave personages,
 that the world is not only growing worse, but that it is becoming
 depopulated, so that if the proverb should have any truth in it, that
 "the more fools there are," "the more laughter," laughing is likely to
 be soon banished from the face of the earth.
 
 The Doctor of Sorbonne assured us that, in fact, the world was almost
 reduced to nothing. He quoted the Father Petavius, who demonstrates that
 in less than three hundred years, the descendants of one of the sons of
 Noah (I forget whether it was Shem or Japhet), amounted to six hundred
 and twelve millions three hundred and fifty-eight thousand true
 believers within two hundred and eighty-five years after the universal
 deluge.
 
 Mr. Andrew asked, why in the time of Philip de Bel, that is to say,
 about three hundred years after Hugh Capet, there were not six hundred
 and twenty-three thousand millions of princes of the royal family?
 
 "It is," said the Doctor of Sorbonne, "because the stock of faith has
 greatly decreased."
 
 A great deal was said about Thebes and its hundred gates, and of the
 million of soldiers that issued out of those gates with the twenty
 thousand chariots of war.
 
 "Shut the book there," said Mr. Andrew. "Since I have taken to reading,
 I beg to suspect that the same genius that wrote Garagantua, used of
 yore to write all the histories."
 
 "But, in short," said one of the company, "Thebes, Memphis, Babylon,
 Nineveh, Troy, Seleucia, were great cities once, and now no longer
 exist."
 
 "Granted," answered the secretary of the Prince Galitzin; "but Moscow,
 Constantinople, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Lyons, (which is better than
 ever Troy was,) and all the towns of France, Germany, Spain, and the
 North, were then deserts."
 
 The Swiss captain, a gentleman of great knowledge, owned to us, that
 when his ancestors took it into their heads to quit their mountains and
 their precipices, to go and take forcible possession, as was but
 reasonable, of a finer country, Cæsar, who saw with his own eyes the
 list of those emigrants, found that their number amounted to three
 hundred and sixty-eight thousand, inclusive of the old, the children,
 and the women. At this time, the single canton of Berne possesses as
 many inhabitants, which is not quite the half of Switzerland, and I can
 assure you, that the thirteen cantons have above seven hundred and
 twenty thousand souls, including the natives who are serving or carrying
 on business in other countries. From such data, gentlemen of learning
 make absurd calculations, and they base fallacious systems on no better
 footing.
 
 The question next agitated was, whether the citizens of Rome, in the
 time of the Cæsars, were richer than the citizens of Paris, in the time
 of Monsieur Silhouette?
 
 "Oh," says Mr. Andrew, "this is a point on which I have some call to
 speak. I was a long time the Man of Forty Crowns; but I conceive that
 the citizens of Rome had more. Those illustrious robbers on the highway
 pillaged the finest countries of Asia, of Africa, and of Europe. They
 lived splendidly on the produce of their rapines; but yet there were
 doubtless some beggars at Rome. I am persuaded that, among those
 conquerors of the world, there were some reduced to an income of forty
 Crowns a year, as I formerly was."
 
 "Do you know," said a learned member of the Academy of Inscriptions and
 Belles Lettres, "that it cost Lucullus for every supper he gave in the
 saloon of Apollo, thirty-nine thousand three hundred and twelve livres
 of our money; but that the celebrated epicurean Atticus did not expend
 above two hundred and thirty livres a month for his table."
 
 "If that be true," said I, "he deserved to be president of the
 Miser-society, lately established in Italy. I have read, as you have
 done, in Florus, that incredible anecdote; but, perhaps Florus had never
 supped with Atticus, or else his text, like so many others, has been
 corrupted by copyists. No Florus shall ever make me believe that the
 friend of Cæsar and of Pompey, of Cicero and of Antony, all of whom were
 often entertained at his house, got off for something less than ten
 Louis d'ors a month. _But thus exactly 'tis that history is written._"
 
 Madam Andrew, for her part, told the learned member of the Academy, that
 if he would keep her table for ten times as much, she would be greatly
 obliged to him.
 
 I am persuaded, that this evening at Mr. Andrew's cost him as much as
 the monthly expense of Atticus. As for the ladies, they expressed a
 doubt whether the suppers of Rome were more agreeable than those of
 Paris. The conversation was very gay, though leaning a little to the
 learned. There was no talk of new fashions, nor of the ridiculous part
 of any one's character or conduct, nor of the scandalous history of the
 day.
 
 The question upon luxury was discussed and searched to the bottom. It
 was mooted whether or not luxury had been the ruin of the Roman empire;
 and it was proved that the two empires of the east and west owed their
 destruction to nothing but to religious controversies, and to the monks;
 and, in fact, when Alaric took Rome, its whole attention was engrossed
 by theological disputes; when Mahomet took Constantinople, the monks
 defended much better the eternity of the light of Mount Thabor, which
 they saw on their navel,[1] than they defended the town against the
 Turks.
 
 One of our men of learning made a very significant remark. It was that
 those two great empires were annihilated, but that the works of Virgil,
 Horace, and Ovid still exist.
 
 From the age of Augustus, they made but one skip to the age of Louis the
 XIVth. A lady put the question, why it was that with a great deal of wit
 there was no longer produced scarcely any work of genius?
 
 Mr. Andrew answered, that it was because such works had been produced in
 the last age. This idea was fine spun, and yet solidly true. It bore a
 thorough handling. After that, they fell with some harshness upon a
 Scotchman, who had taken it into his head to give rules to taste, and to
 criticise the most admirable passages of Racine, without understanding
 French. But there was one Denina still more severely treated. He had
 abused Montesquieu's _Spirit of Laws_, without comprehending him, and
 had especially censured what is the most liked and approved in that
 work.
 
 This recalled to my mind Boileau's making a parade of his affected
 contempt of Tasso. One of the company advanced that Tasso, with all his
 faults, was as superior to Homer, as Montesquieu, with his still greater
 imperfections, was above the farrago of Grotius. But there was presently
 a strong opposition made to these false criticisms, dictated by national
 hatred and prejudice. The Seignior Denina was treated as he deserved,
 and as pedants ought to be by men of wit.
 
 It was especially remarked, with much sagacity, that the greatest part
 of the literary works of this age, as well as of the conversations,
 turned on the examination of the masterpieces of the last century; in
 which we are like disinherited children, who are taking an estimate of
 their father's estate. It was confessed that philosophy had made great
 progress, but that the language and style was somewhat corrupted.
 
 It is the nature of all these conversations, to make transitions from
 one subject to another. All these objects of curiosity, of science, and
 of taste, soon vanished, to give way to the great scene which the
 Empress of Russia, and the King of Poland, were giving to the world.
 They had been just raising up and restoring the rights of oppressed
 humanity, and establishing liberty of conscience in a part of the globe
 of a much greater extent than the old Roman Empire. This service done
 to human kind, this example given to so many courts, was mentioned with
 the applause it deserved. Healths were drank to the philosophical
 empress, to the royal philosopher, and to the philosophical primate,
 with the wish of their having many imitators. Even the doctors of
 Sorbonne admired them; for there are some persons of good sense in that
 body, as there were formerly some men of wit among the Bœotians.
 
 The Russian secretary astonished us with a recital of the great
 establishments they were forming in Russia. It was asked, why people
 were in general more fond of reading the history of Charles the XIIth,
 who passed his life in destroying, than that of Peter the Great, who
 consumed his in creating? On this we concluded, that weakness and a
 frivolous turn of mind are the causes of this preference; that Charles
 the XIIth was the Don Quixote, and Peter the Solon of the North; that
 superficial understandings prefer a wild extravagant heroism, to the
 great views of a legislator: that the particulars of the foundation of a
 town are less pleasing to them, than the rashness of a man, who, at the
 head of only his domestics, braves an army of ten thousand Turks; and
 that, in short, most readers love amusement better than instruction.
 Thence it is, that a hundred women read _The Thousand and One Arabian
 Nights_, for one that reads two chapters of Locke.
 
 What was not talked of at this supper? of which I shall long retain the
 remembrance. It was also in course to say a word of the actors and
 actresses, that eternal subject of the table-talk of Versailles and of
 Paris. It was agreed, that a good declaimer was as rare as a good poet.
 For my part, I must own that Plato's banquet could not have given me
 more pleasure than that of Monsieur and Madame Andrew.
 
 Our very pretty gentlemen, and our very fine ladies, would, doubtless,
 have found it dull, and been tired with it. They pretend to be the only
 good company: but neither Mr. Andrew nor I ever willingly sup with that
 kind of good company.

 THE HURON; OR, PUPIL OF NATURE.[1]
 
 
 
 
 I.
 
 THE HURON ARRIVES IN FRANCE.
 
 
 One day, Saint Dunstan, an Irishman by nation, and a saint by trade,
 left Ireland on a small mountain, which took its route toward the coast
 of France, and set his saintship down in the bay of St. Malo. When he
 had dismounted, he gave his blessing to the mountain, which, after some
 profound bows, took its leave, and returned to its former place.
 
 Here St. Dunstan laid the foundation of a small priory, and gave it the
 name of the Priory Mountain, which it still keeps, as every body knows.
 
 In the year 1689, the fifteenth day of July, in the evening, the abbot
 Kerkabon, prior of our Lady of the Mountain, happened to take the air
 along the shore with Miss Kerkabon, his sister. The prior, who was
 becoming aged, was a very good clergyman, beloved by his neighbors. What
 added most to the respect that was paid him, was, that among all his
 clerical neighbors, he was the only one that could walk to his bed after
 supper. He was tolerably read in theology; and when he was tired of
 reading St. Augustin, he refreshed himself with Rabelais. All the world
 spoke well of him.
 
 Miss Kerkabon, who had never been married, notwithstanding her hearty
 wishes so to be, had preserved a freshness of complexion in her
 forty-fifth year. Her character was that of a good and sensible woman.
 She was fond of pleasure, and was a devotee.
 
 As they were walking, the prior, looking on the sea, said to his sister:
 
 "It was here, alas! that our poor brother embarked with our dear
 sister-in-law, Madam Kerkabon, his wife, on board the frigate 'Swallow,'
 in 1669, to serve the king in Canada. Had he not been killed, probably
 he would have written to us."
 
 "Do you believe," says Miss Kerkabon, "that our sister-in-law has been
 eaten by the Cherokees, as we have been told?"
 
 "Certain it is, had she not been killed, she would have come back. I
 shall weep for her all my lifetime. She was a charming woman; and our
 brother, who had a great deal of wit, would no doubt have made a
 fortune."
 
 Thus were they going on with mutual tenderness, when they beheld a small
 vessel enter the bay of Rence with the tide. It was from England, and
 came to sell provisions. The crew leaped on shore without looking at the
 prior or Miss, his sister, who were shocked at the little attention
 shown them.
 
 That was not the behavior of a well-made youth, who, darting himself
 over the heads of his companions, stood on a sudden before Miss
 Kerkabon. Being unaccustomed to bowing, he made her a sign with his
 head. His figure and his dress attracted the notice of brother and
 sister. His head was uncovered, and his legs bare. Instead of shoes, he
 wore a kind of sandals. From his head his long hair flowed in tresses, A
 small close doublet displayed the beauty of his shape. He had a sweet
 and martial air.[2] In one hand he held a small bottle of Barbadoes
 water, and in the other a bag, in which he had a goblet, and some sea
 biscuit. He spoke French very intelligibly. He offered some of his
 Barbadoes to Miss Kerkabon and her brother. He drank with them, he made
 them drink a second time, and all this with an air of such native
 simplicity, that quite charmed brother and sister. They offered him
 their service, and asked him who he was, and whither going? The young
 man answered: That he knew not where he should go; that he had some
 curiosity; that he had a desire to see the coast of France; that he had
 seen it, and should return.
 
 The prior, judging by his accent that he was not an Englishman, took the
 liberty of asking of what country he was.
 
 "I am a Huron," answered the youth.
 
 Miss Kerkabon, amazed and enchanted to see a Huron who had behaved so
 politely to her, begged the young man's company to supper. He complied
 immediately, and all three went together to the priory of our Lady of
 the Mountain. This short and round Miss devoured him with her little
 eyes, and said from time to time to her brother:
 
 "This tall lad has a complexion of lilies and roses. What a fine skin he
 has for a Huron!"
 
 "Very true, sister," says the prior.
 
 She put a hundred questions, one after another, and the traveler
 answered always pertinently.
 
 The report was soon spread that there was a Huron at the priory. All the
 genteel company of the country came to supper. The abbot of St. Yves
 came with Miss, his sister, a fine, handsome, well-educated girl. The
 bailiff, the tax-gatherer, and their wives, came all together. The
 foreigner was seated between Miss Kerkabon and Miss St. Yves. The
 company eyed him with admiration. They all questioned him together.
 This did not confound the Huron. He seemed to have taken Lord
 Bolingbroke's motto, _Nil admirari_. But at last, tired out with so much
 noise, he told them in a sweet, but serious tone:
 
 "Gentlemen, in my country one talks after another. How can I answer you,
 if you will not allow me to hear you?"
 
 Reasoning always brings people to a momentary reflection. They were all
 silent.
 
 Mr. Bailiff, who always made a property of a foreigner wherever he found
 him, and who was the first man for asking questions in the province,
 opening a mouth of large size, began:
 
 "Sir, what is your name?"
 
 "I have always been called the _Ingenu_," answered the Huron; "and the
 English have confirmed that name, because I always speak as I think, and
 act as I like."
 
 "But, being born a Huron, how could you come to England?"
 
 "I have been carried thither. I was made prisoner by the English after
 some resistance, and the English, who love brave people, because they
 are as brave and honest as we, proposed to me, either to return to my
 family, or go with them to England. I accepted the latter, having
 naturally a relish for traveling."
 
 "But, sir," says the bailiff, with his usual gravity, "how could you
 think of abandoning father and mother?"
 
 "Because I never knew either father or mother," says the foreigner.
 
 This moved the company; they all repeated:
 
 "Neither father nor mother!"
 
 "We will be in their stead," says the mistress of the house, to her
 brother, the prior: "How interesting this Huron gentleman is!"
 
 The _Ingenu_ thanked her with a noble and proud cordiality, and gave her
 to understand, that he wanted the assistance of nobody.
 
 "I perceive, Mr. Huron," said the huge bailiff, "that you talk better
 French than can be expected from an Indian."
 
 "A Frenchman," answered he, "whom they had made prisoner when I was a
 boy, and with whom I contracted a great friendship, taught it me. I
 rapidly learn what I like to learn. When I came to Plymouth, I met with
 one of your French refugees, whom you, I know not why, call Huguenots.
 He improved my knowledge of your language; and as soon as I could
 express myself intelligibly, I came to see your country, because I like
 the French well enough, if they do not put too many questions."
 
 Notwithstanding this candid remark, the abbé of St. Yves asked him,
 which of the three languages pleased him best, the Huron, English, or
 French?
 
 "The Huron, to be sure," answered the _Ingenu_.
 
 "Is it possible?" cried Miss Kerkabon. "I always thought the French was
 the first of all languages, after that of Low Britany."
 
 Then all were eager to know how, in Huron, they asked for snuff? He
 replied:
 
 "_Taya_."
 
 "What signifies to eat?"
 
 "_Essenten_."
 
 Miss Kerkabon was impatient to know how they called, to make love?
 
 He informed her, _Trovander_; and insisted on it, not without reason,
 that these words were well worth their synonyms in French and English.
 _Trovander_, especially, seemed very pretty to all the company. The
 prior, who had in his library a Huron grammar, which had been given him
 by the Rev. Father Sagar Theodat, a Recollet and famous missionary, rose
 from the table to consult it. He returned quite panting with tenderness
 and joy. He acknowledged the foreigner for a true Huron. The company
 speculated a little on the multiplicity of languages; and all agreed,
 that had it not been for the unfortunate affair of the Tower of Babel,
 all the world would have spoken French.
 
 The inquisitive bailiff, who till then had some suspicions of the
 foreigner, conceived the deepest respect for him. He spoke to him with
 more civility than before, and the Huron took no notice of it.
 
 Miss St. Yves was very curious to know how people made love among the
 Hurons.
 
 "In performing great actions to please such as resemble you." All the
 company admired and applauded. Miss St. Yves blushed, and was extremely
 well pleased. Miss Kerkabon blushed likewise, but was not so well
 pleased. She was a little piqued that this gallantry was not addressed
 to her; but she was so good-natured, that her affection for the Huron
 was not diminished at all. She asked him, with great complacency, how
 many mistresses he had at home.
 
 "Only one," answered the foreigner; "Miss Abacaba, the good friend of my
 dear nurse. The reed is not straighter, nor is ermine whiter,--no lamb
 meeker, no eagle fiercer, nor a stag swifter, than was my Abacaba. One
 day she pursued a hare not above fifty leagues from my habitation: a
 base Algonquin, who dwells an hundred leagues further, took her hare
 from her. I was told of it; I ran thither, and with one stroke of my
 club leveled him with the ground. I brought him to the feet of my
 mistress, bound hand and foot. Abacaba's parents were for burning him,
 but I always had a disrelish for such scenes. I set him at liberty. I
 made him my friend. Abacaba was so pleased with my conduct, that she
 preferred me to all her lovers. And she would have continued to love me,
 had she not been devoured by a bear! I slew the bear, and wore his skin
 a long while; but that has not comforted me."
 
 Miss St. Yves felt a secret pleasure at hearing that Abacaba had been
 his only mistress, and that she was no more; yet she understood not the
 cause of her own pleasure. All eyes were riveted on the Huron, and he
 was much applauded for delivering an Algonquin from the cruelty of his
 countrymen.
 
 The merciless bailiff had now grown so furious, that he even asked the
 Huron what religion he was of; whether he had chosen the English, the
 French, or that of the Huguenots?
 
 "I am of my own religion," said he, "just as you are of yours."
 
 "Lord!" cried Miss Kerkabon, "I see already that those wretched English
 have not once thought of baptizing him!"
 
 "Good heavens," said Miss St. Yves, "how is it possible? How is it
 possible the Hurons should not be Roman Catholics? Have not those
 reverend fathers, the Jesuits, converted all the world?"
 
 The Huron assured her, that no true American had ever changed his
 opinion, and that there was not in their language a word to express
 inconstancy.
 
 These last words extremely pleased Miss St. Yves.
 
 "Oh! we'll baptize him, we'll baptize him," said Miss Kerkabon to the
 prior. "You shall have that honor, my dear brother, and I will be his
 god-mother. The Abbot St. Yves shall present him to the font. It will
 make a fine appearance: it will be talked of all over Britany, and do us
 the greatest honor."
 
 The company were all of the same mind with the mistress of the house;
 they all cried:
 
 "We'll baptize him."
 
 The Huron interrupted them by saying, that in England every one was
 allowed to live as he pleased. He rather showed some aversion to the
 proposal which was made, and could not help telling them, that the laws
 of the Hurons were to the full as good as those of Low Britany. He
 finished with saying, that he should return the next day. The bottles
 grew empty, and the company went to bed.
 
 After the Huron had been conducted to his room, they saw that he spread
 the blankets on the floor, and laid himself down upon them in the finest
 attitude in the world.
 
 
 [1] _Le Huron_ was dramatized, under the name of _Civilization_, by Mr.
 John H. Wilkins, and successfully produced at the City of London
 Theatre, on Wednesday, November 10, 1852. Mr. James Anderson enacted the
 part of _Hercule, the Huron_, and added to his well-earned reputation by
 his correct conception and representation of the Indian character.
 
 Mr. James Wallack, Jr., afterward introduced the play to a New York
 audience at Burton's old Chambers Street Theatre, where it was also
 received with great favor. Unfortunately for dramatic literature, the
 promising young author of _Civilisation_ did not long survive his
 success, but soon filled an early grave.--E.
 
 [2] In Mr. Wilkins's dramatic version of this romance, the Huron is
 described as
 
      "A modell'd Hercules! Mien, stature, glance,
       That are the blazons of the inner man,
       And voice it to the stars! A hero born,
       Whose air commands respect above a king's;
       Bearing the stamp from the great mint of heaven,
       And current to the world!"--E.
 
 
 
 
 
 II.
 
 THE HURON, CALLED THE INGENU, ACKNOWLEDGED BY HIS RELATIONS.
 
 
 The _Ingenu_, according to custom, awoke with the sun, at the crowing of
 the cock, which is called in England and Huronia, "the trumpet of the
 day." He did not imitate what is styled good company, who languish in
 the bed of indolence till the sun has performed half its daily journey,
 unable to sleep, but not disposed to rise, and lose so many precious
 hours in that doubtful state between life and death, and who
 nevertheless complain that life is too short.
 
 He had already traversed two or three leagues, and killed fifteen brace
 of game with his rifle, when, upon his return, he found the prior of the
 Lady of the Mountain, with his discreet sister, walking in their
 nightcaps in their little garden. He presented them with the spoils of
 his morning labor, and taking from his bosom a kind of little talisman,
 which he constantly wore about his neck, he entreated them to accept of
 it as an acknowledgment for the kind reception they had given him.
 
 "It is," said he, "the most valuable thing I am possessed of. I have
 been assured that I shall always be happy whilst I carry this little toy
 about me; and I give it you that you may be always happy."
 
 The prior and Miss smiled with pity at the frankness of the _Ingenu_.
 This present consisted of two little portraits, poorly executed, and
 tied together with a greasy string.
 
 Miss Kerkabon asked him, if there were any painters in Huronia?
 
 "No," replied the _Ingenu_, "I had this curiosity from my nurse. Her
 husband had obtained it by conquest, in stripping some of the French of
 Canada, who had made war upon us. This is all I know of the matter."
 
 The prior looked attentively upon these pictures, whilst he changed
 color; his hands trembled, and he seemed much affected.
 
 "By our Lady of the Mountain," he cried out, "I believe these to be the
 faces of my brother, the captain, and his lady."
 
 Miss, after having consulted them with the like emotion, thought the
 same. They were both struck with astonishment and joy blended with
 grief. They both melted, they both wept, their hearts throbbed, and
 during their disorder, the pictures were interchanged between them at
 least twenty times in a second. They seemed to devour the Huron's
 pictures with their eyes. They asked one after another, and even both at
 once, at what time, in what place, and how these miniatures fell into
 the hands of the nurse? They reckoned and computed the time from the
 captain's departure; they recollected having received notice that he had
 penetrated as far as the country of the Hurons; and from that time they
 had never heard anything more of him.
 
 The Huron had told them, that he had never known either father or
 mother. The prior, who was a man of sense, observed that he had a little
 beard, and he knew very well that the Hurons never had any. His chin was
 somewhat hairy; he was therefore the son of an European. My brother
 and sister-in-law were never seen after the expedition against the
 Hurons, in 1669. My nephew must then have been nursing at the breast.
 The Huron nurse has preserved his life, and been a mother to him. At
 length, after an hundred questions and answers, the prior and his sister
 concluded that the Huron was their own nephew. They embraced him, whilst
 tears streamed from their eyes: and the Huron laughed to think that an
 Indian should be nephew to a prior of Lower Britany.
 
 [Illustration: The Huron identified.--"By our Lady of the Mountain," he
 cried out, "I believe these to be the faces of my brother, the captain,
 and his lady."]
 
 All the company went down stairs. Mr. de St. Yves, who was a great
 physiognomist, compared the two pictures with the Huron's countenance.
 They observed, very skillfully, that he had the mother's eyes, the
 forehead and nose of the late Captain Kerkabon, and the cheeks common to
 both.
 
 Miss St. Yves, who had never seen either father or mother, was
 strenuously of opinion, that the young man had a perfect resemblance of
 them. They all admired Providence, and wondered at the strange events of
 this world. In a word, they were so persuaded, so convinced of the birth
 of the Huron, that he himself consented to be the prior's nephew,
 saying, that he would as soon have him for his uncle as another.
 
 The prior went to return thanks in the church of our Lady of the
 Mountain; whilst the Huron, with an air of indifference, amused himself
 with drinking in the house.
 
 The English who had brought him over, and who were ready to set sail,
 came to tell him that it was time to depart.
 
 "Probably," said he to them, "you have not met with any of your uncles
 and aunts. I shall stay here. Go you back to Plymouth. I give you all my
 clothes, as I have no longer occasion for anything in this world, since
 I am the nephew of a prior."
 
 The English set sail, without being at all concerned whether the Huron
 had any relations or not in Lower Britany.
 
 After the uncle, the aunt, and the company had sung _Te Deum_; after the
 bailiff had once more overwhelmed the Huron with questions, after they
 had exhausted all their astonishment, joy, and tenderness, the prior of
 the Mountain and the Abbé of St. Yves concluded that the Huron should be
 baptized with all possible expedition. But the case was very different
 with a tall robust Indian of twenty-two, and an infant who is
 regenerated without his knowing anything of the matter. It was necessary
 to instruct him, and this appeared difficult; for the Abbé of St. Yves
 supposed that a man who was not born in France, could not be endowed
 with common sense.
 
 The prior, indeed, observed to the company, that though, in fact, the
 ingenious gentleman, his nephew, was not so fortunate as to be born in
 Lower Britany, he was not, upon that account, any way deficient in
 sense; which might be concluded from all his answers; and that,
 doubtless, nature had greatly favored him, as well on his father's as on
 his mother's side?
 
 He then was asked if he had ever read any books? He said, he had read
 Rabelais translated into English, and some passages in Shakespeare,
 which he knew by heart; that these books belonged to the captain, on
 board of whose ship he came from America to Plymouth; and that he was
 very well pleased with them. The bailiff failed not to put many
 questions to him concerning these books.
 
 "I acknowledge," said the Huron, "I thought, in reading them, I
 understood some things, but not the whole."
 
 The Abbé of St. Yves reflected upon this discourse, that it was in this
 manner he had always read, and that most men read no other way.
 
 "You have," said he, to the Huron, "doubtless read the bible?"
 
 "Never, Mr. Abbé: it was not among the captain's books. I never heard it
 mentioned."
 
 "This is the way with those cursed English," said Miss Kerkabon; "they
 think more of a play of Shakespeare's, a plum pudding, or a bottle of
 rum, than they do of the Pentateuch. For this reason they have never
 converted any Indians in America. They are certainly cursed by God; and
 we shall conquer Jamaica and Virginia from them in a very short time."
 
 Be this as it may, the most skillful tailor in all St. Malo was sent for
 to dress the Huron from head to foot. The company separated, and the
 bailiff went elsewhere to display his inquisitiveness. Miss St. Yves, in
 parting, returned several times to observe the young stranger, and made
 him lower courtesies than ever she did any one in her life.
 
 The bailiff, before he took his leave, presented to Miss St. Yves a
 stupid dolt of a son, just come from college; but she scarce looked at
 him, so much was she taken up with the politeness of the Huron.
 
 
 
 
 III.
 
 THE HURON CONVERTED.
 
 
 The prior finding that he was somewhat advanced in years, and that God
 had sent him a nephew for his consolation, took it into his head that he
 would resign his benefice in his favor, if he succeeded in baptizing him
 and of making him enter into orders.
 
 The Huron had an excellent memory. A good constitution, inherited from
 his ancestors of Lower Britany, strengthened by the climate of Canada,
 had made his head so vigorous that when he was struck upon it he scarce
 felt it; and when any thing was graven in it, nothing could efface it.
 Nothing had ever escaped his memory. His conception was the more sure
 and lively, because his infancy had not been loaded with useless
 fooleries, which overwhelm ours. Things entered into his head without
 being clouded. The prior at length resolved to make him read the New
 Testament. The Huron devoured it with great pleasure; but not knowing at
 what time, or in what country all the adventures related in this book
 had happened, he did not in the least doubt that the scene of action had
 been in Lower Britany; and he swore, that he would cut off Caiphas and
 Pontius Pilate's ears, if ever he met those scoundrels.
 
 His uncle, charmed with this good disposition, soon brought him to the
 point. He applauded his zeal, but at the same time acquainted him that
 it was needless, as these people had been dead upwards of 1690 years.
 The Huron soon got the whole book by heart. He sometimes proposed
 difficulties that greatly embarrassed the prior. He was often obliged to
 consult the Abbé St. Yves, who, not knowing what to answer, brought a
 Jesuit of Lower Britany to perfect the conversion of the Huron.
 
 Grace, at length, operated; and the Huron promised to become a
 Christian. He did not doubt but that the first step toward it was
 circumcision.
 
 "For," said he, "I do not find in the book that was put into my hands a
 single person who was not circumcised. It is therefore evident, that I
 must make a sacrifice to the Hebrew custom, and the sooner the better."
 
 He sent for the surgeon of the village, and desired him to perform the
 operation. The surgeon, who had never performed such an operation,
 acquainted the family, who screamed out. The good Miss Kerkabon trembled
 lest her nephew, whom she knew to be resolute and expeditious, should
 perform the operation unskillfully himself; and that fatal consequences
 might ensue.
 
 The prior rectified the Huron's mistake, representing to him, that
 circumcision was no longer in fashion; that baptism was much more gentle
 and salutary; that the law of grace was not like the law of rigor. The
 Huron, who had much good sense, and was well disposed, disputed, but
 soon acknowledged his error, which seldom happens in Europe among
 disputants. In a word, he promised to let himself be baptized whenever
 they pleased.
 
 But before baptism it was necessary that he should go to confession, and
 this was the greatest difficulty to surmount. The Huron had still in his
 pocket the book his uncle gave him. He did not there find that a single
 apostle had ever been confessed, and this made him very restive. The
 prior silenced him, by showing him, in the epistle of St. James the
 Minor, these words: "Confess your sins to one another." The Huron was
 mute, and confessed his sins to a Recollet. When he had done, he dragged
 the Recollet from the confessional chair, and seizing him with a
 vigorous arm, placed himself in his seat, making the Recollet kneel
 before him:
 
 "Come, my friend, it is said, 'we must confess our sins to one another;'
 I have related to you my sins, and you shall not stir till you recount
 yours."
 
 Whilst he said this, he fixed his great knee against his adversary's
 stomach. The Recollet roared and groaned, till he made the church
 re-echo. The noise brought people to his assistance, who found the
 catechumen cuffing the monk in the name of St. James the Minor. The joy
 diffused at the baptizing at once a Low-Breton, a Huron, and an
 Englishman, surmounted all these singularities. There were even some
 theologians of opinion that confession was not necessary, as baptism
 supplied the place of every thing.
 
 The Bishop of St. Malo was chosen for the ceremony, who flattered, as
 may be believed, at baptizing a Huron, arrived in a pompous equipage,
 followed by his clergy. Miss St. Yves put on her best gown to bless God,
 and sent for a hair dresser from St. Malo's, to shine at the ceremony.
 The inquisitive bailiff brought the whole country with him. The church
 was magnificently ornamented. But when the Huron was summoned to attend
 the baptismal font, he was not to be found.
 
 His uncle and aunt sought for him every where. It was imagined that he
 had gone a hunting, according to his usual custom. Every one present at
 the festival, searched the neighboring woods and villages; but no
 intelligence could be obtained of the Huron. They began to fear he had
 returned to England. Some remembered that he had said he was very fond
 of that country. The prior and his sister were persuaded that nobody was
 baptized there, and were troubled for their nephew's soul. The bishop
 was confounded, and ready to return home. The prior and the Abbé St.
 Yves were in despair. The bailiff interrogated all passengers with his
 usual gravity. Miss Kerkabon melted into tears. Miss St. Yves did not
 weep, but she vented such deep sighs, as seemed to testify her
 sacramental disposition. They were walking in this melancholy mood,
 among the willows and reeds upon the banks of the little river Rence,
 when they perceived, in the middle of the stream, a large figure,
 tolerably white, with its two arms across its breast. They screamed out,
 and ran away. But, curiosity being stronger than any other
 consideration, they advanced softly amongst the reeds; and when they
 were pretty certain they could not be seen, they were willing to descry
 what it was.
 
 
 
 
 IV.
 
 THE HURON BAPTIZED.
 
 
 The prior and the abbé having run to the river side, they asked the
 Huron what he was doing?
 
 "In faith," said he, "gentlemen, I am waiting to be baptized. I have
 been an hour in the water, up to my neck, and I do not think it is civil
 to let me be quite exhausted."
 
 "My dear nephew," said the prior to him, tenderly, "this is not the way
 of being baptized in Lower Britany. Put on your clothes, and come with
 us."
 
 Miss St. Yves, listening to the discourse, said in a whisper to her
 companion:
 
 "Miss, do you think he will put his clothes on in such a hurry?"
 
 The Huron, however, replied to the prior:
 
 "You will not make me believe now as you did before. I have studied very
 well since, and I am very certain there is no other kind of baptism. The
 eunuch of Queen Candace was baptized in a rivulet. I defy you to show
 me, in the book you gave me, that people were ever baptized in any other
 way. I either will not be baptized at all, or the ceremony shall be
 performed in the river."
 
 It was in vain to remonstrate to him that customs were altered. He
 always recurred to the eunuch of Queen Candace. And though Miss and his
 aunt, who had observed him through the willows, were authorized to tell
 him, that he had no right to quote such a man, they, nevertheless, said
 nothing;--so great was their discretion. The bishop came himself to
 speak to him, which was a great thing; but he could not prevail. The
 Huron disputed with the bishop.
 
 "Show me," said he, "in the book my uncle gave me, one single man that
 was not baptized in a river, and I will do whatever you please."
 
 His aunt, in despair, had observed, that the first time her nephew
 bowed, he made a much lower bow to Miss St. Yves, than to any one in the
 company--that he had not even saluted the bishop with so much respect,
 blended with cordiality, as he did that agreeable young lady. She
 thought it advisable to apply to her in this great embarrassment. She
 earnestly entreated her to use her influence to engage the Huron to be
 baptized according to the custom of Britany, thinking that her nephew
 could never be a Christian if he persisted in being christened in the
 stream.
 
 [Illustration: The Huron baptized.--"I have been an hour in the water,
 up to my neck, and I do not think it is civil to let me be quite
 exhausted."]
 
 Miss St. Yves blushed at the secret joy she felt in being appointed to
 execute so important a commission. She modestly approached the Huron,
 and squeezing his hand in quite a noble manner, she said to him.
 
 "What, will you do nothing to please me?"
 
 And in uttering these words, she raised her eyes from a downcast look,
 into a graceful tenderness.
 
 "Oh! yes, Miss, every thing you require, all that you command, whether
 it is to be baptized in water, fire, or blood;--there is nothing I can
 refuse you."
 
 Miss St. Yves had the glory of effecting, in two words, what neither the
 importunities of the prior, the repeated interrogations of the bailiff,
 nor the reasoning of the bishop, could effect. She was sensible of her
 triumph; but she was not yet sensible of its utmost latitude.
 
 Baptism was administered, and received with all the decency,
 magnificence, and propriety possible. His uncle and aunt yielded to the
 Abbé St. Yves and his sister the favor of supporting the Huron upon the
 font. Miss St. Yves's eyes sparkled with joy at being a god-mother. She
 was ignorant how much this high title compromised her. She accepted the
 honor, without being acquainted with its fatal consequences.
 
 As there never was any ceremony that was not followed by a good dinner,
 the company took their seats at table after the christening. The
 humorists of Lower Britany said, "they did not choose to have their wine
 baptized." The prior said, "that wine, according to Solomon, cherished
 the heart of man." The bishop added, "that the Patriarch Judah ought to
 have tied his ass-colt to the vine, and steeped his cloak in the blood
 of the grape; and that he was sorry the same could not be done in Lower
 Britany, to which God had not allotted vines." Every one endeavored to
 say a good thing upon the Huron's christening, and strokes of gallantry
 to the god-mother. The bailiff, ever interrogating, asked the Huron, "if
 he was faithful in keeping his promises?"
 
 "How," said he, "can I fail keeping them, since I have deposited them in
 the hands of Miss St. Yves?"
 
 The Huron grew warm; he had drank repeatedly his god-mother's health.
 
 "If," said he, "I had been baptized with your hand, I feel that the
 water which was poured on the nape of my neck would have burnt me."
 
 The bailiff thought that this was too poetical, being ignorant that
 allegory is a familiar figure in Canada. But his god-mother was very
 well pleased.
 
 The Huron had, at his baptism, received the name of Hercules. The bishop
 of St. Malo frequently enquired, who was this tutelar saint, whom he had
 never heard mentioned before? The Jesuit, who was very learned, told
 him, "that he was a saint who had wrought twelve miracles." There was a
 thirteenth, which was well worth the other twelve, but it was not proper
 for a Jesuit to mention it. This was the marriage of fifty girls at one
 time--the daughters of king Thespius. A wag, who was present, related
 this miracle very feelingly. And all judged, from the appearance of the
 Huron, that he was a worthy representative of the saint whose name he
 bore.
 
 
 
 
 V.
 
 THE HURON IN LOVE.
 
 
 It must be acknowledged, that from the time of this christening and this
 dinner, Miss St. Yves passionately wished that the bishop would again
 make her an assistant with Mr. Hercules in some other fine
 ceremony--that is, the marriage ceremony. However, as she was well
 brought up, and very modest,--she did not entirely agree with herself in
 regard to these tender sentiments; but if a look, a word, a gesture, a
 thought, escaped from her, she concealed it admirably under the veil of
 modesty. She was tender, lively, and sagacious.
 
 As soon as the bishop was gone, the Huron and Miss St. Yves met
 together, without thinking they were in search of one another. They
 spoke together, without premeditating what they said. The sincere youth
 immediately declared, "that he loved her with all his heart; and that
 the beauteous Abacaba, with whom he had been desperately in love in his
 own country, was far inferior to her." Miss replied, with her usual
 modesty, "that the prior, her uncle, and the lady, her aunt, should be
 spoken to immediately; and that, on her side, she would say a few words
 to her dear brother, the Abbé of St. Yves, and that she flattered
 herself it would meet with no opposition."
 
 The youth replied: "that the consent of any one was entirely
 superfluous; that it appeared to him extremely ridiculous to go and ask
 others what they were to do; that when two parties were agreed, there
 was no occasion for a third, to accomplish their union."
 
 "I never consult any one," said he, "when I have a mind to breakfast, to
 hunt, or to sleep. I am sensible, that in love it is not amiss to have
 the consent of the person whom we wish for; but as I am neither in love
 with my uncle nor my aunt, I have no occasion to address myself to them
 in this affair; and if you will believe me, you may equally dispense
 with the advice of the Abbé of St. Yves."
 
 It may be supposed that the young lady exerted all the delicacy of her
 wit, to bring her Huron to the terms of good breeding. She was very
 angry, but soon softened. In a word, it cannot be said how this
 conversation would have ended, if the declining day had not brought the
 Abbé to conduct his sister home. The Huron left his uncle and aunt to
 rest, they being somewhat fatigued with the ceremony, and long dinner.
 He passed part of the night in writing verses in the Huron language,
 upon his well-beloved; for it should be known, that there is no country
 where love has not rendered lovers poets.[1]
 
 The next day his uncle spoke to him in the following manner. "I am
 somewhat advanced in years. My brother has left only a little bit of
 ground, which is a very small matter. I have a good priory. If you will
 only make yourself a sub-deacon, as I hope you will, I will resign my
 priory in your favor; and you will live quite at your ease, after
 having been the consolation of my old age."
 
 The Huron replied:
 
 "Uncle, much good may it do you; live as long as you can. I do not know
 what it is to be a sub-deacon, or what it is to resign, but every thing
 will be agreeable to me, provided I have Miss St. Yves at my disposal."
 
 "Good heavens, nephew! what is it you say? Do you love that beautiful
 young lady so earnestly?"
 
 "Yes, uncle."
 
 "Alas! nephew, it is impossible you should ever marry her."
 
 "It is very possible, uncle; for she did not only squeeze my hand when
 she left me, but she promised she would ask me in marriage. I certainly
 shall wed her."
 
 "It is impossible, I tell you, she is your god-mother. It is a dreadful
 sin for a god-mother to give her hand to her god-son. It is contrary to
 all laws, human and divine."
 
 "Why the deuce, uncle, should it be forbidden to marry one's god-mother,
 when she is young and handsome? I did not find, in the book you gave me,
 that it was wrong to marry young women who assisted at christenings. I
 perceive, every day, that an infinite number of things are done here
 which are not in your book, and nothing is done that is said in it. I
 must acknowledge to you, that this astonishes and displeases me. If I am
 deprived of the charming Miss St. Yves on account of my baptism, I give
 you notice, that I will run away with her and unbaptize myself."
 
 The prior was confounded; his sister wept.
 
 "My dear brother," said she, "our nephew must not damn himself; our holy
 father the pope can give him a dispensation, and then he may be happy,
 in a christian-like manner, with the person he likes."
 
 The ingenuous Hercules embraced his aunt:
 
 "For goodness sake," said he, "who is this charming man, who is so
 gracious as to promote the amours of girls and boys? I will go and speak
 to him this instant."
 
 The dignity and character of the pope was explained to him, and the
 Huron was still more astonished than before.
 
 "My dear uncle," said he, "there is not a word of all this in your
 book; I have traveled, and am acquainted with the sea; we are now upon
 the coast of the ocean, and I must leave Miss St. Yves, to go and ask
 leave to marry her of a man who lives toward the Mediterranean, four
 hundred leagues from hence, and whose language I do not understand! This
 is most incomprehensibly ridiculous! But I will go first to the Abbé St.
 Yves, who lives only a league from hence; and I promise you I will wed
 my mistress before night."
 
 Whilst he was yet speaking, the bailiff entered, and, according to his
 usual custom, asked him where he was going?
 
 "I am going to get married," replied the ingenuous Hercules, running
 along; and in less than a quarter of an hour he was with his charming
 dear mistress, who was still asleep.
 
 "Ah! my dear brother," said Miss Kerkabon to the prior, "you will never
 make a sub-deacon of our nephew."
 
 The bailiff was very much displeased at this journey; for he laid claim
 to Miss St. Yves in favor of his son, who was a still greater and more
 insupportable fool than his father.
 
 
 [1] "Love," says Robert G. Ingersoll, "writes every poem, sings every
 song, paints every picture, chisels every statue--makes kings and queens
 of common clay, and is the perfume of that wondrous flower, the human
 heart."--E.
 
 
 
 
 VI.
 
 THE HURON FLIES TO HIS MISTRESS, AND BECOMES QUITE FURIOUS.
 
 
 No sooner had the ingenuous Hercules reached the house, than having
 asked the old servant, which was his mistress's apartment, he forced
 open the door, which was badly fastened, and flew toward the bed. Miss
 St. Yves, startled out of her sleep, cried.
 
 "Ah! what, is it you! Stop, what are you about?" He answered:
 
 "I am going to marry."
 
 She opposed him with all the decency of a young lady so well educated;
 but the Huron did not understand raillery, and found all evasions
 extremely disagreeable.
 
 "Miss Abacaba, my first mistress," said he, "did not behave in this
 manner; you have no honesty; you promised me marriage, and you will not
 marry; this is being deficient in the first laws of honor."
 
 The outcries of the lady, brought the sagacious Abbé de St. Yves with
 his housekeeper, an old devotee servant, and the parish priest. The
 sight of these moderated the courage of the assailant.
 
 "Good heavens!" cried the Abbé, "my dear neighbor, what are you about?"
 
 "My duty," replied the young man, "I am fulfilling my promises, which
 are sacred."
 
 Miss St. Yves adjusted herself, not without blushing. The lover was
 conducted into another apartment. The Abbé remonstrated to him on the
 enormity of his conduct. The Huron defended himself upon the privileges
 of the law of nature, which he understood perfectly well. The Abbé
 maintained, that the law positive should be allowed all its advantages;
 and that without conventions agreed on between men, the law of nature
 must almost constantly be nothing more than natural felony. Notaries,
 priests, witnesses, contracts, and dispensations, were absolutely
 necessary.
 
 The ingenuous Hercules made answer with the observation constantly
 adopted by savages:
 
 "You are then very great rogues, since so many precautions are
 necessary."
 
 This remark somewhat disconcerted the Abbé.
 
 "There are, I acknowledge, libertines and cheats among us, and there
 would be as many among the Hurons, if they were united in a great city:
 but, at the same time, we have direct, honest, enlightened people; and
 these are the men who have framed the laws. The more upright we are, the
 more readily we should submit to them, as we thereby set an example to
 the vicious, who respect those bounds which virtue has given herself."
 
 This answer struck the Huron. It has already been observed, that his
 mind was well disposed. He was softened by flattering speeches, which
 promised him hopes; all the world is caught in these snares; and Miss
 St. Yves herself appeared, after having been at her toilet. Every thing
 was now conducted with the utmost good breeding.
 
 [Illustration: The separation.]
 
 It was with much difficulty that Hercules was sent back to his
 relations. It was again necessary for the charming Miss St. Yves to
 interfere; the more she perceived the influence she had upon him, the
 more she loved him. She made him depart, and was much affected at it. At
 length, when he was gone, the Abbé, who was not only Miss St. Yves's
 elder brother by many years, but was also her guardian, endeavored to
 wean his ward from the importunities of this dreadful lover. He went to
 consult the bailiff, who had always intended his son for the Abbé's
 sister, and who advised him to place the poor girl in a convent. This
 was a terrible stroke. Such a measure would, to a young lady unaffected
 with any particular passion, have been inexpressible punishment; but to
 a love-sick maid, equally sagacious and tender, it was despair itself.
 
 When the ingenuous Hercules returned to the Prior's, he related all that
 had happened with his usual frankness. He met with the same
 remonstrances, which had some effect upon his mind, though none upon his
 senses; but the next day, when he wanted to return to his mistress, in
 order to reason with her upon the law of nature and the law of
 convention, the bailiff acquainted him, with insulting joy, that she was
 in a convent.
 
 "Very well," said he, "I'll go and reason with her in this convent."
 
 That cannot be, said the bailiff; and then entered into a long
 explanation of the nature of a convent, telling him that this word was
 derived from _conventus_, in the Latin, which signifies "an assembly;"
 and the Huron could not comprehend, why he might not be admitted into
 this assembly. As soon as he was informed that this assembly was a kind
 of prison, in which girls were shut up, a shocking institution, unknown
 in Huronia and England; he became as furious as was his patron Hercules,
 when Euritus, king of Œchalia, no less cruel than the Abbé of St.
 Yves, refused him the beauteous Iola, his daughter, not inferior in
 beauty to the Abbé's sister. He was upon the point of going to set fire
 to the convent to carry off his mistress, or be burnt with her. Miss
 Kerkabon, terrified at such a declaration, gave up all hopes of ever
 seeing her nephew a sub-deacon; and, sadly weeping, she exclaimed: "The
 devil has certainly been in him since he has been christened."
 
 
 
 
 VII.
 
 THE HURON REPULSES THE ENGLISH.
 
 
 The ingenuous Hercules walked toward the sea-coast wrapped in deep and
 gloomy melancholy, with his double charged fusee upon his shoulder, and
 his cutlass by his side, shooting now and then a bird, and often tempted
 to shoot himself; but he had still some affection for life, for the sake
 of his dear mistress; by turns execrating his uncle and aunt, all Lower
 Britany, and his christening; then blessing them, as they had introduced
 him to the knowledge of her he loved. He resolved upon going to burn the
 convent, and he stopped short for fear of burning his mistress. The
 waves of the Channel are not more agitated by the easterly and westerly
 winds, than was his heart by so many contrary emotions.
 
 He was walking along very fast, without knowing whither he was going,
 when he heard the beat of a drum. He saw, at a great distance, a vast
 multitude, part of whom ran toward the coast, and the other part in the
 opposite direction.
 
 A thousand shrieks re-echoed on every side. Curiosity and courage
 hurried him, that instant, toward the spot where the greatest clamor
 arose, which he attained in a few leaps. The commander of the militia,
 who had supped with him at the Prior's, knew him immediately, and he ran
 to the Huron with open arms:
 
 "Ah! it is the sincere American: he will fight for us."
 
 Upon which the militia, who were almost dead with fear, recovered
 themselves, crying with one voice:
 
 "It is the Huron, the ingenuous Huron."
 
 "Gentlemen," said he, "what is the matter? Why are you frightened? Have
 they shut your mistresses up in convents?"
 
 Instantly a thousand confused voices cried out:
 
 "Do you not see the English, who are landing?"
 
 "Very well," replied the Huron, "they are a brave people; they never
 proposed making me a sub-deacon; they never carried off my mistress."
 
 The commander made him understand, that they were coming to pillage the
 Abbé of the Mountain, drink his uncle's wine, and perhaps carry off
 Miss St. Yves; that the little vessel which set him on shore in Britany
 had come only to reconnoitre the coast; that they were committing acts
 of hostility, without having declared war against France; and that the
 province was entirely exposed to them.
 
 "If this he the case," said he, "they violate the law of nature: let me
 alone; I lived a long time among them; I am acquainted with their
 language, and I will speak to them. I cannot think they can have so
 wicked a design."
 
 During this conversation the English fleet approached; the Huron ran
 toward it, and having jumped into a little boat, soon rowed to the
 Admiral's ship, and having gone on board, asked "whether it was true,
 that they were come to ravage the coast, without having honestly
 declared war?"
 
 The Admiral and all his crew burst out into laughter, made him drink
 some punch, and sent him back.
 
 The ingenuous Hercules, piqued at this reception, thought of nothing
 else but beating his old friends for his countrymen and the Prior. The
 gentlemen of the neighborhood ran from all quarters, and joined them;
 they had some cannon, and he discharged them one after the other. The
 English landed, and he flew toward them, when he killed three of them
 with his own hand. He even wounded the Admiral, who had made a joke of
 him. The entire militia were animated with his prowess. The English
 returned to their ships, and went on board; and the whole coast
 re-echoed with the shouts of victory, "Live the king! live the ingenuous
 Hercules!"
 
 Every one ran to embrace him; every one strove to stop the bleeding of
 some slight wounds he had received.
 
 "Ah!" said he, "if Miss St. Yves were here, she would put on a plaster
 for me."
 
 The bailiff, who had hid himself in his cellar during the battle, came
 to pay his compliments like the rest. But he was greatly surprised, when
 he heard the ingenuous Hercules say to a dozen young men, well disposed
 for his service, who surrounded him:
 
 "My friends, having delivered the Abbé of the Mountain is nothing; we
 must rescue a nymph."
 
 The warm blood of these youths was fired at the expression. He was
 already followed by crowds, who repaired to the convent. If the bailiff
 had not immediately acquainted the commandant with their design, and he
 had not sent a detachment after the joyous troop, the thing would have
 been done. The Huron was conducted back to his uncle and aunt, who
 overwhelmed him with tears and tenderness.
 
 "I see very well," said his uncle, "that you will never be either a
 sub-deacon or a prior; you will be an officer, and one still braver than
 my brother the Captain, and probably as poor."
 
 Miss Kerkabon could not stop an incessant flood of tears, whilst she
 embraced him, saying, "he will be killed too, like my brother; it were
 much better he were a sub-deacon."
 
 The Huron had, during the battle, picked up a purse full of guineas,
 which the Admiral had probably lost. He did not doubt but that this
 purse would buy all Lower Britany, and, above all, make Miss St. Yves a
 great lady. Every one persuaded him to repair to Versailles, to receive
 the recompense due to his services. The commandant, and the principal
 officers, furnished him with certificates in abundance. The uncle and
 aunt also approved of this journey. He was to be presented to the king
 without any difficulty. This alone would give him great weight in the
 province. These two good folks added to the English purse a considerable
 present out of their savings. The Huron said to himself, "When I see the
 king, I will ask Miss St. Yves of him in marriage, and certainly he will
 not refuse me." He set out accordingly, amidst the acclamations of the
 whole district, stifled with embraces, bathed in tears by his aunt,
 blessed by his uncle, and recommending himself to the charming Miss St.
 Yves.
 
 
 
 
 VIII.
 
 THE HURON GOES TO COURT. SUPS UPON THE ROAD WITH SOME HUGUENOTS.
 
 
 The ingenuous Hercules took the Saumur road in the coach, because there
 was at that time no other convenience. When he came to Saumur, he was
 astonished to find the city almost deserted, and to see several families
 going away. He was told, that half a dozen years before, Saumur
 contained upwards of fifty thousand inhabitants, and that at present
 there were not six thousand. He mentioned this at the inn, whilst at
 supper. Several Protestants were at table; some complained bitterly,
 others trembled with rage, others, weeping, said, _Nos dulcia linquimus
 arva, nos patriam fugimus_. The Huron, who did not understand Latin, had
 these words explained to him, which signified, "We abandon our sweet
 fields;--We fly from our country."
 
 "And why do you fly from your country, gentlemen?"
 
 "Because we must otherwise acknowledge the Pope."
 
 "And why not acknowledge him? You have no god-mothers, then, that you
 want to marry; for, I am told it is he that grants this permission."
 
 "Ah! sir, this Pope says, that he is master of the domains of kings."
 
 "But, gentlemen, what religion are you of?"
 
 "Why, sir, we are for the most part drapers and manufacturers."
 
 "If the Pope, then, is not the master of your clothes and manufactures,
 you do very well not to acknowledge him; but as to kings, it is their
 business, and why do you trouble yourselves about it?"
 
 Here a little black man took up the argument, and very learnedly set
 forth the grievances of the company. He talked of the revocation of the
 edict of Nantes with so much energy; he deplored, in so pathetic a
 manner, the fate of fifty thousand fugitive families, and of fifty
 thousand others converted by dragoons; that the ingenuous Hercules could
 not refrain from shedding tears.
 
 "Whence arises it," said he, "that so great a king, whose renown expands
 itself even to the Hurons, should thus deprive himself of so many hearts
 that would have loved him, and so many arms that would have served him."
 
 "Because he has been imposed upon, like other great kings," replied the
 little orator, "He has been made to believe, that as soon as he utters a
 word, all people think as he does; and that he can make us change our
 religion, just as his musician Lulli, in a moment, changes the
 decorations of his opera. He has not only already lost five or six
 hundred thousand very useful subjects, but he has turned many of them
 into enemies; and King William, who is at this time master of England,
 has formed several regiments of these identical Frenchmen, who would
 otherwise have fought for their monarch.
 
 "Such a disaster is more astonishing, as the present Pope, to whom Louis
 XIV. sacrifices a part of his people, is his declared enemy. A violent
 quarrel has subsisted between them for nearly nine years. It has been
 carried so far, that France was in hopes of at length casting off the
 yoke, by which it has been kept in subjection for so many ages to this
 foreigner, and, more particularly, of not giving him any more money,
 which is the _primum mobile_ of the affairs of this world. It,
 therefore, appears evident, that this great king has been imposed on, as
 well with respect to his interest, as the extent of his power, and that
 even the magnanimity of his heart has been struck at."
 
 The Huron, becoming more and more interested, asked:
 
 "Who were the Frenchmen who thus deceived a monarch so dear to the
 Hurons?"
 
 "They are the Jesuits," he was answered, "and, particularly, Father la
 Chaise, the kings confessor. It is to be hoped that God will one day
 punish them for it, and that they will be driven out, as they now drive
 us. Can any misfortune equal ours? Mons. de Louvois besets us on all
 sides with Jesuits and dragoons."
 
 "Well gentlemen," replied the Huron, "I am going to Versailles to
 receive the recompense due to my services; I will speak to Mons. de
 Louvois. I am told it is he who makes war from his closet. I shall see
 the king, and I will acquaint him with the truth. It is impossible not
 to yield to this truth, when it is felt. I shall return very soon to
 marry Miss St. Yves, and I beg you will be present at our nuptials."
 
 These good people now took him for some great Lord, who traveled
 _incognito_ in the coach. Some took him for the king's fool.
 
 There was at table a disguised Jesuit, who acted as a spy to the
 Reverend Father de la Chaise. He gave him an account of everything that
 passed, and Father de la Chaise reported it to M. de Louvois. The spy
 wrote. The Huron and the letter arrived almost at the same time at
 Versailles.
 
 
 
 
 IX.
 
 THE ARRIVAL OF THE HURON AT VERSAILLES. HIS RECEPTION AT COURT.
 
 
 The ingenuous Hercules was set down from a public carriage, in the court
 of the kitchens. He asks the chairmen, what hour the king can be seen?
 The chairmen laugh in his face, just as the English Admiral had done:
 and he treated them in the same manner--he beat them. They were for
 retaliation, and the scene had like to have proved bloody, if a soldier,
 who was a gentleman of Britany, had not passed by, and who dispersed the
 mob.
 
 "Sir," said the traveler to him, "you appear to me to be a brave man. I
 am nephew to the Prior of our Lady of the Mountain. I have killed
 Englishmen, and I am come to speak to the king. I beg you will conduct
 me to his chamber."
 
 The soldier, delighted to find a man of courage from his province, who
 did not seem acquainted with the customs of the court, told him it was
 necessary to be presented to M. de Louvois.
 
 "Very well, then, conduct me to M. de Louvois, who will doubtless
 conduct me to the king."
 
 "It is more difficult to speak to M. de Louvois than the king. But I
 will conduct you to Mr. Alexander, first commissioner of war, and this
 will be just the same as if you spoke to the minister."
 
 They accordingly repair to Mr. Alexander's, who is first clerk, but they
 cannot be introduced, he being closely engaged in business with a lady
 of the court, and no person is allowed admittance.
 
 "Well," said the soldier, "there is no harm done, let us go to Mr.
 Alexander's first clerk. This will be just the same as if you spoke to
 Mr. Alexander himself."
 
 The Huron quite astonished, followed him. They remained together half an
 hour in a little anti-chamber.
 
 "What is all this?" said the ingenuous Hercules. "Is all the world
 invisible in this country? It is much easier to fight in Lower Britany
 against Englishmen, than to meet with people at Versailles, with whom
 one hath business."
 
 He amused himself for some time with relating his amours to his
 countryman; but the clock striking, recalled the soldier to his post,
 when a mutual promise was given of meeting on the morrow.
 
 The Huron remained another half hour in the anti-chamber, meditating
 upon Miss St. Yves, and the difficulty of speaking to kings and first
 clerks.
 
 At length the patron appeared.
 
 "Sir," said the ingenuous Hercules, "If I had waited to repulse the
 English as long as you have made me wait for my audience, they would
 certainly have ravaged all Lower Britany without opposition."
 
 These words impressed the clerk. He at length said to the inhabitant of
 Britany, "What is your request?"
 
 "A recompense," said the other: "these are my titles;" showing his
 certificates.
 
 The clerk read, and told him, "that probably he might obtain leave to
 purchase a lieutenancy."
 
 "Me? what, must I pay money for having repulsed the English? Must I pay
 a tax to be killed for you, whilst you are peaceably giving your
 audience here? You are certainly jesting. I require a company of cavalry
 for nothing. I require that the king shall set Miss St. Yves at liberty
 from the convent, and give her to me in marriage. I want to speak to the
 king in favor of fifty thousand families, whom I propose restoring to
 him. In a word, I want to be useful. Let me be employed and advanced."
 
 "What is your name, sir, who talk in such a high style?"
 
 "Oh! oh!" answered the Huron; "you have not then read my certificates?
 This is the way they are treated. My name is _Hercules de Kerkabon_. I
 am christened, and I lodge at the Blue Dial." The clerk concluded, like
 the people at Saumur, that his head was turned, and did not pay him any
 further attention.
 
 The same day, the Reverend Father de la Chaise, confessor to Louis XIV.,
 received his spy's letter, which accused the Breton Kerkabon of favoring
 in his heart the Huguenots, and condemning the conduct of the Jesuits.
 M. de Louvois had, on his side, received a letter from the inquisitive
 bailiff, which depicted the Huron as a wicked, lewd fellow, inclined to
 burn convents, and carry off the nuns.
 
 Hercules, after having walked in the gardens of Versailles, which had
 become irksome to him; after having supped like a native of Huronia and
 Lower Britany: had gone to rest, in the pleasant hope of seeing the king
 the next day; of obtaining Miss St. Yves in marriage; of having, at
 least, a company of cavalry; and of setting aside the persecution
 against the Huguenots. He was rocking himself asleep with these
 flattering ideas, when the _Marechaussée_ entered his chamber, and
 seized upon his double-charged fusee and his great sabre.
 
 They took an inventory of his ready money, and then conducted him to the
 castle erected by King Charles V., son to John II., near the street of
 St. Antoine, at the gate des Tournelles.
 
 What was the Huron's astonishment in his way thither the reader is left
 to imagine. He at first fancied it was all a dream; and remained for
 some time in a state of stupefaction. Presently, transported with rage,
 that gave him more than common strength, he collared two of his
 conductors who were with him in the coach, flung them out of the door,
 cast himself after them, and then dragged the third, who wanted to hold
 him. He fell in the attempt, when they tied him, and replaced him in the
 carriage.
 
 "This, then," said he, "is what one gets for driving the English out of
 Lower Britany! What wouldst thou say, charming Miss St. Yves, if thou
 didst see me in this situation?"
 
 They at length arrived at the place of their destination. He was carried
 without any noise into the chamber in which he was to be locked up, like
 a dead corpse going to the grave. This room was already occupied by an
 old solitary student of Port Royal, named Gordon, who had been
 languishing here for two years.
 
 "See," said the chief of the Marechaussée, "here is company I bring
 you;" and immediately the enormous bolts of this strong door, secured
 with large iron bars, were fastened upon them. These two captives were
 thus separated from all the universe besides.
 
 
 
 
 X.
 
 THE HURON IS SHUT UP IN THE BASTILE WITH A JANSENIST.
 
 
 Mr. Gordon was a healthy old man, of a serene disposition, who was
 acquainted with two great things; the one was, to bear adversity; the
 other, to console the afflicted. He approached his companion with an
 open sympathizing air, and said to him, whilst he embraced him:
 
 "Whoever thou art that is come to partake of my grave, be assured, that
 I shall constantly forget myself to soften thy torments in the infernal
 abyss where we are plunged. Let us adore Providence that has conducted
 us here. Let us suffer in peace, and trust in hope."
 
 These words had the same effect upon the youth as cordial drops, which
 recall a dying person to life, and show to his astonished eyes a glimpse
 of light.
 
 After the first compliments were over, Gordon, without urging him to
 relate the cause of his misfortune, inspired him by the sweetness of his
 discourse and by that interest which two unfortunate persons share with
 each other, with a desire of opening his heart and of disburdening
 himself of the weight which oppressed him; but he could not guess the
 cause of his misfortune, and the good man Gordon was as much astonished
 as himself.
 
 "God must, doubtless," said the Jansenist to the Huron, "have great
 designs upon you, since he conducted you from Lake Ontario into England,
 from thence to France; caused you to be baptized in Lower Britany, and
 has now lodged you here for your salvation."
 
 "I' faith," replied Hercules, "I believe the devil alone has interfered
 in my destiny.[1] My countrymen in America would never have treated me
 with the barbarity that I have here experienced; they have not the least
 idea of it. They are called savages;--they are good people, but rustic,
 and the men of this country are refined villains. I am indeed, greatly
 surprised to have come from another world, to be shut up in this, under
 four bolts with a priest; but I consider what an infinite number of men
 set out from one hemisphere to go and get killed in the other, or are
 cast away in the voyage, and are eaten by the fishes. I cannot discover
 the gracious designs of God over all these people."
 
 Their dinner was brought them through a wicket. The conversation turned
 upon Providence, _lettres de cachet_, and upon the art of not sinking
 under disgrace, to which all men in this world are exposed.
 
 "It is now two years since I have been here," said the old man, "without
 any other consolation than myself and books; and yet I have never been a
 single moment out of temper."
 
 "Ah! Mr. Gordon," cried Hercules, "you are not then in love with your
 god-mother. If you were as well acquainted with Miss St. Yves as I am,
 you would be in a state of desperation."
 
 At these words he could not refrain from tears, which greatly relieved
 him from his oppression.
 
 "How is it then that tears solace us?" said the Huron, "It seems to me
 that they should have quite an opposite effect."
 
 "My son," said the good old man, "every thing is physical about us; all
 secretions are useful to the body, and all that comforts it, comforts
 the soul. We are the machines of Providence."
 
 The ingenuous Huron, who, as we have already observed more than once,
 had a great share of understanding, entered deeply into the
 consideration of this idea, the seeds whereof appeared to be in himself.
 After which he asked his companion.
 
 "Why his machine had for two years been confined by four bolts?"
 
 "By effectual grace," answered Gordon; "I pass for a Jansenist; I know
 Arnaud and Nicole; the Jesuits have persecuted us. We believe that the
 Pope is nothing more than a bishop, like another, and therefore Father
 la Chaise has obtained from the king, his penitent, an order for
 robbing me without any form of justice, of the most precious inheritance
 of man--liberty!"
 
 "This is very strange," said the Huron, "all the unhappy people I have
 met with have been made so solely by the Pope. With respect to your
 effectual grace, I acknowledge I do not understand what you mean. But I
 consider it as a very great favor, that God has let me, in my
 misfortunes, meet with a man, who pours into my heart such consolation
 as I thought myself incapable of receiving."
 
 The conversation became each day more interesting and instructive. The
 souls of the two captives seemed to unite in one body. The old man had
 acquired knowledge, and the young man was willing to receive
 instruction. At the end of the first month, he eagerly applied himself
 to the study of geometry. Gordon made him read _Rohault's Physics_,
 which book was still in fashion, and he had good sense enough to find in
 it nothing but doubts and uncertainties.
 
 He afterward read the first volume of the _Enquiry After Truth_. This
 instructive work gave him new light.
 
 "What!" said he, "do our imagination and our senses deceive us to that
 degree? What, are not our ideas formed by objects, and can we not
 acquire them by ourselves?"
 
 When he had gone through the second volume, he was not so well
 satisfied; and he concluded it was much easier to destroy than to build.
 
 His colleague, astonished that a young ignoramus should make such a
 remark, conceived a very high opinion of his understanding, and was more
 strongly attached to him.
 
 "Your Malebranche," said he to Gordon one day, "seems to have written
 half his book whilst he was in possession of his reason, and the other
 half with the assistance only of imagination and prejudice."
 
 Some days after, Gordon asked him what he thought of the soul, and the
 manner in which we receive our ideas of volition, grace, and free
 agency.
 
 "Nothing," replied the Huron. "If I think sometimes, it is that we are
 under the power of the Eternal Being, like the stars and the
 elements--that he operates everything in us--that we are small wheels of
 the immense machine, of which he is the soul--that he acts according to
 general laws, and not from particular views. This is all that appears to
 me intelligible; all the rest is to me a dark abyss."
 
 "But this, my son, would be making God the author of sin!"
 
 "But, father, your effectual grace would equally make him the author of
 sin; for certainly all those to whom this grace was refused, would sin;
 and is not an all-powerful being who permits evil, virtually the author
 of evil?"
 
 This sincerity greatly embarrassed the good man; he found that all his
 endeavors to extricate himself from this quagmire were ineffectual; and
 he heaped such quantities of words upon one another, which seemed to
 have meaning, but which in fact had none, that the Huron could not help
 pitying him. This question evidently determined the origin of good and
 evil; and poor Gordon was reduced to the necessity of recurring to
 Pandora's box--Oromasdes's egg pierced by Arimanes--the enmity between
 Typhon and Osiris--and, at last, original sin; and these he huddled
 together in profound darkness, without their throwing the least
 glimmering light upon one another. However, this romance of the soul
 diverted their thoughts from the contemplation of their own misery; and,
 by a strange magic, the multitude of calamities dispersed throughout the
 world diminished the sensation of their own miseries. They did not dare
 complain when all mankind was in a state of sufferance.
 
 But in the repose of night, the image of the charming Miss St. Yves
 effaced from the mind of her lover every metaphysical and moral idea. He
 awoke with his eyes bathed in tears; and the old Jansenist forgot his
 effectual grace, and the Abbé of St. Cyran, and even Jansenius himself,
 to afford consolation to a youth whom he had judged guilty of a mortal
 sin.
 
 After these lectures and their reasonings were over, their adventures
 furnished them with subjects of conversation; after this store was
 exhausted, they read together, or separately. The Huron's understanding
 daily increased; and he would certainly have made great progress in
 mathematics, if the thought of Miss St. Yves had not frequently
 distracted him.
 
 He read histories, which made him melancholy. The world appeared to him
 too wicked and too miserable. In fact, history is nothing more than a
 picture of crimes and misfortunes. The crowd of innocent and peaceable
 men are always invisible upon this vast theatre. The _dramatis personæ_
 are composed of ambitious, perverse men. The pleasure which history
 affords is derived from the same source as tragedy, which would languish
 and become insipid, were it not inspired with strong passions, great
 events, and piteous misfortunes. Clio must be armed with a poniard as
 well as Melpomene.
 
 Though the history of France is not less filled with horror than those
 of other nations, it nevertheless appeared to him so disgusting in the
 beginning, so dry in the continuation, and so trifling in the end, (even
 in the time of Henry IV.); ever destitute of grand monuments, or foreign
 to those fine discoveries which have illustrated other nations; that he
 was obliged to resolve upon not being tired, in order to go through all
 the particulars of obscure calamities confined to a little corner of the
 world.
 
 Gordon thought like him. They both laughed with pity when they read of
 the sovereigns of Fezensacs, Fesansaguet, and Astrac: such a study could
 be relished only by their heirs, if they had any. The brilliant ages of
 the Roman Republic made him sometimes quite indifferent as to any other
 part of the globe. The spectacle of victorious Rome, the lawgiver of
 nations, engrossed his whole soul. He glowed in contemplating a people
 who were governed for seven hundred years by the enthusiasm of liberty
 and glory.
 
 Thus rolled days, weeks, and months; and he would have thought himself
 happy in the sanctuary of despair, if he had not loved.
 
 The natural goodness of his heart was softened still more when he
 reflected upon the Prior of our Lady of the Mountain, and the sensible
 Kerkabon.
 
 "What must they think," he would often repeat, "when they can get no
 tidings of me? They must think me an ungrateful wretch." This idea
 rendered him inconsolable. He pitied those who loved him much more than
 he pitied himself.
 
 
 [1] In the play called _Civilization_, Hercules uses the following
 language:
 
      "In my barbarian days, I spoke the truth:
       Wrong'd not my neighbor: paid back benefits,
       With benefit and gratitude to boot;
       Dealt justly: held a friend to be a gift,
       Precious as stars dropt down from heaven: bowed
       Before the works of God: beheld in them
       His presence, palpable, as at an altar:
       And worshipp'd heaven at the mountain's foot.
                                           But this
       Was Barbarism, I am wiser now;
       More civilized. I know the way to lie,
       To cheat, deceive, and be a zealous Christian!"--E.
 
 
 
 
 
 XI.
 
 HOW THE HURON DISCLOSES HIS GENIUS.
 
 
 Reading aggrandizes the soul, and an enlightened friend affords
 consolation. Our captive had these two advantages in his favor which he
 had never expected.
 
 "I shall begin to believe in the Metamorphoses," said he, "for I have
 been transformed from a brute into a man."
 
 He formed a chosen library with part of the money which he was allowed
 to dispose of. His friend encouraged him to commit to writing such
 observations as occurred to him. These are his notes upon ancient
 history:
 
 "I imagine that nations were for a long time like myself; that they did
 not become enlightened till very late; that for many ages they were
 occupied with nothing but the present moment which elapsed: that they
 thought very little of what was past, and never of the future. I have
 traversed five or six hundred leagues in Canada, and I did not meet with
 a single monument: no one is the least acquainted with the actions of
 his predecessors. Is not this the natural state of man? The human
 species of this continent appears to me superior to that of the other.
 They have extended their being for many ages by arts and knowledge. Is
 this because they have beards upon their chins and God has refused this
 ornament to the Americans? I do not believe it; for I find the Chinese
 have very little beard, and that they have cultivated arts for upwards
 of five thousand years. In effect, if their annals go back upwards of
 four thousand years, the nation must necessarily have been united and in
 a flourishing state more than five hundred centuries.
 
 "One thing particularly strikes me in this ancient history of China,
 which is, that almost every thing is probable and natural. I admire it
 because it is not tinctured with anything of the marvelous.
 
 "Why have all other nations adopted fabulous origins? The ancient
 chronicles of the history of France, which, by the by, are not very
 ancient, make the French descend from one Francus, the son of Hector.
 The Romans said they were the issue of a Phrygian, though there was not
 in their whole language a single word that had the least connection
 with the language of Phrygia. The gods had inhabited Egypt for ten
 thousand years, and the devils Scythia, where they had engendered the
 Huns. I meet with nothing before Thucydides but romances similar to the
 Amadis, and far less amusing. Apparitions, oracles, prodigies, sorcery,
 metamorphoses, are interspersed throughout with the explanation of
 dreams, which are the bases of the destiny of the greatest empires and
 the smallest states. Here are speaking beasts, there brutes that are
 adored, gods transformed into men, and men into gods. If we must have
 fables, let us, at least, have such as appear the emblem of truth. I
 admire the fables of philosophers, but I laugh at those of children, and
 hate those of impostors."
 
 He one day hit upon a history of the Emperor Justinian. It was there
 related, that some Appedeutes of Constantinople had delivered, in very
 bad Greek, an edict against the greatest captain of the age, because
 this hero had uttered the following words in the warmth of conversation:
 "Truth shines forth with its proper light, and people's minds are not
 illumined with flaming piles." The Appedeutes declared that this
 proposition was heretical, bordering upon heresy, and that the contrary
 action was catholic, universal, and Grecian: "The minds of the people
 are enlightened but with flaming piles, and truth cannot shine forth
 with its own light." These Linostolians thus condemned several
 discourses of the captain, and published an edict.
 
 "What!" said the Huron, with much emotion, "shall such people publish
 edicts?"
 
 "They are not edicts," replied Gordon: "they are contradictions, which
 all the world laughed at in Constantinople, and the Emperor the first.
 He was a wise prince, who knew how to reduce the Linostolian Appedeutes
 to a state incapable of doing anything but good. He knew that these
 gentlemen, and several other Pastophores, had tired the patience of the
 Emperors, his predecessors, with contradictions in more serious
 matters."
 
 "He did quite right," said the Huron, "the Pastophores should not be
 supported, but constrained."
 
 He committed several other observations to paper, which astonished old
 Gordon. "What," said he to himself, "have I consumed fifty years in
 instruction and not attained to the degree of natural good sense of this
 child, who is almost a savage? I tremble to think I have so arduously
 strengthened prejudices, and he listens to simple nature only."
 
 The good man had some little books of criticism, some of those
 periodical pamphlets wherein men, incapable of producing anything
 themselves, blacken the productions of others; where a Vise insults a
 Racine, and a Faidit a Fénelon. The Huron ran over some of them. "I
 compare them," said he, "to certain gnats that lodge their eggs in the
 nostrils of the finest horses, which do not, however, retard their
 speed."
 
 The two philosophers scarce deigned to cast their eyes upon these dregs
 of literature.
 
 They soon after went through the elements of astronomy. The Huron sent
 for some globes: he was ravished at this great spectacle.
 
 "How hard it is," said he, "that I should only begin to be acquainted
 with heaven, when the power of contemplating it is ravished from me!
 Jupiter and Saturn revolve in these immense spaces;--millions of suns
 illumine myriads of worlds; and, in this corner of the earth on which I
 am cast, there are beings that deprive me of seeing and studying those
 worlds to which my eye might reach, and even that in which God has
 placed me. The light created for the whole universe is lost to me. It
 was not hidden from me in the northern horizon, where I passed my
 infancy and youth. Without you, my dear Gordon, I should be
 annihilated."
 
 
 
 
 XII.
 
 THE HURON'S SENTIMENTS UPON THEATRICAL PIECES.
 
 
 The young Huron resembled one of those vigorous trees, which,
 languishing in an ungrateful soil, extend in a little time their roots
 and branches when transplanted to a more favorable spot; and it was very
 extraordinary that this favorable spot should be a prison.
 
 Among the books which employed the leisure of the two captives were some
 poems and also translations of Greek tragedies, and some dramatic
 pieces in French. Those passages that dwelt on love communicated at once
 pleasure and pain to the soul of the Huron. They were but so many images
 of his dear Miss St. Yves. The fable of the two pigeons rent his heart:
 for he was far estranged from his tender dove.
 
 Molière enchanted him. He taught him the manners of Paris and of human
 nature.
 
 "To which of his comedies do you give the preference?"
 
 "Doubtless to his _Tartuffe_."
 
 "I am of your opinion," said Gordon; "it was a Tartuffe that flung me
 into this dungeon, and perhaps they were Tartuffes who have been the
 cause of your misfortunes."
 
 "What do you think of these Greek tragedies?"
 
 "They are very good for Grecians."
 
 But when he read the modern _Iphigenia, Phædrus, Andromache_, and
 _Athalia_, he was in ecstacy, he sighed, he wept,--and he learned them
 by heart, without having any such intention.
 
 "Read _Rodogune_," said Gordon; "that is said to be a capital
 production; the other pieces which have given you so much pleasure, are
 trifles compared to this."
 
 The young man had scarce got through the first page, before he said,
 "This is not written by the same author."
 
 "How do you know it?"
 
 "I know nothing yet; but these lines neither touch my ear nor my heart."
 
 "O!" said Gordon, "the versification does not signify." The Huron asked,
 "What must I judge by then?"
 
 After having read the piece very attentively without any other design
 than being pleased, he looked steadfastly at his friend with much
 astonishment, not knowing what to say. At length, being urged to give
 his opinion with respect to what he felt, this was the answer he made:
 "I understood very little of the beginning; the middle disgusted me; but
 the last scene greatly moved me, though there appears to me but little
 probability in it. I have no prejudices for or against any one, but I do
 not remember twenty lines, I, who recollect them all when they please
 me."
 
 "This piece, nevertheless, passes for the best upon our stage."
 
 "If that be the case," said he, "it is perhaps like many people who are
 not worthy of the places they hold. After all, this is a matter of
 taste, and mine cannot yet be formed. I may be mistaken; but you know I
 am accustomed to say what I think or rather what I feel. I suspect that
 illusion, fashion, caprice, often warp the judgments of men."
 
 Here he repeated some lines from _Iphigenia_, which he was full of; and
 though he declaimed but indifferently, he uttered them with such truth
 and emotion that he made the old Jansenist weep. He then read _Cinna_,
 which did not excite his tears, but his admiration.
 
 
 
 
 XIII.
 
 THE BEAUTIFUL MISS ST. YVES GOES TO VERSAILLES.
 
 
 Whilst the unfortunate Hercules was more enlightened than consoled;
 whilst his genius, so long stifled, unfolded itself with so much
 rapidity and strength; whilst nature, which was attaining a degree of
 perfection in him, avenged herself of the outrages of fortune; what
 became of the Prior, his good sister, and the beautiful recluse, Miss
 St. Yves? The first month they were uneasy, and the third they were
 immersed in sorrow. False conjectures, ill-grounded reports, alarmed
 them. At the end of six months, it was concluded he was dead. At length,
 Mr. and Miss Kerkabon learned, by a letter of ancient date, which one of
 the king's guards had written to Britany, that a young man resembling
 the Huron arrived one night at Versailles, but that since that time no
 one had heard him spoken of.
 
 "Alas," said Miss Kerkabon, "our nephew has done some ridiculous thing,
 which has brought on some terrible consequences. He is young, a _Low
 Breton_, and cannot know how to behave at court. My dear brother, I
 never saw Versailles nor Paris; here is a fine opportunity, and we shall
 perhaps find our poor nephew. He is our brother's son, and it is our
 duty to assist him. Who knows? we may perhaps at length prevail upon him
 to become a sub-deacon when the fire of youth is somewhat abated. He was
 much inclined to the sciences. Do you recollect how he reasoned upon
 the Old and New Testaments? We are answerable for his soul. He was
 baptized at our instigation. His dear mistress Miss St. Yves does
 nothing but weep incessantly. Indeed, we must go to Paris. If he is
 concealed in any of those infamous houses of pleasure, which I have
 often heard of, we will get him out."
 
 The Prior was affected at his sister's discourse. He went in search of
 the Bishop of St. Malo's, who had baptized the Huron, and requested his
 protection and advice. The Prelate approved of the journey. He gave the
 Prior letters of recommendation to Father la Chaise, the king's
 confessor, who was invested with the first dignity in the kingdom; to
 Harlai, the Archbishop of Paris, and to Bossuet, Bishop of Meaux.
 
 At length, the brother and sister set out; but when they came to Paris,
 they found themselves bewildered in a great labyrinth without clue or
 end. Their fortune was but middling, and they had occasion every day for
 carriages to pursue their discovery, which they could not accomplish.
 
 The Prior waited upon the Reverend Father la Chaise; he was with
 Mademoiselle du Tron, and could not give audience to Priors. He went to
 the Archbishop's door: the Prelate was shut up with the beautiful
 Mademoiselle de Lesdiguières about church matters. He flew to the
 country house of the Bishop of Meaux: he was engaged in a close
 examination with Mademoiselle de Mauleon, of the mystery relating to
 Mademoiselle Guyon. At length, however, he gained access to these two
 prelates; they both declared they could not interfere with regard to his
 nephew, as he was not a sub-deacon.
 
 He at length saw the Jesuit, who received him with open arms, protesting
 he had always entertained the greatest private esteem for him, though he
 had never known him. He swore that his society had always been attached
 to the inhabitants of Lower Britany.
 
 "But," said he, "has not your nephew the misfortune of being a
 Huguenot?"
 
 "No, certainly, Reverend Father."
 
 "May he not be a Jansenist?"
 
 "I can assure your Reverence, that he is scarce a Christian. It is about
 eleven months since he was christened."
 
 "This is very well;--we will take care of him. Is your benefice
 considerable?"
 
 "No, a very trifle, and our nephew costs us a great deal."
 
 "Are there any Jansenists in your neighborhood? Take great care, my dear
 Mr. Prior, they are more dangerous than Huguenots, or even Atheists."
 
 "My Reverend Father, we have none; it is not even known at our Lady of
 the Mountain what Jansenism is."
 
 "So much the better; go, there is nothing I will not do for you."
 
 He dismissed the Prior in this affectionate manner, but thought no more
 about him.
 
 Time slipped away, and the Prior and his good sister were almost in
 despair.
 
 In the meanwhile, the cursed bailiff urged very strenuously the marriage
 of his great booby son with the beautiful Miss St. Yves, who was taken
 purposely out of the convent. She always entertained a passion for her
 god-son in proportion as she detested the husband who was designed for
 her. The insult that had been offered her, by shutting her up in a
 convent, increased her affection; and the mandate for wedding the
 bailiff's son completed her antipathy for him. Chagrin, tenderness, and
 terror, racked her soul. Love, we know, is much more inventive and more
 daring in a young woman than friendship in an aged Prior and an aunt
 upwards of forty-five. Besides, she had received good instructions in
 her convent with the assistance of romances, which she read by stealth.
 
 The beautiful Miss St. Yves remembered the letter that had been sent by
 one of the king's guards to Lower Britany, which had been spoken of in
 the province. She resolved to go herself and gain information at
 Versailles; to throw herself at the minister's feet, if her husband
 should be in prison as it was said, and obtain justice for him. I know
 not what secret intelligence she had gained that at court nothing is
 refused to a pretty woman; but she knew not the price of these boons.
 
 Having taken this resolution, it afforded her some consolation; and she
 enjoyed some tranquillity without upraiding Providence with the severity
 of her lot. She receives her detested intended father-in-law, caresses
 her brother, and spreads happiness throughout the house. On the day
 appointed for the ceremony, she secretly departs at four o'clock in the
 morning, with the little nuptial presents she has received, and all she
 could gather. Her plan was so well laid, that she was about ten leagues
 upon her journey, when, about noon, her absence was discovered, and when
 every one's consternation and surprise was inexpressible. The
 inquisitive bailiff asked more questions that day than he had done for a
 week before; the intended bridegroom was more stupefied than ever. The
 Abbé St. Yves resolved in his rage to pursue his sister. The bailiff and
 his son were disposed to accompany him. Thus fate led almost the whole
 canton of Lower Britany to Paris.
 
 The beautiful Miss St. Yves was not without apprehensions that she
 should be pursued. She rode on horseback, and she got all the
 intelligence she could from the couriers, without being suspected. She
 asked if they had not met a fat abbé, an enormous bailiff, and a young
 booby, galloping as fast as they could to Paris. Having learned, on the
 third day, that they were not far behind, she took quite a different
 road, and was skillful and lucky enough to arrive at Versailles, whilst
 they were in a fruitless pursuit after her, at Paris. But how was she to
 behave at Versailles? Young, handsome, untutored, unsupported, unknown,
 exposed to every danger, how could she dare go in search of one of the
 king's guards? She had some thoughts of applying to a Jesuit of low
 rank, for there were some for every station of life; as God, they say,
 has given different aliments to every species of animals. He had given
 the king his confessor, who was called, by all solicitors of benefices,
 the head of the Gallican Church. Then came the princes' confessors. The
 ministers had none, they were not such dupes. There were Jesuits for the
 genteel mob, and particularly those for chambermaids, by whom were known
 the secrets of their mistresses; and this was no small vocation, the
 beautiful Miss St. Yves addressed herself to one of these last, who was
 called _Father Tout-à-tous_ (all to every one). She confessed to him,
 set forth her adventure, her situation, her danger, and conjured him to
 get her a lodging with some good devotee, who might shelter her from
 temptation.
 
 [Illustration: The Confessional.]
 
 Father _Tout-à-tous_ introduced her to the wife of the cup-bearer, one
 of his most trusty penitents. From the moment Miss St. Yves became her
 lodger, she did her utmost to obtain the confidence and friendship of
 this penitent. She gained intelligence of the Breton-Guard, and invited
 him to visit her. Having learned from him that her lover had been
 carried off after having had a conference with one of the clerks, she
 flew to this clerk. The sight of a fine woman softened him, for it must
 be allowed God created woman only to tame mankind.
 
 The scribe, thus mollified, acknowledged to her every thing.
 
 "Your lover has been in the bastile almost a year, and without your
 intercession he would, perhaps, have ended hid days there."
 
 The tender Miss St. Yves swooned at this intelligence. When she had
 recovered herself, her informer told her:
 
 "I have no power to do good; all my influence extends to doing harm.
 Take my advice, wait upon M. de St. Pouange, who has the power of doing
 both good and ill; he is Mons. de Louvois's cousin and favorite. This
 minister has two souls: the one is M. de St. Pouange, and Mademoiselle
 de Belle is the other, but she is at present absent from Versailles; so
 that you have nothing to do but captivate the protector I have pointed
 out to you."
 
 The beautiful Miss St. Yves, divided between some trifling joy and
 excessive grief, between a glimmering of hope and dreadful
 apprehensions,--pursued by her brother, idolizing her lover, wiping her
 tears, which flowed in torrents; trembling and feeble, yet summoning all
 her courage;--in this situation, she flew on the wings of love to M. de
 St. Pouange's.
 
 
 
 
 XIV.
 
 RAPID PROGRESS OF THE HURON'S INTELLECT.
 
 
 The ingenuous youth was making a rapid progress in the sciences, and
 particularly in the science of man. The cause of this sudden disclosure
 of his understanding was as much owing to his savage education as to the
 disposition of his soul; for, having learned nothing in his infancy, he
 had not imbibed any prejudices. His mind, not having been warped by
 error, had retained all its primitive rectitude. He saw things as they
 were; whereas the ideas that are communicated to us in our infancy make
 us see them all our life in a false light.
 
 "Your persecutors are very abominable wretches," said he to his friend
 Gordon. "I pity you for being oppressed, but I condemn you for being a
 Jansenist. All sects appear to me to be founded in error. Tell me if
 there be any sectaries in geometry?"
 
 "No, my child," said the good old Gordon, heaving a deep sigh; "all men
 are agreed concerning truth when demonstrated, but they are too much
 divided about latent truths."
 
 "If there were but one single hidden truth in your load of arguments,
 which have been so often sifted for such a number of ages, it would
 doubtless have been discovered, and the universe would certainly have
 been unanimous, at least, in that respect. If this truth had been as
 necessary as the sun is to the earth, it would have been as brilliant as
 that planet. It is an absurdity, an insult to human nature--it is an
 attack upon the Infinite and Supreme Being to say there is a truth
 essential to the happiness of man which God conceals."
 
 All that this ignorant youth, instructed only by nature, said, made a
 very deep impression upon the mind of the old unhappy scholiast.
 
 "Is it really certain," he cried, "that I should have made myself truly
 miserable for mere chimeras? I am much more certain of my misery than of
 effectual grace. I have spent my time in reasoning about the liberty of
 God and human nature, but I have lost my own. Neither St. Augustine nor
 St. Prosner will extricate me from my present misfortunes."
 
 The ingenuous Huron, who gave way to his natural instincts, at length
 said:
 
 "Will you give me leave to speak to you boldly and frankly? Those who
 bring upon themselves persecution for such idle disputes seem to me to
 have very little sense; those who persecute, appear to me very
 monsters."
 
 The two captives entirely coincided with respect to the injustice of
 their captivity.
 
 "I am a hundred times more to be pitied than you," said the Huron; "I am
 born free as the air: I had two lives, liberty and the object of my
 love; and I am deprived of both. We are both in fetters, without
 knowing who put them on us, or without being able to enquire. It is said
 that the Hurons are barbarians, because they avenge themselves on their
 enemies; but they never oppress their friends. I had scarce set foot in
 France, before I shed my blood for this country. I have, perhaps,
 preserved a whole province, and my recompense is imprisonment. In this
 country men are condemned without being heard. This is not the case in
 England. Alas! it was not against the English that I should have
 fought."
 
 Thus his growing philosophy could not brook nature being insulted in the
 first of her rights, and he gave vent to his just indignation.
 
 His companion did not contradict him. Absence ever increases ungratified
 love, and philosophy does not diminish it. He as frequently spoke of his
 dear Miss St. Yves, as he did of morality or metaphysics. The more he
 purified his sentiments, the more he loved. He read some new romances;
 but he met with few that depicted to him the real state of his soul. He
 felt that his heart stretched beyond the bounds of his author.
 
 "Alas!" said he, "almost all these writers have nothing but wit and
 art."
 
 At length, the good Jansenist priest became, insensibly, the confident
 of his tenderness. He was already acquainted with love as a sin with
 which a penitent accuses himself at confession. He now learned to know
 it as a sentiment equally noble and tender; which can elevate the soul
 as well as soften it, and can at times produce virtues. In fine, for the
 last miracle, a Huron converted a Jansenist.
 
 
 
 
 XV.
 
 THE BEAUTIFUL MISS ST. YVES VISITS M. DE ST. POUANGE.
 
 
 The charming Miss St. Yves, still more afflicted than her lover, waited
 accordingly upon M. de St. Pouange, accompanied by her friend with whom
 she lodged, each having their faces covered with their hoods. The first
 thing she saw at the door was the Abbé St. Yves, her brother coming out.
 She was terrified, but her friend supported her spirits.
 
 "For the very reason," said she, "that people have been speaking
 against you, speak to him for yourself. You may he assured, that the
 accusers in this part of the world are always in the right, unless they
 are immediately detected. Besides, your presence will have greater
 effect, or else I am much mistaken, than the words of your brother."
 
 Ever so little encouragement to a passionate lover makes her intrepid.
 Miss St. Yves appears at the audience. Her youth, her charms, her
 languishing eyes, moistened with some involuntary tears, attract every
 one's attention. Every sycophant to the deputy minister forgot for an
 instant the idol of power to contemplate that of beauty. St. Pouange
 conducted her into a closet. She spoke with an affecting grace. St.
 Pouange felt some emotion. She trembled, but he told her not to be
 afraid.
 
 "Return to-night," said he; "your business requires some reflection, and
 it must be discussed at leisure. There are too many people here at
 present. Audiences are rapidly dispatched. I must get to the bottom of
 all that concerns you."
 
 He then paid her some compliments upon her beauty and address, and
 advised her to come at seven in the evening.
 
 She did not fail attending at the hour appointed, and her pious friend
 again accompanied her; but she remained in the hall, where she read the
 _Christian Pedagogue_, whilst St. Pouange and the beauteous Miss St.
 Yves were in the back closet. He began by saying:
 
 "Would you believe it, Miss, that your brother has been to request me to
 grant him a _lettre de cachet_ against you; but, indeed, I would sooner
 grant one to send him back to Lower Britany."
 
 "Alas! sir," said she, "_lettres de cachet_ are granted very liberally
 in your offices, since people come from the extremity of the kingdom to
 solicit them like pensions. I am very far from requesting one against my
 brother, yet I have much reason to complain of him. But I respect the
 liberty of mankind; and, therefore, supplicate for that of a man whom I
 want to make my husband; of a man to whom the king is indebted for the
 preservation of a province; who can beneficially serve him; and who is
 the son of an officer killed in his service. Of what is he accused? How
 could he be treated so cruelly without being heard?"
 
 The deputy minister then showed her the letter of the spy Jesuit, and
 that of the perfidious bailiff.
 
 "What!" said she with astonishment, "are there such monsters upon earth?
 and would they force me to marry the stupid son of a ridiculous, wicked
 man? and is it upon such evidence that the fate of citizens is
 determined?"
 
 She threw herself upon her knees, and with a flood of tears solicited
 the freedom of a brave man who adored her. Her charms appeared to the
 greatest advantage in such a situation. She was so beautiful, that St.
 Pouange, bereft of all shame, used words with some reserve, which
 brought on others less delicate, which were succeeded by those still
 more expressive. The revocation of the _lettre de cachet_ was proposed,
 and he at length went so far as to state the only means of obtaining the
 liberty of the man whose interest she had so violently and
 affectionately at heart.
 
 This uncommon conversation continued for a long time. The devotee in the
 anti-chamber, in reading her _Christian Pedagogue_, said to herself:
 
 "My Lord St. Pouange never before gave so long an audience. Perhaps he
 has refused every thing to this poor girl, and she is still entreating
 him."
 
 At length her companion came out of the closet in the greatest
 confusion, without being able to speak. She was lost in deep meditation
 upon the character of the great and the half great, who so slightly
 sacrifice the liberty of men and the honor of women.
 
 She did not utter a syllable all the way back. But having returned to
 her friend's, she burst out, and told all that had happened. Her pious
 friend made frequent signs of the cross.
 
 "My dear friend," said she, "you must consult to-morrow Father
 _Tout-à-tous_, our director. He has much influence over M. de St.
 Pouange. He is confessor of many of the female servants of the house. He
 is a pious accommodating man, who has also the direction of some women
 of fashion. Yield to him; this is my way; and I always found myself
 right. We weak women stand in need of a man to lead us: and so, my dear
 friend, I'll go to-morrow in search of Father _Tout-à-tous_."
 
 
 
 
 XVI.
 
 MISS ST. YVES CONSULTS A JESUIT.
 
 
 No sooner was the beautiful and disconsolate Miss St. Yves with her holy
 confessor, than she told him, "that a powerful, voluptuous man, had
 proposed to her to set at liberty the man whom she intended making her
 lawful husband, and that he required a great price for his service; that
 she held such infidelity in the highest detestation; and that if her
 life only had been required, she would much sooner have sacrificed it
 than to have submitted."
 
 "This is a most abominable sinner," said Father _Tout-à-tous_, "You
 should tell me the name of this vile man. He must certainly be some
 Jansenist. I will inform against him to his Reverence, Father de la
 Chaise, who will place him in the situation of your dear beloved
 intended bridegroom."
 
 The poor girl, after much hesitation and embarrassment, at length
 mentioned St. Pouange.
 
 "My Lord St. Pouange!" cried the Jesuit, "Ah! my child, the case is
 quite different. He is cousin to the greatest minister we have ever had;
 a man of worth, a protector of the good cause, a good Christian. He
 could not entertain such a thought. You certainly must have
 misunderstood him."
 
 "Oh! Father, I did but understand him too well. I am lost on which ever
 side I turn. The only alternative I have to choose is misery or shame;
 either my lover must be buried alive, or I must make myself unworthy of
 living. I cannot let him perish, nor can I save him."
 
 Father _Tout-à-tous_ endeavored to console her with these gentle
 expressions:
 
 "In the _first place_, my child, never use the word lover. It intimates
 something worldly, which may offend God. Say my husband. You consider
 him as such, and nothing can be more decent.
 
 "_Secondly_: Though he be ideally your husband, and you are in hopes he
 will be such eventually, yet he is not so in reality, consequently, you
 are still free and the mistress of your own conduct.
 
 [Illustration: Father Tout-à-tous.]
 
 "_Thirdly_: Actions are not maliciously culpable, when the intention is
 virtuous; and nothing can be more virtuous than to procure your husband
 his liberty.
 
 "_Fourthly_: You have examples in holy antiquity, that miraculously
 serve you for a guide. St. Augustin relates, that under the proconsulate
 of Septimius Acyndius, in the thirty-fourth year of our salvation, a
 poor man could not pay unto Cæsar what belonged to Cæsar, and was justly
 condemned to die, notwithstanding the maxim, 'Where there is nothing,
 the king must lose his right.' The object in question was a pound of
 gold. The culprit had a wife in whom God had united beauty and prudence.
 
 "You may assure yourself, my child, that when a Jesuit quotes St.
 Augustin, that saint must certainly have been in the right. I advise you
 to nothing. You are prudent, and it is to be presumed that you will do
 your husband a service. My Lord St. Pouange is an honest man. He will
 not deceive you. This is all I can say. I will pray to God for you, and
 I hope every thing will take place for his glory."
 
 The beautiful Miss St. Yves, who was no less terrified with the Jesuit's
 discourse than with the proposals of the deputy minister, returned in
 despair to her friend. She was tempted to deliver herself by death from
 the horror of her situation.
 
 
 
 
 XVII.
 
 THE JESUIT TRIUMPHS.
 
 
 The unfortunate Miss St. Yves entreated her friend to kill her; but this
 lady, who was fully as indulgent as the Jesuit, spoke to her still more
 clearly.
 
 "Alas!" said she, "at this agreeable, gallant, and famous court,
 business is always thus transacted. The most considerable, as well as
 the most indifferent places are seldom given away without a
 consideration. The dignities of war are solicited by the queen of love,
 and, without regard to merit, a place is often given to him who has the
 handsomest advocate.
 
 "You are in a situation that is extremely critical. The object is to
 restore your lover to liberty, and to marry him. It is a sacred duty
 that you are to fulfill. The world will applaud you. It will be said,
 that you only allowed yourself to be guilty of a weakness, through an
 excess of virtue."
 
 "Heavens!" cried Miss St. Yves, "What kind of virtue is this? What a
 labyrinth of distress! What a world! What men to become acquainted with!
 A Father de la Chaise and a ridiculous bailiff imprison my lover; I am
 persecuted by my family; assistance is offered me, only that I may be
 dishonored! A Jesuit has ruined a brave man, another Jesuit wants to
 ruin me. On every side snares are laid for me, and I am upon the very
 brink of destruction! I must even speak to the king; I will throw myself
 at his feet as he goes to mass or to the theatre."
 
 "His attendants will not let you approach," said her good friend; "and
 if you should be so unfortunate as to speak to him, M. de Louvois, or
 the Reverend Father de la Chaise, might bury you in a convent for the
 rest of your days."
 
 Whilst this generous friend thus increased the perplexities of Miss St.
 Yves's tortured soul, and plunged the dagger deeper in her heart, a
 messenger arrived from M. de St. Pouange with a letter, and two fine
 pendant earrings. Miss St. Yves, with tears, refused to accept of any
 part of the contents of the packet; but her friend took the charge of
 them upon herself.
 
 As soon as the messenger had gone, the _confidante_ read the letter, in
 which a _petit-souper_ (a little supper) was proposed to the two friends
 for that night. Miss St. Yves protested she would not go, whilst her
 pious friend endeavored to make her try on the diamond earrings; but
 Miss St. Yves could not endure them, and opposed it all the day long;
 being entirely wrapped up in the contemplation of her lover's
 imprisonment. At length, after a long resistance--after sighs, moans,
 and torrents of tears--driven by excitement almost to the verge of
 insanity--weakened with the conflict, overwhelmed and irresolute, the
 innocent victim, not knowing whether she was going, was dragged by this
 artful woman to the fatal supper of the "good Christian and protector of
 the good cause," M. de St. Pouange.

 XVIII.
 
 MISS ST. YVES DELIVERS HER LOVER AND A JANSENIST.
 
 
 At day-break she fled to Paris with the minister's mandate. It would be
 difficult to depict the agitation of her mind in this journey. Imagine a
 virtuous and noble soul, humbled by its own reproaches, intoxicated with
 tenderness, distracted with the remorse of having betrayed her lover,
 and elated with the pleasure of releasing the object of her adoration.
 Her torments and conflicts by turns engaged her reflections. She was no
 longer that innocent girl whose ideas were confined to a provincial
 education. Love and misfortunes had united to remould her. Sentiment had
 made as rapid a progress in her mind, as reason had in that of her
 lover.
 
 Her dress was dictated by the greatest simplicity. She viewed with
 horror the trappings with which she had appeared before her fatal
 benefactor. Her companion had taken the earrings without her having
 looked at them. Anxious and confused, idolizing the Huron and detesting
 herself, she at length arrived at the gate of that dreadful castle--the
 palace of vengeance--where crimes and innocence are alike immured.
 
 When she was upon the point of getting out of the coach her strength
 failed her. Some people came to her assistance. She entered, whilst her
 heart was in the greatest palpitation, her eyes streaming, and her whole
 frame bespoke the greatest consternation. She was presented to the
 governor. He was going to speak to her, but she had lost all power of
 expression: she showed her order, whilst, with great difficulty, she
 articulated some accents. The governor entertained a great esteem for
 his prisoner, and he was greatly pleased at his being released. His
 heart was not callous, like those of most of his brethren, who think of
 nothing but the fees their captives are to pay them; extort their
 revenues from their victims; and living by the misery of others,
 conceive a horrid joy at the lamentations of the unfortunate.
 
 He sent for the prisoner into his apartment. The two lovers swooned at
 the sight of each other. The beautiful Miss St. Yves remained for a long
 time motionless, without any symptoms of life; the other soon recalled
 his fortitude.
 
 "This lady," said the governor, "is probably your wife. You did not tell
 me you were married. I am informed that it is through her generous
 solicitude that you have obtained your liberty."
 
 "Alas!" said the beautiful Miss St. Yves, in a faltering voice, "I am
 not worthy of being his wife;" and swooned again.
 
 When she recovered her senses, she presented, with a trembling hand and
 averted eyes, the grant and written promise of a company.
 
 The Huron, equally astonished and affected, awoke from one dream to fall
 into another.
 
 "Why was I shut up here? How could you deliver me? Where are the
 monsters that immured me? You are a divinity sent from heaven to succor
 me."
 
 The beautiful Miss St. Yves, with a dejected air, looked at her lover,
 blushed, and instantly turned away her streaming eyes. In a word, they
 told him all she knew, and all she had undergone, except what she was
 willing to conceal forever, but which any other than the Huron, more
 accustomed to the world and better acquainted with the customs of
 courts, would easily have guessed.
 
 "Is it possible," said he, "that a wretch like the bailiff can have
 deprived me of my liberty?
 
 "Alas! I find that men, like the vilest of animals, can all injure.
 
 "But is it possible that a monk, a Jesuit, the king's confessor, should
 have contributed to my misfortunes as much as the bailiff, without my
 being able to imagine under what pretence this detestable knave has
 persecuted me? Did he make me pass for a Jansenist? In fine, how came
 you to remember me? I did not deserve it; I was then only a savage.
 
 "What! could you, without advice, without assistance, undertake a
 journey to Versailles?
 
 "You there appeared, and my fetters were broken!
 
 "There must then be in beauty and virtue an invincible charm, that opens
 gates of adamant and softens hearts of steel."
 
 At the word virtue, a flood of tears issued from the eyes of the
 beautiful Miss St. Yves. She did not know how far she had been virtuous
 in the crime with which she reproached herself.
 
 Her lover thus continued:
 
 "Thou angel, who hast broken my chains, if thou hast had sufficient
 influence (which I cannot yet comprehend) to obtain justice for me,
 obtain it likewise for an old man who first taught me to think, as thou
 didst to love. Misfortunes have united us; I love him as a father; I can
 neither live without thee nor him."
 
 "I solicit?"
 
 "The same man."
 
 "Who!"
 
 "Yes, I will be beholden to you for everything, and I will owe nothing
 to any one but yourself. Write to this man in power. Overwhelm me with
 kindness--complete what you have begun--perfect your miracle."
 
 She was sensible she ought to do everything her lover desired. She
 wanted to write, but her hand refused its office. She began her letter
 three times, and tore it as often. At length she got to the end, and the
 two lovers left the prison, after having embraced the old martyr to
 efficacious grace.
 
 The happy yet disconsolate Miss St. Yves knew where her brother lodged:
 thither she repaired; and her lover took an apartment at the same house.
 
 They had scarce reached their lodging, before her protector sent the
 order for releasing the good old Gordon, at the same time making an
 appointment with her for the next day.
 
 She gave the order of release to her lover, and refused the appointment
 of a benefactor whom she could no more see without expiring with shame
 and grief.
 
 Her lover would not have left her upon any other errand than to release
 his friend. He flew to the place of his confinement and fulfilled this
 duty, reflecting, meanwhile, upon the strange vicissitudes of this
 world, and admiring the courageous virtue of a young lady, to whom two
 unfortunate men owed more than life.
 
 
 
 
 XIX.
 
 THE HURON, THE BEAUTIFUL MISS ST. YVES, AND THEIR RELATIONS, ARE
 CONVENED.
 
 
 The generous and respectable, but injured girl, was with her brother the
 Abbé de St. Yves, the good Prior of the Mountain, and Lady de Kerkabon.
 They were equally astonished, but their situations and sentiments were
 very different. The Abbé de St. Yves was expiating the wrongs he had
 done his sister at her feet, and she pardoned him. The prior and his
 sympathizing sister likewise wept, but it was for joy. The filthy
 bailiff and his insupportable son did not trouble this affecting scene.
 They had set out upon the first report that their antagonist had been
 released. They flew to bury in their own province their folly and fear.
 
 The four _dramatis personæ_, variously agitated, were waiting for the
 return of the young man who had gone to deliver his friend. The Abbé de
 St. Yves did not dare to raise his eyes to meet those of his sister. The
 good Kerkabon said:
 
 "I shall then see once more my dear nephew."
 
 "You will see him again," said the charming Miss St. Yves, "but he is no
 longer the same man. His behavior, his manners, his ideas, his sense,
 have all undergone a complete mutation. He has become as respectable, as
 he was before ignorant and strange to everything. He will be the honor
 and consolation of your family; would to heaven that I might also be the
 honor of mine!"
 
 "What, are you not the same as you were?" said the prior. "What then has
 happened to work so great a change?"
 
 During this conversation the Huron returned in company with the
 Jansenist. The scene was now changed, and became more interesting. It
 began by the uncle and aunt's tender embraces. The Abbé de St. Yves
 almost kissed the knees of the ingenuous Huron, who, by the by, was no
 longer ingenuous. The language of the eyes formed all the discourse of
 the two lovers, who, nevertheless, expressed every sentiment with which
 they were penetrated. Satisfaction and acknowledgment sparkled in the
 countenance of the one, whilst embarrassment was depicted in Miss St.
 Yves's melting but half averted eyes. Every one was astonished that she
 should mingle grief with so much joy.
 
 The venerable Gordon soon endeared himself to the whole family. He had
 been unhappy with the young prisoner, and this was a sufficient title to
 their esteem. He owed his deliverance to the two lovers, and this alone
 reconciled him to love. The acrimony of his former sentiments was
 dismissed from his heart--he was converted by gratitude, as well as the
 Huron. Every one related his adventures before supper. The two Abbés and
 the aunt listened like children to the relation of stories of ghosts,
 and both were deeply interested.
 
 "Alas!" said Gordon, "there are perhaps upwards of five hundred virtuous
 people in the same fetters as Miss St. Yves has broken. Their
 misfortunes are unheeded. Many hands are found to strike the unhappy
 multitude,--how seldom one to succor them."
 
 This very just reflection increased his sensibility and gratitude.
 Everything heightened the triumph of the beautiful Miss St. Yves. The
 grandeur and intrepidity of her soul were the subject of each one's
 admiration. This admiration was blended with that respect which we feel
 in spite of ourselves for a person who we think has some influence at
 court. But the Abbé de St. Yves enquired:
 
 "What could my sister do to obtain this influence so soon?"
 
 Supper being ready, every one was already seated, when, lo! the worthy
 _confidante_ of Versailles arrived, without being acquainted with
 anything that had passed. She was in a coach and six, and it was easily
 seen to whom the equipage belonged. She entered with that air of
 authority assumed by people in power who have a great deal of
 business--saluted the company with much indifference, and, pulling the
 beautiful Miss St. Yves on one side, said:
 
 "Why do you make people wait so long? Follow me. There are the diamonds
 you forgot."
 
 However softly she uttered these expressions, the Huron, nevertheless,
 overheard them. He saw the diamonds. The brother was speechless. The
 uncle and aunt exhibited the surprise of good people, who had never
 before beheld such magnificence. The young man, whose mind was now
 formed by an experience of twelve months, could not help making some
 reflections against his will, and was for a moment in anxiety. His
 mistress perceived it, and a mortal paleness spread itself over her
 countenance; a tremor seized her, and it was with difficulty she could
 support herself.
 
 "Ah! madam," said she to her fatal friend, "you have ruined me--you have
 given me the mortal blow."
 
 These words pierced the heart of the Huron: but he had already learned
 to possess himself. He did not dwell upon them, lest he should make his
 mistress uneasy before her brother, but turned pale as well as she.
 
 Miss St. Yves, distracted with the change she perceived in her lover's
 countenance, pulled the woman out of the room into the passage, and
 there threw the jewels at her feet, saying:
 
 "Alas! these were not my seducers, as you well know: but he that gave
 them shall never set eyes on me again."
 
 Her friend took them up, whilst Miss St. Yves added:
 
 "He may either take them again, or give them to you. Begone, and do not
 make me still more odious to myself."
 
 The ambassadress at length departed, not being able to comprehend the
 remorse to which she had been witness.
 
 The beautiful Miss St. Yves, greatly oppressed and feeling a revolution
 in her body that almost suffocated her, was compelled to go to bed; but
 that she might not alarm any one she kept her pains and sufferings to
 herself: and under pretence of only being weary, she asked leave to take
 a little rest. This, however, she did not do till she had reanimated the
 company with consolatory and flattering expressions, and cast such a
 kind look upon her lover as darted fire into his soul.
 
 The supper, of which she did not partake, was in the beginning gloomy;
 but this gloominess was of that interesting kind which inspires
 reflection and useful conversation, so superior to that frivolous
 excitement commonly exhibited, and which is usually nothing more than a
 troublesome noise.
 
 Gordon, in a few words, gave the history of Jansenism and Molinism; of
 those persecutions with which one party hampered the other; and of the
 obstinacy of both. The Huron entered into a criticism thereupon, pitying
 those men who, not satisfied with all the confusion occasioned by these
 opposite interests, create evils by imaginary interests and
 unintelligible absurdities. Gordon related--the other judged. The guests
 listened with emotion, and gained new lights. The duration of
 misfortunes, and the shortness of life, then became the topics. It was
 remarked that all professions have peculiar vices and dangers annexed to
 them; and that from the prince down to the lowest beggar, all seemed
 alike to accuse providence. How happens it that so many men, for so
 little, perform the office of persecutors, sergeants, and executioners,
 to others? With what inhuman indifference does a man in authority sign
 papers for the destruction of a family; and with what joy, still more
 barbarous, do mercenaries execute them.
 
 "I saw in my youth," said the good old Gordon, "a relation of the
 Marshal de Marillic, who, being prosecuted in his own province on
 account of that illustrious but unfortunate man, concealed himself under
 a borrowed name in Paris. He was an old man near seventy-two years of
 age. His wife, who accompanied him, was nearly of the same age. They had
 a libertine son, who at fourteen years of age absconded from his
 father's house, turned soldier, and deserted. He had gone through every
 gradation of debauchery and misery; at length, having changed his name,
 he was in the guards of Cardinal Richelieu, (for this priest, as well as
 Mazarine, had guards) and had obtained an exempt's staff in their
 company of sergeants.
 
 "This adventurer was appointed to arrest the old man and his wife, and
 acquitted himself with all the obduracy of a man who was willing to
 please his master. As he was conducting them, he heard these two victims
 deplore the long succession of miseries which had befallen them from
 their cradle. This aged couple reckoned as one of their greatest
 misfortunes the wildness and loss of their son. He recollected them, but
 he nevertheless led them to prison; assuring them, that his Reverence
 was to be served in preference to every body else. His Eminence rewarded
 his zeal.
 
 "I have seen a spy of Father de la Chaise betray his own brother, in
 hopes of a little benefice, which he did not obtain; and I saw him die,
 not of remorse, but of grief at having been cheated by the Jesuit.
 
 "The vocation of a confessor, which I for a long while exercised, made
 me acquainted with the secrets of families. I have known very few, who,
 though immersed in the greatest distress, did not externally wear the
 mask of felicity and every appearance of joy; and I have always observed
 that great grief was the fruit of our unconstrained desires."
 
 "For my part," said the Huron, "I imagine, that a noble, grateful,
 sensible man, may always be happy; and I hope to enjoy an uncheckered
 felicity with the charming, generous Miss St. Yves. For I flatter
 myself," added he, in addressing himself to her brother with a friendly
 smile, "that you will not now refuse me as you did last year: besides, I
 shall pursue a more decent method."
 
 The Abbé was confounded in apologies for the past, and in protesting an
 eternal attachment.
 
 Uncle Kerkabon said this would be the most glorious day of his whole
 life. His good aunt Kerkabon, in ecstasies of joy, cried out:
 
 "I always said you would never be a sub-deacon. This sacrament is
 preferable to the other; would to God I had been honored with it! but I
 will serve you for a mother."
 
 And now all vied with each other in applauding the gentle Miss St. Yves.
 
 Her lover's heart was too full of what she had done for him, and he
 loved her too much, for the affair of the jewels to make any permanent
 impression on him. But those words, which he too well heard, "_you have
 given me the mortal blow_", still secretly terrified him, and
 interrupted all his joy; whilst the eulogiums paid his beautiful
 mistress still increased his love. In a word, nothing was thought of but
 her,--nothing was mentioned but the happiness those two lovers deserved.
 A plan was agitated to live altogether at Paris, and schemes of grandeur
 and fortune were formed. These hopes, which the smallest ray of
 happiness engenders, were predominant. But the Huron felt, in the secret
 recesses of his heart, a sentiment that exploded the illusion. He read
 over the promises signed by St. Pouange, and the commission signed
 Louvois. These men were painted to him such as they were, or such as
 they were thought to be. Every one spoke of the ministers and
 administration with the freedom of convivial conversation, which is
 considered in France as the most precious liberty to be obtained on
 earth.
 
 "If I were king of France," said the Huron, "this is the kind of
 minister that I would choose for the war department. I would have a man
 of the highest birth, as he is to give orders to the nobility. I would
 require that he should himself have been an officer, and have passed
 through the various gradations; or, at least, that he had attained the
 rank of Lieutenant General, and was worthy of being a Marshal of France.
 For, to be acquainted with the details of the service, is it not
 necessary that he himself should have served? and will not officers
 obey, with a hundred times more alacrity, a military man, who like
 themselves has been signalized by his courage, rather than a mere man of
 the cabinet, who, whatever natural ability he may possess, can, at most,
 only guess at the operations of a campaign? I should not be displeased
 at my minister's generosity, even though it might sometimes embarrass a
 little the keeper of the royal treasure. I should desire him to have a
 facility in business, and that he should distinguish himself by that
 kind of gaiety of mind, which is the lot of men superior to business,
 which is so agreeable to the nation, and which renders the performance
 of every duty less irksome."
 
 This is the character he would have chosen for a minister, as he had
 constantly observed that such an amiable disposition is incompatible
 with cruelty.
 
 Monsieur de Louvois would not, perhaps, have been satisfied with the
 Huron's wishes. His merit lay in a different walk. But whilst they were
 still at table, the disorder of the unhappy Miss St. Yves took a fatal
 turn. Her blood was on fire,--the symptoms of a malignant fever had
 appeared. She suffered, but did not complain, being unwilling to disturb
 the pleasure of the guests.
 
 Her brother, thinking that she was not asleep, went to the foot of her
 bed. He was astonished at the condition he found her in. Every body flew
 to her. Her lover appeared next to her brother. He was certainly the
 most alarmed, and the most affected of any one; but he had learned to
 unite discretion to all the happy gifts nature had bestowed upon him,
 and a quick sensibility of decorum began to prevail over him.
 
 A neighboring physician was immediately sent for. He was one of those
 itinerant doctors who confound the last disorder they were consulted
 upon with the present;--who follow a blind practice in a science from
 which the most mature investigations and careful observations do not
 preclude uncertainty and danger. He greatly increased the disorder by
 prescribing a fashionable nostrum. Can fashion extend to medicine? This
 frenzy was then too prevalent in Paris.
 
 The grief of Miss St. Yves contributed still more than her physician to
 render her disorder fatal. Her body suffered martyrdom in the torments
 of her mind. The crowd of thoughts which agitated her breast,
 communicated to her veins a more dangerous poison than that of the most
 burning fever.
 
 
 
 
 XX.
 
 THE DEATH OF THE BEAUTIFUL MISS ST. YVES, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.
 
 
 Another physician was called in. But, instead of assisting nature and
 leaving it to act in a young person whose organs recalled the vital
 stream, he applied himself solely to counteract the effects of his
 brother's prescription. The disorder, in two days, became mortal. The
 brain, which is thought to be the seat of the mind, was as violently
 affected as the heart, which, we are told, is the seat of the passions.
 By what incomprehensible mechanism are our organs held in subjection to
 sentiment and thought? How is it that a single melancholy idea shall
 disturb the whole course of the blood; and that the blood should in turn
 communicate irregularities to the human understanding? What is that
 unknown fluid which certainly exists and which, quicker and more active
 than light, flies in less than the twinkling of an eye into all the
 channels of life,--produces sensations, memory, joy or grief, reason or
 frenzy,--recalls with horror what we would choose to forget; and renders
 a thinking animal, either a subject of admiration, or an object of pity
 and compassion?
 
 These were the reflections of the good old Gordon; and these
 observations, so natural, which men seldom make, did not prevent his
 feeling upon this occasion; for he was not of the number of those gloomy
 philosophers who pique themselves upon being insensible.
 
 He was affected at the fate of this young woman, like a father who sees
 his dear child yielding to a slow death. The Abbé de St. Yves was
 desperate; the prior and his sister shed floods of tears; but who could
 describe the situation of her lover? All expression falls far short of
 the intensity of his affliction.
 
 His aunt, almost lifeless, supported the head of the departing fair in
 her feeble arms; her brother was upon his knees at the foot of the bed;
 her lover squeezed her hand, which he bathed in tears; his groans rent
 the air, whilst he called her his guardian angel, his life, his hope,
 his better half, his mistress, his wife. At the word wife, a sigh
 escaped her, whilst she looked upon him with inexpressible tenderness,
 and then abruptly gave a horrid scream. Presently in one of those
 intervals when grief, the oppression of the senses, and pain subside and
 leave the soul its liberty and powers, she cried out:
 
 "I your wife? Ah! dear lover, this name, this happiness, this felicity,
 were not destined for me! I die, and I deserve it. O idol of my heart! O
 you, whom I sacrificed to infernal demons--it is done--I am
 punished--live and be happy!"
 
 These tender but dreadful expressions were incomprehensible; yet they
 melted and terrified every heart. She had the courage to explain
 herself, and her auditors quaked with astonishment, grief, and pity.
 They with one voice detested the man in power, who repaired a shocking
 act of injustice only by his crimes, and who had forced the most amiable
 innocence to be his accomplice.
 
 "Who? you guilty?" said her lover, "no, you are not. Guilt can only be
 in the heart;--yours is devoted solely to virtue and to me."
 
 This opinion he corroborated by such expressions as seemed to recall the
 beautiful Miss St. Yves back to life. She felt some consolation from
 them and was astonished at being still beloved. The aged Gordon would
 have condemned her at the time he was only a Jansenist; but having
 attained wisdom, he esteemed her, and wept.
 
 In the midst of these lamentations and fears, whilst the dangerous
 situation of this worthy girl engrossed every breast, and all were in
 the greatest consternation, a courier arrived from court.
 
 "A courier? from whom, and upon what account?"
 
 He was sent by the king's confessor to the Prior of the Mountain. It was
 not Father de la Chaise who wrote, but brother Vadbled, his valet de
 chambre, a man of great consequence at that time, who acquainted the
 archbishops with the reverend Father's pleasure, who gave audiences,
 promised benefices, and sometimes issued _lettres de cachet_.
 
 He wrote to the Abbé of the Mountain, "that his reverence had been
 informed of his nephew's exploits: that his being sent to prison was
 through mistake; that such little accidents frequently happened, and
 should therefore not be attended to; and, in fine, it behoved him, the
 prior, to come and present his nephew the next day: that he was to bring
 with him that good man Gordon; and that he, brother Vadbled, should
 introduce them to his reverence and M. de Louvois, who would say a word
 to them in his anti-chamber."
 
 To which he added, "that the history of the Huron, and his combat
 against the English, had been related to the king; that doubtless the
 king would deign to take notice of him in passing through the gallery,
 and perhaps he might even nod his head to him."
 
 The letter concluded by flattering him with hopes that all the ladies of
 the court would show their eagerness to recognize his nephew; and that
 several among them would say to him, "Good day, Mr. Huron;" and that he
 would certainly be talked of at the king's supper.
 
 The letter was signed, "Your affectionate brother Jesuit, Vadbled."
 
 The prior having read the letter aloud, his furious nephew for an
 instant suppressed his rage, and said nothing to the bearer: but turning
 toward the companion of his misfortunes, asked him, what he thought of
 that communication? Gordon replied:
 
 "This, then, is the way that men are treated! They are first beaten and
 then, like monkeys, they dance."
 
 The Huron resuming his character, which always returned in the great
 emotions of his soul, tore the letter to bits, and threw them in the
 courier's face:
 
 "There is my answer," said he.
 
 [Illustration: Death of Miss St. Ives.--"When the fatal moment came, all
 around her most feelingly expressed their grief by incessant tears and
 lamentations. The Huron was senseless. Great souls feel more violent
 sensations than those of less tender dispositions."]
 
 His uncle was in terror, and fancied he saw thunderbolts, and twenty
 _lettres de cachet_ at once fall upon him. He immediately wrote the best
 excuse he could for these transports of passion in a young man, which he
 considered as the ebullition of a great soul.
 
 But a solicitude of a more melancholy stamp now seized every heart. The
 beautiful and unfortunate Miss St. Yves was already sensible of her
 approaching end; she was serene, but it was that kind of shocking
 serenity, the result of exhausted nature being no longer able to
 withstand the conflict.
 
 "Oh, my dear lover!" said she, in a faltering voice, "death punishes me
 for my weakness; but I expire with the consolation of knowing you are
 free. I adored you whilst I betrayed you, and I adore you in bidding you
 an eternal adieu."
 
 She did not make a parade of a ridiculous fortitude; she did not
 understand that miserable glory of having some of her neighbors say,
 "she died with courage." Who, at twenty, can be at once torn from her
 lover, from life, and what is called honor, without regret, without some
 pangs? She felt all the horror of her situation, and made it felt by
 those expiring looks and accents which speak with so much energy. In a
 word, she shed tears like other people at those intervals that she was
 capable of giving vent to them.
 
 Let others strive to celebrate the pompous deaths of those who
 insensibly rush into destruction. This is the lot of all animals. We die
 like them only when age or disorders make us resemble them by the
 paralysis of our organs. Whoever suffers a great loss must feel great
 regrets. If they are stifled, it is nothing but vanity that is pursued,
 even in the arms of death.
 
 When the fatal moment came, all around her most feelingly expressed
 their grief by incessant tears and lamentations. The Huron was
 senseless. Great souls feel more violent sensations than those of less
 tender dispositions. The good old Gordon knew enough of his companion to
 dread that when he came to himself he would be guilty of suicide. All
 kinds of arms were put out of his way, which the unfortunate young man
 perceived. He said to his relations and Gordon, without shedding any
 tears, without a groan, or the least emotion:
 
 "Do you then think that any one upon earth hath the right and power to
 prevent my putting an end to my life?"
 
 Gordon took care to avoid making a parade of those commonplace
 declamations and arguments which are relied on to prove that we are not
 allowed to exercise our liberty in ceasing to be when we are in a
 wretched situation; that we should not leave the house when we can no
 longer remain in it; that a man is like a soldier at his post; as if it
 signified to the Being of beings whether the conjunction of the
 particles of matter were in one spot or another. Impotent reasons, to
 which a firm and concentrated despair disdains to listen, and to which
 Cato replied only with the use of a poniard.
 
 The Huron's sullen and dreadful silence, his doleful aspect, his
 trembling lips, and the shivering of his whole frame, communicated to
 every spectator's soul that mixture of compassion and terror, which
 fetters all our powers, precludes discourse, or compels us to speak only
 in faltering accents. The hostess and her family were excited. They
 trembled to behold the state of his desperation, yet all kept their eyes
 upon him, and attended to all his motions. The ice-cold corpse of the
 beautiful Miss St. Yves had already been carried into a lower hall out
 of the sight of her lover, who seemed still in search of it, though
 incapable of observing any object.
 
 In the midst of this spectacle of death, whilst the dead body was
 exposed at the door of the house; whilst two priests by the side of the
 holy water-pot were repeating prayers with an air of distraction; whilst
 some passengers, through idleness, sprinkled the bier with some drops of
 holy water, and others went their ways quite indifferent; whilst her
 relations were drowned in tears, and every one thought the lover would
 not survive his loss;--in this situation St. Pouange arrived with his
 female Versailles friend.
 
 He alighted from his coach; and the first object that presented itself
 was a bier: he turned away his eyes with that simple distaste of a man
 bred up in pleasures, and who thinks he should avoid a spectacle which
 might recall him to the contemplation of human misery. He is inclined to
 go up stairs, whilst his female friend enquires through curiosity whose
 funeral it is. The name of Miss St. Yves is pronounced. At this name she
 turned, and gave a piercing shriek. St. Pouange now returns, whilst
 surprise and grief possess his soul. The good old Gordon stood with
 streaming eyes. He for a moment ceased his lamentations, to acquaint the
 courtier with all the circumstances of this melancholy catastrophe. He
 spoke with that authority which is the companion to sorrow and virtue.
 St. Pouange was not naturally wicked. The torrent of business and
 amusements had hurried away his soul, which was not yet acquainted with
 itself. He did not border upon that grey age which usually hardens the
 hearts of ministers. He listened to Gordon with a downcast look, and
 some tears escaped him, which he was surprised to shed. In a word, he
 repented.
 
 "I will," said he, "absolutely see this extraordinary man you have
 mentioned to me. He affects me almost as much as this innocent victim,
 whose death I have occasioned."
 
 Gordon followed him as far as the chamber in which the Prior Kerkabon,
 the Abbé St. Yves, and some neighbors, were striving to recall to life
 the young man, who had again fainted.
 
 "I have been the cause of your misfortunes," said the deputy minister,
 when the Huron had regained consciousness, "and my whole life shall be
 employed in making reparation for my error."
 
 The first idea that struck the Huron was to kill him and then destroy
 himself. But he was without arms, and closely watched. St. Pouange was
 not repulsed with refusals accompanied with reproach, contempt, and the
 insults he deserved, which were lavished upon him. Time softens
 everything. Mons. de Louvois at length succeeded in making an excellent
 officer of the Huron, who has appeared under another name at Paris and
 in the army, respected by all honest men, being at once a warrior and an
 intrepid philosopher.
 
 He never mentioned this adventure without being greatly affected, and
 yet his greatest consolation was to speak of it. He cherished the memory
 of his beloved Miss St. Yves to the last moment of his life.[1]
 
 The Abbé St. Yves and the Prior were each provided with good livings.
 The good Kerkabon rather chose to see his nephew invested with military
 honors than in the sub-deaconry. The devotee of Versailles kept the
 diamond earrings, and received besides a handsome present. Father
 _Tout-à-tous_ had presents of chocolate, coffee, and confectionery, with
 the _Meditations of the Reverend Father Croiset_, and the _Flower of the
 Saints_, bound in Morocco. Good old Gordon lived with the Huron till his
 death, in the most friendly intimacy: he had also a benefice, and
 forgot, forever, essential grace, and the concomitant concourse. He took
 for his motto, "Misfortunes are of some use." How many worthy people are
 there in the world who may justly say, "Misfortunes are good for
 nothing?"
 
 
 [1] In the Play, _Civilization_, the Huron musingly soliloquizes:
 
      "And what is love to man? An only gift
       Too precious to be idly thrown away!
       For is it not as precious as our land,
       Which, heeding not another's golden sky--
       Soft airs, sweet flowers, hill and dale conjoin'd
       By nature's cunning past comparison--
       Is still our land; and, as our land, surpasses
       Far such fairy worlds?
 
      "There are some dreams that last a life--mine
       Is one of these. I shall dream on till death
       Shall end the vision!
 
      "It is not hard to die! And life is but
       A shadow on the wall--a falling leaf
       Toy'd with by autumn winds--a flower--a star
       Among the infinite, infinitesimal!
       We are but breath whispering against the wind,--
       Sand in the desert!--dew upon the sea!"--E.
 
 
 
 
 
 MICROMEGAS:
 
 A SATIRE ON THE PHILOSOPHY, IGNORANCE. AND SELF-CONCEIT OF MANKIND.
 
 
 
 
 [Illustration: A medieval exploring vessel.][1]
 
 
 
 
 I.
 
 A VOYAGE TO THE PLANET SATURN, BY A NATIVE OF SIRIUS.
 
 
 In one of the planets that revolve round the star known by the name of
 Sirius, was a certain young gentleman of promising parts, whom I had the
 honor to be acquainted with in his last voyage to this our little
 ant-hill. His name was Micromegas, an appellation admirably suited to
 all great men, and his stature amounted to eight leagues in height, that
 is, twenty-four thousand geometrical paces of five feet each.
 
 Some of your mathematicians, a set of people always useful to the
 public, will, perhaps, instantly seize the pen, and calculate that Mr.
 Micromegas, inhabitant of the country of Sirius, being from head to foot
 four and twenty thousand paces in length, making one hundred and twenty
 thousand royal feet, that we, denizens of this earth, being at a medium
 little more than five feet high, and our globe nine thousand leagues in
 circumference: these things being premised, they will then conclude that
 the periphery of the globe which produced him must be exactly one and
 twenty millions six hundred thousand times greater than that of this our
 tiny ball. Nothing in nature is more simple and common. The dominions of
 some sovereigns of Germany or Italy, which may be compassed in half an
 hour, when compared with the empires of Ottoman, Russia, or China, are
 no other than faint instances of the prodigious difference that nature
 hath made in the scale of beings. The stature of his excellency being of
 these extraordinary dimensions, all our artists will agree that the
 measure around his body might amount to fifty thousand royal feet--a
 very agreeable and just proportion.
 
 His nose being equal in length to one-third of his face, and his jolly
 countenance engrossing one-seventh part of his height, it must be owned
 that the nose of this same Sirian was six thousand three hundred and
 thirty-three royal feet to a hair, which was to be demonstrated. With
 regard to his understanding, it is one of the best cultivated I have
 known. He is perfectly well acquainted with abundance of things, some of
 which are of his own invention; for, when his age did not exceed two
 hundred and fifty years, he studied, according to the custom of the
 country, at the most celebrated university of the whole planet, and by
 the force of his genius discovered upwards of fifty propositions of
 Euclid, having the advantage by more than eighteen of Blaise Pascal,
 who, (as we are told by his own sister,) demonstrated two and thirty for
 his amusement and then left off, choosing rather to be an indifferent
 philosopher than a great mathematician.
 
 About the four hundred and fiftieth year of his age, or latter end of
 his childhood, he dissected a great number of small insects not more
 than one hundred feet in diameter, which are not perceivable by ordinary
 microscopes, of which he composed a very curious treatise, which
 involved him in some trouble. The mufti of the nation, though very old
 and very ignorant, made shift to discover in his book certain lemmas
 that were suspicious, unseemly, rash, heretic, and unsound, and
 prosecuted him with great animosity, for the subject of the author's
 inquiry was whether, in the world of Sirius, there was any difference
 between the substantial forms of a flea and a snail.
 
 Micromegas defended his philosophy with such spirit as made all the
 female sex his proselytes; and the process lasted two hundred and twenty
 years; at the end of which time, in consequence of the mufti's interest,
 the book was condemned by judges who had never read it, and the author
 expelled from court for the term of eight hundred years.
 
 Not much affected at his banishment from a court that teemed with
 nothing but turmoils and trifles, he made a very humorous song upon the
 mufti, who gave himself no trouble about the matter, and set out on his
 travels from planet to planet, in order (as the saying is) to improve
 his mind and finish his education. Those who never travel but in a
 post-chaise or berlin, will, doubtless, be astonished at the equipages
 used above; for we that strut upon this little mole hill are at a loss
 to conceive anything that surpasses our own customs. But our traveler
 was a wonderful adept in the laws of gravitation, together with the
 whole force of attraction and repulsion, and made such seasonable use of
 his knowledge, that sometimes by the help of a sunbeam, and sometimes by
 the convenience of a comet, he and his retinue glided from sphere to
 sphere, as the bird hops from one bough to another. He in a very little
 time posted through the milky way, and I am obliged to own he saw not a
 twinkle of those stars supposed to adorn that fair empyrean, which the
 illustrious Dr. Derham brags to have observed through his telescope. Not
 that I pretend to say the doctor was mistaken. God forbid! But
 Micromegas was upon the spot, an exceeding good observer, and I have no
 mind to contradict any man. Be that as it may, after many windings and
 turnings, he arrived at the planet Saturn; and, accustomed as he was to
 the sight of novelties, he could not for his life repress a supercilious
 and conceited smile, which often escapes the wisest philosopher, when he
 perceived the smallness of that globe, and the diminutive size of its
 inhabitants; for really Saturn is but about nine hundred times larger
 than this our earth, and the people of that country mere dwarfs, about a
 thousand fathoms high. In short, he at first derided those poor pigmies,
 just as an Indian fiddler laughs at the music of Lully, at his first
 arrival in Paris: but as this Sirian was a person of good sense, he soon
 perceived that a thinking being may not be altogether ridiculous, even
 though he is not quite six thousand feet high; and therefore he became
 familiar with them, after they had ceased to wonder at his extraordinary
 appearance. In particular, he contracted an intimate friendship with the
 secretary of the Academy of Saturn, a man of good understanding, who,
 though in truth he had invented nothing of his own, gave a very good
 account of the inventions of others, and enjoyed in peace the reputation
 of a little poet and great calculator. And here, for the edification of
 the reader, I will repeat a very singular conversation that one day
 passed between Mr. Secretary and Micromegas.
 
 
 [1] The Gazettes record that this vessel ran ashore on the coast of
 Bothnia, when returning from the polar circle with a party of
 philosophers on board who had been making observations, for which nobody
 has hitherto been the wiser; but, according to this romance, the vessel
 was illegally captured in the Baltic sea by the Sirian giant Micromegas
 and the Saturnian dwarf.--E.
 
 
 
 
 II.
 
 THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN MICROMEGAS AND THE INHABITANT OF SATURN.
 
 
 His excellency having laid himself down, and the secretary approached
 his nose:
 
 "It must be confessed," said Micromegas, "that nature is full of
 variety."
 
 "Yes," replied the Saturnian, "nature is like a parterre, whose
 flowers--"
 
 "Pshaw!" cried the other, "a truce with your parterres."
 
 "It is," resumed the secretary, "like an assembly of fair and brown
 women, whose dresses--"
 
 "What a plague have I to do with your brunettes?" said our traveler.
 
 "Then it is like a gallery of pictures, the strokes of which--"
 
 "Not at all," answered Micromegas, "I tell you once for all, nature is
 like nature, and comparisons are odious."
 
 "Well, to please you," said the secretary--
 
 "I won't be pleased," replied the Sirian, "I want to be instructed;
 begin, therefore, without further preamble, and tell me how many senses
 the people of this world enjoy."
 
 "We have seventy and two," said the academician, "but we are daily
 complaining of the small number, as our imagination transcends our
 wants, for, with the seventy-two senses, our five moons and ring, we
 find ourselves very much restricted; and notwithstanding our curiosity,
 and the no small number of those passions that result from these few
 senses, we have still time enough to be tired of idleness."
 
 "I sincerely believe what you say," cried Micromegas "for, though we
 Sirians have near a thousand different senses, there still remains a
 certain vague desire, an unaccountable inquietude incessantly
 admonishing us of our own unimportance, and giving us to understand that
 there are other beings who are much our superiors in point of
 perfection. I have traveled a little, and seen mortals both above and
 below myself in the scale of being, but I have met with none who had not
 more desire than necessity, and more want than gratification. Perhaps I
 shall one day arrive in some country where nought is wanting, but
 hitherto I have had no certain information of such a happy land."
 
 The Saturnian and his guest exhausted themselves in conjectures upon
 this subject, and after abundance of argumentation equally ingenious and
 uncertain, were fain to return to matter of fact.
 
 "To what age do you commonly live?" said the Sirian.
 
 "Lack-a-day! a mere trifle," replied the little gentleman.
 
 "It is the very same case with us," resumed the other, "the shortness of
 life is our daily complaint, so that this must be an universal law in
 nature."
 
 "Alas!" cried the Saturnian, "few, very few on this globe outlive five
 hundred great revolutions of the sun; (these, according to our way of
 reckoning, amount to about fifteen thousand years.) So, you see, we in a
 manner begin to die the very moment we are born: our existence is no
 more than a point, our duration an instant, and our globe an atom.
 Scarce do we begin to learn a little, when death intervenes before we
 can profit by experience. For my own part, I am deterred from laying
 schemes when I consider myself as a single drop in the midst of an
 immense ocean. I am particularly ashamed, in your presence, of the
 ridiculous figure I make among my fellow-creatures."
 
 To this declaration, Micromegas replied.
 
 "If you were not a philosopher, I should be afraid of mortifying your
 pride by telling you that the term of our lives is seven hundred times
 longer than the date of your existence: but you are very sensible that
 when the texture of the body is resolved, in order to reanimate nature
 in another form, which is the consequence of what we call death--when
 that moment of change arrives, there is not the least difference betwixt
 having lived a whole eternity, or a single day. I have been in some
 countries where the people live a thousand times longer than with us,
 and yet they murmured at the shortness of their time. But one will find
 every where some few persons of good sense, who know how to make the
 best of their portion, and thank the author of nature for his bounty.
 There is a profusion of variety scattered through the universe, and yet
 there is an admirable vein of uniformity that runs through the whole:
 for example, all thinking beings are different among themselves, though
 at bottom they resemble one another in the powers and passions of the
 soul. Matter, though interminable, hath different properties in every
 sphere. How many principal attributes do you reckon in the matter of
 this world?"
 
 "If you mean those properties," said the Saturnian, "without which we
 believe this our globe could not subsist, we reckon in all three
 hundred, such as extent, impenetrability, motion, gravitation,
 divisibility, et cætera."
 
 "That small number," replied the traveler, "probably answers the views
 of the creator on this your narrow sphere. I adore his wisdom in all his
 works. I see infinite variety, but every where proportion. Your globe is
 small: so are the inhabitants. You have few sensations; because your
 matter is endued with few properties. These are the works of unerring
 providence. Of what color does your sun appear when accurately
 examined?"
 
 "Of a yellowish white," answered the Saturnian, "and in separating one
 of his rays we find it contains seven colors."
 
 "Our sun," said the Sirian, "is of a reddish hue, and we have no less
 than thirty-nine original colors. Among all the suns I have seen there
 is no sort of resemblance, and in this sphere of yours there is not one
 face like another."
 
 After divers questions of this nature, he asked how many substances,
 essentially different, they counted in the world of Saturn; and
 understood that they numbered but thirty: such as God; space; matter;
 beings endowed with sense and extension; beings that have extension,
 sense, and reflection; thinking beings who have no extension; those that
 are penetrable; those that are impenetrable, and also all others. But
 this Saturnian philosopher was prodigiously astonished when the Sirian
 told him they had no less than three hundred, and that he himself had
 discovered three thousand more in the course of his travels. In short,
 after having communicated to each other what they knew, and even what
 they did not know, and argued during a complete revolution of the sun,
 they resolved to set out together on a small philosophical tour.
 
 
 
 
 III.
 
 THE VOYAGE OF THESE INHABITANTS OF OTHER WORLDS.
 
 
 Our two philosophers were just ready to embark for the atmosphere of
 Saturn, with a large provision of mathematical instruments, when the
 Saturnian's mistress, having got an inkling of their design, came all in
 tears to make her protests. She was a handsome brunette, though not
 above six hundred and threescore fathoms high; but her agreeable
 attractions made amends for the smallness of her stature.
 
 "Ah! cruel man," cried she, "after a courtship of fifteen hundred years,
 when at length I surrendered, and became your wife, and scarce have
 passed two hundred more in thy embraces, to leave me thus, before the
 honeymoon is over, and go a rambling with a giant of another world! Go,
 go, thou art a mere virtuoso, devoid of tenderness and love! If thou
 wert a true Saturnian, thou wouldst be faithful and invariable. Ah!
 whither art thou going? what is thy design? Our five moons are not so
 inconstant, nor our ring so changeable as thee! But take this along with
 thee, henceforth I ne'er shall love another man."
 
 The little gentleman embraced and wept over her, notwithstanding his
 philosophy; and the lady, after having swooned with great decency, went
 to console herself with more agreeable company.
 
 Meanwhile our two virtuosi set out, and at one jump leaped upon the
 ring, which they found pretty flat, according to the ingenious guess of
 an illustrious inhabitant of this our little earth. From thence they
 easily slipped from moon to moon; and a comet chancing to pass, they
 sprang upon it with all their servants and apparatus. Thus carried about
 one hundred and fifty million of leagues, they met with the satellites
 of Jupiter, and arrived upon the body of the planet itself, where they
 continued a whole year; during which they learned some very curious
 secrets, which would actually be sent to the press, were it not for fear
 of the gentlemen inquisitors, who have found among them some corollaries
 very hard of digestion. Nevertheless, I have read the manuscript in the
 library of the illustrious archbishop of ---- who, with that generosity
 and goodness which should ever be commended, has granted me permission
 to peruse his books; wherefore I promise he shall have a long article in
 the next edition of Moreri, and I shall not forget the young gentlemen,
 his sons, who give us such pleasing hopes of seeing perpetuated the race
 of their illustrious father. But to return to our travelers. When they
 took leave of Jupiter, they traversed a space of about one hundred
 millions of leagues, and coasting along the planet Mars, which is well
 known to be five times smaller than our little earth, they descried two
 moons subservient to that orb, which have escaped the observation of all
 our astronomers. I know father Castel will write, and that pleasantly
 enough, against the existence of these two moons; but I entirely refer
 myself to those who reason by analogy. Those worthy philosophers are
 very sensible that Mars, which is at such a distance from the sun, must
 be in a very uncomfortable situation, without the benefit of a couple of
 moons. Be that as it may, our gentlemen found the planet so small, that
 they were afraid they should not find room to take a little repose; so
 that they pursued their journey like two travelers who despise the
 paltry accommodation of a village, and push forward to the next market
 town. But the Sirian and his companion soon repented of their delicacy,
 for they journeyed a long time without finding a resting place, till at
 length they discerned a small speck, which was the Earth. Coming from
 Jupiter, they could not but be moved with compassion at the sight of
 this miserable spot, upon which, however, they resolved to land, lest
 they should be a second time disappointed. They accordingly moved toward
 the tail of the comet, where, finding an Aurora Borealis ready to set
 sail, they embarked, and arrived on the northern coast of the Baltic on
 the fifth day of July, new style, in the year 1737.
 
 
 
 
 IV.
 
 WHAT BEFELL THEM UPON THIS OUR GLOBE.
 
 
 Having taken some repose, and being desirous of reconnoitering the
 narrow field in which they were, they traversed it at once from north to
 south. Every step of the Sirian and his attendants measured about thirty
 thousand royal feet: whereas, the dwarf of Saturn, whose stature did not
 exceed a thousand fathoms, followed at a distance quite out of breath;
 because, for every single stride of his companion, he was obliged to
 make twelve good steps at least. The reader may figure to himself, (if
 we are allowed to make such comparisons,) a very little rough spaniel
 dodging after a captain of the Prussian grenadiers.
 
 As those strangers walked at a good pace, they compassed the globe in
 six and thirty hours; the sun, it is true, or rather the earth,
 describes the same space in the course of one day; but it must be
 observed that it is much easier to turn upon an axis than to walk
 a-foot. Behold them then returned to the spot from whence they had set
 out, after having discovered that almost imperceptible sea, which is
 called the Mediterranean; and the other narrow pond that surrounds this
 mole-hill, under the denomination of the great ocean; in wading through
 which the dwarf had never wet his mid-leg, while the other scarce
 moistened his heel. In going and coming through both hemispheres, they
 did all that lay in their power to discover whether or not the globe was
 inhabited. They stooped, they lay down, they groped in every corner, but
 their eyes and hands were not at all proportioned to the small beings
 that crawl upon this earth; and, therefore, they could not find the
 smallest reason to suspect that we and our fellow-citizens of this globe
 had the honor to exist.
 
 The dwarf, who sometimes judged too hastily, concluded at once that
 there was no living creatures upon earth; and his chief reason was, that
 he had seen nobody. But Micromegas, in a polite manner, made him
 sensible of the unjust conclusion:
 
 "For," said he, "with your diminutive eyes you cannot see certain stars
 of the fiftieth magnitude, which I easily perceive; and do you take it
 for granted that no such stars exist?"
 
 "But I have groped with great care?" replied the dwarf.
 
 "Then your sense of feeling must be bad," said the other.
 
 "But this globe," said the dwarf, "is ill contrived; and so irregular in
 its form as to be quite ridiculous. The whole together looks like a
 chaos. Do but observe these little rivulets; not one of them runs in a
 straight line; and these ponds which are neither round, square, nor
 oval, nor indeed of any regular figure, together with these little sharp
 pebbles, (meaning the mountains,) that roughen the whole surface of the
 globe, and have torn all the skin from my feet. Besides, pray take
 notice of the shape of the whole, how it flattens at the poles, and
 turns round the sun in an awkward oblique manner, so as that the polar
 circles cannot possibly be cultivated. Truly, what makes me believe
 there is no inhabitant on this sphere, is a full persuasion that no
 sensible being would live in such a disagreeable place."
 
 "What then?" said Micromegas, "perhaps the beings that inhabit it come
 not under that denomination; but, to all appearance, it was not made for
 nothing. Everything here seems to you irregular; because you fetch all
 your comparisons from Jupiter or Saturn. Perhaps this is the very reason
 of the seeming confusion which you condemn; have I not told you, that in
 the course of my travels I have always met with variety?"
 
 The Saturnian replied to all these arguments; and perhaps the dispute
 would have known no end, if Micromegas, in the heat of the contest, had
 not luckily broken the string of his diamond necklace, so that the
 jewels fell to the ground; they consisted of pretty small unequal
 karats, the largest of which weighed four hundred pounds, and the
 smallest fifty. The dwarf, in helping to pick them up, perceived, as
 they approached his eye, that every single diamond was cut in such a
 manner as to answer the purpose of an excellent microscope. He therefore
 took up a small one, about one hundred and sixty feet in diameter, and
 applied it to his eye, while Micromegas chose another of two thousand
 five hundred feet. Though they were of excellent powers, the observers
 could perceive nothing by their assistance, so they were altered and
 adjusted. At length, the inhabitant of Saturn discerned something almost
 imperceptible moving between two waves in the Baltic. This was no other
 than a whale, which, in a dexterous manner, he caught with his little
 finger, and, placing it on the nail of his thumb, showed it to the
 Syrian, who laughed heartily at the excessive smallness peculiar to
 the inhabitants of this our globe. The Saturnian, by this time convinced
 that our world was inhabited, began to imagine we had no other animals
 than whales; and being a mighty debater, he forthwith set about
 investigating the origin and motion of this small atom, curious to know
 whether or not it was furnished with ideas, judgment, and free will.
 Micromegas was very much perplexed upon this subject. He examined the
 animal with the most patient attention, and the result of his inquiry
 was, that he could see no reason to believe a soul was lodged in such a
 body. The two travelers were actually inclined to think there was no
 such thing as mind in this our habitation, when, by the help of their
 microscope, they perceived something as large as a whale floating upon
 the surface of the sea. It is well known that, at this period, a flight
 of philosophers were upon their return from the polar circle, where they
 had been making observations, for which nobody has hitherto been the
 wiser. The gazettes record, that their vessel ran ashore on the coast of
 Bothnia and that they with great difficulty saved their lives; but in
 this world one can never dive to the bottom of things. For my own part,
 I will ingenuously recount the transaction just as it happened, without
 any addition of my own; and this is no small effort in a modern
 historian.
 
 
 
 
 V.
 
 THE TRAVELERS CAPTURE A VESSEL.
 
 
 Micromegas stretched out his hand gently toward the place where the
 object appeared, and advanced two fingers, which he instantly pulled
 back, for fear of being disappointed, then opening softly and shutting
 them all at once, he very dexterously seized the ship that contained
 those gentlemen, and placed it on his nail, avoiding too much pressure,
 which might have crushed the whole in pieces.
 
 "This," said the Saturnian dwarf, "is a creature very different from the
 former."
 
 Upon which the Sirian placing the supposed animal in the hollow of his
 hand, the passengers and crew, who believed themselves thrown by a
 hurricane upon some rock, began to put themselves in motion. The sailors
 having hoisted out some casks of wine, jumped after them into the hand
 of Micromegas: the mathematicians having secured their quadrants,
 sectors, and Lapland servants, went overboard at a different place, and
 made such a bustle in their descent, that the Sirian at length felt his
 fingers tickled by something that seemed to move. An iron bar chanced to
 penetrate about a foot deep into his forefinger; and from this prick he
 concluded that something had issued from the little animal he held in
 his hand; but at first he suspected nothing more: for the microscope,
 that scarce rendered a whale and a ship visible, had no effect upon an
 object so imperceptible as man.
 
 I do not intend to shock the vanity of any person whatever; but here I
 am obliged to beg your people of importance to consider that, supposing
 the stature of a man to be about five feet, we mortals make just such a
 figure upon the earth, as an animal the sixty thousandth part of a foot
 in height, would exhibit upon a bowl ten feet in circumference. When you
 reflect upon a being who could hold this whole earth in the palm of his
 hand, and is provided with organs proportioned to those we possess, you
 will easily conceive that there must be a great variety of created
 substances;--and pray, what must such beings think of those battles by
 which a conqueror gains a small village, to lose it again in the
 sequel?
 
 [Illustration: Micromegas captures a ship.]
 
 I do not at all doubt, but if some captain of grenadiers should chance
 to read this work, he would add two large feet at least to the caps of
 his company; but I assure him his labor will be in vain; for, do what he
 will, he and his soldiers will never be other than infinitely diminutive
 and inconsiderable.
 
 What wonderful address must have been inherent in our Sirian
 philosopher, that enabled him to perceive those atoms of which we have
 been speaking. When Leuwenhoek and Hartsoecker observed the first
 rudiments of which we are formed, they did not make such an astonishing
 discovery. What pleasure, therefore, was the portion of Micromegas, in
 observing the motion of those little machines, in examining all their
 pranks, and following them in all their operations! With what joy did he
 put his microscope into his companion's hand; and with what transport
 did they both at once exclaim:
 
 "I see them distinctly,--don't you see them carrying burdens, lying down
 and rising up again?"
 
 So saying, their hands shook with eagerness to see, and apprehension to
 lose such uncommon objects. The Saturnian, making a sudden transition
 from the most cautious distrust to the most excessive credulity,
 imagined he saw them engaged in their devotions and cried aloud in
 astonishment.
 
 Nevertheless, he was deceived by appearances: a case too common, whether
 we do or do not make use of microscopes.
 
 
 
 
 VI.
 
 WHAT HAPPENED IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH MEN.
 
 
 Micromegas being a much better observer than the dwarf, perceived
 distinctly that those atoms spoke; and made the remark to his companion,
 who was so much ashamed of being mistaken in his first suggestion, that
 he would not believe such a puny species could possibly communicate
 their ideas: for, though he had the gift of tongues, as well as his
 companion, he could not hear those particles speak; and therefore
 supposed they had no language.
 
 "Besides, how should such imperceptible beings have the organs of
 speech? and what in the name of Jove can they say to one another? In
 order to speak, they must have something like thought, and if they
 think, they must surely have something equivalent to a soul. Now, to
 attribute anything like a soul to such an insect species appears a mere
 absurdity."
 
 "But just now," replied the Sirian, "you believed they were engaged in
 devotional exercises; and do you think this could be done without
 thinking, without using some sort of language, or at least some way of
 making themselves understood? Or do you suppose it is more difficult to
 advance an argument than to engage in physical exercise? For my own
 part, I look upon all faculties as alike mysterious."
 
 "I will no longer venture to believe or deny," answered the dwarf. "In
 short I have no opinion at all, let us endeavor to examine these
 insects, and we will reason upon them afterward."
 
 "With all my heart," said Micromegas, who, taking out a pair of scissors
 which he kept for paring his nails, cut off a paring from his thumb
 nail, of which he immediately formed a large kind of speaking trumpet,
 like a vast tunnel, and clapped the pipe to his ear: as the
 circumference of this machine included the ship and all the crew, the
 most feeble voice was conveyed along the circular fibres of the nail; so
 that, thanks to his industry, the philosopher could distinctly hear the
 buzzing of our insects that were below. In a few hours he distinguished
 articulate sounds, and at last plainly understood the French language.
 The dwarf heard the same, though with more difficulty.
 
 The astonishment of our travelers increased every instant. They heard a
 nest of mites talk in a very sensible strain: and that _Lusus Naturæ_?
 seemed to them inexplicable. You need not doubt but the Sirian and his
 dwarf glowed with impatience to enter into conversation with such atoms.
 Micromegas being afraid that his voice, like thunder, would deafen and
 confound the mites, without being understood by them, saw the necessity
 of diminishing the sound; each, therefore, put into his mouth a sort of
 small toothpick, the slender end of which reached to the vessel. The
 Sirian setting the dwarf upon his knees, and the ship and crew upon his
 nail, held down his head and spoke softly. In fine, having taken these
 and a great many more precautions, he addressed himself to them in these
 words:
 
 "O ye invisible insects, whom the hand of the Creator hath deigned to
 produce in the abyss of infinite littleness! I give praise to his
 goodness, in that he hath been pleased to disclose unto me those secrets
 that seemed to be impenetrable."
 
 If ever there was such a thing as astonishment, it seized upon the
 people who heard this address, and who could not conceive from whence it
 proceeded. The chaplain of the ship repeated exorcisms, the sailors
 swore, and the philosophers formed a system; but, notwithstanding all
 their systems, they could not divine who the person was that spoke to
 them. Then the dwarf of Saturn, whose voice was softer than that of
 Micromegas, gave them briefly to understand what species of beings they
 had to do with. He related the particulars of their voyage from Saturn,
 made them acquainted with the rank and quality of Monsieur Micromegas;
 and, after having pitied their smallness, asked if they had always been
 in that miserable state so near akin to annihilation; and what their
 business was upon that globe which seemed to be the property of whales.
 He also desired to know if they were happy in their situation? if they
 were inspired with souls? and put a hundred questions of the like
 nature.
 
 A certain mathematician on board, braver than the rest, and shocked to
 hear his soul called in question, planted his quadrant, and having taken
 two observations of this interlocutor, said: "You believe then, Mr.,
 what's your name, that because you measure from head to foot a thousand
 fathoms--"
 
 "A thousand fathoms!" cried the dwarf, "good heavens! How should he know
 the height of my stature? A thousand fathoms! My very dimensions to a
 hair. What, measured by a mite! This atom, forsooth, is a geometrician,
 and knows exactly how tall I am; while I, who can scarce perceive him
 through a microscope, am utterly ignorant of his extent!"
 
 "Yes, I have taken your measure," answered the philosopher, "and I will
 now do the same by your tall companion."
 
 The proposal was embraced: his excellency reclined upon his side; for,
 had he stood upright, his head would have reached too far above the
 clouds. Our mathematicians planted a tall tree near him, and then, by a
 series of triangles joined together, they discovered that the object of
 their observation was a strapping youth, exactly one hundred and twenty
 thousand royal feet in length. In consequence of this calculation,
 Micromegas uttered these words:
 
 "I am now more than ever convinced that we ought to judge of nothing by
 its external magnitude. O God! who hast bestowed understanding upon such
 seemingly contemptible substances, thou canst with equal ease produce
 that which is infinitely small, as that which is incredibly great: and
 if it be possible, that among thy works there are beings still more
 diminutive than these, they may nevertheless, be endued with
 understanding superior to the intelligence of those stupendous animals I
 have seen in heaven, a single foot of whom is larger than this whole
 globe on which I have alighted."
 
 One of the philosophers assured him that there were intelligent beings
 much smaller than men, and recounted not only Virgil's whole fable of
 the bees, but also described all that Swammerdam hath discovered, and
 Réaumur dissected. In a word, he informed him that there are animals
 which bear the same proportion to bees, that bees bear to man; the same
 as the Sirian himself compared to those vast beings whom he had
 mentioned; and as those huge animals are to other substances, before
 whom they would appear like so many particles of dust. Here the
 conversation became very interesting, and Micromegas proceeded in these
 words:
 
 "O ye intelligent atoms, in whom the Supreme Being hath been pleased to
 manifest his omniscience and power, without all doubt your joys on this
 earth must be pure and exquisite: for, being unincumbered with matter,
 and, to all appearance, little else than soul, you must spend your lives
 in the delights of pleasure and reflection, which are the true
 enjoyments of a perfect spirit. True happiness I have no where found;
 but certainly here it dwells."
 
 At this harangue all the philosophers shook their heads, and one among
 them, more candid than his brethren, frankly owned, that excepting a
 very small number of inhabitants who were very little esteemed by their
 fellows, all the rest were a parcel of knaves, fools, and miserable
 wretches.
 
 "We have matter enough," said he, "to do abundance of mischief, if
 mischief comes from matter; and too much understanding, if evil flows
 from understanding. You must know, for example, that at this very
 moment, while I am speaking, there are one hundred thousand animals of
 our own species, covered with hats, slaying an equal number of their
 fellow-creatures, who wear turbans; at least they are either slaying or
 being slain; and this hath usually been the case all over the earth from
 time immemorial."
 
 The Sirian, shuddering at this information, begged to know the cause of
 those horrible quarrels among such a puny race; and was given to
 understand that the subject of the dispute was a pitiful mole-hill
 [called Palestine,] no larger than his heel. Not that any one of those
 millions who cut one another's throats pretends to have the least claim
 to the smallest particle of that clod. The question is, whether it shall
 belong to a certain person who is known by the name of Sultan, or to
 another whom (for what reason I know not) they dignify with the
 appellation of Pope. Neither the one nor the other has seen or ever will
 see the pitiful corner in question; and probably none of these wretches,
 who so madly destroy each other, ever beheld the ruler on whose account
 they are so mercilessly sacrificed!
 
 "Ah, miscreants!" cried the indignant Sirian, "such excess of desperate
 rage is beyond conception. I have a good mind to take two or three
 steps, and trample the whole nest of such ridiculous assassins under my
 feet."
 
 "Don't give yourself the trouble," replied the philosopher, "they are
 industrious enough in procuring their own destruction. At the end of ten
 years the hundredth part of those wretches will not survive; for you
 must know that, though they should not draw a sword in the cause they
 have espoused, famine, fatigue, and intemperance, would sweep almost all
 of them from the face of the earth. Besides, the punishment should not
 be inflicted upon them, but upon those sedentary and slothful
 barbarians, who, from their palaces, give orders for murdering a million
 of men and then solemnly thank God for their success."
 
 Our traveler was moved with compassion for the entire human race, in
 which he discovered such astonishing contrasts. "Since you are of the
 small number of the wise," said he, "and in all likelihood do not engage
 yourselves in the trade of murder for hire, be so good as to tell me
 your occupation."
 
 "We anatomize flies," replied the philosopher, "we measure lines, we
 make calculations, we agree upon two or three points which we
 understand, and dispute upon two or three thousand that are beyond our
 comprehension."
 
 "How far," said the Sirian, "do you reckon the distance between the
 great star of the constellation Gemini and that called Caniculæ?"
 
 To this question all of them answered with one voice: "Thirty-two
 degrees and a half."
 
 "And what is the distance from hence to the moon?"
 
 "Sixty semi-diameters of the earth."
 
 He then thought to puzzle them by asking the weight of the air; but they
 answered distinctly, that common air is about nine hundred times
 specifically lighter than an equal column of the lightest water, and
 nineteen hundred times lighter than current gold. The little dwarf of
 Saturn, astonished at their answers, was now tempted to believe those
 people sorcerers, who, but a quarter of an hour before, he would not
 allow were inspired with souls.
 
 "Well," said Micromegas, "since you know so well what is without you,
 doubtless you are still more perfectly acquainted with that which is
 within. Tell me what is the soul, and how do your ideas originate?"
 
 Here the philosophers spoke altogether as before; but each was of a
 different opinion. The eldest quoted Aristotle; another pronounced the
 name of Descartes; a third mentioned Mallebranche; a fourth Leibnitz;
 and a fifth Locke. An old peripatecian lifting up his voice, exclaimed
 with an air of confidence. "The soul is perfection and reason, having
 power to be such as it is, as Aristotle expressly declares, page 633, of
 the Louvre edition:
 
      "_Εντελεχεῖά τις ἐστι, καὶ λόγος τοὖ δύναμιν ἓχοντος_
       _τοιοὗδι εἷ ταἷ_."
 
 "I am not very well versed in Greek," said the giant.
 
 "Nor I either," replied the philosophical mite.
 
 "Why then do you quote that same Aristotle in Greek?" resumed the
 Sirian.
 
 "Because," answered the other, "it is but reasonable we should quote
 what we do not comprehend in a language we do not understand."
 
 Here the Cartesian interposing: "The soul," said he, "is a pure spirit
 or intelligence, which hath received before birth all the metaphysical
 ideas; but after that event it is obliged to go to school and learn
 anew the knowledge which it hath lost."
 
 "So it was necessary," replied the animal of eight leagues, "that thy
 soul should be learned before birth, in order to be so ignorant when
 thou hast got a beard upon thy chin. But what dost thou understand by
 spirit?"
 
 "I have no idea of it," said the philosopher, "indeed it is supposed to
 be immaterial."
 
 "At least, thou knowest what matter is?" resumed the Sirian.
 
 "Perfectly well," answered the other. "For example: that stone is gray,
 is of a certain figure, has three dimensions, specific weight, and
 divisibility."
 
 "I want to know," said the giant, "what that object is, which, according
 to thy observation, hath a gray color, weight, and divisibility. Thou
 seest a few qualities, but dost thou know the nature of the thing
 itself?"
 
 "Not I, truly," answered the Cartesian.
 
 Upon which the Sirian admitted that he also was ignorant in regard to
 this subject. Then addressing himself to another sage, who stood upon
 his thumb, he asked "what is the soul? and what are her functions?"
 
 "Nothing at all," replied this disciple of Mallebranche; "God hath made
 everything for my convenience. In him I see everything, by him I act; he
 is the universal agent, and I never meddle in his work."
 
 "That is being a nonentity indeed," said the Sirian sage; and then,
 turning to a follower of Leibnitz, he exclaimed: "Hark ye, friend, what
 is thy opinion of the soul?"
 
 "In my opinion," answered this metaphysician, "the soul is the hand that
 points at the hour, while my body does the office of the clock; or, if
 you please, the soul is the clock, and the body is the pointer; or
 again, my soul is the mirror of the universe, and my body the frame. All
 this is clear and uncontrovertible."
 
 A little partisan of Locke who chanced to be present, being asked his
 opinion on the same subject, said: "I do not know by what power I think;
 but well I know that I should never have thought without the assistance
 of my senses. That there are immaterial and intelligent substances I do
 not at all doubt; but that it is impossible for God to communicate the
 faculty of thinking to matter, I doubt very much. I revere the eternal
 power, to which it would ill become me to prescribe bounds. I affirm
 nothing, and am contented to believe that many more things are possible
 than are usually thought so."
 
 The Sirian smiled at this declaration, and did not look upon the author
 as the least sagacious of the company: and as for the dwarf of Saturn,
 he would have embraced this adherent of Locke, had it not been for the
 extreme disproportion in their respective sizes. But unluckily there was
 another animalcule in a square cap, who, taking the word from all his
 philosophical brethren, affirmed that he knew the whole secret, which
 was contained in the abridgment of St. Thomas. He surveyed the two
 celestial strangers from top to toe, and maintained to their faces that
 their persons, their fashions, their suns and their stars, were created
 solely for the use of man. At this wild assertion our two travelers were
 seized with a fit of that uncontrollable laughter, which (according to
 Homer) is the portion of the immortal gods: their bellies quivered,
 their shoulders rose and fell, and, during these convulsions, the vessel
 fell from the Sirian's nail into the Saturnian's pocket, where these
 worthy people searched for it a long time with great diligence. At
 length, having found the ship and set everything to rights again, the
 Sirian resumed the discourse with those diminutive mites, and promised
 to compose for them a choice book of philosophy which would demonstrate
 the very essence of things. Accordingly, before his departure, he made
 them a present of the book, which was brought to the Academy of Sciences
 at Paris, but when the old secretary came to open it he saw nothing but
 blank paper, upon which:--
 
 "Ay, ay," said he, "this is just what I suspected."
 
 
 
 
 THE WORLD AS IT GOES.
 
 THE VISION OF BABOUC.
 
 
 [Illustration: The spiritual rulers of Persepolis.][1]
 
 Among the genii who preside over the empires of the earth, Ithuriel held
 one of the first ranks, and had the department of Upper Asia. He one
 morning descended into the abode of Babouc, the Scythian, who dwelt on
 the banks of the Oxus, and said to him:
 
 "Babouc, the follies and vices of the Persians have drawn upon them our
 indignation. Yesterday an assembly of the genii of Upper Asia was held,
 to consider whether we would chastise Persepolis or destroy it entirely.
 Go to that city; examine everything; return and give me a faithful
 account; and, according to thy report, I will then determine whether to
 correct or extirpate the inhabitants."
 
 "But, my lord," said Babouc with great humility, "I have never been in
 Persia, nor do I know a single person in that country."
 
 "So much the better," said the angel, "thou wilt be the more impartial:
 thou hast received from heaven the spirit of discernment, to which I now
 add the power of inspiring confidence. Go, see, hear, observe, and fear
 nothing. Thou shalt everywhere meet with a favorable reception."
 
 Babouc mounted his camel, and set out with his servants. After having
 traveled some days, he met, near the plains of Senaar, the Persian army,
 which was going to attack the forces of India. He first addressed
 himself to a soldier, whom he found at a distance from the main army,
 and asked him what was the occasion of the war?
 
 "By all the gods," said the soldier, "I know nothing of the matter. It
 is none of my business. My trade is to kill and to be killed, to get a
 livelihood. It is of no consequence to me whom I serve. To-morrow,
 perhaps, I may go over to the Indian camp; for it is said that they give
 their soldiers nearly half a copper drachma a day more than we have in
 this cursed service of Persia. If thou desirest to know why we fight,
 speak to my captain."
 
 Babouc, having given the soldier a small present, entered the camp. He
 soon became acquainted with the captain, and asked him the cause of the
 war.
 
 "How canst thou imagine that I should know it?" said the captain, "or of
 what importance is it to me? I live about two hundred leagues from
 Persepolis: I hear that war is declared. I instantly leave my family,
 and, having nothing else to do, go, according to our custom, to make my
 fortune, or to fall by a glorious death."
 
 "But are not thy companions," said Babouc, "a little better informed
 than thee?"
 
 "No," said the officer, "there are none but our principal satraps that
 know the true cause of our cutting one another's throats."
 
 Babouc, struck with astonishment, introduced himself to the generals,
 and soon became familiarly acquainted with them. At last one of them
 said:
 
 "The cause of this war, which for twenty years past hath desolated Asia,
 sprang originally from a quarrel between a eunuch belonging to one of
 the concubines of the great king of Persia, and the clerk of a factory
 belonging to the great king of India. The dispute was about a claim
 which amounted nearly to the thirtieth part of a daric. Our first
 minister, and the representative of India, maintained the rights of
 their respective masters with becoming dignity. The dispute grew warm.
 Both parties sent into the field an army of a million of soldiers. This
 army must be recruited every year with upwards of four hundred thousand
 men. Massacres, burning of houses, ruin and devastation, are daily
 multiplied; the universe suffers; and their mutual animosity still
 continues. The first ministers of the two nations frequently protest
 that they have nothing in view but the happiness of mankind; and every
 protestation is attended with the destruction of a town, or the
 desolation of a province."
 
 Next day, on a report being spread that peace was going to be concluded,
 the Persian and Indian generals made haste to come to an engagement. The
 battle was long and bloody. Babouc beheld every crime, and every
 abomination. He was witness to the arts and stratagems of the principal
 satraps, who did all that lay in their power to expose their general to
 the disgrace of a defeat. He saw officers killed by their own troops,
 and soldiers stabbing their already expiring comrades in order to strip
 them of a few bloody garments torn and covered with dirt. He entered the
 hospitals to which they were conveying the wounded, most of whom died
 through the inhuman negligence of those who were well paid by the king
 of Persia to assist these unhappy men.
 
 "Are these men," cried Babouc, "or are they wild beasts? Ah! I plainly
 see that Persepolis will be destroyed."
 
 Full of this thought, he went over to the camp of the Indians, where,
 according to the prediction of the genii, he was as well received as in
 that of the Persians; but he saw there the same crimes which had already
 filled him with horror.
 
 "Oh!" said he to himself, "if the angel Ithuriel should exterminate the
 Persians, the angel of India must certainly destroy the Indians."
 
 But being afterward more particularly informed of all that passed in
 both armies, he heard of such acts of generosity, humanity, and
 greatness of soul, as at once surprised and charmed him:
 
 "Unaccountable mortals! as ye are," cried he, "how can you thus unite so
 much baseness and so much grandeur, so many virtues and so many vices?"
 
 Meanwhile the peace was proclaimed; and the generals of the two armies,
 neither of whom had gained a complete victory, but who, for their own
 private interest, had shed the blood of so many of their
 fellow-creatures, went to solicit their courts for rewards. The peace
 was celebrated in public writings which announced the return of virtue
 and happiness to the earth.
 
 "God be praised," said Babouc, "Persepolis will now be the abode of
 spotless innocence, and will not be destroyed, as the cruel genii
 intended. Let us haste without delay to the capital of Asia."
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 He entered that immense city by the ancient gate, which was entirely
 barbarous, and offended the eye by its disagreeable rusticity. All that
 part of the town savored of the time when it was built; for,
 notwithstanding the obstinacy of men in praising ancient at the expense
 of modern times, it must be owned that the first essays in every art are
 rude and unfinished.
 
 Babouc mingled in a crowd of people composed of the most ignorant, dirty
 and deformed of both sexes, who were thronging with a stupid air into a
 large and gloomy inclosure. By the constant hum; by the gestures of the
 people; by the money which some persons gave to others for the liberty
 of sitting down, he imagined that he was in a market, where chairs were
 sold: but observing several women fall down on their knees with an
 appearance of looking directly before them, while in reality they were
 leering at the men by their sides, he was soon convinced that he was in
 a temple. Shrill, hoarse, savage and discordant voices made the vault
 re-echo with ill articulated sounds, that produced the same effect as
 the braying of asses, when, in the plains of Pictavia, they answer the
 cornet that calls them together. He stopped his ears; but he was ready
 to shut his mouth and hold his nose, when he saw several laborers enter
 into the temple with picks and spades, who removed a large stone, and
 threw up the earth on both sides, from whence exhaled a pestilential
 vapor. At last some others approached, deposited a dead body in the
 opening, and replaced the stone upon it.
 
 "What!" cried Babouc, "do these people bury their dead in the place
 where they adore the deity? What! are their temples paved with
 carcasses? I am no longer surprised at those pestilential diseases
 that frequently depopulate Persepolis. The putrefaction of the dead, and
 the infected breath of such numbers of the living, assembled and crowded
 together in the same place, are sufficient to poison the whole
 terrestial globe. Oh! what an abominable city is Persepolis! The angels
 probably intend to destroy it in order to build a more beautiful one in
 its place, and to people it with inhabitants who are more virtuous and
 better singers. Providence may have its reasons for so doing; to its
 disposal let us leave all future events."
 
 [Illustration: Burying the dead in churches.--"What!" cried Babouc, "do
 these people bury their dead in the place where they adore the deity?
 What! are their temples paved with carcasses?"]
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 Meanwhile the sun approached his meridian height. Babouc was to dine at
 the other end of the city with a lady for whom her husband, an officer
 in the army, had given him some letters: but he first took several turns
 in Persepolis, where he saw other temples, better built and more richly
 adorned, filled with a polite audience, and resounding with harmonious
 music. He beheld public fountains, which, though ill-placed, struck the
 eye by their beauty; squares where the best kings that had governed
 Persia seemed to breathe in bronze, and others where he heard the people
 crying out:
 
 "When shall we see our beloved master?"
 
 He admired the magnificent bridges built over the river; the superb and
 commodious quays; the palaces raised on both sides; and an immense
 house, where thousands of old soldiers, covered with scars and crowned
 with victory, offered their daily praises to the god of armies. At last
 he entered the house of the lady, who, with a set of fashionable people,
 waited his company to dinner. The house was neat and elegant; the repast
 delicious; the lady young, beautiful, witty, and engaging; and the
 company worthy of her; and Babouc every moment said to himself:
 
 "The angel Ithuriel has little regard for the world, or he would never
 think of destroying such a charming city."
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 In the meantime he observed that the lady, who had begun by tenderly
 asking news about her husband, spoke more tenderly to a young magi,
 toward the conclusion of the repast. He saw a magistrate, who, in
 presence of his wife, paid his court with great vivacity to a widow,
 while the indulgent widow held out her hand to a young citizen,
 remarkable for his modesty and graceful appearance.
 
 Babouc then began to fear that the genius Ithuriel had but too much
 reason for destroying Persepolis. The talent he possessed of gaining
 confidence let him that same day into all the secrets of the lady. She
 confessed to him her affection for the young magi, and assured him that
 in all the houses in Persepolis he would meet with similar examples of
 attachment. Babouc concluded that such a society could not possibly
 survive: that jealousy, discord, and vengeance must desolate every
 house; that tears and blood must be daily shed; and, _in fine_, that
 Ithuriel would do well to destroy immediately a city abandoned to
 continual disasters.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 Such were the gloomy ideas that possessed his mind, when a grave man in
 a black gown appeared at the gate and humbly begged to speak to the
 young magistrate. Phis stripling, without rising or taking the least
 notice of the old gentleman, gave him some papers with a haughty and
 careless air, and then dismissed him. Babouc asked who this man was. The
 mistress of the house said to him in a low voice:
 
 "He is one of the best advocates in the city, and hath studied the law
 these fifty years. The other, who is but twenty-five years of age, and
 has only been a satrap of the law for two days, hath ordered him to make
 an extract of a process he is going to determine, though he has not as
 yet examined it."
 
 "This giddy youth acts wisely," said Babouc, "in asking counsel of an
 old man. But why is not the old man himself the judge?"
 
 "Thou art surely in jest," said they; "those who have grown old in
 laborious and inferior posts are never raised to places of dignity. This
 young man has a great post, because his father is rich; and the right of
 dispensing justice is purchased here like a farm."
 
 "O unhappy city!" cried Babouc, "this is surely the height of anarchy
 and confusion. Those who have thus purchased the right of judging will
 doubtless sell their judgments; nothing do I see here but an abyss of
 iniquity!"
 
 While he was thus expressing his grief and surprise, a young warrior,
 who that very day had returned from the army, said to him:
 
 "Why wouldst thou not have seats in the courts of justice offered for
 sale? I myself purchased the right of braving death at the head of two
 thousand men who are under my command. It has this year cost me forty
 daracs of gold to lie on the earth thirty nights successively in a red
 dress, and at last to receive two wounds with an arrow, of which I still
 feel the smart. If I ruin myself to serve the emperor of Persia, whom I
 never saw, the satrap of the law may well pay something for enjoying the
 pleasure of giving audience to pleaders."
 
 Babouc was filled with indignation, and could not help condemning a
 country, where the highest posts in the army and the law were exposed
 for sale. He at once concluded that the inhabitants must be entirely
 ignorant of the art of war, and the laws of equity; and that, though
 Ithuriel should not destroy them, they must soon be ruined by their
 detestable administration.
 
 He was still further confirmed in his bad opinion by the arrival of a
 fat man, who, after saluting all the company with great familiarity,
 went up to the young officer and said:
 
 "I can only lend thee fifty thousand darics of gold; for indeed the
 taxes of the empire have this year brought me in but three hundred
 thousand."
 
 Babouc inquired into the character of this man who complained of having
 gained so little, and was informed that in Persepolis there were forty
 plebian kings who held the empire of Persia by lease, and paid a small
 tribute to the monarch.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 After dinner he went into one of the most superb temples in the city,
 and seated himself amidst a crowd of men and women, who had come thither
 to pass away the time. A magi appeared in a machine elevated above the
 heads of the people, and talked a long time of vice and virtue. He
 divided into several parts what needed no division at all: he proved
 methodically what was sufficiently clear, and he taught what everybody
 knew. He threw himself into a passion with great composure, and went
 away perspiring and out of breath. The assembly then awoke and imagined
 they had been present at a very instructive discourse. Babouc said:
 
 "This man had done his best to tire two or three hundred of his
 fellow-citizens; but his intention was good, and there is nothing in
 this that should occasion the destruction of Persepolis."
 
 Upon leaving the assembly he was conducted to a public entertainment,
 which was exhibited every day in the year. It was in a kind of great
 hall, at the end of which appeared a palace. The most beautiful women of
 Persepolis and the most considerable satraps were ranged in order, and
 formed so fine a spectacle that Babouc at first believed that this was
 all the entertainment. Two or three persons, who seemed to be kings and
 queens, soon appeared in the vestibule of their palace. Their language
 was very different from that of the people; it was measured, harmonious,
 and sublime. Nobody slept. The audience kept a profound silence which
 was only interrupted by expressions of sensibility and admiration. The
 duty of kings, the love of virtue, and the dangers arising from
 unbridled passions, were all described by such lively and affecting
 strokes, that Babouc shed tears. He doubted not but that these heroes
 and heroines, these kings and queens whom he had just heard, were the
 preachers of the empire; he even purposed to engage Ithuriel to come and
 hear them, being content that such a spectacle would forever reconcile
 him to the city.
 
 As soon as the entertainment was finished, he resolved to visit the
 principal queen, who had recommended such pure and noble morals in the
 palace. He desired to be introduced to her majesty, and was led up a
 narrow staircase to an ill-furnished apartment in the second story,
 where he found a woman in a mean dress, who said to him with a noble and
 pathetic air:
 
 "This employment does not afford me a sufficient maintenance. I want
 money, and without money there is no comfort."
 
 Babouc gave her an hundred darics of gold, saying:
 
 "Had there been no other evil in the city but this, Ithuriel would have
 been to blame for being so much offended."
 
 From thence he went to spend the evening at the house of a tradesman
 who dealt in magnificent trifles. He was conducted thither by a man of
 sense, with whom he had contracted an acquaintance. He bought whatever
 pleased his fancy; and the toy man with great politeness sold him
 everything for more than it was worth. On his return home his friends
 showed him how much he had been cheated. Babouc set down the name of the
 tradesman in his pocket-book, in order to point him out to Ithuriel as
 an object of peculiar vengeance on the day when the city should be
 punished. As he was writing, he heard somebody knock at the door: this
 was the toy man himself, who came to restore him his purse, which he had
 left by mistake on the counter.
 
 "How canst thou," cried Babouc, "be so generous and faithful, when thou
 hast had the assurance to sell me these trifles for four times their
 value?"
 
 "There is not a tradesman," replied the merchant, "of ever so little
 note in the city, that would not have returned thee thy purse; but
 whoever said that I sold thee these trifles for four times their value
 is greatly mistaken: I sold them for ten times their value; and this is
 so true, that wert thou to sell them again in a month hence, thou
 wouldst not get even this tenth part. But nothing is more just. It is
 the variable fancies of men that set a value on these baubles; it is
 this fancy that maintains an hundred workmen whom I employ; it is this
 that gives me a fine house and a handsome chariot and horses; it is
 this, in fine, that excites industry, encourages taste, promotes
 circulation, and produces abundance.
 
 "I sell the same trifles to the neighboring nation at a much higher rate
 than I have sold them to thee, and by these means I am useful to the
 empire."
 
 Babouc, after having reflected a moment, erased the tradesman's name
 from his tablets.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 Babouc, not knowing as yet what to think of Persepolis, resolved to
 visit the magi and the men of letters; for, as the one studied wisdom
 and the other religion, he hoped that they in conjunction would obtain
 mercy for the rest of the people. Accordingly, he went next morning into
 a college of magi. The archimandrite confessed to him, that he had an
 hundred thousand crowns a year for having taken the vow of poverty, and
 that he enjoyed a very extensive empire in virtue of his vow of
 humility; after which he left him with an inferior brother, who did him
 the honors of the place.
 
 While the brother was showing him the magnificence of this house of
 penitence, a report was spread abroad that Babouc was come to reform all
 these houses. He immediately received petitions from each of them, the
 substance of which was, "Preserve us and destroy all the rest." On
 hearing their apologies, all these societies were absolutely necessary:
 on hearing their mutual accusations, they all deserved to be abolished.
 He was surprised to find that all the members of these societies were so
 extremely desirous of edifying the world, that they wished to have it
 entirely under their dominion.
 
 Soon after a little man appeared, who was a demi-magi, and who said to
 him:
 
 "I plainly see that the work is going to be accomplished: for Zerdust is
 returned to earth; and the little girls prophecy, pinching and whipping
 themselves. We therefore implore thy protection against the great lama."
 
 "What!" said Babouc, "against the royal pontiff, who resides at Tibet?"
 
 "Yes, against him, himself."
 
 "What! you are then making war upon him, and raising armies!"
 
 "No, but he says that man is a free agent, and we deny it. We have
 written several pamphlets against him, which he never read. Hardly has
 he heard our name mentioned. He has only condemned us in the same manner
 as a man orders the trees in his garden to be cleared from
 caterpillars."
 
 Babouc was incensed at the folly of these men who made profession of
 wisdom; and at the intrigues of those who had renounced the world; and
 at the ambition, pride and avarice of such as taught humility and a
 disinterested spirit: from all which he concluded that Ithuriel had good
 reason to destroy the whole race.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 On his return home, he sent for some new books to alleviate his grief,
 and in order to exhilarate his spirits, invited some men of letters to
 dine with him; when, like wasps attracted by a pot of honey, there came
 twice as many as he desired. These parasites were equally eager to eat
 and to speak; they praised two sorts of persons, the dead and
 themselves; but none of their contemporaries, except the master of the
 house. If any of them happened to drop a smart and witty expression, the
 rest cast down their eyes and bit their lips out of mere vexation that
 it had not been said by themselves. They had less dissimulation than the
 magi, because they had not such grand objects of ambition. Each of them
 behaved at once with all the meanness of a valet and all the dignity of
 a great man. They said to each other's face the most insulting things,
 which they took for strokes of wit. They had some knowledge of the
 design of Babouc's commission; one of them entreated him in a low voice
 to extirpate an author who had not praised him sufficiently about five
 years before; another requested the ruin of a citizen who had never
 laughed at his comedies; and the third demanded the destruction of the
 academy because he had not been able to get admitted into it. The repast
 being ended, each of them departed by himself; for in the whole crowd
 there were not two men that could endure the company or conversation of
 each other, except at the houses of the rich, who invited them to their
 tables. Babouc thought that it would be no great loss to the public if
 all these vermin were destroyed in the general catastrophe.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 Having now got rid of these men of letters, he began to read some new
 books, where he discovered the true spirit by which his guests had been
 actuated. He observed with particular indignation those slanderous
 gazettes, those archives of bad taste, dictated by envy, baseness, and
 hunger; those ungenerous satires, where the vulture is treated with
 lenity, and the dove torn in pieces; and those dry and insipid romances,
 filled with characters of women to whom the author was an utter
 stranger.
 
 All these detestable writings he committed to the flames, and went to
 pass the evening in walking. In this excursion he was introduced to an
 old man possessed of great learning, who had not come to increase the
 number of his parasites. This man of letters always fled from crowds;
 he understood human nature, availed himself of his knowledge, and
 imparted it to others with great discretion. Babouc told him how much he
 was grieved at what he had seen and read.
 
 "Thou hast read very despicable performances," said the man of letters;
 "but in all times, in all countries, and in all kinds of literature, the
 bad swarm and the good are rare. Thou hast received into thy house the
 very dregs of pedantry. In all professions, those who are least worthy
 of appearing are always sure to present themselves with the greatest
 impudence. The truly wise live among themselves in retirement and
 tranquillity; and we have still some men and some books worthy of thy
 attention."
 
 While he was thus speaking, they were joined by another man of letters;
 and the conversation became so entertaining and instructive, so elevated
 above vulgar prejudices, and so conformable to virtue, that Babouc
 acknowledged he had never heard the like.
 
 "These are men," said he to himself, "whom the angel Ithuriel will not
 presume to touch, or he must be a merciless being indeed."
 
 Though reconciled to men of letters, he was still enraged against the
 rest of the nation.
 
 "Thou art a stranger," said the judicious person who was talking to him;
 "abuses present themselves to thy eyes in crowds, while the good, which
 lies concealed, and which is even sometimes the result of these very
 abuses, escapes thy observation."
 
 He then learned that among men of letters there were some who were free
 from envy; and that even among the magi themselves there were some men
 of virtue. In fine, he concluded that these great bodies, which by their
 mutual shocks seemed to threaten their common ruin, were at bottom very
 salutary institutions; that each society of magi was a check upon its
 rivals; and that though these rivals might differ in some speculative
 points, they all taught the same morals, instructed the people, and
 lived in subjection to the laws; not unlike to those preceptors who
 watch over the heir of a family while the master of the house watches
 over them. He conversed with several of these magi, and found them
 possessed of exalted souls. He likewise learned that even among the
 fools who pretended to make war on the great lama there had been some
 men of distinguished merit; and from all these particulars he
 conjectured that it might be with the manners of Persepolis as it was
 with the buildings; some of which moved his pity, while others filled
 him with admiration.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 He said to the man of letters:
 
 "I plainly see that these magi, whom I at first imagined to be so
 dangerous, are in reality extremely useful; especially when a wise
 government hinders them from rendering themselves too necessary; but
 thou wilt at least acknowledge that your young magistrates, who purchase
 the office of a judge as soon as they can mount a horse, must display in
 their tribunals the most ridiculous impertinence and the most iniquitous
 perverseness. It would doubtless be better to give these places
 gratuitously to those old civilians who have spent their lives in the
 study of the law."
 
 The man of letters replied:
 
 "Thou hast seen our army before thy arrival at Persepolis; thou knowest
 that our young officers fight with great bravery, though they buy their
 posts; perhaps thou wilt find that our young magistrates do not give
 wrong decisions, though they purchase the right of dispensing justice."
 
 He led him next day to the grand tribunal, where an affair of great
 importance was to be decided. The cause was known to all the world. All
 the old advocates that spoke on the subject were wavering and unsettled
 in their opinions. They quoted an hundred laws, none of which were
 applicable to the question. They considered the matter in a hundred
 different lights, but never in its true point of view. The judges were
 more quick in their decisions than the advocates in raising doubts. They
 were unanimous in their sentiments. They decided justly, because they
 followed the light of reason. The others reasoned falsely because they
 only consulted their books.
 
 Babouc concluded that the best things frequently arose from abuses. He
 saw the same day that the riches of the receivers of the public revenue,
 at which he had been so much offended, were capable of producing an
 excellent effect; for the emperor having occasion for money, he found in
 an hour by their means what he could not have procured in six months by
 the ordinary methods. He saw that those great clouds, swelled with the
 dews of the earth, restored in plentiful showers what they had thence
 derived. Besides, the children of these new gentlemen, who were
 frequently better educated than those of the most ancient families, were
 sometimes more useful members of society; for he whose father hath been
 a good accountant may easily become a good judge, a brave warrior, and
 an able statesman.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 Babouc was insensibly brought to excuse the avarice of the farmer of the
 revenues, who in reality was not more avaricious than other men, and
 besides was extremely necessary. He overlooked the folly of those who
 ruined themselves in order to obtain a post in the law or army; a folly
 that produces great magistrates and heroes. He forgave the envy of men
 of letters, among whom there were some that enlightened the world; and
 he was reconciled to the ambitious and intriguing magi, who were
 possessed of more great virtues than little vices. But he had still many
 causes of complaint. The gallantries of the ladies especially, and the
 fatal effects which these must necessarily produce, filled him with fear
 and terror.
 
 As he was desirous of prying into the characters of men of every
 condition, he went to wait on a minister of state; but trembled all the
 way, lest some wife should be assassinated by her husband in his
 presence. Having arrived at the statesman's, he was obliged to remain
 two hours in the anti-chamber before his name was sent in, and two hours
 more after that was done. In this interval, he resolved to recommend to
 the angel Ithuriel both the minister and his insolent porters. The
 anti-chamber was filled with ladies of every rank, magi of all colors,
 judges, merchants, officers, and pedants, and all of them complained of
 the minister. The miser and the usurer said:
 
 "Doubtless this man plunders the provinces."
 
 The capricious reproached him with fickleness; the voluptuary said:
 
 "He thinks of nothing but his pleasure."
 
 The factious hoped to see him soon ruined by a cabal; and the women
 flattered themselves that they should soon have a younger minister.
 
 Babouc heard their conversation, and could not help saying:
 
 "This is surely a happy man; he hath all his enemies in his
 anti-chamber; he crushes with his power those that envy his grandeur; he
 beholds those who detest him groveling at his feet."
 
 At length he was admitted into the presence-chamber, where he saw a
 little old man bending under the weight of years and business, but still
 lively and full of spirits.
 
 The minister was pleased with Babouc, and to Babouc he appeared a man of
 great merit. The conversation became interesting. The minister confessed
 that he was very unhappy; that he passed for rich, while in reality he
 was poor; that he was believed to be all-powerful, and yet was
 constantly contradicted; that he had obliged none but a parcel of
 ungrateful wretches; and that, in the course of forty years labor, he
 had hardly enjoyed a moment's rest. Babouc was moved with his
 misfortunes; and thought that if this man had been guilty of some
 faults, and Ithuriel had a mind to banish him, he ought not to cut him
 off, but to leave him in possession of his place.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 While Babouc was talking to the minister, the beautiful lady with whom
 he had dined entered hastily, her eyes and countenance showing all the
 symptoms of grief and indignation. She burst into reproaches against the
 statesman; she shed tears; she complained bitterly that her husband had
 been refused a place to which his birth allowed him to aspire, and which
 he had fully merited by his wounds and his service. She expressed
 herself with such force; she uttered her complaints with such a graceful
 air; she overthrew objections with so much address, and enforced her
 arguments with so much eloquence, that she did not leave the chamber
 till she had made her husband's fortune.
 
 Babouc gave her his hand, and said: "Is it possible, madam, that thou
 canst take so much pains to serve a man whom thou dost not love, and
 from whom thou hast everything to fear?"
 
 "A man whom I do not love!" cried she "know, sir, that my husband is the
 best friend I have in the world; and there is nothing I would not
 sacrifice for him, except my own inclinations."
 
 The lady conducted Babouc to her own house. The husband, who had at last
 arrived overwhelmed with grief, received his wife with transports of joy
 and gratitude. He embraced by turns his wife, the little magi, and
 Babouc. Wit, harmony, cheerfulness, and all the graces, embellished the
 repast.
 
 Babouc, though a Scythian, and sent by a geni, found, that should he
 continue much longer in Persepolis, he would forget even the angel
 Ithuriel. He began to grow fond of a city, the inhabitants of which were
 polite, affable, and beneficent, though fickle, slanderous, and vain. He
 was much afraid that Persepolis would be condemned. He was even afraid
 to give in his account.
 
 This, however, he did in the following manner. He caused a little
 statue, composed of different metals, of earth, and stones, the most
 precious and the most vile, to be cast by one of the best founders in
 the city, and carried it to Ithuriel.
 
 "Wilt thou break," said he, "this pretty statue, because it is not
 wholly composed of gold and diamonds?"
 
 Ithuriel immediately understood his meaning, and resolved to think no
 more of punishing Persepolis, but to leave "The world as it goes."
 
 "For," said he, "if all is not well, all is passable."
 
 Thus Persepolis was suffered to remain; nor did Babouc complain like
 Jonas, who, [according to the scriptures,] was highly incensed at the
 preservation of Nineveh.
 
 
 [1] When Babouc visited the college of the magi, "the archimandrite [the
 chief of the monks] confessed to him, that he had an hundred thousand
 crowns a year for having taken the vow of poverty, and that he enjoyed a
 very extensive empire in virtue of his vow of humility." (See page
 365.)--E.

 The adventure of the youthful Rustan is generally known throughout the
 whole province of Candahar. He was the only son of a Mirza of that
 country. The title of Mirza there is much the same as that of Marquis
 among us, or that of Baron among the Germans. The mirza, his father, had
 a handsome fortune. Young Rustan was to be married to a mirzasse, or
 young lady of his own rank. The two families earnestly desired their
 union. Rustan was to become the comfort of his parents, to make his wife
 happy, and to live blest in her possession.
 
 But he had unfortunately seen the princess of Cachemire at the fair of
 Kaboul, which is the most considerable fair in the world, and much more
 frequented than those of Bassora and Astracan. The occasion that brought
 the old prince of Cachemire to the fair with his daughter was as
 follows:
 
 He had lost the two most precious curiosities of his treasury; one of
 them was a diamond as thick as a man's thumb, upon which the figure of
 his daughter was engraved by an art which was then possessed by the
 Indians, and has since been lost; the other was a javelin, which went of
 itself wherever its owner thought proper to send it. This is nothing
 very extraordinary among us, but it was thought so at Cachemire.
 
 A fakir belonging to his highness stole these two curiosities; he
 carried them to the princess:
 
 "Keep these two curiosities with the utmost care; your destiny depends
 upon them;" said he, and then departed.
 
 The Duke of Cachemire, in despair, resolved to visit the fair of Kaboul,
 in order to see whether there might not, among the merchants who go
 thither from all quarters of the world, be some one possessed of his
 diamond and his weapon. The princess carried his diamond well fastened
 to her girdle; but the javelin, which she could not so easily hide, she
 had carefully locked up at Cachemire, in a large chest.
 
 Rustan and she saw each other at Kaboul. They loved one another with all
 the sincerity of persons of their age, and all the tenderness of
 affection natural to those of their country. The princess gave Rustan
 her diamond as a pledge of her love, and he promised at his departure to
 go incognito to Cachemire, in order to pay her a visit.
 
 The young mirza had two favorites, who served him as secretaries,
 grooms, stewards, and valets de chambre. The name of one was Topaz; he
 was handsome, well-shaped, fair as a Circassian beauty, as mild and
 ready to serve as an Armenian, and as wise as a Gueber. The name of the
 other was Ebene; he was a very beautiful negro, more active and
 industrious than Topaz, and one that thought nothing difficult. The
 young mirza communicated his intention of traveling to these. Topaz
 endeavored to dissuade him from it, with the circumspect zeal of a
 servant who was unwilling to offend him. He represented to him the great
 danger to which he exposed himself. He asked him how he could leave two
 families in despair? how he could pierce the hearts of his parents? He
 shook the resolution of Rustan; but Ebene confirmed it anew, and
 obviated all his objections.
 
 The young man was not furnished with money to defray the charge of so
 long a voyage. The prudent Topaz would not have lent him any; Ebene
 supplied him. He with great address stole his master's diamond, made a
 false one exactly like it which he put in its place, and pledged the
 true one to an Armenian for several thousand rupees.
 
 As soon as the marquis possessed these rupees, all things were in
 readiness for his departure. An elephant was loaded with his baggage.
 His attendants mounted on horseback.
 
 Topaz said to his master: "I have taken the liberty to expostulate with
 you upon your enterprise, but after expostulating it is my duty to obey.
 I am devoted to you, I love you, I will follow you to the extremity of
 the earth; but let us by the way consult the oracle that is but two
 parasongs distant from here."
 
 Rustan consented. The answer returned by the oracle, was:
 
 "If you go to the east you will be at the west."
 
 Rustan could not guess the meaning of this answer. Topaz maintained that
 it boded no good. Ebene, always complaisant to his master, persuaded him
 that it was highly favorable.
 
 There was another oracle at Kaboul; they went to it. The oracle of
 Kaboul made answer in these words:
 
 "If you possess, you will cease to possess; if you are conqueror, you
 will not conquer, if you are Rustan, you will cease to be so."
 
 This oracle seemed still more unintelligible than the former.
 
 "Take care of yourself," said Topaz.
 
 "Fear nothing," said Ebene; and this minister, as may well be imagined,
 was always thought in the right by his master, whose passions and hopes
 he encouraged. Having left Kaboul, they passed through a vast forest.
 They seated themselves upon the grass in order to take a repast, and
 left their horses grazing. The attendants were preparing to unload the
 elephant which carried the dinner, the table, cloth, plates, &c., when,
 all on a sudden, Topaz and Ebene were perceived by the little caravan to
 be missing. They were called, the forest resounded with the names of
 Topaz and Ebene; the lackeys seek them on every side, and fill the
 forest with their cries; they return without having seen anything, and
 without having received any answer.
 
 "We have," said they to Rustan, "found nothing but a vulture that fought
 with an eagle, and stripped it of all its feathers."
 
 The mention of this combat excited the curiosity of Rustan; he went on
 foot to the place; he perceived neither vulture nor eagle; but he saw
 his elephant, which was still loaded with baggage, attacked by a huge
 rhinoceros: one struck with its horn, the other with its proboscis. The
 rhinoceros desisted upon seeing Rustan; his elephant was brought back,
 but his horses were not to be found.
 
 "Strange things happen in forests to travelers," cried Rustan.
 
 The servants were in great consternation, and the master in despair from
 having at once lost his horse, his dear negro, and the wise Topaz, for
 whom he still entertained a friendship, though always differing from him
 in opinion.
 
 The hope of being soon at the feet of the beautiful princess still
 consoled the mirza, who, journeying on, now met with a huge streaked
 ass, which a vigorous two-handed country clown beat with an oaken
 cudgel. The asses of this sort are extremely beautiful, very scarce, and
 beyond comparison swift in running. The ass resented the repeated blows
 of the clown by kicks which might have rooted up an oak. The young
 mirza, as was reasonable, took upon him the defence of the ass, which
 was a charming creature, the clown betook himself to flight, crying to
 the ass, "You shall pay for this."
 
 The ass thanked her deliverer in her own language, and approaching him,
 permitted his caresses and caressed him in her turn. After dinner,
 Rustan mounted her, and took the road to Cachemire with his servants,
 who followed him, some on foot and some upon the elephant. Scarce had he
 mounted his ass, when that animal turned toward Kaboul, instead of
 proceeding to Cachemire. It was to no purpose for her master to turn the
 bridle, to kick, to press the sides of the beast with his knees, to
 spur, to slacken the bridle, to pull toward him, to whip both on the
 right and the left. The obstinate animal persisted in running toward
 Kaboul.
 
 Rustan in despair fretted and raved, when he met with a dealer in
 camels, who said to him:
 
 "Master, you have there a very malicious beast, that carries you where
 you do not choose to go. If you will give it to me, I will give you the
 choice of four of my camels."
 
 Rustan thanked providence for having thrown so good a bargain in the
 way.
 
 "Topaz was very much in the wrong," said he, "to tell me that my journey
 would prove unprosperous."
 
 He mounts the handsome camel, the others follow; he rejoins his caravan
 and fancies himself on the road to happiness.
 
 Scarce had he journeyed four parasongs, when he was stopped by a deep,
 broad, and impetuous torrent, which rolled over huge rocks white with
 foam. The two banks were frightful precipices which dazzled the sight
 and made the blood run cold. To pass was impracticable; to go to the
 right or to the left was impossible.
 
 "I am beginning to be afraid," said Rustan, "that Topaz was in the right
 in blaming my journey, and that I was in the wrong in undertaking it. If
 he were still here he might give me good advice. If I had Ebene with me,
 he would comfort me and find expedients; but everything fails me."
 
 This perplexity was increased by the consternation of his attendants.
 The night was dark, and they passed it in lamentations. At last fatigue
 and dejection made the amorous traveler fall asleep. He awoke at
 day-break, and saw, spanning the torrent, a beautiful marble bridge
 which reached from shore to shore.
 
 Nothing was heard but exclamations, cries of astonishment and joy. Is it
 possible? Is this a dream? What a prodigy is this! What an enchantment!
 Shall we venture to pass? The whole company kneeled, rose up, went to
 the bridge, kissed the ground, looked up to heaven, stretched out their
 hands, set their feet on it with trembling, went to and fro, fell into
 ecstasies; and Rustan said:
 
 "At last heaven favors me. Topaz did not know what he was saying. The
 oracles were favorable to me. Ebene was in the right, but why is he not
 here?"
 
 Scarce had the company got beyond the torrent, when the bridge sunk into
 the water with a prodigious noise.
 
 "So much the better, so much the better," cried Rustan. "Praised be God,
 blessed be heaven; it would not have me return to my country, where I
 should be nothing more than a gentleman. The intention of heaven is,
 that I should wed her I love. I shall become prince of Cachemire; thus
 in possessing my mistress I shall cease to possess my little marquisate
 at Candahar. 'I shall be Rustan, and I shall not be Rustan,' because I
 shall have become a great prince: thus is a great part of the oracle
 clearly explained in my favor. The rest will be explained in the same
 manner. I am very happy. But why is not Ebene with me? I regret him a
 thousand times more than Topaz."
 
 He proceeded a few parasongs farther with the greatest alacrity
 imaginable; but, at the close of day, a chain of mountains more rugged
 than a counterscarp, and higher than the tower of Babel would have been
 had it been finished, stopped the passage of the caravan, which was
 again seized with dread.
 
 All the company cried out: "It is the will of God that we perish here!
 he broke the bridge merely to take from us all hopes of returning; he
 raised the mountain for no other reason than to deprive us of all means
 of advancing. Oh, Rustan! oh, unhappy marquis! we shall never see
 Cachemire; we shall never return to the land of Candahar."
 
 The most poignant anguish, the most insupportable dejection, succeeded
 in the soul of Rustan, to the immoderate joy which he had felt, to the
 hopes with which he had intoxicated himself. He was no longer disposed
 to interpret the prophecies in his favor.
 
 "Oh, heavens! oh, God of my fathers!" said he, "must I then lose my
 friend Topaz!"
 
 As he pronounced these words, fetching deep sighs and shedding tears in
 the midst of his disconsolate followers, the base of the mountain
 opened, a long gallery appeared to the dazzled eyes in a vault lighted
 with a hundred thousand torches. Rustan immediately begins to exult, and
 his people to throw themselves upon their knees and to fall upon their
 backs in astonishment, and cry out, "A miracle! a miracle! Rustan is the
 favorite of Witsnow, the well-beloved of Brahma. He will become the
 master of mankind."
 
 Rustan believed it; he was quite beside himself; he was raised above
 himself.
 
 "Alas, Ebene," said he, "my dear Ebene, where are you? Why are you not
 witness of all these wonders? How did I lose you? Beauteous princess of
 Cachemire, when shall I again behold your charms!"
 
 He advances with his attendants, his elephants, and his camels, under
 the hollow of the mountain; at the end of which he enters into a meadow
 enameled with flowers and encompassed with rivulets. At the extremity of
 the meadows are walks of trees to the end of which the eye cannot reach,
 and at the end of these alleys is a river, on the sides of which are a
 thousand pleasure houses with delicious gardens. He everywhere hears
 concerts of vocal and instrumental music; he sees dances; he makes haste
 to go upon one of the bridges of the river; he asks the first man he
 meets what fine country that is?
 
 He whom he addressed himself to answered:
 
 "You are in the province of Cachemire; you see the inhabitants immersed
 in joy and pleasure. We celebrate the marriage of our beauteous
 princess, who is going to be married to the lord Barbabou, to whom her
 father promised her. May God perpetuate their felicity!"
 
 At these words Rustan fainted away, and the Cachemirian lord thought he
 was troubled with the falling sickness. He caused him to be carried to
 his house, where he remained a long time insensible. He sent in search
 of the two most able physicians in that part of the country. They felt
 the patient's pulse, who having somewhat recovered his spirits, sobbed,
 rolled his eyes, and cried from time to time, "Topaz, Topaz, you were
 entirely in the right!"
 
 One of the two physicians said to the Cachemirian lord:
 
 "I perceive, by this young man's accent, that he is from Candahar, and
 that the air of this country is hurtful to him. He must be sent home. I
 perceive by his eyes that he has lost his senses. Entrust me with him, I
 will carry him back to his own country, and cure him."
 
 The other physician maintained that grief was his only disorder; and
 that it was proper to carry him to the wedding of the princess, and make
 him dance. Whilst they were in consultation, the patient recovered his
 health. The two physicians were dismissed, and Rustan remained along
 with his host.
 
 "My lord," said he, "I ask your pardon for having been so free as to
 faint in your presence. I know it to be a breach of politeness. I
 entreat you to accept of my elephant, as an acknowledgment of the
 kindness you have shown me."
 
 He then related to him all his adventure, taking particular care to
 conceal from him the occasion of his journey.
 
 "But, in the name of Witsnow and Brahma," said he to him, "tell me who
 is this happy Barbabou, who is to marry the princess of Cachemire? Why
 has her father chosen him for his son-in-law, and why has the princess
 accepted of him for an husband?"
 
 "Sir," answered the Cachemirian, "the princess has by no means accepted
 of Barbabou. She is, on the contrary, in tears, whilst the whole
 province joyfully celebrates her marriage. She has shut herself up in a
 tower of her palace. She does not choose to see any of the rejoicings
 made upon the occasion."
 
 Rustan, at hearing this, perceived himself revived. The bloom of his
 complexion, which grief had caused to fade, appeared again upon his
 countenance.
 
 "Tell me, I entreat you," continued he, "why the prince of Cachemire is
 obstinately bent upon giving his daughter to lord Barbabou whom she does
 not love?"
 
 "This is the fact," answered the Cachemirian. "Do you know that our
 august prince lost a large diamond and a javelin which he considered as
 of great value?"
 
 "Ah! I very well know that," said Rustan.
 
 "Know then," said his host, "that our prince, being in despair at not
 having heard of his two precious curiosities, after having caused them
 to be sought for all over the world, promised his daughter to whoever
 should bring him either the one or the other. A lord Barbabou came who
 had the diamond, and he is to marry the princess to-morrow."
 
 Rustan turned pale, stammered out a compliment, took leave of his host,
 and galloped upon his dromedary to the capital city, where the ceremony
 was to be performed. He arrives at the palace of the prince, he tells
 him he has something of importance to communicate to him, he demands an
 audience. He is told that the prince is taken up with the preparations
 for the wedding.
 
 "It is for that very reason," said he, "that I am desirous of speaking
 to him." Such is his importunity, that he is at last admitted.
 
 "Prince," said he, "may God crown all your days with glory and
 magnificence! Your son-in-law is a knave."
 
 "What! a knave! how dare you speak in such terms? Is that a proper way
 of speaking to a duke of Cachemire of a son-in-law of whom he has made
 choice?"
 
 "Yes, he is a knave," continued Rustan; "and to prove it to your
 highness, I have brought you back your diamond."
 
 The duke, surprised at what he heard, compared the two diamonds; and as
 he was no judge of precious stones, he could not determine which was the
 true one.
 
 "Here are two diamonds," said he, "and I have but one daughter, I am in
 a strange perplexity."
 
 He sent for Harbabou, and asked him if he had not imposed upon him,
 Harbabou swore he had bought his diamond from an Armenian; the other did
 not tell him who he had his from; but he proposed an expedient, which
 was that he should engage his rival in single combat.
 
 "It is not enough for your son-in-law to give a diamond," said he, "he
 should also give proofs of valor. Do not you think it just that he who
 kills his rival should marry the princess?"
 
 "Undoubtedly," answered the prince. "It will be a fine sight for the
 court. Fight directly. The conqueror shall take the arms of the
 conquered according to the customs of Cachemire, and he shall marry my
 daughter."
 
 The two pretenders to the hand of the princess go down into the court.
 Upon the stairs there was a jay and a raven. The raven cried, "Fight,
 fight." The jay cried, "Don't fight."
 
 This made the prince laugh; the two rivals scarce took any notice of it.
 They begin the combat. All the courtiers made a circle round them. The
 princess, who kept herself constantly shut up in her tower, did not
 choose to behold this sight. She never dreampt that her lover was at
 Cachemire, and she hated Barbabou to such a degree, that she could not
 bear the sight of him. The combat had the happiest result imaginable.
 Barbabou was killed outright; and this greatly rejoiced the people,
 because he was ugly and Rustan was very handsome. The favor of the
 public is almost always determined by this circumstance.
 
 The conqueror put on the coat of mail, scarf, and the casque of the
 conquered, and came, followed by the whole court, to present himself
 under the windows of his mistress. The multitude cried aloud: "Beautiful
 princess, come and see your handsome lover, who has killed his ugly
 rival." These words were re-echoed by her women. The princess unluckily
 looked out of the window, and seeing the armor of a man she hated, she
 ran like one frantic to her strong box and took out the fatal javelin,
 which flew to pierce Rustan, notwithstanding his cuirass. He cried out
 loudly, and at this cry the princess thought she again knew the voice of
 her unhappy lover.
 
 She ran down stairs, with her hair disheveled, and death in her eyes as
 well as her heart. Rustan had already fallen, all bloody, into the arms
 of his attendants. She sees him. Oh, moment! oh, sight! oh, discovery of
 inexpressible grief, tenderness and horror! She throws herself upon him,
 and embraces him.
 
 "You receive," said she, "the first and last kisses of your mistress and
 your murderer."
 
 She pulls the dart from the wound, plunges it in her heart, and dies
 upon the body of the lover whom she adores. The father, terrified, in
 despair, and ready to die like his daughter, tries in vain to bring her
 to life. She was no more. He curses the fatal dart, breaks it to pieces,
 throws away the two fatal diamonds; and whilst he prepared the funeral
 of his daughter instead of her marriage, he caused Rustan, who weltered
 in his blood and had still some remains of life, to be carried to his
 palace.
 
 He was put into bed. The first objects he saw on each side of his
 deathbed were Topaz and Ebene. This surprise made him in some degree
 recover his strength.
 
 "Cruel men," said he, "why did you abandon me? Perhaps the princess
 would still be alive if you had been with the unhappy Rustan."
 
 "I have not forsaken you a moment," said Topaz.
 
 "I have always been with you," said Ebene.
 
 "Ah! what do you say? why do you insult me in my last moments?" answered
 Rustan, with a languishing voice.
 
 "You may believe me," said Topaz. "You know I never approved of this
 fatal journey, the dreadful consequences of which I foresaw. I was the
 eagle that fought with the vulture and stripped it of its feathers; I
 was the elephant that carried away the baggage, in order to force you to
 return to your own country; I was the streaked ass that carried you,
 whether you would or no, to your father; it was I that made your horses
 go astray; it was I that caused the torrent that prevented your passage;
 it was I that raised the mountain which stopped up a road so fatal to
 you; I was the physician that advised you to return to your own country;
 I was the jay that cried to you not to fight."
 
 "And I," said Ebene, "was the vulture that he stripped of his feathers,
 the rhinoceros who gave him a hundred strokes with the horn, the clown
 that beat the streaked ass, the merchant who made you a present of
 camels to hasten you to your destruction; I dug the cavern that you
 crossed, I am the physician that encouraged you to walk, the raven that
 cried out to you to combat."
 
 "Alas!" said Topaz, "remember the oracles: 'If you go to the east you
 will be at the west.'"
 
 "Yes," said Ebene, "here the dead are buried with their faces turned to
 the west. The oracle was plain enough, though you did not understand it.
 You possessed, and you did not possess; for though you had the diamond,
 it was a false one, and you did not know it. You are conqueror, and you
 die; you are Rustan, and you cease to be so: all has been accomplished."
 
 Whilst he spoke thus, four white wings covered the body of Topaz, and
 four black ones that of Ebene.
 
 "What do I see?" cried Rustan.
 
 Topaz and Ebene answered together: "You see your two geniuses."
 
 "Good gentlemen," cried the unhappy Rustan, "how came you to meddle; and
 what occasion had a poor man for two geniuses?"
 
 "It is a law," answered Topaz; "every man has too geniuses. Plato was
 the first man who said so, and others have repeated it after him. You
 see that nothing can be more true. I who now speak to you, am your good
 genius. I was charged to watch over you to the last moment of your life.
 Of this task I have faithfully acquitted myself."
 
 "But," said the dying man, "if your business was to serve me, I am of a
 nature much superior to yours. And then how can you have the assurance
 to say you are my good genius, since you have suffered me to be deceived
 in everything I have undertaken, and since you suffer both my mistress
 and me to die miserably?"
 
 "Alas!" said Topaz, "it was your destiny."
 
 "If destiny does all," answered the dying man, "what is a genius good
 for? And you, Ebene, with your four black wings, you are, doubtless, my
 evil genius."
 
 "You have hit it," answered Ebene.
 
 "Then I suppose you were the evil genius of my princess likewise," said
 Rustan.
 
 "No," replied Ebene, "she had an evil genius of her own, and I seconded
 him perfectly."
 
 "Ah! cursed Ebene," said Rustan, "if you are so malicious, you don't
 belong to the same master with Topaz: you have been formed by two
 different principles, one of which is by nature good, the other evil."
 
 "That does not follow," said Ebene, "this is a very knotty point."
 
 "It is not possible," answered the dying man, "that a benevolent being
 could create so destructive a genius."
 
 "Possible or not possible," replied the genius, "the thing is just as I
 say."
 
 "Alas!" said Topaz, "my poor unfortunate friend, don't you see that that
 rogue is so malicious as to encourage you to dispute, in order to
 inflame your blood and hasten your death?"
 
 "Get you gone," said the melancholy Rustan, "I am not much better
 satisfied with you than with him. He at least acknowledges that it was
 his intention to hurt me; and you, who pretended to defend me, have done
 me no service at all."
 
 "I am very sorry for it," said the good genius.
 
 "And I too," said the dying man; "there is something at the bottom of
 all this which I cannot comprehend."
 
 "Nor I neither," said the good genius.
 
 "I shall know the truth of the matter in a moment," said Rustan. "We
 shall see that," said Topaz.
 
 The whole scene then vanished. Rustan again found himself in the house
 of his father, which he had not quitted, and in his bed, where he had
 slept an hour.
 
 He awakes in astonishment, perspiring all over, and quite wild. He rubs
 himself, he calls, he rings the bell. His valet de chambre, Topaz, runs
 in, in his nightcap, and yawning.
 
 "Am I dead or alive?" cried out Rustan, "shall the beauteous princess of
 Cachemire escape?
 
 "Does your lordship rave?" answered Topaz, coldly.
 
 "Ah!" cried Rustan, "what then is become of this barbarous Ebene, with
 his four black wings! It is he that makes me die by so cruel a death."
 
 "My lord," answered Topaz, "I left him snoring up stairs. Would you have
 me bid him come down?"
 
 "The villain," said Rustan, "has persecuted me for six months together.
 It was he who carried me to the fatal fair of Kaboul; it is he that
 cheated me of the diamond which the princess presented me; he is the
 sole cause of my journey, of the death of my princess, and of the wound
 with a javelin, of which I die in the flower of my age."
 
 "Take heart," said Topaz, "you were never at Kaboul; there is no
 princess of Cachemire; her father never had any children but two boys,
 who are now at college; you never had a diamond; the princess cannot be
 dead, because she never was born; and you are in perfect health."
 
 "What! is it not then true that you attended me whilst dying, and in the
 bed of the prince of Cachemire? Did you not acknowledge to me, that, in
 order to preserve me from so many dangers, you were an eagle, an
 elephant, a streaked ass, a physician, and a jay?"
 
 "My lord, you have dreampt all this," answered Topaz; "our ideas are no
 more of our own creating whilst we are asleep than whilst we are awake.
 God has thought proper that this train of ideas should pass in your
 head, most probably to convey some instruction to you, of which you may
 make a good use."
 
 "You make a jest of me," replied Rustan, "how long have I slept?"
 
 "My lord," said Topaz, "you have not yet slept an hour."
 
 "Cursed reasoner," returned Rustan, "how is it possible that I could be
 in the space of an hour at the fair of Kaboul six months ago; that I
 could have returned from thence, have traveled to Cachemire, and that
 Barbabou, the princess, and I, should have died?"
 
 "My lord," said Topaz, "nothing can be more easy and more common; and
 you might have traveled around the world, and have met with a great many
 more adventures in much less time. Is it not true that you can, in an
 hour's time, read the abridgment of the Persian history, written by
 Zoroaster? yet this abridgment contains eight hundred thousand years.
 All these events pass before your eyes one after another, in an hour's
 time. Now you must acknowledge, that it is as easy to Brahma to confine
 them to the space of an hour, as to extend them to the space of eight
 hundred thousand years. It is exactly the same thing. Imagine to
 yourself that time turns upon a wheel whose diameter is infinite. Under
 this vast wheel is a numerous multitude of wheels one within another.
 That in the centre is imperceptible, and goes round an infinite number
 of times, whilst the great wheel performs but one revolution. It is
 evident that all the events which have happened from the beginning of
 the world, to its end, might have happened in much less time than the
 hundred thousandth part of a second; and one may even go so far as to
 assert that the thing is so."
 
 "I cannot comprehend all this," said Rustan.
 
 "If you want information," said Topaz, "I have a parrot that will easily
 explain it to you. He was born some time before the deluge; he has been
 in the ark; he has seen a great deal; yet he is but a year and a half
 old. He will relate to you his history, which is extremely interesting."
 
 "Go fetch your parrot," said Rustan, "it will amuse me till I again find
 myself disposed to sleep."
 
 "It is with my sister, the nun," said Topaz: "I will go and fetch it. It
 will please you; its memory is faithful, it relates in a simple manner,
 without endeavoring to show wit at every turn."
 
 "So much the better," said Rustan, "I like that manner of telling
 stories."
 
 The parrot being brought to him, spoke in this manner:
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 N.B. Mademoiselle Catherine Vade could never find the history of the
 parrot in the commonplace-book of her late cousin Anthony Vade, author
 of that tale. This is a great misfortune, considering what age that
 parrot lived in.

 MEMNON THE PHILOSOPHER.
 
 
 Memnon one day took it into his head to become a great philosopher. "To
 be perfectly happy," said he to himself, "I have nothing to do but to
 divest myself entirely of passions; and nothing is more easy, as
 everybody knows. In the first place, I will never be in love; for, when
 I see a beautiful woman, I will say to myself, these cheeks will one day
 grow sallow and wrinkled, these eyes be encircled with vermilion, that
 bosom become lean and emaciated, that head bald and palsied. Now I have
 only to consider her at present in imagination as she will afterwards
 appear in reality, and certainly a fair face will never turn my head.
 
 "In the second place, I shall always be temperate. It will be in vain to
 tempt me with good cheer, with delicious wines, or the charms of
 society, I will have only to figure to myself the consequences of
 excess--an aching head, a loathing stomach, the loss of reason, of
 health, and of time: I will then only eat to supply the waste of nature;
 my health will be always equal, my ideas pure and luminous. All this is
 so easy that there is no merit in accomplishing it."
 
 "But," says Memnon, "I must think a little of how I am to regulate my
 fortune: why, my desires are moderate, my wealth is securely placed with
 the Receiver General of the finances of Nineveh. I have wherewithal to
 live independent; and that is the greatest of blessings. I shall never
 be under the cruel necessity of dancing attendance at court. I will
 never envy any one, and nobody will envy me. Still all this is easy. I
 have friends, and I will preserve them, for we shall never have any
 difference. I will never take amiss anything they may say or do; and
 they will behave in the same way to me. There is no difficulty in all
 this."
 
 Having thus laid this little plan of philosophy in his closet, Memnon
 put his head out of the window. He saw two women walking under the
 plane-trees near his house. The one was old, and appeared quite at her
 ease. The other was young, handsome, and seemingly much agitated. She
 sighed, she wept, and seemed on that account still more beautiful. Our
 philosopher was touched, not, to be sure, with the lady, (he was too
 much determined not to feel any uneasiness of that kind) but with the
 distress which he saw her in. He came down stairs, and accosted the
 young Ninevite, designing to console her with philosophy. That lovely
 person related to him, with an air of the greatest simplicity, and in
 the most affecting manner, the injuries she sustained from an imaginary
 uncle--with what art he had deprived her of some imaginary property, and
 of the violence which she pretended to dread from him.
 
 "You appear to me," said she, "a man of such wisdom, that if you will
 come to my house and examine into my affairs, I am persuaded you will be
 able to relieve me from the cruel embarrassment I am at present involved
 in."
 
 Memnon did not hesitate to follow her, to examine her affairs
 philosophically, and to give her sound counsel.
 
 The afflicted lady led him into a perfumed chamber, and politely made
 him sit down with her on a large sofa, where they both placed themselves
 opposite to each other, in the attitude of conversation; the one eager
 in telling her story, the other listening with devout attention. The
 lady spoke with downcast eyes, whence there sometimes fell a tear, and
 which, as she now and then ventured to raise them, always met those of
 the sage Memnon. Their discourse was full of tenderness, which redoubled
 as often as their eyes met. Memnon took her affairs exceedingly to
 heart, and felt himself every instant more and more inclined to oblige a
 person so virtuous and so unhappy. By degrees, in the warmth of
 conversation they drew nearer. Memnon counseled her with great wisdom,
 and gave her most tender advice.
 
 At this interesting moment, as may easily be imagined, who should come
 in but the uncle. He was armed from head to foot, and the first thing he
 said was, that he would immediately sacrifice, as was just, both Memnon
 and his niece. The latter, who made her escape, knew that he was
 disposed to pardon, provided a good round sum were offered to him.
 Memnon was obliged to purchase his safety with all he had about him. In
 those days people were happy in getting so easily quit. America was not
 then discovered, and distressed ladies were not then so dangerous as
 they are now.
 
 Memnon, covered with shame and confusion, got home to his own house. He
 there found a card inviting him to dinner with some of his intimate
 friends.
 
 "If I remain at home alone," said he, "I shall have my mind so occupied
 with this vexatious adventure, that I shall not be able to eat a bit,
 and I shall bring upon myself some disease. It will therefore be prudent
 in me to go to my intimate friends and partake with them of a frugal
 repast. I shall forget, in the sweets of their society, the folly I have
 this morning been guilty of."
 
 Accordingly he attends the meeting; he is discovered to be uneasy at
 something, and he is urged to drink and banish care.
 
 "A little wine, drank in moderation, comforts the heart of God and man:"
 so reasoned Memnon the philosopher, and he became intoxicated. After the
 repast, play is proposed.
 
 "A little play, with one's intimate friends, is a harmless pastime." He
 plays and loses all in his purse, and four times as much on his word. A
 dispute arises on some circumstance in the game, and the disputants grow
 warm. One of his intimate friends throws a dice-box at his head, and
 strikes out one of his eyes. The philosopher Memnon is carried home
 drunk and penniless, with the loss of an eye.
 
 He sleeps out his debauch, and, when his head becomes clear, he sends
 his servant to the Receiver General of the finances of Nineveh, to draw
 a little money to pay his debt of honor to his intimate friends. The
 servant returns and informs him, that the Receiver General had that
 morning been declared a fraudulent bankrupt, and that by this means an
 hundred families are reduced to poverty and despair. Memnon, almost
 beside himself, puts a plaster on his eye and a petition in his pocket,
 and goes to court to solicit justice from the king against the bankrupt.
 In the saloon he meets a number of ladies, all in the highest spirits,
 and sailing along with hoops four-and-twenty feet in circumference. One
 of them, slightly acquainted with him, eyed him askance, and cried
 aloud: "Ah! what a horrid monster!"
 
 Another, who was better acquainted with him, thus accosts him:
 "Good-morrow, Mr. Memnon, I hope you are well, Mr. Memnon. La! Mr.
 Memnon, how did you lose your eye?" and turning upon her heel, she
 tripped unconcernedly away.
 
 Memnon hid himself in a corner, and waited for the moment when he could
 throw himself at the feet of the monarch. That moment at last arrived.
 Three times he kissed the earth, and presented his petition. His
 gracious majesty received him very favorably, and referred the paper to
 one of his satraps. The satrap takes Memnon aside, and says to him with
 a haughty air and satirical grin:
 
 "Hark ye, you fellow with the one eye, you must be a comical dog indeed,
 to address yourself to the king rather than to me: and still more so, to
 dare to demand justice against an honest bankrupt, whom I honor with my
 protection, and who is also a nephew to the waiting-maid of my mistress.
 Proceed no further in this business, my good friend, if you wish to
 preserve the eye you have left."
 
 Memnon having thus, in his closet, resolved to renounce women, the
 excess of the table, play, and quarreling, but especially having
 determined never to go to court, had been in the short space of
 four-and-twenty hours duped and robbed by a gentle dame, had got drunk,
 had gamed, had been engaged in a quarrel, had got his eye knocked out,
 and had been at court, where he was sneered at and insulted.
 
 Petrified with astonishment, and his heart broken with grief, Memnon
 returns homeward in despair. As he was about to enter his house, he is
 repulsed by a number of officers who are carrying off his furniture for
 the benefit of his creditors. He falls down almost lifeless under a
 plane-tree. There he finds the fair dame of the morning, who was walking
 with her dear uncle; and both set up a loud laugh on seeing Memnon with
 his plaster. The night approached, and Memnon made his bed on some straw
 near the walls of his house. Here the ague seized him, and he fell
 asleep in one of the fits, when a celestial spirit appeared to him in a
 dream.
 
 It was all resplendent with light: it had six beautiful wings, but
 neither feet, nor head, and could be likened to nothing.
 
 "What art thou?" said Memnon.
 
 "Thy good genius," replied the spirit.
 
 "Restore me then my eye, my health, my fortune, my reason," said Memnon;
 and he related how he had lost them all in one day. "These are
 adventures which never happen to us in the world we inhabit," said the
 spirit.
 
 "And what world do you inhabit?" said the man of affliction.
 
 "My native country," replied the other, "is five hundred millions of
 leagues distant from the sun, in a little star near Sirius, which you
 see from hence."
 
 "Charming country!" said Memnon. "And are there indeed with you no jades
 to dupe a poor devil, no intimate friends that win his money and knock
 out an eye for him, no fraudulent bankrupts, no satraps, that make a
 jest of you while they refuse you justice?"
 
 "No," said the inhabitant of the star, "we have nothing of the kind. We
 are never duped by women, because we have none among us; we never commit
 excesses at table, because we neither eat nor drink; we have no
 bankrupts, because with us there is neither silver nor gold; our eyes
 cannot be knocked out, because we have not bodies in the form of yours;
 and satraps never do us injustice, because in our world we are all
 equal."
 
 "Pray my lord," said Memnen, "without women and without eating how do
 you spend your time?"
 
 "In watching, over the other worlds that are entrusted to us; and I am
 now come to give you consolation."
 
 "Alas!" replied Memnon, "why did you not come yesterday to hinder me
 from committing so many indiscretions?"
 
 "I was with your elder brother Hassan," said the celestial being. "He is
 still more to be pitied than you are. His most gracious majesty, the
 sultan of the Indies, in whose court he has the honor to serve, has
 caused both his eyes to be put out for some small indiscretion; and he
 is now in a dungeon, his hands and feet loaded with chains."
 
 "'Tis a happy thing, truly," said Memnon, "to have a good genius in
 one's family, when out of two brothers, one is blind of an eye, the
 other blind of both; one stretched upon straw, the other in a dungeon."
 
 "Your fate will soon change," said the spirit of the star. "It is true
 you will never recover your eye; but, except that, you may be
 sufficiently happy if you never again take it into your head to be a
 perfect philosopher."
 
 "Is it then impossible?" said Memnon.
 
 "As impossible as to be perfectly wise, perfectly strong, perfectly
 powerful, perfectly happy. We ourselves are very far from it. There is a
 world indeed where all this takes place; but, in the hundred thousand
 millions of worlds dispersed over the regions of space, everything goes
 on by degrees. There is less philosophy and less enjoyment in the second
 than in the first, less in the third than in the second, and so forth
 till the last in the scale, where all are completely fools."
 
 "I am afraid," said Memnon, "that our little terraqueous globe here is
 the madhouse of those hundred thousand millions of worlds, of which your
 lordship does me the honor to speak."
 
 "Not quite," said the spirit, "but very nearly; everything must be in
 its proper place."
 
 "But are those poets and philosophers wrong, then, who tell us that
 everything is for the best?"
 
 "No, they are right, when we consider things in relation to the
 gradation of the whole universe."
 
 "Oh! I shall never believe it till I recover my eye again," said the
 unfortunate Memnon.
 
 
 [1] The above engraving from Chamber's Guide to the British Museum,
 represents a head and bust of Memnon, "formed of a single block of fine
 syene granite, one piece of which is red, while the rest is blue or
 grayish. The sculptor, with admirable taste, used the red part for the
 head, and the darker part for the breast. Although the statue has all
 the characteristics of Egyptian sculpture--the projecting eyes, thick
 lips, high ears, and small chin--yet such is the beauty of the
 execution, so much sweetness and mildness is there in the expression of
 the countenance, that the effect is, on the whole, extremely pleasing.
 Here, in short, we have the masterpiece of some Egyptian sculptor of
 superior genius, whose name has perished. Here also, if we are to accept
 the statue as a genuine likeness, we behold the features of the great
 Egyptian Pharaoh, at whose name, some fourteen centuries before Christ,
 the Mediterranean nations trembled. Doubtless on such a subject the
 sculptor would do his best; striving, while transmitting the features of
 the hero to posterity, to produce also a countenance that would be the
 ideal of Egyptian beauty."--E.

 ANDRÉ DES TOUCHES AT SIAM.
 
 
 André Des Touches was a very agreeable musician in the brilliant reign
 of Louis XIV. before the science of music was perfected by Rameau; and
 before it was corrupted by those who prefer the art of surmounting
 difficulties to nature and the real graces of composition.
 
 Before he had recourse to these talents he had been a musketeer, and
 before that, in 1688, he went into Siam with the Jesuit Tachard, who
 gave him many marks of his affection, for the amusement he afforded on
 board the ship; and Des Touches spoke with admiration of father Tachard
 for the rest of his life.
 
 At Siam he became acquainted with the first commissary of Barcalon,
 whose name was Croutef; and he committed to writing most of those
 questions which he asked of Croutef, and the answers of that Siamese.
 They are as follows:
 
 DES TOUCHES.--How many soldiers have you?
 
 CROUTEF.--Fourscore thousand, very indifferently paid.
 
 DES TOUCHES.--And how many Talapolins?
 
 CROUTEF.--A hundred and twenty thousand, very idle and very rich. It is
 true that in the last war we were beaten, but our Talapolins have lived
 sumptuously, and built fine houses.
 
 DES TOUCHES.--Nothing could have discovered more judgment. And your
 finances, in what state are they?
 
 CROUTEF.--In a very bad state. We have, however, about ninety thousand
 men employed to render them prosperous, and if they have not succeeded,
 it has not been their fault; for there is not one of them who does not
 honorably seize all that he can get possession of, and strip and plunder
 those who cultivate the ground for the good of the state.
 
 DES TOUCHES.--Bravo! And is not your jurisprudence as perfect as the
 rest of your administration?
 
 CROUTEF.--It is much superior. We have no laws, but we have five or six
 thousand volumes on the laws. We are governed in general by customs; for
 it is known that a custom, having been established by chance, is the
 wisest principle that can be imagined. Besides, all customs being
 necessarily different in different provinces, the judges may choose at
 their pleasure a custom which prevailed four hundred years ago, or one
 which prevailed last year. It occasions a variety in our legislation,
 which our neighbors are forever admiring. This yields a certain fortune
 to practitioners. It is a resource for all pleaders who are destitute of
 honor, and a pastime of infinite amusement for the judges, who can with
 safe consciences decide causes without understanding them.
 
 DES TOUCHES.--But in criminal cases--you have laws which may be depended
 upon.
 
 CROUTEF.--God forbid! We can condemn men to exile, to the galleys, to be
 hanged; or we can discharge them, according to our own fancy. We
 sometimes complain of the arbitrary power of the Barcalon; but we choose
 that all our decisions should be arbitrary.
 
 DES TOUCHES.--That is very just. And the torture--do you put people to
 the torture?
 
 CROUTEF.--It is our greatest pleasure. We have found it an infallible
 secret to save a guilty person, who has vigorous muscles, strong and
 supple hamstrings, nervous arms, and firm loins; and we gaily break on
 the wheel all those innocent persons to whom nature has given feeble
 organs. It is thus we conduct ourselves with wonderful wisdom and
 prudence. As there are half proofs, I mean half truths, it is certain
 there are persons who are half innocent and half guilty. We commence,
 therefore, by rendering them half dead; we then go to breakfast;
 afterwards ensues entire death, which gives us great consideration in
 the world, which is one of the most valuable advantages of our offices.
 
 DES TOUCHES.--It must be allowed that nothing can be more prudent and
 humane. Pray tell me what becomes of the property of the condemned?
 
 CROUTEF.--The children are deprived of it. For you know that nothing can
 be more equitable than to punish the single fault of a parent on all his
 descendants.
 
 DES TOUCHES.--Yes. It is a great while since I have heard of this
 jurisprudence.
 
 CROUTEF.--The people of Laos, our neighbors, admit neither the torture,
 nor arbitrary punishments, nor the different customs, nor the horrible
 deaths which are in use among us; but we regard them as barbarians who
 have no idea of good government. All Asia is agreed that we dance the
 best of all its inhabitants, and that, consequently, it is impossible
 they should come near us in jurisprudence, in commerce, in finance, and,
 above all, in the military art.
 
 DES TOUCHES.--Tell me, I beseech you, by what steps men arrive at the
 magistracy in Siam.
 
 CROUTEF.--By ready money. You perceive that it may be impossible to be a
 good judge, if a man has not by him thirty or forty thousand pieces of
 silver. It is in vain a man may be perfectly acquainted with all our
 customs; it is to no purpose that he has pleaded five hundred causes
 with success--that he has a mind which is the seat of judgment, and a
 heart replete with justice; no man can become a magistrate without
 money. This, I say, is the circumstance which distinguishes us from all
 Asia, and particularly from the barbarous inhabitants of Laos, who have
 the madness to recompense all kinds of talents, and not to sell any
 employment.
 
 André des Touches, who was a little off his guard, said to the Siamese,
 that most of the airs which he had just sung sounded discordant to him;
 and wished to receive information concerning real Siamese music. But
 Croutef, full of his subject, and enthusiastic for his country,
 continued in these words:
 
 "What does it signify that our neighbors, who live beyond our mountains,
 have better music than we have, or better pictures; provided we have
 always wise and humane laws? It is in that circumstance we excel. For
 example:
 
 "If a man has adroitly stolen three or four hundred thousand pieces of
 gold, we respect him, and we go and dine with him. But if a poor servant
 gets awkwardly into his possession three or four pieces of copper out of
 his mistress's box, we never fail of putting that servant to a public
 death; first, lest he should not correct himself; secondly, that he may
 not have it in his power to produce a great number of children for the
 state, one or two of whom might possibly steal a few little pieces of
 copper, or become great men; thirdly, because it is just to proportion
 the punishment to the crime, and that it would be ridiculous to give any
 useful employment in a prison to a person guilty of so enormous a crime.
 
 "But we are still more just, more merciful, more reasonable in the
 chastisements which we inflict on those who have the audacity to make
 use of their legs to go wherever they choose. We treat those warriors so
 well who sell us their lives, we give them so prodigious a salary, they
 have so considerable a part in our conquests, that they must be the most
 criminal of all men to wish to return to their parents on the recovery
 of their reason, because they had been enlisted in a state of
 intoxication. To oblige them to remain in one place, we lodge about a
 dozen leaden balls in their heads; after which they become infinitely
 useful to their country.
 
 "I will not speak of a great number of excellent institutions, which do
 not go so far as to shed the blood of men, but which render life so
 pleasant and agreeable that it is impossible the guilty should avoid
 becoming virtuous. If a farmer has not been able to pay promptly a tax
 which exceeds his ability, we sell the pot in which he dresses his food;
 we sell his bed, in order that, being relieved of all his superfluities,
 he may be in a better condition to cultivate the earth."
 
 DES TOUCHES.--That is extremely harmonious!
 
 CROUTEF.--To comprehend our profound wisdom, you must know that our
 fundamental principle is to acknowledge in many places as our sovereign,
 a shaven-headed foreigner who lives at the distance of nine hundred
 miles from us. When we assign some of our best territories to any of our
 Talapolins, which it is very prudent in us to do, that Siamese Talapolin
 must pay the revenue of his first year to that shaven-headed Tartar,
 without which it is clear our lands would be unfruitful.
 
 But the time, the happy time, is no more, when that tonsured priest
 induced one half of the nation to cut the throats of the other half, in
 order to decide whether Sammonocodom had played at leap-frog or at some
 other game; whether he had been disguised in an elephant or in a cow; if
 he had slept three hundred and ninety days on the right side, or on the
 left. Those grand questions, which so essentially affect morality,
 agitated all minds; they shook the world; blood flowed plentifully for
 it; women were massacred on the bodies of their husbands; they dashed
 out the brains of their little infants on the stones, with a devotion,
 with a grace, with a contrition truly angelic. Woe to us! degenerate
 offspring of pious ancestors, who never offer such holy sacrifices! But,
 heaven be praised, there are yet among us at least a few good souls, who
 would imitate them if they were permitted.
 
 DES TOUCHES.--Tell me, I beseech you, sir, if at Siam you divide the
 tone major into two commas, or into two semi-commas; and if the progress
 of the fundamental sounds are made by one, three, and nine?
 
 CROUTEF. By Sammonocodom, you are laughing at me. You observe no bounds.
 You have interrogated me on the form of our government, and you speak to
 me of music!
 
 DES TOUCHES.---Music is everything. It was at the foundation of all the
 politics of the Greeks. But I beg your pardon; you have not a good ear;
 and we will return to our subject. You said, that in order to produce a
 perfect harmony--
 
 CROUTEF.--I was telling you, that formerly the tonsured Tartar pretended
 to dispose of all the kingdoms of Asia; which occasioned something very
 different from perfect harmony. But a very considerable benefit resulted
 from it; for people were then more devout toward Sammonocodom and his
 elephant than they are now; for, at the present time, all the world
 pretends to common sense, with an indiscretion truly pitiable. However,
 all things go on; people divert themselves, they dance, they play, they
 dine, they sup, they make love; this makes every man shudder who
 entertains good intentions.
 
 DES TOUCHES.--And what would you have more? You only want good music. If
 you had good music, you might call your nation the happiest in the
 world.
 
 
 
 
 THE BLIND PENSIONERS AT QUINZE VINGT.
 
 
 A SHORT DIGRESSION.--When the hospital of the Quinze Vingt was first
 founded, the pensioners were all equal, and their little affairs were
 concluded upon by a majority of votes. They distinguished perfectly by
 the touch between copper and silver coin; they never mistook the wine of
 Brie for that of Burgundy. Their sense of smelling was finer than that
 of their neighbors who had the use of two eyes. They reasoned very well
 on the four senses; that is, they knew everything they were permitted to
 know, and they lived as peaceably and as happily as blind people could
 be supposed to do. But unfortunately one of their professors pretended
 to have clear ideas in respect to the sense of seeing, he drew
 attention; he intrigued; he formed enthusiasts; and at last he was
 acknowledged chief of the community. He pretended to be a judge of
 colors, and everything was lost.
 
 This dictator of the Quinze Vingt chose at first a little council, by
 the assistance of which he got possession of all the alms. On this
 account, no person had the resolution to oppose him. He decreed, that
 all the inhabitants of the Quinze Vingt were clothed in white. The blind
 pensioners believed him; and nothing was to be heard but their talk of
 white garments, though, in fact, they possessed not one of that color.
 All their acquaintance laughed at them. They made their complaints to
 the dictator, who received them very ill; he rebuked them as innovators,
 freethinkers, rebels, who had suffered themselves to be seduced by the
 errors of those who had eyes, and who presumed to doubt that their chief
 was infallible. This contention gave rise to two parties.
 
 To appease the tumult, the dictator issued a decree, importing that all
 their vestments were red. There was not one vestment of that color in
 the Quinze Vingt. The poor men were laughed at more than ever.
 Complaints were again made by the community. The dictator rushed
 furiously in; and the other blind men were as much enraged. They fought
 a long time; and peace was not restored until the members of the Quinze
 Vingt were permitted to suspend their judgments in regard to the color
 of their dress.
 
 A deaf man, reading this little history, allowed that these people,
 being blind, were to blame in pretending to judge of colors; but he
 remained steady to his own opinion, that those persons who were deaf
 were the only proper judges of music.
 
 [Illustration: Boodh resting "upon the face of the waters," supported by
 serpents.][1]
 
 
 [1] Boodhism, is described in _Webster's Dictionary_ as "a system of
 religion in Eastern Asia, embraced by more than one third of the human
 race. It teaches that, at distant intervals, a Boodh, or deity, appears,
 to restore the world from a state of ignorance and decay, and then sinks
 into a state of entire non-existence, or rather, perhaps, of bare
 existence without attributes, action, or consciousness. This state,
 called _Nirvana_, or _Nicban_, is regarded as the ultimate supreme good,
 and the highest reward of virtue among men. Four Boodhs have thus
 appeared in the world, and passed into _Nirvana_, the last of whom,
 Gaudama, became incarnate about 500 years before Christ, from his death,
 in 543 B.C., many thousand years will elapse before the appearance of
 another; so that the system, in the mean time, is practically one of
 pure atheism."
 
 The serpent has ever been a significant emblem in religion and
 mythology. Being "the most subtle beast of the field," it was naturally
 accepted as the emblem of wisdom. With its tail in its mouth it formed a
 circle, which was regarded by the ancients as the emblem of eternity.
 Moses set up a brazen serpent on a cross in the wilderness as an emblem
 of healing. Æsculapius, the god of medicine, is seen on ancient statues
 with a serpent twining around a staff by his side, symbolizing health,
 prudence and foresight. Hygiea, the goddess of health, is represented in
 works of art as a virgin dressed in a long robe and feeding a serpent
 from a cup. Mercury is always shown holding in his right hand a wand
 with two twined serpents. The nine coiled serpents in the above
 engraving, correspond with the nine muses in the Grecian mythology. The
 cobra, whose poison is death, is an emblem of the destroying power, and
 destruction, or rather change, symbolizes new formation, renovation or
 creation. Thus eternal formation, proceeds from eternal destruction. The
 serpent also figures in a beautiful allegory concerning the introduction
 of knowledge among mankind, _i.e._, "the knowledge of good and
 evil."--E.
 
 
 
 
 BABABEC.
 
 
 When I was in the city of Benarez, on the borders of the Ganges, the
 country of the ancient Brahmins, I endeavored to instruct myself in
 their religion and manners. I understood the Indian language tolerably
 well. I heard a great deal, and remarked everything. I lodged at the
 house of my correspondent Omri, who was the most worthy man I ever knew.
 He was of the religion of the Brahmins: I have the honor to be a
 Mussulman. We never exchanged one word higher than another about Mahomet
 or Brahma. We performed our ablutions each on his own side; we drank of
 the same sherbet, and we ate of the same rice, as if we had been two
 brothers.
 
 One day we went together to the pagoda of Gavani. There we saw several
 bands of Fakirs. Some of whom were Janguis, that is to say,
 contemplative Fakirs; and others were disciples of the ancient
 Gymnosophists, who led an active life. They all have a learned language
 peculiar to themselves; it is that of the most ancient Brahmins; and
 they have a book written in this language, which they call the _Shasta_.
 It is, beyond all contradiction, the most ancient book in all Asia, not
 excepting the _Zend_.
 
 I happened by chance to cross in front of a Fakir, who was reading in
 this book.
 
 "Ah! wretched infidel!" cried he, "thou hast made me lose a number of
 vowels that I was counting, which will cause my soul to pass into the
 body of a hare instead of that of a parrot, with which I had before the
 greatest reason to flatter myself."
 
 I gave him a rupee to comfort him for the accident. In going a few paces
 farther, I had the misfortune to sneeze. The noise I made roused a
 Fakir, who was in a trance.
 
 "Heavens!" cried he, "what a dreadful noise. Where am I? I can no longer
 see the tip of my nose,--the heavenly light has disappeared."
 
 "If I am the cause," said I, "of your not seeing farther than the length
 of your nose, here is a rupee to repair the great injury I have done
 you. Squint again, my friend, and resume the heavenly light."
 
 Having thus brought myself off discreetly enough, I passed over to the
 side of the Gymnosophists, several of whom brought me a parcel of mighty
 pretty nails to drive into my arms and thighs, in honor of Brahma. I
 bought their nails, and made use of them to fasten down my boxes. Others
 were dancing upon their hands, others cut capers on the slack rope, and
 others went always upon one foot. There were some who dragged a heavy
 chain about with them, and others carried a packsaddle; some had their
 heads always in a bushel--the best people in the world to live with. My
 friend Omri took me to the cell of one of the most famous of these. His
 name was Bababec: he was as naked as he was born, and had a great chain
 about his neck, that weighed upwards of sixty pounds. He sat on a wooden
 chair, very neatly decorated with little points of nails that penetrated
 into his flesh; and you would have thought he had been sitting on a
 velvet cushion. Numbers of women flocked to him to consult him. He was
 the oracle of all the families in the neighborhood; and was, truly
 speaking, in great reputation. I was witness to a long conversation that
 Omri had with him.
 
 [Illustration: The Fakir.]
 
 
 
      RELIGIOUS ZEAL.
 
 
      The most earnest and zealous advocates of modern Christianity are,
      undoubtedly, to be found in the ranks of that grotesque
      organization known as the "Salvation Army"; but the wildest efforts
      of these misguided propagandists fall far short of the intense
      religious fervor displayed by the zealous followers of Brahma.
 
      A contributor to Cassell's _Illustrated Travels_ describes a
      religious festival which he witnessed a few years ago at Hurdwar on
      the Ganges, while on an elephant shooting expedition in the Dehra
      Dhoon, Northern India, which vividly illustrates the folly and
      fanaticism of these degraded religious devotees, and which is only
      second in repulsiveness to the horrible ceremonies of Juggernaut.
 
      "There is," says this writer, "a religious festival every year at
      Hurdwar, but every sixth year the ceremonies are more holy and the
      crowd of pilgrims larger. The _Koom Mela_, a religious feast of
      great holiness in native eyes, occurs every eleven years, and the
      pilgrims on such occasions arrive from every part of India. The
      crowd usually numbers over two millions. But it is when the
      festivals occurring at intervals of six years and at intervals of
      eleven years happen to meet in the same year that the crowd is the
      largest, the importance of the fair greatest, and the concourse of
      fanatic fakirs and holy Brahmins, from every hole and corner of
      India, the most striking and remarkable. Merchants arrive from the
      most distant countries; not from different parts of India only, but
      from Persia, Thibet, China, Afghanistan, and even from Russia. It
      was one of these festivals and giant fairs that we had the good
      fortune to see.
 
      "As the day of the great festival approaches, the fakirs--who by
      the way are always stark naked, and generally as disgusting
      specimens of humanity as it is possible to conceive--and the
      Brahmins, excite their hearers by increasingly-fervent speeches, by
      self-applied tortures, frightful contortions, and wild dances and
      gestures, to which the crowd loudly responds by shouts and wild
      yells. Early on the morning of the day which to their mind is more
      holy than any other in their whole lifetime, the assembled people
      to the number of two or even three millions, repair to the ghauts
      and patiently wait for the signal, to begin their work of
      regeneration and salvation. This desirable end is attained by each
      and every individual who within a certain time, during the tinkling
      of a well-known bell, precipitates himself into the river, washes
      himself thoroughly, and repeats a short prayer. This done, the
      pilgrim must leave the river again, and if he has not entered it
      until the bell began to tinkle, and has succeeded in going through
      his performance and left the water again before the sound of the
      bell has ceased, his sins from his birth are remitted and washed
      away, and his happy future after death is assured, unless he
      commits some specifically named and very enormous sins. The other
      pilgrims, who by reason of the great crowd cannot reach the water
      in time to go through the whole performance as required by the
      Brahmins, receive blessings commensurate with the length of their
      stay in the water while the bell was ringing. Even the unfortunate
      pilgrims who altogether fail to enter the water at the right
      moment, are consoled by the partial removal of their load of
      wickedness; but the blessings which accompany a full performance of
      what the Brahmins require, are so superior to the favors following
      an incomplete or tardy immersion, that it is not strange
      extraordinary efforts are made to enter the water at the first
      sound of the bells and gongs.
 
      "The crowd was made up of men and women of half-a-hundred tribes of
      nations, in every variety of dress and partial nakedness. Many men
      wore their loincloths only; the women's hair was loose and flying
      to the wind; all were newly and hideously painted; many were
      intoxicated, not only with opium and spirits, but with religious
      frenzy and impatient waiting. As the exciting moment approached
      shouts rent the air; the priests harangued louder and louder; the
      fakirs grew wilder and more incoherent; then gradually the great
      noise subsided, when suddenly a single bell, immediately followed
      by a hundred more, broke the silence, and with one accord, shouting
      like madmen, the people rushed forward and the foremost ranks threw
      themselves into the water. Then there arose a mighty shout, the
      many gongs joined in, and the bells redoubled their efforts. But
      the confusion, the crushing, the struggling for very life, the
      surging of the mad masses at the water's edge, defy all
      description.
 
      "As the first rows of men and women reached the water they were
      upset and overturned by the people in their rear, who passed over
      them into still deeper water, and in their turn suffered the same
      fate at the bands of the on-rushing crowd behind them, until deep
      water was reached.... The shouts of excitement were changed to
      shrieks and passionate cries for help; the men under water
      struggled with those above them: weak women were carried out by the
      stream or trampled on; men pulled each other down, and in their mad
      fear exerted their utmost strength without object or purpose. Then
      the survivors, trying to escape from the water, met the yet dry
      crowd still charging down to death, and this increased the dire
      confusion. It was a horrid sight, and one I was quite unprepared
      for, notwithstanding all I had heard before."--E.
 
 
 
 "Do you think, father," said my friend, "that after having gone through
 seven metempsichoses, I may at length arrive at the habitation of
 Brahma?"
 
 "That is as it may happen," said the Fakir. "What sort of life do you
 lead?"
 
 "I endeavor," answered Omri, "to be a good subject, a good husband, a
 good father, and a good friend. I lend money without interest to the
 rich who want it, and I give it to the poor: I always strive to preserve
 peace among my neighbors."
 
 "But have you ever run nails into your flesh?" demanded the Brahmin.
 
 "Never, reverend father."
 
 "I am sorry for it," replied the father; "very sorry for it, indeed. It
 is a thousand pities; but you will certainly not reach above the
 nineteenth heaven."
 
 "No higher!" said Omri. "In truth, I am very well contented with my lot.
 What is it to me whether I go into the nineteenth or the twentieth,
 provided I do my duty in my pilgrimage, and am well received at the end
 of my journey? Is it not as much as one can desire, to live with a fair
 character in this world, and be happy with Brahma in the next? And pray
 what heaven do you think of going to, good master Bababec, with your
 chain?"
 
 "Into the thirty-fifth," said Bababec.
 
 "I admire your modesty," replied Omri, "to pretend to be better lodged
 than me. This is surely the result of an excessive ambition. How can
 you, who condemn others that covet honors in this world, arrogate such
 distinguished ones to yourself in the next? What right have you to be
 better treated than me? Know that I bestow more alms to the poor in ten
 days, than the nails you run into your flesh cost for ten years? What is
 it to Brahma that you pass the whole day stark naked with a chain about
 your neck? This is doing a notable service to your country, doubtless! I
 have a thousand times more esteem for the man who sows pulse or plants
 trees, than for all your tribe, who look at the tips of their noses, or
 carry packsaddles, to show their magnanimity."
 
 Having finished this speech, Omri softened his voice, embraced the
 Brahmin, and, with an endearing sweetness, besought him to throw aside
 his nails and his chain, to go home with him, and live with decency and
 comfort.
 
 The Fakir was persuaded, he was washed clean, rubbed with essences and
 perfumes, and clad in a decent habit; he lived a fortnight in this
 manner, behaved with prudence and wisdom, and acknowledged that he was a
 thousand times happier than before; but he lost his credit among the
 people, the women no longer crowded to consult him; he therefore quitted
 the house of the friendly Omri, and returned to his nails and his chain,
 _to regain his reputation_.

 INTRODUCTION.
 
 
 There can be no doubt that everything in the world is governed by
 fatality. My own life is a convincing proof of this doctrine. An English
 lord, with whom I was a great favorite, had promised me that I should
 have the first living that fell to his gift. An old incumbent of eighty
 happened to die, and I immediately traveled post to London to remind the
 earl of his promise. I was honored with an immediate interview, and was
 received with the greatest kindness. I informed his lordship of the
 death of the rector, and of the hope I cherished relative to the
 disposal of the vacant living. He replied that I really looked very ill.
 I answered that, thanks to God, my greatest affliction was poverty. I am
 sorry for you, said his lordship, and he politely dismissed me with a
 letter of introduction to a Mr. Sidrac, who dwelt in the vicinity of
 Guildhall. I ran as fast as I could to this gentleman's house, not
 doubting but that he would immediately install me in the wished for
 living. I delivered the earl's letter, and Mr. Sidrac, who had the honor
 to be my lord's surgeon, asked me to sit down, and, producing a case of
 surgical instruments, began to assure me that he would perform an
 operation which he trusted would very soon relieve me.
 
 You must know, that his lordship had understood that I was suffering
 from some dreadful complaint, and that he generously intended to have me
 cured at his own expense. The earl had the misfortune to be as deaf as a
 post, a fact with which I, alas! had not been previously acquainted.
 
 During the time which I lost in defending myself against the attacks of
 Mr. Sidrac, who insisted positively upon curing me, whether I would or
 no, one out of the fifty candidates who were all on the lookout, came to
 town, flew to my lord, begged the vacant living--and obtained it.
 
 I was deeply in love with an interesting girl, a Miss Fidler, who had
 promised to marry me upon condition of my being made rector. My
 fortunate rival not only got the living, but also my mistress into the
 bargain!
 
 My patron, upon being told of his mistake, promised to make me ample
 amends, but alas! he died two days afterwards.
 
 Mr. Sidrac demonstrated to me that, according to his organic structure,
 my good patron could not have lived one hour longer. He also clearly
 proved that the earl's deafness proceeded entirely from the extreme
 dryness of the drums of his ears, and kindly offered, by an application
 of spirits of wine, to harden both of my ears to such a degree that I
 should, in one month only, become as deaf as any peer of the realm.
 
 I discovered Mr. Sidrac to be a man of profound knowledge. He inspired
 me with a taste for the study of nature, and I could not but be sensible
 of the valuable acquisition I had made in acquiring the friendship of a
 man who was capable of relieving me, should I need his services.
 Following his advice, I applied myself closely to the study of nature,
 to console myself for the loss of the rectory and of my enchanting Miss
 Fidler.
 
 
 
 
 II.
 
 THE STUDY OF NATURE.
 
 
 After making many profound observations upon nature, (having employed in
 the research, my five senses, my spectacles, and a very large
 telescope,) I said one day to Mr. Sidrac, unless I am much deceived,
 philosophy laughs at us. I cannot discover any trace of what the world
 calls nature; on the contrary, everything seems to me to be the result
 of art. By art the planets are made to revolve around the sun, while the
 sun revolves on its own axis. I am convinced that some genius has
 arranged things in such a manner, that the square of the revolutions of
 the planets is always in proportion to the cubic root from their
 distance to their centre, and one had need be a magician to find out how
 this is accomplished. The tides of the sea are the result of art no less
 profound and no less difficult to explain.
 
 All animals, vegetables and minerals are arranged with due regard to
 weight and measure, number and motion. All is performed by springs,
 levers, pullies, hydraulic machines, and chemical combinations, from the
 insignificant flea to the being called man, from the grass of the field
 to the far spreading oak, from a grain of sand to a cloud in the
 firmament of heaven. Assuredly, everything is governed by art, and the
 word _nature_ is but a chimera.
 
 What you say, answered Mr. Sidrac, has been said many years ago, and so
 much the better, for the probability is greater that your remark is
 true. I am always astonished when I reflect, that a grain of wheat cast
 into the earth will produce in a short time above a handful of the same
 corn. Stop, said I, foolishly, you forget that wheat must die before it
 can spring up again, at least so they say at college. My friend Sidrac,
 laughing heartily at this interruption, replied. That assertion went
 down very well a few years ago, when it was first published by an
 apostle called Paul; but in our more enlightened age, the meanest
 laborer knows that the thing is altogether too ridiculous even for
 argument.
 
 My dear friend, said I, excuse the absurdity of my remark, I have
 hitherto been a theologian, and one cannot divest one's self in a moment
 of every silly opinion.
 
 
 
 
 III.
 
 GOOD ADVICE.
 
 
 Some time after this conversation between the disconsolate person, whom
 we shall call Goodman, and the clever anatomist, Mr. Sidrac, the latter,
 one fine morning, observed his friend in St. James's Park, standing in
 an attitude of deep thought. What is the matter? said the surgeon. Is
 there anything amiss? No, replied Goodman, but I am left without a
 patron in the world since the death of my friend, who had the misfortune
 to be so deaf. Now supposing there be only ten thousand clergymen in
 England, and granting these ten thousand have each two patrons, the odds
 against my obtaining a bishopric are twenty thousand to one; a
 reflection quite sufficient to give any man the blue-devils. I remember,
 it was once proposed to me, to go out as cabin-boy to the East Indies. I
 was told that I should make my fortune. But as I did not think I should
 make a good admiral, whenever I should arrive at the distinction, I
 declined; and so, after turning my attention to every profession under
 the sun, I am fixed for life as a poor clergyman, good for nothing.
 
 Then be a clergyman no longer! cried Sidrac, and turn philosopher: what
 is your income? Only thirty guineas a year, replied Goodman; although at
 the death of my mother, it will be increased to fifty. Well, my dear
 Goodman, continued Sidrac, that sum is quite sufficient to support you
 in comfort. Thirty guineas are six hundred and thirty shillings, almost
 two shillings a day. With this fixed income, a man need do nothing to
 increase it, but is at perfect liberty to say all he thinks of the East
 India Company, the House of Commons, the king and all the royal family,
 of man generally and individually, and lastly, of God and his
 attributes; and the liberty we enjoy of expressing our thoughts upon
 these most interesting topics, is certainly very agreeable and amusing.
 
 Come and dine at my table every day. That will save you some little
 money. We will afterwards amuse ourselves with conversation, and your
 thinking faculty will have the pleasure of communicating with mine by
 means of speech, which is certainly a very wonderful thing, though its
 advantages are not duly appreciated by the greater part of mankind.

 IV.
 
 DIALOGUE UPON THE SOUL AND OTHER TOPICS.
 
 
 GOODMAN.--But my dear Sidrac, why do you always say _my thinking
 faculty_ and not _my soul_? If you used the latter term I should
 understand you much better.
 
 SIDRAC.--And for my part, I freely confess, I should not understand
 myself. I _feel_, I _know_, that God has endowed me with the faculties
 of thinking and speaking, but I can neither _feel_ nor _know_ that God
 has given me a thing called a soul.
 
 GOODMAN.--Truly upon reflection, I perceive that I know as little about
 the matter as you do, though I own that I have, all my life, been bold
 enough to believe that I knew. I have often remarked that the eastern
 nations apply to the soul the same word they use to express life. After
 their example, the Latins understood the word _anima_ to signify the
 life of the animal. The Greeks called the breath the soul. The Romans
 translated the word breath by _spiritus_, and thence it is that the word
 spirit or soul is found in every modern nation. As it happens that no
 one has ever seen this spirit or breath, our imagination has converted
 it into a being, which it is impossible to see or touch. The learned
 tell us, that the soul inhabits the body without having any place in it,
 that it has the power of setting our different organs in motion without
 being able to reach and touch them, indeed, what has not been said upon
 the subject? The great Locke knew into what a chaos these absurdities
 had plunged the human understanding. In writing the only reasonable book
 upon metaphysics that has yet appeared in the world, he did not compose
 a single chapter on the soul; and if by chance he now and then makes use
 of the word, he only introduces it to stand for intellect or mind.
 
 In fact, every human being, in spite of Bishop Berkeley, is sensible
 that he has a mind, and that this mind or intellect is capable of
 receiving ideas; but no one can feel that there is another being--a
 soul,--within him, which gives him motion, feeling and thought. It is,
 in fact, ridiculous to use words we do not understand, and to admit the
 existence of beings of whom we cannot have the slightest knowledge.
 
 SIDRAC.--We are then agreed upon a subject which, for so many centuries,
 has been a matter of dispute.
 
 GOODMAN.--And I must observe that I am surprised we should have agreed
 upon it so soon.
 
 SIDRAC. Oh! that is not so astonishing. We really wish to know what is
 truth. If we were among the Academies, we should argue like the
 characters in Rabelais. If we had lived in those ages of darkness, the
 clouds of which so long enveloped Great Britain, one of us would very
 likely have burned the other. We are so fortunate as to be born in an
 age comparatively reasonable; we easily discover what appears to us to
 be truth, and we are not afraid to proclaim it.
 
 GOODMAN.--You are right, but I fear, that, after all, the truth we have
 discovered is not worth much. In mathematics, indeed, we have done
 wonders; from the most simple causes we have produced effects that would
 have astonished Apollonius or Archimedes: but what have we proved in
 metaphysics? Absolutely nothing but our own ignorance.
 
 SIDRAC.--And do you call that nothing? You grant the supreme Being has
 given you the faculties of feeling and thinking, he has in the same
 manner given your feet the faculty of walking, your hands their
 wonderful dexterity, your stomach the capability of digesting food, and
 your heart the power of throwing arterial blood into all parts of your
 body. Everything we enjoy is derived from God, and yet we are totally
 ignorant of the means by which he governs and conducts the universe. For
 my own part, as Shakespeare says, I thank him for having taught me that,
 of the principles of things, I know absolutely nothing. It has always
 been a question, in what manner the soul acted upon the body. Before
 attempting to answer this question, I must be convinced that I have a
 soul. Either God has given us this wonderful spark of intellect, or he
 has gifted us with some principle that answers equally well. In either
 case, we are still the creatures of his divine will and goodness, and
 that is all I know about the matter.
 
 GOODMAN.--But if you do not know, tell me at least, what you are
 inclined to think upon the subject. You have opened skulls, and
 dissected the human fœtus. Have you ever, in these, dissections,
 discovered any appearance of a soul?
 
 SIDRAC.--Not the least, and I have not been able to understand how an
 immortal and spiritual essence, could dwell for months together in a
 membrane. It appears to me difficult to conceive that this pretended
 soul existed before the foundation of the body; for in what could it
 have been employed during the many ages previous to its mysterious union
 with flesh? Again! how can we imagine a spiritual principle waiting
 patiently in idleness during a whole eternity, in order to animate a
 mass of matter for a space of time, which, compared with eternity, is
 less than a moment?
 
 It is worse still, when I am told that God forms immortal souls out of
 nothing, and then cruelly dooms them to an eternity of flames and
 torments. What? burn a spirit, in which there can be nothing capable of
 burning; how can he burn the sound of a voice, or the wind that blows?
 though both the sound and wind were material during the short time of
 their existence; but a pure spirit--a thought--a doubt--I am lost in the
 labyrinth; on whichever side I turn, I find nothing but obscurity and
 absurdity, impossibility and contradiction. But I am quite at ease when
 I say to myself God is master of all. He who can cause each star to hold
 its particular course through the broad expanse of the firmament, can
 easily give to us sentiments and ideas, without the aid of this atom,
 called the soul. It is certain that God has endowed all animals, in a
 greater or lesser degree, with thought, memory, and judgment; he has
 given them life; it is demonstrated that they have feeling, since they
 possess all the organs of feeling; if then they have all this without a
 soul, why is it improbable that we have none? and why do mankind flatter
 themselves that they alone are gifted with a spiritual and immortal
 principle?
 
 GOODMAN.--Perhaps this idea arises from their inordinate vanity. I am
 persuaded that if the peacock could speak, he would boast of his soul,
 and would affirm that it inhabited his magnificent tail. I am very much
 inclined to believe with you, that God has created us thinking
 creatures, with the faculties of eating, drinking, feeling, &c., without
 telling us one word about the matter. We are as ignorant as the peacock
 I just mentioned, and he who said that we live and die without knowing
 how, why, or wherefore, spoke nothing but the truth.
 
 SIDRAC.--A celebrated author, whose name I forget, calls us nothing more
 than the puppets of Providence, and this seems to me to be a very good
 definition. An infinity of movements are necessary to our existence, but
 we did not ourselves invent and produce motion. There is a Being who
 has created light, caused it to move from the sun to our eyes in about
 seven minutes. It is only by means of motion that my five senses are put
 in action, and it is only by means of my senses that I have ideas, hence
 it follows that my ideas are derived from the great author of motion,
 and when he informs me how he communicates these ideas to me, I will
 most sincerely thank him.
 
 GOODMAN.--And so will I. As it is I constantly thank him for having
 permitted me, as Epictetus says, to contemplate for a period of some
 years this beautiful and glorious world. It is true that he could have
 made me happier by putting me in possession of Miss Fidler and a good
 rectory; but still, such as I am, I consider myself as under a great
 obligation to God's parental kindness and care.
 
 SIDRAC.--You say that it is in the power of God to give you a good
 living, and to make you still happier than you are at present. There are
 many persons who would not scruple flatly to contradict this proposition
 of yours. Do you forget that you yourself sometimes complain of
 fatality? A man, and particularly a priest, ought never to contradict
 one day an assertion he has perhaps made the day before. All is but a
 succession of links, and God is wiser than to break the eternal chain of
 events, even for the sake of my dear friend Goodman.
 
 GOODMAN.--I did not foresee this argument when I was speaking of
 fatality; but to come at once to the point, if it be so, God is as much
 a slave as myself.
 
 SIDRAC.--He is the slave of his will, of his wisdom, and of the laws
 which he has himself instituted; and it is impossible that he can
 infringe upon any of them; because it is impossible that he can become
 either weak or inconsistent.
 
 GOODMAN.--But, my friend, what you say would tend to make us
 irreligious, for, if God cannot change any of the affairs of the world,
 what is the use of teasing him with prayers, or of singing hymns to his
 praise?
 
 SIDRAC.--Well! who bids you worship or pray to God? We praise a man
 because we think him vain; we entreat of him when we think him weak and
 likely to change his purpose on account of our petitions. Let us do our
 duty to God, by being just and true to each other. In that consists our
 real prayers, and our most heartfelt praises.

 A CONVERSATION WITH A CHINESE.
 
 
 In the year 1723, there was a Chinese in Holland, who was both a learned
 man and a merchant, two things that ought by no means to be
 incompatible; but which, thanks to the profound respect that is shown to
 money, and the little regard that the human species pay to merit, have
 become so among us.
 
 This Chinese, who spoke a little Dutch, happened to be in a bookseller's
 shop at the same time that some literati were assembled there. He asked
 for a book; they offered him Bossuet's _Universal History_, badly
 translated. At the title _Universal History_--
 
 "How pleased am I," cried the Oriental, "to have met with this book. I
 shall now see what is said of our great empire; of a nation that has
 subsisted for upwards of fifty thousand years; of that long dynasty of
 emperors who have governed us for such a number of ages. I shall see
 what these Europeans think of the religion of our literati, and of that
 pure and simple worship we pay to the Supreme Being. What a pleasure
 will it be for me to find how they speak of our arts, many of which are
 of a more ancient date with us than the eras of all the kingdoms of
 Europe! I fancy the author will be greatly mistaken in relation to the
 war we had about twenty-two thousand five hundred and fifty-two years
 ago, with the martial people of Tonquin and Japan, as well as the solemn
 embassy that the powerful emperor of Mogulitian sent to request a body
 of laws from us in the year of the world 500000000000079123450000."
 
 "Lord bless you," said one of the literati, "there is hardly any mention
 made of that nation in this world, the only nation considered is that
 marvelous people, the Jews."
 
 "The Jews!" said the Chinese, "those people then must certainly be
 masters of three parts of the globe at least."
 
 "They hope to be so some day," answered the other; "but at present they
 are those pedlars you see going about here with toys and nicknacks, and
 who sometimes do us the honor to clip our gold and silver."
 
 "Surely you are not serious," exclaimed the Chinese. "Could those people
 ever have been in possession of a vast empire?"
 
 Here I joined in the conversation, and told him that for a few years
 they were in possession of a small country to themselves; but that we
 were not to judge of a people from the extent of their dominions, any
 more than of a man by his riches.
 
 "But does not this book take notice of some other nations?" demanded the
 man of letters.
 
 "Undoubtedly," replied a learned gentleman who stood at my elbow; "it
 treats largely of a small country about sixty leagues wide, called
 Egypt, in which it is said that there is a lake of one hundred and fifty
 leagues in circumference, made by the hands of man."
 
 "My God!" exclaimed the Chinese, "a lake of one hundred and fifty
 leagues in circumference within a spot of ground only sixty leagues
 wide! This is very curious!"
 
 "The inhabitants of that country," continued the doctor, "were all
 sages."
 
 "What happy times were those!" cried the Chinese; "but is that all?"
 
 "No," replied the other, "there is mention made of those famous people
 the Greeks."
 
 "Greeks! Greeks!" said the Asiatic, "who are those Greeks?"
 
 "Why," replied the philosopher, "they were masters of a little province,
 about the two hundredth part as large as China, but whose fame spread
 over the whole world."
 
 "Indeed!" said the Chinese, with an air of openness and ingenuousness;
 "I declare I never heard the least mention of these people, either in
 the Mogul's country, in Japan, or in Great Tartary."
 
 "Oh, the barbarian! the ignorant creature!" cried out our sage very
 politely. "Why then, I suppose you know nothing of Epaminondas the
 Theban, nor of the Pierian Heaven, nor the names of Achilles's two
 horses, nor of Silenus's ass? You have never heard speak of Jupiter, nor
 of Diogenes, nor of Lais, nor of Cybele, nor of--"
 
 "I am very much afraid," said the learned Oriental, interrupting him,
 "that you know nothing of that eternally memorable adventure of the
 famous Xixofon Concochigramki, nor of the masteries of the great
 Fi-psi-hi-hi! But pray tell me what other unknown things does this
 _Universal History_ treat of?"
 
 Upon this my learned neighbor harangued for a quarter of an hour
 together about the Roman republic, and when he came to Julius Cæsar the
 Chinese stopped him, and very gravely said.
 
 "I think I have heard of him, was he not a Turk?"
 
 "How!" cried our sage in a fury, "don't you so much as know the
 difference between Pagans, Christians, and Mahometans? Did you never
 hear of Constantine? Do you know nothing of the history of the popes?"
 
 "We have heard something confusedly of one Mahomet," replied the
 Asiatic.
 
 "It is surely impossible," said the other, "but that you must have heard
 at least of Luther, Zuinglius, Bellarmin, and Œcolampadius."
 
 "I shall never remember all those names," said the Chinese, and so
 saying he quitted the shop, and went to sell a large quantity of Pekoa
 tea, and fine calico, and then after purchasing what merchandise he
 required, set sail for his own country, adoring _Tien_, and recommending
 himself to Confucius.
 
 As to myself, the conversation I had been witness to plainly discovered
 to me the nature of vain glory; and I could not forbear exclaiming:
 
 "Since Cæsar and Jupiter are names unknown to the finest, most ancient,
 most extensive, most populous, and most civilized kingdom in the
 universe, it becomes ye well, O ye rulers of petty states! ye pulpit
 orators of a narrow parish, or a little town! ye doctors of Salamanca,
 or of Bourges! ye trifling authors, and ye heavy commentators!--it
 becomes you well, indeed, to aspire to fame and immortality."
 
 
 [1] According to Chambers' work on _The British Museum_, from which the
 above cuts are copied, "the Chinese, are a vast nation of some
 300,000,000 of souls, nearly a third part of the whole human race. The
 entire population is subject to the supreme and despotic authority of a
 single hereditary ruler who resides at Pekin, the chief city of the
 whole empire. Under him the government is administered by a descending
 hierarchy of officials or mandarins, who are chosen from all ranks of
 the people, according to their talents as displayed in the course, first
 of their education at school and college, and afterwards of their public
 life. The officials are, in short, the men in highest repute for
 scholarship and accomplishments in the empire; and the whole system of
 the government is that of promotion upwards from the ranks of the
 people, according to merit. The Chinese generally are remarkable for
 common sense, orderliness, and frugal prudential habits. Printing and
 paper being cheap among them, and education universal, they have an
 immense literature, chiefly in the departments of the drama, the novel,
 and the moral essay; their best writers of fiction are said to resemble
 Richardson in style, and their best moralists Franklin. The greatest
 name in their literature, or indeed in their history, is that of
 Confucius, a philosopher and religious teacher who lived about 500 years
 B.C., and who left a number of books expounding and enforcing the great
 maxims of morality. During all the revolutions that have since elapsed,
 the doctrines of Confucius have retained their hold of the Chinese mind,
 and the religion of China consists in little more than an attachment to
 these doctrines, and a veneration for their founder. With abstract
 notions of the Deity, and of the destiny of man when he quits this life,
 the Chinese do not trouble themselves; a moral, correct life, and
 especially an honorable discharge of the duties of a son and a citizen,
 is the whole aim of their piety. There are, however, some voluntary
 sects among them, who superinduce articles of speculative belief on the
 prosaic code of morality established by Confucius; and forms of
 religious worship are practised over the whole country under the direct
 sanction of the government. There are a number of figures, larger and
 smaller, of Chinese divinities, some of which are very neatly carved in
 ivory, wood, and stone. With what precise feelings the more educated
 Chinese address these images in prayer--whether they look upon them as
 symbols, or whether, like Polytheists generally, they actually view the
 carved figures themselves as gifted with powers--it would be difficult
 to say; the mass of the people, however, probably never ask the
 question, but, from the mere force of custom, come to regard such
 objects as the figure of Kwan-yin, the goddess of mercy, and the larger
 gilt figures of the god and goddess, precisely as the Polytheistic
 Greeks or Romans regarded their statues in their temples; that is, as
 real divinities with power for good or evil. The religious sentiment,
 however, sits very lightly on the Chinese. Absence of any feeling of the
 supernatural is perhaps the most remarkable feature of the Chinese
 character.
 
 "Buddhism, was founded, as is generally believed, some centuries before
 Christ by a Hindoo prince and sage named Gautama. As originally
 propounded, Buddhism is supposed to have been a purer and more
 reasonable form of faith than Brahminism, recognising more clearly the
 spiritual and moral aims of religion; but, having been expelled from
 Hindostan during the early centuries of our era, after having undergone
 severe persecution from the Brahmins--at whose power it struck, by
 proscribing the system of castes---it sought refuge in the eastern
 peninsula, Ceylon, Thibet, Japan, and China, where it has been modified
 and corrupted into various forms."--E.

      ANDROGYNOUS DEITIES.
 
 
      The ancients ascribed the existence of the universe to the fiat of
      omnipotence. Almighty power conjoined with infinite wisdom had
      produced the world and all that it inhabits. Man, the head of
      visible creation, was formed in the image of the gods, but the gods
      only were endowed with generative or creative power. These gods
      were androgynous--that is, male and female--containing in one
      person both the paternal and maternal attributes. Plato taught that
      mankind, like the gods, were originally androgynous, and Moses
      tells us that Eve, in matured wisdom and beauty, sprang forth from
      the side of Adam, even as
 
            "From great Jove's head, the armed Minerva sprung
            With awful shout."
 
      "The thought of God as the Divine Mother," says a sincere and
      intelligent clergyman in a sermon recently published, "is a very
      ancient one, found in the most early nature worships." "We thank
      Thee O God," says the Rev. Theodore Parker, "that Thou art our
      Father and our Mother." "O God," says St. Augustine, "Thou art the
      Father, Thou the Mother of Thy children."
 
      The preceding illustration of the birth of Minerva,--the goddess of
      wisdom,--_i.e. wisdom issuing from the brain of Jove_, is from
      Falkener's _Museum of Classical Antiquities_. It is taken from an
      ancient Etruscan patera (mirror), now in the Museum at Bologna, and
      is supposed to have been copied from the pediment of the eastern or
      main entrance to the Parthenon, or temple of Minerva. This pediment
      was the work of Phidias, and, like so many of the former monuments
      of ancient art and civilization, is now forever lost to mankind.
 
      "The goddess," says the distinguished architect and antiquary M. De
      Quincy, "is shown issuing from the head of Jupiter. She has a
      helmet on her head, buckler on her arm, and spear in her hand.
      Jupiter is seated, holding a sceptre in one hand and a thunderbolt
      in the other. On the right of the new born goddess is Juno, whose
      arms are elevated, and who seems to have assisted at the
      extraordinary childbirth. On the left of Jupiter is Venus,
      recognizable by a sprig of myrtle and a dove. Behind Juno is
      Vulcan, still armed with the axe which has cleft the head of the
      god, and seeming to regard with admiration the success of his
      operations."
 
      The engraving representing the birth of Eve, is from the _Speculum
      Salutis, or the Mirror of Salvation_, of which many manuscript
      copies were issued, for the instruction of the mendicant friars,
      between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries. "Heineken describes a
      copy in the imperial library of Vienna, which he attributes to the
      twelfth century. He says, such was the popularity of the work with
      the Benedictines that almost every monastery possessed a copy of
      it. Of the four manuscript copies owned by the British Museum, one
      is supposed to have been written in the thirteenth century, another
      copy is in the Flemish writing of the fifteenth century." This
      work, which contains several engravings and forty-five chapters of
      barbarous Latin rhymes, presents a good illustration of Christian
      art as it existed during the period immediately preceding the
      revival of letters, when the barbarism and ignorance of the dark
      ages had supplanted the artistic culture of ancient Greece and
      Rome.
 
      Unprejudiced readers will doubtless admit that the birth of Minerva
      from the brain of Jove greatly resembles the birth of Eve from the
      side of Adam, and these myths show the analogy existing between the
      Jewish and Pagan mythologies; but the design and execution of the
      respective engravings, show the retrogression in art that had taken
      place between the time of the immortal Phidias and that of Pope
      Innocent III.[1]--between Pagan civilization as it existed prior to
      the Christian era, and the medieval barbarism of the successors of
      St. Peter.
 
      "God created man in his own image," says Godfrey Higgins in the
      _Anacalypsis_, (vol. 2, p. 397.) "Everything was supposed to be in
      the image of God; and thus man was created double--the male and
      female in one person, or androgynous like God. By some uninitiated
      Jews, of about the time of Christ, this double being was supposed
      to have been created back to back [see the bearded Bacchus and
      Ariadne on the following page]; but I believe, from looking at the
      twins in all ancient zodiacs, it was side by side; precisely as we
      have seen the Siamese boys,--but still _male_ and _female_.
      Besides, the book of Genesis implies that they were side by side,
      by the woman being taken from the _side_ of man. Among the Indians
      the same doctrine is found, as we might expect."
 
      "We must rise to man," says the eloquent clergyman previously
      referred to, "in order to know rightly what God is. Humanity
      plainly images a power which is at once the source and pattern of
      the womanly as well as of the manly qualities, inasmuch as woman as
      well as man is needed to fill out the idea of humanity. The womanly
      traits--pity, forgiveness, gentleness, patience, sympathy,
      unselfishness--are as worthy of the Divine Being as the manly
      traits."--E.
 
 
 
      [1] "It was," says Gibbon, "at the feet of his legate that John of
 England surrendered his crown; and Innocent may boast of the two most
 signal triumphs over sense and humanity, the establishment of
 transsubstantiation, and the origin of the inquisition."

 PLATO'S DREAM.
 
 
 Plato was a great dreamer, as many others have been since his time. He
 dreampt that mankind were formerly double; and that, as a punishment for
 their crimes, they were divided into male and female.
 
 He undertook to prove that there can be no more than five perfect
 worlds, because there are but five regular mathematical bodies. His
 Republic was one of his principal dreams. He dreampt, moreover, that
 watching arises from sleep, and sleep from watching; and that a person
 who should attempt to look at an eclipse, otherwise than in a pail of
 water, would surely lose his sight. Dreams were, at that time, in great
 repute.
 
 Here follows one of his dreams, which is not one of the least
 interesting. He thought that the great Demiurgos, the eternal geometer,
 having peopled the immensity of space with innumerable globes, was
 willing to make a trial of the knowledge of the genii who had been
 witnesses of his works. He gave to each of them a small portion of
 matter to arrange, nearly in the same manner as Phidias and Zeuxis would
 have given their scholars a statue to carve, or a picture to paint, if
 we may be allowed to compare small things to great.
 
 [Illustration: Envy.]
 
 Demogorgon had for his lot the lump of mould, which we call the Earth;
 and having formed it, such as it now appears, he thought he had executed
 a masterpiece. He imagined he had silenced Envy herself, and expected to
 receive the highest panegyrics, even from his brethren; but how great
 was his surprise, when, at his next appearing among them, they received
 him with a general hiss.
 
 One among them, more satirical than the rest, accosted him thus:
 
 "Truly you have performed mighty feats! you have divided your world into
 two parts; and, to prevent the one from having communication with the
 other, you have carefully placed a vast collection of waters between the
 two hemispheres. The inhabitants must perish with cold under both your
 poles, and be scorched to death under the equator. You have, in your
 great prudence, formed immense deserts of sand, so that all who travel
 over them may die with hunger and thirst. I have no fault to find with
 your cows, your sheep, your cocks, and your hens; but can never be
 reconciled to your serpents and your spiders. Your onions and your
 artichokes are very good things, but I cannot conceive what induced you
 to scatter such a heap of poisonous plants over the face of the earth,
 unless it was to poison its inhabitants. Moreover, if I am not mistaken,
 you have created about thirty different kinds of monkeys, a still
 greater number of dogs, and only four or five species of the human race.
 It is true, indeed, you have bestowed on the latter of these animals a
 faculty by you called Reason; but, in truth, this same reason is a very
 ridiculous thing, and borders very near upon folly. Besides, you do not
 seem to have shown any very great regard to this two-legged creature,
 seeing you have left him with so few means of defense; subjected him to
 so many disorders, and provided him with so few remedies; and formed him
 with such a multitude of passions, and so small a portion of wisdom or
 prudence to resist them. You certainly was not willing that there should
 remain any great number of these animals on the earth at once; for,
 without reckoning the dangers to which you have exposed them, you have
 so ordered matters that, taking every day through the year, the small
 pox will regularly carry off the tenth part of the species, and sister
 maladies will taint the springs of life in the nine remaining parts; and
 then, as if this was not sufficient, you have so disposed things, that
 one-half of those who survive will be occupied in going to law with each
 other, or cutting one another's throats.
 
 "Now, they must doubtless be under infinite obligations to you, and it
 must be owned you have executed a masterpiece."
 
 Demogorgon blushed. He was sensible there was much moral and physical
 evil in this affair; but still he insisted there was more good than ill
 in it.
 
 "It is an easy matter to find fault, good folks," said the genii; "but
 do you imagine it is so easy to form an animal, who, having the gift of
 reason and free-will, shall not sometimes abuse his liberty? Do you
 think that, in rearing between nine and ten thousand different plants,
 it is so easy to prevent some few from having noxious qualities? Do you
 suppose that, with a certain quantity of water, sand, and mud, you could
 make a globe that should have neither seas nor deserts?"
 
 "As for you, my sneering friend, I think you have just finished the
 planet Jupiter. Let us see now what figure you make with your great
 belts, and your long nights, with four moons to enlighten them. Let us
 examine your worlds, and see whether the inhabitants you have made are
 exempt from follies or diseases."
 
 Accordingly the genii fell to examining the planet Jupiter, when the
 laugh went strongly against the laugher. The serious genii who had made
 the planet Saturn, did not escape without his share of the censure, and
 his brother operators, the makers of Mars, Mercury, and Venus, had each
 in his turn some reproaches to undergo.
 
 Several large volumes, and a great number of pamphlets, were written on
 this occasion; smart sayings and witty repartees flew about on all
 sides; they railed against and ridiculed each other; and, in short, the
 disputes were carried on with all the warmth of party heat, when the
 eternal Demiurgos thus imposed silence on them all:
 
 "In your several performances there is both good and bad, because you
 have a great share of understanding, but at the same time fall short of
 perfection. Your works will not endure above an hundred millions of
 years, after which you will acquire more knowledge, and perform much
 better. It belongs to me alone to create things perfect and immortal."
 
 This was the doctrine Plato taught his disciples. One of them, when he
 had finished his harangue, cried out, "_And so you then awoke?_"

 Falkener's _Museum of Classical Antiquities_. The statue was found at
 Pompeii in 1847.--E.

 [Illustration: Visiting Seignior Pococurante.]
 
 
 
 
 PLEASURE IN HAVING NO PLEASURE.
 
 
 "Hitherto," said Candide to Martin, "I have met with none but
 unfortunate people in the whole habitable globe, except in El Dorado,
 but, observe those gondoliers, are they not perpetually singing?"
 
 "You do not see them," answered Martin, "at home with their wives and
 brats. The doge has his chagrin, gondoliers theirs. Nevertheless, in the
 main, I look upon the gondolier's life as preferable to that of the
 doge; but the difference is so trifling, that it is not worth the
 trouble of examining into."
 
 "I have heard great talk," said Candide, "of the Senator Pococurante,
 who lives in that fine house at the Brenta, where, they say, he
 entertains foreigners in the most polite manner. They pretend this man
 is a perfect stranger to uneasiness."
 
 "I should be glad to see so extraordinary a being," said Martin.
 
 Candide thereupon sent a messenger to Seignior Pococurante, desiring
 permission to wait on him the next day.
 
 Accordingly, Candide and his friend Martin went in a gondola on the
 Brenta, and arrived at the palace of the noble Pococurante. The gardens
 were laid out in elegant taste, and adorned with fine marble statues;
 his palace was built after the most approved rules in architecture. The
 master of the house, who was a man of sixty, and very rich, received our
 two travelers with great politeness, but without much ceremony, which
 somewhat disconcerted Candide, but was not at all displeasing to Martin.
 
 As soon as they were seated, two very pretty girls, neatly dressed,
 brought in chocolate, which was extremely well frothed. Candide could
 not help making encomiums upon their beauty and graceful carriage.
 
 "The creatures are well enough," said the senator, "but I am heartily
 tired of women, of their coquetry, their jealousy, their quarrels, their
 humors, their vanity, their pride, and their folly; I am weary of making
 sonnets, or of paying for sonnets to be made on them; and, after all,
 those two girls begin to grow very indifferent to me."
 
 After having refreshed himself, Candide walked into a large gallery,
 where he was struck with the sight of a fine collection of paintings.
 
 "Pray," said Candide, "by what master are the first two of these?"
 
 "They are Raphael's," answered the senator. "I gave a great deal of
 money for them seven years ago, purely out of curiosity, as they were
 said to be the finest pieces in Italy; but I cannot say they please me:
 the coloring is dark and heavy; the figures do not swell nor come out
 enough, and the drapery is very bad. In short, notwithstanding the
 encomiums lavished upon them, they are not, in my opinion, a true
 representation of nature. I approve of no paintings but where I think I
 behold nature herself; and there are very few, if any, of that kind to
 be met with. I have what is called a fine collection, but it affords me
 no delight."
 
 While dinner was getting ready, Pococurante ordered a concert. Candide
 praised the music to the skies.
 
 "This noise," said the noble Venetian, "may amuse one for a little time,
 but if it were to last above half an hour, it would grow very tiresome,
 though perhaps no one would care to own it. Music has become the art of
 executing that which is difficult. Now whatever is difficult cannot long
 continue pleasing. I might take more pleasure in an opera if they had
 not made that species of dramatic entertainment so shockingly monstrous;
 and I am amazed that people can bear to see wretched tragedies set to
 music, where the scenes are contrived for no other purpose than to lug
 in, as it were by the ears, three or four ridiculous songs, to give a
 favorite actress an opportunity of exhibiting her voice. Let who will or
 can die away in raptures at the trills of an eunuch quavering the
 majestic part of Cæsar or Cato, and strutting in a foolish manner on the
 stage; for my part, I have long ago renounced these paltry
 entertainments, which constitute the glory of modern Italy, and are so
 dearly purchased by crowned heads."
 
 Candide opposed these sentiments; but he did it in a discreet manner; as
 for Martin, he was entirely of the old senator's opinion.
 
 Dinner being served up, they sat down to table, and after a very hearty
 repast returned to the library. Candide observing Homer richly bound,
 commended the noble Venetian's taste.
 
 "This," said he, "is a book that was once the delight of the great
 Pangloss, the best philosopher in Germany."
 
 "Homer is no favorite of mine," answered Pococurante, very coolly: "I
 was made to believe once that I took a pleasure in reading him; but his
 continual repetitions of battles have all such a resemblance with each
 other; his gods, that are forever in a hurry and bustle without ever
 doing anything; his Helen, that is the cause of the war, and yet hardly
 acts in the whole performance; his Troy, that holds out so long, without
 being taken; in short, all these things together make the poem very
 insipid to me. I have asked some learned men, whether they are not in
 reality as much tired as myself with reading this poet? Those who spoke
 ingenuously, assured me that he had made them fall asleep; and yet, that
 they could not well avoid giving him a place in their libraries; but it
 was merely as they would do an antique, or those rusty medals which are
 kept only for curiosity, and are of no manner of use in commerce."
 
 "But your excellency does not surely form this same opinion of Virgil?"
 said Candide.
 
 "Why, I grant," replied Pococurante, "that the second, third, fourth,
 and sixth book, of his Æneid are excellent; but as for his pious Æneas,
 his strong Cloanthus, his friendly Achates, his boy Ascanius, his silly
 King Latinus, his ill-bred Amata, his insipid Lavinia, and some other
 characters much in the same strain, I think there cannot be in nature
 anything more flat and disagreeable. I must confess, I much prefer Tasso
 to him; nay, even that sleepy tale-teller Ariosto."
 
 "May I take the liberty to ask if you do not receive great pleasure from
 reading Horace?" said Candide.
 
 "There are maxims in this writer," replied Pococurante, "from whence a
 man of the world may reap some benefit; and the short measure of the
 verse makes them more easy to retain in the memory. But I see nothing
 extraordinary in his journey to Brundusium, and his account of his bad
 dinner; nor in his dirty low quarrel between one Rupilius, whose words,
 as he expresses it, were full of poisonous filth; and another, whose
 language was dipped in vinegar. His indelicate verses against old women
 and witches have frequently given me great offense; nor can I discover
 the great merit of his telling his friend Mecænas, that if he will but
 rank him in the class of lyric poets, his lofty head shall touch the
 stars. Ignorant readers are apt to praise everything by the lump in a
 writer of reputation. For my part, I read only to please myself. I like
 nothing but that which makes for my purpose."
 
 Candide, who had been brought up with a notion of never making use of
 his own judgment, was astonished at what he had heard; but Martin found
 there was a good deal of reason in the senator's remarks.
 
 "O! here is a Tully," said Candide: "this great man, I fancy, you are
 never tired of reading?"
 
 "Indeed, I never read him at all," replied Pococurante. "What is it to
 me whether he pleads for Rabirius or Cluentius? I try causes enough
 myself. I had once some liking for his philosophical works; but when I
 found he doubted of everything, I thought I knew as much as himself,
 _and had no need of a guide to learn ignorance_.
 
 "Ha!" cried Martin, "here are fourscore volumes of the _Memoirs of the
 Academy of Sciences_. Perhaps there may be something curious and
 valuable in this collection."
 
 "Yes," answered Pococurante, "so there might, if any one of these
 compilers of this rubbish had only invented the art of pin-making; but
 all these volumes are filled with mere chimerical systems, without one
 single article conducive to real utility."
 
 "I see a prodigious number of plays," said Candide, "in Italian,
 Spanish, and French."
 
 "Yes," replied the Venetian, "there are, I think, three thousand, and
 not three dozen of them good for anything. As to these huge volumes of
 divinity, and those enormous collections of sermons, they are not
 altogether worth one single page in Seneca; and I fancy you will readily
 believe that neither myself, nor any one else, ever looks into them."
 
 Martin, perceiving some shelves filled with English books, said to the
 senator:
 
 "I fancy that a republican must be highly delighted with those books,
 which are most of them written with a noble spirit of freedom."
 
 "It is noble to write as we think," said Pococurante; "it is the
 privilege of humanity. Throughout Italy we write only what we do not
 think; and the present inhabitants of the country of the Cæsars and
 Antoninuses dare not acquire a single idea without the permission of a
 father dominican. I should be enamoured of the spirit of the English
 nation, did it not utterly frustrate the good effects it would produce,
 by passion and the spirit of party."
 
 Candide, seeing a Milton, asked the senator if he did not think that
 author a great man?
 
 "Who?" said Pococurante, sharply; "that barbarian who writes a tedious
 commentary in ten books of rambling verse on the first chapter of
 Genesis? that slovenly imitator of the Greeks, who disfigures the
 creation by making the Messiah take a pair of compasses from heaven's
 armory to plan the world; whereas Moses represented the Deity as
 producing the whole universe by his fiat? Can I, think you, have any
 esteem for a writer who has spoiled Tasso's hell and the devil? who
 transforms Lucifer sometimes into a toad, and at others, into a pigmy?
 who makes him say the same thing over again an hundred times? who
 metamorphoses him into a school-divine? and who, by an absurdly serious
 imitation of Ariosto's comic invention of fire-arms, represents the
 devils and angels cannonading each other in heaven? Neither I nor any
 other Italian can possibly take pleasure in such melancholy reveries;
 but the marriage of sin and death, and snakes issuing from the womb of
 the former, are enough to make any person sick that is not lost to all
 sense of delicacy. This obscene, whimsical, and disagreeable poem, met
 with the neglect it deserved at its first publication; and I only treat
 the author now as he was treated in his own country by his
 contemporaries."
 
 Candide was sensibly grieved at this speech, as he had a great respect
 for Homer, and was very fond of Milton.
 
 "Alas!" said he softly to Martin, "I am afraid this man holds our German
 poets in great contempt."
 
 "There would be no such great harm in that," said Martin.
 
 "O, what a surprising man!" said Candide still to himself; "what a
 genius is this Pococurante! nothing can please him."
 
 After finishing their survey of the library, they went down into the
 garden, when Candide commended the several beauties that offered
 themselves to his view.
 
 "I know nothing upon earth laid out in such bad taste," said
 Pococurante; "everything about it is childish and trifling; but I shall
 soon have another laid out upon a nobler plan."
 
 "Well," said Candide to Martin, as soon as our two travelers had taken
 leave of his excellency: "I hope you will own, that this man is the
 happiest of all mortals, for he is above everything he possesses."
 
 "But do you not see," said Martin, "that he likewise dislikes everything
 he possesses? It was an observation of Plato, long since, that those are
 not the best stomachs that reject, without distinction, all sorts of
 aliments."
 
 "True," said Candide; "but still there must certainly be a pleasure in
 criticising everything, and in perceiving faults where others think they
 see beauties."
 
 "That is," replied Martin, "there is a pleasure in having no pleasure."
 
 [Illustration: The "yawning oysters" discovered by Pythagoras.]
 
 
 
 
 AN ADVENTURE IN INDIA.
 
 
 All the world knows that Pythagoras, while he resided in India, attended
 the school of the Gymnosophists, and learned the language of beasts and
 plants.[1] One day, while he was walking in a meadow near the seashore,
 he heard these words:
 
 "How unfortunate that I was born an herb! I scarcely attain two inches
 in height, when a voracious monster, an horrid animal, tramples me under
 his large feet; his jaws are armed with rows of sharp scythes, by which
 he cuts, then grinds, and then swallows me. Men call this monster a
 sheep. I do not suppose there is in the whole creation a more detestable
 creature."
 
 Pythagoras proceeded a little way and found an oyster yawning on a small
 rock. He had not yet adopted that admirable law, by which we are
 enjoined not to eat those animals which have a resemblance to us.[2] He
 had scarcely taken up the oyster to swallow it, when it spoke these
 affecting words:
 
 "O, Nature, how happy is the herb, which is, as I am, thy work! though
 it be cut down, it is regenerated and immortal; and we, poor oysters, in
 vain are defended by a double cuirass: villains eat us by dozens at
 their breakfast, and all is over with us forever. What an horrible fate
 is that of an oyster, and how barbarous are men!"
 
 Pythagoras shuddered; he felt the enormity of the crime he had nearly
 committed; he begged pardon of the oyster with tears in his eyes, and
 replaced it very carefully on the rock.
 
 As he was returning to the city, profoundly meditating on this
 adventure, he saw spiders devouring flies; swallows eating spiders, and
 sparrow-hawks eating swallows. "None of these," said he, "are
 philosophers."
 
 On his entrance, Pythagoras was stunned, bruised, and thrown down by a
 lot of tatterdemalions, who were running and crying: "Well done, he
 fully deserved it." "Who? What?" said Pythagoras, as he was getting up.
 The people continued running and crying: "O how delightful it will be to
 see them boiled!"
 
 Pythagoras supposed they meant lentiles, or some other vegetables: but
 he was in an error; they meant two poor Indians. "Oh!" said Pythagoras,
 "these Indians, without doubt, are two great philosophers weary of their
 lives, they are desirous of regenerating under other forms; it affords
 pleasure to a man to change his place of residence, though he may be but
 indifferently lodged: there is no disputing on taste."[3]
 
 He proceeded with the mob to the public square, where he perceived a
 lighted pile of wood, and a bench opposite to it, which was called a
 tribunal. On this bench judges were seated, each of whom had a cow's
 tail in his hand, and a cap on his head, with ears resembling those of
 the animal which bore Silenus when he came into that country with
 Bacchus, after having crossed the Erytrean sea without wetting a foot,
 and stopping the sun and moon; as it is recorded with great fidelity in
 the Orphicks.
 
 Among these judges there was an honest man with whom Pythagoras was
 acquainted. The Indian sage explained to the sage of Samos the nature of
 that festival to be given to the people of India.
 
 "These two Indians," said he, "have not the least desire to be committed
 to the flames. My grave brethren have adjudged them to be burnt; one for
 saying, that the substance of Xaca is not that of Brahma; and the other
 for supposing, that the approbation of the Supreme Being was to be
 obtained at the point of death without holding a cow by the tail;
 'Because,' said he, 'we may be virtuous at all times, and we cannot
 always have a cow to lay hold of just when we may have occasion.' The
 good women of the city were greatly terrified at two such heretical
 opinions; they would not allow the judges a moment's peace until they
 had ordered the execution of those unfortunate men."
 
 Pythagoras was convinced that from the herb up to man, there were many
 causes of chagrin. However, he obliged the judges and even the devotees
 to listen to reason, which happened only at that time.
 
 He went afterwards and preached toleration at Crotona; but a bigot set
 fire to his house, and he was burnt--the man who had delivered the two
 Hindoos from the flames? Let those save themselves who can![4]
 
 
 [1] Perhaps it would be impossible at the present day to convince
 scientists that oysters formerly conversed intelligibly with mankind and
 protested eloquently against human injustice; but all men are not
 scientists, and there are many worthy people who still have implicit
 faith in ancient Semitic records--who firmly believe in miracles and
 prodigies--and who would consider it rank heresy to doubt that the
 serpent, though now as mute as an oyster, formerly held a very animated
 conversation, in the original Edenic language, with the inexperienced
 and confiding female who then graced with her charming presence the
 bowers of Paradise; and this sacred narrative of the "maiden and the
 reptile" is quite as repugnant to modern science as the sentimental fish
 story of "Pythagoras and the oyster".
 
 As a matter of fact, the doctrine of the metempsichosis, as taught by
 the Samian sage, was formerly held in great repute by the most civilized
 nations of antiquity, and it is surely as easy to credit the assertion
 of our author, that the ancient Gymnosophists "had learned the language
 of beasts and plants" as to believe the unquestioned and orthodox
 statement that a certain quadruped, (_Asinus vulgaris_,) --whose
 romantic history is recorded in the twenty-second chapter of
 Numbers,--was once upon a time able to converse in very good Hebrew with
 Monsieur Balaam, an ancient prophet of great merit and renown.--E.
 
 [2] The resemblance of oysters to mankind, here implied, can only be
 apparent to the "eye of faith," and lovers of these delicious bivalves
 will fail to recognize the family likeness.--E.
 
 [3] Pythagoras was born at Samos, about 590 years before the Christian
 era. He received an education well calculated to enlighten his mind and
 invigorate his body. He studied poetry, music, eloquence and astronomy,
 and became so proficient in gymnastic exercises, that in his eighteenth
 year he won the prize for wrestling at the Olympic games. He then
 visited Egypt and Chaldea, and gaining the confidence of the priests,
 learned from them the artful policy by which they governed the people.
 On his return to Samos he was saluted by the name of _Sophist_, or wise
 man, but he declined the name, and was satisfied with that of
 philosopher, or the _friend of wisdom_. He ultimately fixed his
 residence in Magna Græcia, in the town of Crotona, where he founded the
 school called _the Italian_.
 
 This school became very prosperous, and hundreds of pupils received the
 _secret instructions_ of Pythagoras, who taught by the use of ciphers or
 numbers, and hieroglyphic writings. His pupils were thus enabled to
 correspond together in unknown characters; and, by the signs and words
 employed, they could discover among strangers those who had been
 educated in the Pythagorean school. All the pupils of the philosopher
 greatly reverenced their teacher, and deemed it a crime to dispute his
 word. One of their expressions "_thus saith the Master_," has been
 adopted by modern sects.
 
 The Samian sage taught the doctrine of the metempsichosis, or the
 transmigration of the soul into different bodies, which he had probably
 learned from the Brahmins; who believed that, in these various
 peregrinations, the soul or thinking principle was purged from all evil,
 and was ultimately absorbed into the Divine substance from which it was
 supposed to have emanated.
 
 Godfrey Higgins in the _Anacalypsis_ cites authorities to prove that the
 doctrine of the metempsichosis was held by "many of the early fathers of
 the Christians, which they defended on several texts of the New
 Testament. It was held by Origin, Calcidius, Synesius, and by the
 Simonians, Basilidians, Valentiniens, Marcionites, and the Gnostics in
 general. It was also held by the Pharisees among the Jews, and by the
 most learned of the Greeks, and by many Chinese, Hindoos and Indians.
 
 "When all the circumstances relating to Pythagoras and to his doctrines,
 both in moral and natural philosophy, are considered," continues
 Higgins, "nothing can be more striking than the exact conformity of the
 latter to the received opinions of the moderns, and of the former to the
 moral doctrines of Jesus Christ."
 
 "The pupils of Pythagoras," says Eschenburg, _Manual of Classical
 Literature_, "soon amounted to 600, dwelt in one public building, and
 held their property in common. Under philosophy, the Italic school
 included every object of human knowledge. But Pythagoras considered
 music and astronomy of special value. He is supposed to have had some
 very correct views of astronomy, agreeing with the true Copernican
 system. The beautiful fancy of the music of the spheres is attributed to
 him. The planets striking on the ether, through which they pass, must
 produce a sound; this must vary according to their different magnitudes,
 velocities, and relative distances; these differences were all adjusted
 with perfect regularity and exact proportions, so that the movements of
 the bodies produced the richest tones of harmony; not heard, however, by
 mortal ears."
 
 Pythagoras taught, and his followers maintained, the absolute equality
 of property, "all their worldly possessions being brought into a common
 store". The early Christians had also "all things in common," and the
 doctrines of Jesus and Pythagoras have many points of resemblance. Both
 were reformers, both sought to benefit the poor and the oppressed, both
 taught and practised the doctrines now known as Communism, and both, for
 their love to the human race, suffered a cruel martyrdom from an
 orthodox and vindictive priesthood.
 
 In obedience to an oracle, the Romans, long after the death of
 Pythagoras, erected a statue to his memory as the wisest of mankind.--E.
 
 [4] Godfrey Higgins in the _Anacalypsis_ draws aside the veil of Isis,
 and explains in a satisfactory manner the reason why Pythagoras, like
 Socrates and Jesus, was condemned to death by the established
 priesthood. Each of these great reformers had been initiated into the
 _sacred mysteries_, and each taught his followers by secret symbols or
 parables that contained a hidden meaning; so "that seeing the
 _uninitiated_ might see and not perceive, and hearing might hear and not
 understand." The reason that Jesus gave for following this method was
 "because it is given unto you (_i.e._ the initiated) to know the
 mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them (_i.e._ the people) it
 is not given." (Matt. XIII: II.) The mass of mankind, being excluded
 from this secret knowledge, were kept in a state of debasement as
 compared with the favored few who were acquainted with the jealously
 guarded secrets of the Cabala; and the earnest desire of these great
 reformers--of these noble men who cheerfully gave their lives to benefit
 their race--was, without divulging the secrets of their initiation, to
 teach mankind to partake of the forbidden fruit of the tree of
 knowledge, and to learn "that a virtuous life would secure eternal
 happiness." Such philanthropic doctrines were denounced as wicked and
 heretical by the orthodox priesthood, who instinctively oppose human
 progress, and who, like the silversmith of Ephesus, described by St.
 Paul, felt that "this our craft is in danger" should the people become
 enlightened. They therefore, excited a popular clamor, and aroused the
 worst passions and prejudices of their followers; who, inspired with
 fanatic zeal, cruelly and wickedly burned Pythagoras of Crotona,
 poisoned Socrates of Athens, and crucified Jesus of Nazareth.--E.

 JEANNOT AND COLIN.
 
 
 Many persons, worthy of credit, have seen Jeannot and Colin at school in
 the town of Issoire, in Auvergne, France,--a town famous all over the
 world for its college and its caldrons.
 
 Jeannot was the son of a dealer in mules of great reputation; and Colin
 owed his birth to a good substantial farmer in the neighborhood, who
 cultivated the land with four mules; and who, after he had paid all
 taxes and duties at the rate of a sol per pound, was not very rich at
 the year's end.
 
 Jeannot and Colin were very handsome, considering they were natives of
 Auvergne; they dearly loved each other. They had many enjoyments in
 common, and certain little adventures of such a nature as men always
 recollect with pleasure when they afterwards meet in the world.
 
 Their studies were nearly finished, when a tailor brought Jeannot a
 velvet suit of three colors, with a waistcoat from Lyons, which was
 extremely well fancied. With these came a letter addressed to Monsieur
 de la Jeannotière.
 
 Colin admired the coat, and was not at all jealous; but Jeannot assumed
 an air of superiority, which gave Colin some uneasiness. From that
 moment Jeannot abandoned his studies; he contemplated himself in a
 glass, and despised all mankind.
 
 Soon after, a valet-de-chambre arrived post-haste, and brought a second
 letter to the Marquis de la Jeannotière; it was an order from his
 father, who desired the young marquis to repair immediately to Paris.
 Jeannot got into his chaise, giving his hand to Colin with a smile,
 which denoted the superiority of a patron. Colin felt his littleness,
 and wept. Jeannot departed in all the pomp of his glory.
 
 Such readers as take a pleasure in being instructed should be informed
 that Monsieur Jeannot the father, had, with great rapidity, acquired an
 immense fortune by business. You will ask how such great fortunes are
 made? My answer is, by luck. Monsieur Jeannot had a good person, so had
 his wife; and she had still some freshness remaining. They went to Paris
 on account of a law-suit, which ruined them; when fortune, which raises
 and depresses men at her pleasure, presented them to the wife of an
 undertaker belonging to one of the hospitals for the army. This
 undertaker, a man of great talents, might make it his boast, that he had
 buried more soldiers in a year than cannons destroy in ten. Jeannot
 pleased the wife; the wife of Jeannot interested the undertaker. Jeannot
 was employed in the undertaker's business; this introduced him to other
 business. When our boat runs with wind and stream, we have nothing to do
 but let it sail on. We then make an immense fortune with ease. The poor
 creatures who from the shore see you pursue your voyage with full sail,
 stare with astonishment; they cannot conceive to what you owe your
 success; they envy you instinctively, and write pamphlets against you
 which you never read.
 
 This is just what happened to Jeannot the father, who soon became
 Monsieur de la Jeannotière; and who having purchased a marquisate in six
 months time, took the young marquis, his son, from school, in order to
 introduce him to the polite world at Paris.
 
 Colin, whose heart was replete with tenderness, wrote a letter of
 compliments to his old companion, and congratulated him on his good
 fortune. The little marquis did not reply. Colin was so much affected at
 this neglect that he was taken ill.
 
 The father and mother immediately consigned the young marquis to the
 care of a governor. This governor, who was a man of fashion, and who
 knew nothing, was not able to teach his pupil anything.
 
 The marquis would have had his son learn Latin; this his lady opposed.
 They then referred the matter to the judgment of an author, who had at
 that time acquired great reputation by his entertaining writings. This
 author was invited to dinner. The master of the house immediately
 addressed him thus:
 
 "Sir, as you understand Latin, and are a man acquainted with the
 court,--"
 
 "I understand Latin! I don't know one word of it," answered the wit,
 "and I think myself the better for being unacquainted with it. It is
 very evident that a man speaks his own language in greater perfection
 when he does not divide his application between it and foreign
 languages. Only consider our ladies; they have a much more agreeable
 turn of wit than the men, their letters are written with a hundred times
 the grace of ours. This superiority they owe to nothing else but their
 not understanding Latin."
 
 "Well, was I not in the right?" said the lady. "I would have my son
 prove a notable man, I would have him succeed in the world; and you see
 that if he was to understand Latin he would be ruined. Pray, are plays
 and operas performed in Latin? Do lawyers plead in Latin? Do men court a
 mistress in Latin?"
 
 The marquis, dazzled by these reasons, gave up the point, and it was
 resolved, that the young marquis should not misspend his time in
 endeavoring to become acquainted with Cicero, Horace and Virgil.
 
 "Then," said the father, "what shall he learn? For he must know
 something. Might not one teach him a little geography?"
 
 "Of what use will that be?" answered the governor. "When the marquis
 goes to his estate, won't the postillion know the roads? They certainly
 will not carry him out of his way. There is no occasion for a quadrant
 to travel thither; and one can go very commodiously from Paris to
 Auvergne without knowing what latitude one is in."
 
 "You are in the right," replied the father; "but I have heard of a
 science, called astronomy, if I am not mistaken."
 
 "Bless me!" said the governor, "do people regulate their conduct by the
 influence of the stars in this world? And must the young gentleman
 perplex himself with the calculation of an eclipse, when he finds it
 ready calculated to his hand in an almanac, which, at the same time,
 shows him the movable feasts, the age of the moon, and also that of all
 the princesses in Europe?"
 
 The lady agreed perfectly with the governor; the little marquis was
 transported with joy; the father remained undetermined. "What then is my
 son to learn?" said he.
 
 "To become amiable," answered the friend who was consulted, "and if he
 knows how to please, he will know all that need be known. This art he
 will learn in the company of his mother, without either he or she being
 at any trouble."
 
 The lady, upon hearing this, embraced the ignorant flatterer, and said:
 "It is easy to see, sir, that you are the wisest man in the world. My
 son will be entirely indebted to you for his education. I think,
 however, it would not be amiss if he was to know something of history."
 
 "Alas, madam, what is that good for," answered he; "there certainly is
 no useful or entertaining history but the history of the day; all
 ancient histories, as one of our wits has observed, are only fables that
 men have agreed to admit as true. With regard to modern history, it is a
 mere chaos, a confusion which it is impossible to make anything of. Of
 what consequence is it to the young marquis, your son, to know that
 Charlemagne instituted the twelve peers of France, and that his
 successor stammered?"
 
 "Admirably said," cried the governor; "the genius of young persons is
 smothered under a heap of useless knowledge; but of all sciences, the
 most absurd, and that which, in my opinion, is most calculated to stifle
 genius of every kind, is geometry. The objects about which this
 ridiculous science is conversant, are surfaces, lines, and points, that
 have no existence in nature. By the force of imagination, the
 geometrician makes a hundred thousand curved lines pass between a circle
 and a right line that touches it, when, in reality, there is not room
 for a straw to pass there. Geometry, if we consider it in its true
 light, is a mere jest, and nothing more."
 
 The marquis and his lady did not well understand the governor's meaning,
 yet they were entirely of his opinion.
 
 "A man of quality, like the young marquis," continued he, "should not
 rack his brains with useless sciences. If he should ever have occasion
 for a plan of the lands of his estate, he may have them correctly
 surveyed without studying geometry. If he has a mind to trace the
 antiquity of his noble family, which leads the inquirer back to the most
 remote ages, he will send for a Benedictine. It will be the same thing
 with regard to all other wants. A young man of quality, endowed with a
 happy genius, is neither a painter, a musician, an architect, nor a
 graver; but he makes all these arts flourish by generously encouraging
 them. It is, doubtless, better to patronize than to practice them. It is
 enough for the young marquis to have a taste; it is the business of
 artists to exert themselves for him; and it is in this sense that it is
 said very justly of people of quality, (I mean those who are very rich),
 that they know all things without having learnt anything; for they, in
 fact, come at last to know how to judge concerning whatever they order
 or pay for."
 
 The ignorant man of fashion then spoke to this purpose:
 
 "You have very justly observed, madam, that the grand end which a man
 should have in view is to succeed in the world. Can it possibly be said
 that this success is to be obtained by cultivating the sciences? Did
 anybody ever so much as think of talking of geometry in good company?
 Does anyone ever inquire of a man of the world, what star rises with the
 sun? Who enquires at supper, whether the long-haired Clodio passed the
 Rhine?"
 
 "No, doubtless," cried the marchioness, whom her charms had in some
 measure initiated into the customs of the polite world; "and my son
 should not extinguish his genius by the study of all this stuff. But
 what is he, after all, to learn? for it is proper that a young person of
 quality should know how to shine upon an occasion, as my husband
 observes. I remember to have heard an abbé say, that the most delightful
 of all the sciences, is something that begins with a _B_."
 
 "With a B, madam? Is it not botany you mean?"
 
 "No, it was not botany he spoke of; the name of the science he mentioned
 began with _B_, and ended with _on_."
 
 "Oh, I comprehend you, madam," said the man of fashion; "it is _Blason_
 you mean. It is indeed a profound science; but it is no longer in
 fashion, since the people of quality have ceased to cause their arms to
 be painted upon the doors of their coaches. It was once the most useful
 thing in the world, in a well regulated state. Besides, this study would
 be endless. Now-a-days there is hardly a barber that has not his coat of
 arms; and you know that whatever becomes common is but little esteemed."
 
 In fine, after they had examined the excellencies and defects of all the
 sciences, it was determined that the young marquis should learn to
 dance.
 
 Nature, which does all, had given him a talent that quickly displayed
 itself surprisingly; it was that of singing ballads agreeably. The
 graces of youth, joined to this superior gift, caused him to be looked
 upon as a young man of the brightest hopes. He was admired by the women;
 and having his head full of songs, he composed some for his mistress. He
 stole from the song "_Bacchus and Love_" in one ballad; from that of
 "_Night and Day_" in another; from that of "_Charms and Alarms_" in a
 third. But as there were always in his verses some superfluous feet, or
 not enough, he had them corrected for twenty louis-d'ors a song; and in
 the annals of literature he was put upon a level with the La Fares,
 Chaulieus, Hamiltons, Sarrazins, and Voitures.
 
 The marchioness then looked upon herself as the mother of a wit, and
 gave a supper to the wits of Paris. The young man's brain was soon
 turned; he acquired the art of speaking without knowing his own meaning,
 and he became perfect in the habit of being good for nothing. When his
 father found he was so eloquent, he very much regretted that his son had
 not learned Latin; for he would have bought him a lucrative place among
 the gentry of the long robe. The mother, who had more elevated
 sentiments, undertook to procure a regiment for her son; and in the
 meantime, courtship was his occupation. Love is sometimes more expensive
 than a regiment. He was very improvident, whilst his parents exhausted
 their finances still more, by expensive living.
 
 A young widow of fashion, their neighbor, who had but a moderate
 fortune, had an inclination to secure the great wealth of Monsieur and
 Madame de la Jeannotière, and appropriating it to herself, by a marriage
 with the young marquis. She allured him to visit her; she admitted his
 addresses; she showed that she was not indifferent to him; she led him
 on by degrees; she enchanted and captivated him without much difficulty.
 Sometimes she lavished praises upon him, sometimes she gave him advice.
 She became the most intimate friend of both the father and mother.
 
 An elderly lady, who was their neighbor, proposed the match. The
 parents, dazzled by the glory of such an alliance, accepted the proposal
 with joy. They gave their only son to their intimate friend.
 
 The young marquis was now on the point of marrying a woman whom he
 adored, and by whom he was beloved; the friends of the family
 congratulated them; the marriage articles were just going to be drawn
 up, whilst wedding clothes were being made for the young couple, and
 their epithalamium composed.
 
 The young marquis was one day upon his knees before his charming
 mistress, whom love, esteem, and friendship were going to make all his
 own. In a tender and spirited conversation, they enjoyed a foretaste of
 their coming happiness, they concerted measures to lead a happy life.
 When all on a sudden a valet-de-chambre belonging to the old
 marchioness, arrived in a great fright.
 
 "Here is sad news," said he, "officers have removed the effects of my
 master and mistress; the creditors have seized upon all by virtue of an
 execution; and I am obliged to make the best shift I can to have my
 wages paid."
 
 "Let's see," said the marquis, "what is this? What can this adventure
 mean?"
 
 "Go," said the widow, "go quickly, and punish those villains."
 
 He runs, he arrives at the house; his father is already in prison; all
 the servants have fled in different ways, each carrying off whatever he
 could lay his hands upon. His mother is alone, without assistance,
 without comfort, drowned in tears. She has nothing left but the
 remembrance of her fortune, of her beauty, her faults, and her
 extravagant living.
 
 After the son had wept a long time with his mother, he at length said to
 her:
 
 "Let us not give ourselves up to despair. This young widow loves me to
 excess; she is more generous than rich, I can answer for her; I will go
 and bring her to you."
 
 He returns to his mistress, and finds her in company with a very amiable
 young officer.
 
 "What, is it you, M. de la Jeannotière," said she; "what brings you
 here? Is it proper to forsake your unhappy mother in such a crisis? Go
 to that poor, unfortunate woman, and tell her that I still wish her
 well. I have occasion for a chamber-maid, and will give her the
 preference."
 
 "My lad," said the officer, "you are well shaped. Enlist in my company;
 you may depend on good usage."
 
 The marquis, thunderstruck, and with a heart enraged, went in quest of
 his old governor, made him acquainted with his misfortune, and asked his
 advice. The governor proposed that he should become a tutor, like
 himself.
 
 "Alas!" said the marquis, "I know nothing; you have taught me nothing,
 and you are the first cause of my misfortunes." He sobbed when he spoke
 thus.
 
 "Write romances," said a wit who was present; "it is an admirable
 resource at Paris."
 
 The young man, in greater despair than ever, ran to his mother's
 confessor. This confessor was a Theatin of great reputation, who
 directed the consciences only of women of the first rank. As soon as he
 saw Jeannot, he ran up to him:
 
 "My God, Mr. Marquis," said he, "where is your coach? How is the good
 lady your mother?"
 
 The poor unfortunate young man gave him an account of what had befallen
 his family. In proportion as he explained himself the Theatin assumed an
 air more grave, more indifferent, and more defiant.
 
 "My son," said he, "it is the will of God that you should be reduced to
 this condition; riches serve only to corrupt the heart. God, in his
 great mercy, has then reduced your mother to beggary?"
 
 [Illustration: Jeannot and Colin.]
 
 "Yes, sir," answered the marquis.
 
 "So much the better," said the confessor, "her election is the more
 certain."
 
 "But father," said the marquis, "is there in the mean time no hopes of
 some assistance in this world?"
 
 "Farewell, my son," said the confessor; "a court lady is waiting for
 me."
 
 The marquis was almost ready to faint. He met with much the same
 treatment from all; and acquired more knowledge of the world in half a
 day than he had previously learned in all the rest of his life.
 
 Being quite overwhelmed with despair, he saw an old-fashioned chaise
 advance, which resembled an open wagon with leather curtains; it was
 followed by four enormous carts which were loaded. In the chaise there
 was a young man, dressed in the rustic manner, whose fresh countenance
 was replete with sweetness and gaiety. His wife, a little woman of a
 brown complexion and an agreeable figure, though somewhat stout, sat
 close by him. As the carriage did not move on like the chaise of a
 petit-maître, the traveler had sufficient time to contemplate the
 marquis, who was motionless and immersed in sorrow.
 
 "Good God," cried he, "I think that is Jeannot." Upon hearing this name,
 the marquis lifts up his eyes, the carriage stops, and Colin cries out,
 "'Tis Jeannot, 'tis Jeannot himself."
 
 The little fat bumpkin gave but one spring from the chaise and ran to
 embrace his old companion. Jeannot recollected his friend Colin, while
 his eyes were blinded with tears of shame.
 
 "You have abandoned me," said Colin; "but, though you are a great man, I
 will love you forever."
 
 Jeannot, confused and affected, related to him with emotion a great part
 of his history.
 
 "Come to the inn where I lodge, and tell me the rest of it," said Colin;
 "embrace my wife here, and let us go and dine together." They then went
 on foot, followed by their baggage.
 
 "What is all this train," said Jeannot; "is it yours?"
 
 "Yes," answered Colin, "it all belongs to me and to my wife. We have
 just come in from the country. I am now at the head of a large
 manufactory of tin and copper. I have married the daughter of a merchant
 well provided with all things necessary for the great as well as the
 little. We work a great deal; God blesses us; we have not changed our
 condition; we are happy; we will assist our friend Jeannot. Be no longer
 a marquis; all the grandeur in the world is not to be compared to a good
 friend. You shall return with me to the country. I will teach you the
 trade; it is not very difficult; I will make you my partner, and we will
 live merrily in the remote corner where we were born."
 
 Jeannot, quite transported, felt emotions of grief and joy, tenderness
 and shame; and he said within himself: "My fashionable friends have
 betrayed me, and Colin, whom I despised, is the only one who comes to
 relieve me." What instruction does not this narrative afford!
 
 Colin's goodness of heart caused the seeds of a virtuous disposition,
 which the world had not quite stifled in Jeannot, to revive. He was
 sensible that he could not forsake his father and mother.
 
 "We will take care of your mother," said Colin; "and as to the good man
 your father, who is now in jail, his creditors, seeing he has nothing,
 will compromise matters for a trifle. I know something of business, and
 will take the whole affair upon myself."
 
 Colin found means to procure the father's enlargement. Jeannot returned
 to the country with his relatives, who resumed their former way of life.
 He married a sister of Colin, and she, being of the same temper with her
 brother, made him completely happy.
 
 Jeannot the father, Jeannote the mother, and Jeannot the son, were thus
 convinced that happiness is not the result of vanity.

 THE HISTORY OF THE TRAVELS OF SCARMENTADO.[1]
 
 
 I was born in Candia, in the year 1600. My father was governor of the
 city; and I remember that a poet of middling parts, and of a most
 unmusical ear, whose name was Iro, composed some verses in my praise, in
 which he made me to descend from Minos in a direct line; but my father
 being afterwards disgraced, he wrote some other verses, in which he
 derived my pedigree from no nobler an origin than the amours of Pasiphæ
 and her gallant. This Iro was a most mischievous rogue, and one of the
 most troublesome fellows in the island.
 
 My father sent me at fifteen years of age to prosecute my studies at
 Rome. There I arrived in full hopes of learning all kinds of truth; for
 I had hitherto been taught quite the reverse, according to the custom of
 this lower world from China to the Alps. Monsignor Profondo, to whom I
 was recommended, was a man of a very singular character, and one of the
 most terrible scholars in the world. He was for teaching me the
 categories of Aristotle; and was just on the point of placing me in the
 category of his minions; a fate which I narrowly escaped. I saw
 processions, exorcisms, and some robberies.
 
 It was commonly said, but without any foundation, that la Signora
 Olympia, a lady of great prudence, had deceived many lovers, she being
 both inconstant and mercenary. I was then of an age to relish such
 comical anecdotes.
 
 A young lady of great sweetness of temper, called la Signora Fatelo,
 thought proper to fall in love with me. She was courted by the reverend
 father Poignardini, and by the reverend father Aconiti,[2] young monks
 of an order now extinct; and she reconciled the two rivals by declaring
 her preference for me; but at the same time I ran the risk of being
 excommunicated and poisoned. I left Rome highly pleased with the
 architecture of St. Peter.
 
 I traveled to France. It was during the reign of Louis the Just. The
 first question put to me was, whether I chose to breakfast on a slice of
 the Marshal D'Ancre,[3] whose flesh the people had roasted and
 distributed with great liberality to such as chose to taste it.
 
 This kingdom was continually involved in civil wars, sometimes for a
 place at court, sometimes for two pages of theological controversy. This
 fire, which one while lay concealed under the ashes, and at another
 burst forth with great violence, had desolated these beautiful provinces
 for upwards of sixty years. The pretext was, defending the liberties of
 the Gallican church. "Alas!" said I, "these people are nevertheless born
 with a gentle disposition. What can have drawn them so far from their
 natural character? They joke and keep holy days.[4] Happy the time when
 they shall do nothing but joke!"
 
 I went over to England, where the same disputes occasioned the same
 barbarities. Some pious Catholics had resolved, for the good of the
 church, to blow up into the air with gunpowder the king, the royal
 family, and the whole parliament, and thus to deliver England from all
 these heretics at once. They showed me the place where Queen Mary of
 blessed memory, the daughter of Henry VIII., had caused more than five
 hundred, of her subjects to be burnt. An Irish priest assured me that it
 was a very good action; first, because those who were burnt were
 Englishmen; and secondly, because they did not make use of holy water,
 nor believe in St. Patrick. He was greatly surprised that Queen Mary was
 not yet canonized; but he hoped she would receive that honor as soon as
 the cardinal should be a little more at leisure.
 
 From thence I went to Holland, where I hoped to find more tranquillity
 among a people of a more cold and phlegmatic temperament. Just as I
 arrived at the Hague, the people were cutting off the head of a
 venerable old man. It was the bald head of the prime minister Barnevelt;
 a man who deserved better treatment from the republic. Touched with pity
 at this affecting scene, I asked what was his crime, and whether he had
 betrayed the state.
 
 "He has done much worse," replied a preacher in a black cloak; "he
 believed that men may be saved by good works as well as by faith. You
 must be sensible," adds he, "that if such opinions were to gain ground,
 a republic could not subsist; and that there must be severe laws to
 suppress such scandalous and horrid blasphemies."
 
 A profound politician said to me with a sigh: "Alas! sir, this happy
 time will not last long; it is only by chance that the people are so
 zealous. They are naturally inclined to the abominable doctrine of
 toleration, and they will certainly at last grant it." This reflection
 set him a groaning. For my own part, in expectation of that fatal period
 when moderation and indulgence should take place, I instantly quitted a
 country where severity was not softened by any lenitive, and embarked
 for Spain.
 
 The court was then at Seville, the galleons had just arrived; and
 everything breathed plenty and gladness, in the most beautiful season of
 the year. I observed at the end of an alley of orange and citron trees,
 a kind of large ring, surrounded with steps covered with rich and costly
 cloth. The king, the queen, the infants, and the infantas, were seated
 under a superb canopy. Opposite to the royal family was another throne,
 raised higher than that on which his majesty sat. I said to a
 fellow-traveler: "Unless this throne be reserved for God, I don't see
 what purpose it can serve."
 
 This unguarded expression was overheard by a grave Spaniard, and cost me
 dear. Meanwhile, I imagined we were going to a carousal, or a match of
 bull-baiting, when the grand inquisitor appeared in that elevated
 throne, from whence he blessed the king and the people.
 
 Then came an army of monks, who led off in pairs, white, black, grey,
 shod, unshod, bearded, beardless, with pointed cowls, and without cowls.
 Next followed the hangman; and last of all were seen, in the midst of
 the guards and grandees, about forty persons clad in sackcloth, on which
 were painted the figures of flames and devils. Some of these were Jews,
 who could not be prevailed upon to renounce Moses entirely; others were
 Christians, who had married women with whom they had stood sponsors to a
 child; who had not adored our Lady of Atocha; or who had refused to part
 with their ready money in favor of the Hieronymite brothers. Some pretty
 prayers were sung with much devotion, and then the criminals were burnt
 at a slow fire; a ceremony with which the royal family seemed to be
 greatly edified.
 
 As I was going to bed in the evening, two members of the inquisition
 came to my lodging with a figure of St. Hermandad. They embraced me with
 great tenderness, and conducted me in solemn silence to a well-aired
 prison, furnished with a bed of mat, and a beautiful crucifix. There I
 remained for six weeks; at the end of which time the reverend father,
 the Inquisitor, sent for me. He pressed me in his arms for some time
 with the most paternal affection, and told me that he was sorry to hear
 that I had been so ill lodged; but that all the apartments of the house
 were full, and hoped I should be better accommodated the next time. He
 then asked me with great cordiality if I knew for what reason I was
 imprisoned.
 
 I told the reverend father that it was evidently for my sins.
 
 "Very well," said he, "my dear child; but for what particular sin? Speak
 freely."
 
 I racked my brain with conjectures, but could not possibly guess. He
 then charitably dismissed me. At last I remembered my unguarded
 expression. I escaped with a little bodily correction, and a fine of
 thirty thousand reals. I was led to make my obeisance to the grand
 Inquisitor, who was a man of great politeness. He asked me how I liked
 his little feast. I told him it was a most delicious one; and then went
 to press my companions to quit the country, beautiful as it was.
 
 They had, during my imprisonment, found time to inform themselves of all
 the great things which the Spaniards had done for the interest of
 religion. They had read the memoirs of the famous bishop of Chiapa, by
 which it appears that they had massacred, or burnt, or drowned, about
 ten millions of infidels in America, in order to convert them. I believe
 the accounts of the bishop are a little exaggerated; but suppose we
 reduce the number of victims to five millions, it will still be a most
 glorious achievement.
 
 The impulse for traveling still possessed me. I had proposed to finish
 the tour of Europe with Turkey, and thither we now directed our course.
 I made a firm resolution not to give my opinion of any public feasts I
 might see in the future. "These Turks," said I to my companions, "are a
 set of miscreants that have not been baptized, and therefore will be
 more cruel than the reverend fathers the inquisitors. Let us observe a
 profound silence while we are among the Mahometans." When we arrived
 there, I was greatly surprised to see more Christian churches in Turkey
 than in Candia. I saw also numerous troops of monks, who were allowed to
 pray to the virgin Mary with great freedom, and to curse Mahomet--some
 in Greek, some in Latin, and others in Armenian. "What good-natured
 people are these Turks," cried I.
 
 The Greek christians, and the Latin christians in Constantinople were
 mortal enemies. These sectarians persecuted each other in much the same
 manner as dogs fight in the streets, till their masters part them with a
 cudgel.
 
 The grand vizier was at that time the protector of the Greeks. The Greek
 patriarch accused me of having supped with the Latin patriarch; and I
 was condemned in full divan to receive an hundred blows on the soles of
 my feet, redeemable for five hundred sequins. Next day the grand vizier
 was strangled. The day following his successor, who was for the Latin
 party, and who was not strangled till a month after, condemned me to
 suffer the same punishment, for having supped with the Greek patriarch.
 Thus was I reduced to the sad necessity of absenting myself entirely
 from the Greek and Latin churches.
 
 In order to console myself for this loss, I frequently visited a very
 handsome Circassian. She was the most entertaining lady I ever knew in a
 private conversation, and the most devout at the mosque. One evening she
 received me with tenderness and sweetly cried, "Alla, Illa, Alla."
 
 These are the sacramental words of the Turks. I imagined they were the
 expressions of love, and therefore cried in my turn, and with a very
 tender accent, "Alla, Illa, Alla."
 
 "Ah!" said she, "God be praised, thou art then a Turk?"
 
 I told her that I was blessing God for having given me so much
 enjoyment, and that I thought myself extremely happy.
 
 In the morning the inman came to enroll me among the circumcised, and as
 I made some objection to the initiation, the cadi of that district, a
 man of great loyalty, proposed to have me impaled. I preserved my
 freedom by paying a thousand sequins, and then fled directly into
 Persia, resolved for the future never to hear Greek or Latin mass, nor
 to cry "Alla, Illa, Alla," in a love encounter.
 
 On my arrival at Ispahan, the people asked me whether I was for white or
 black mutton? I told them that it was a matter of indifference to me,
 provided it was tender. It must be observed that the Persian empire was
 at that time split into two factions, that of the white mutton and that
 of the black. The two parties imagined that I had made a jest of them
 both; so that I found myself engaged in a very troublesome affair at the
 gates of the city, and it cost me a great number of sequins to get rid
 of the white and the black mutton.
 
 I proceeded as far as China, in company with an interpreter, who assured
 me that this country was the seat of gaiety and freedom. The Tartars had
 made themselves masters of it, after having destroyed everything with
 fire and sword.
 
 The reverend fathers, the Jesuits, on the one hand, and the reverend
 fathers, the Dominicans, on the other, alleged that they had gained many
 souls to God in that country, without any one knowing aught of the
 matter. Never were seen such zealous converters. They alternately
 persecuted one another; they transmitted to Rome whole volumes of
 slander; and treated each other as infidels and prevaricators for the
 sake of one soul. But the most violent dispute between them was with
 regard to the manner of making a bow. The Jesuits would have the
 Chinese to salute their parents after the fashion of China, and the
 Dominicans would have them to do it after the fashion of Rome.
 
 I happened unluckily to be taken by the Jesuits for a Dominican. They
 represented me to his Tartarian majesty as a spy of the pope. The
 supreme council charged a prime mandarin, who ordered a sergeant, who
 commanded four shires of the country, to seize me and bind me with great
 ceremony. In this manner I was conducted before his majesty, after
 having made about an hundred and forty genuflections. He asked me if I
 was a spy of the pope's, and if it was true that that prince was to come
 in person to dethrone him. I told him that the pope was a priest of
 seventy years of age; that he lived at the distance of four thousand
 leagues from his sacred Tartaro-Chinese majesty; that he had about two
 thousand soldiers, who mounted guard with umbrellas; that he never
 dethroned anybody; and that his majesty might sleep in perfect security.
 
 Of all the adventures of my life this was the least fatal. I was sent to
 Macao, and there I took shipping for Europe.
 
 My ship required to be refitted on the coast of Golconda. I embraced
 this opportunity to visit the court of the great Aureng-Zeb, of whom
 such wonderful things have been told, and which was then in Delphi. I
 had the pleasure to see him on the day of that pompous ceremony in which
 he receives the celestial present sent him by the Sherif of Mecca. This
 was the besom with which they had swept the holy house, the Caaba, and
 the Beth Alla. It is a symbol that sweeps away all the pollutions of the
 soul.
 
 Aureng-Zeb seemed to have no need of it. He was the most pious man in
 all Indostan. It is true, he had cut the throat of one of his brothers,
 and poisoned his father. Twenty Rayas, and as many Omras, had been put
 to death; but that was a trifle. Nothing was talked of but his devotion.
 No king was thought comparable to him, except his sacred majesty Muley
 Ismael, the most serene emperor of Morocco, who always cut off some
 heads every Friday after prayers.
 
 I spoke not a word. My travels had taught me wisdom. I was sensible that
 it did not belong to me to decide between these august sovereigns. A
 young Frenchman, a fellow-lodger of mine, was, however, greatly wanting
 in respect to both the emperor of the Indies and to that of Morocco. He
 happened to say very imprudently, that there were sovereigns in Europe
 who governed their dominions with great equity, and even went to church
 without killing their fathers or brothers, or cutting off the heads of
 their subjects.
 
 This indiscreet discourse of my young friend, the interpreter at once
 translated. Instructed by former experience, I instantly caused my
 camels to be saddled, and set out with my Frenchman. I was afterwards
 informed that the officers of the great Aureng-Zeb came that very night
 to seize me, but finding only the interpreter, they publicly executed
 him; and the courtiers all claimed, very justly, that his punishment was
 well deserved.
 
 I had now only Africa to visit in order to enjoy all the pleasures of
 our continent; and thither I went to complete my voyage. The ship in
 which I embarked was taken by the Negro corsairs. The master of the
 vessel complained loudly, and asked why they thus violated the laws of
 nations. The captain of the Negroes thus replied:
 
 "You have a long nose and we have a short one. Your hair is straight and
 ours is curled; your skin is ash-colored and ours is of the color of
 ebon; and therefore we ought, by the sacred laws of nature, to be always
 at enmity. You buy us in the public markets on the coast of Guinea like
 beasts of burden, to make us labor in I don't know what kind of
 drudgery, equally hard and ridiculous. With the whip held over our
 heads, you make us dig in mines for a kind of yellow earth, which in
 itself is good for nothing, and is not so valuable as an Egyptian onion.
 In like manner wherever we meet you, and are superior to you in
 strength, we make you slaves, and oblige you to cultivate our fields, or
 in case of refusal we cut off your nose and ears."
 
 To such a learned discourse it was impossible to make any answer. I
 submitted to labor in the garden of an old negress, in order to save my
 nose and ears. After continuing in slavery for a whole year, I was at
 length happily ransomed.
 
 As I had now seen all that was rare, good, or beautiful on earth, I
 resolved for the future to see nothing but my own home. I took a wife,
 and soon suspected that she deceived me; but, notwithstanding this
 doubt, I still found that of all conditions of life this was much the
 happiest.

 THE GOOD BRAMIN.
 
 DOES HAPPINESS RESULT FROM IGNORANCE OR FROM KNOWLEDGE?
 
 
 In my travels I once happened to meet with an aged Bramin. This man had
 a great share of understanding and prudence, and was very learned. He
 was also very rich, and his riches added greatly to his popularity; for,
 wanting nothing that wealth could procure, he had no desire to defraud
 any one. His family was admirably managed by three handsome wives, who
 always studied to please him; and when he was weary of their society, he
 had recourse to the study of philosophy.
 
 Not far from his house, which was handsome, well-furnished and
 embellished with delightful gardens, dwelt an old Indian woman who was a
 great bigot, ignorant, and withall very poor.
 
 "I wish," said the Bramin to me one day, "I had never been born!"
 
 "Why so?" said I.
 
 "Because," replied he, "I have been studying these forty years, and I
 find it has been so much time lost. While I teach others I know nothing
 myself. The sense of my condition is so humiliating, it makes all things
 so distasteful to me, that life has become a burden. I have been born,
 and I exist in time, without knowing what time is. I am placed, as our
 wise men say, in the confines between two eternities, and yet I have no
 idea of eternity. I am composed of matter, I think, but have never been
 able to satisfy myself what it is that produces thought. I even am
 ignorant whether my understanding is a simple faculty I possess, like
 that of walking and digesting, or if I think with my head in the same
 manner as I take hold of a thing with my hands. I am not only thus in
 the dark with relation to the principles of thought, but the principles
 of my motions are entirely unknown to me. I do not know why I exist, and
 yet I am applied to every day for a solution of the enigma. I must
 return an answer, but can say nothing satisfactory on the the subject. I
 talk a great deal, and when I have done speaking remain confounded and
 ashamed of what I have said."
 
 "I am in still greater perplexity when I am asked if Brama was produced
 by Vishnu, or if they have both existed from eternity. God is my judge
 that I know nothing of the matter, as plainly appears by my answers.
 'Reverend father,' says one, 'be pleased to inform me how evil is spread
 over the face of the earth.' I am as much at a loss as those who ask the
 question. Sometimes I tell them that every thing is for the best; but
 those who have the gout or the stone--those who have lost their fortunes
 or their limbs in the wars--believe as little of this assertion as I do
 myself. I retire to my own house full of curiosity, and endeavor to
 enlighten my ignorance by consulting the writings of our ancient sages,
 but they only serve to bewilder me the more. When I talk with my
 brethren upon this subject, some tell me we ought to make the most of
 life and laugh at the world. Others think they know something, and lose
 themselves in vain and chimerical hypotheses. Every effort I make to
 solve the mystery adds to the load I feel. Sometimes I am ready to fall
 into despair when I reflect that, after all my researches, I neither
 know from whence I came, what I am, whither I shall go, or what is to
 become of me."
 
 The condition in which I saw this good man gave me real concern. No one
 could be more rational, no one more open and honest. It appeared to me
 that the force of his understanding and the sensibility of his heart
 were the causes of his misery.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 The same day I had a conversation with the old woman, his neighbor. I
 asked her if she had ever been unhappy for not understanding how her
 soul was made? She did not even comprehend my question. She had not, for
 the briefest moment in her life, had a thought about these subjects with
 which the good Bramin had so tormented himself. She believed from the
 bottom of her heart in the metamorphoses of her god Vishnu, and,
 provided she could get some of the sacred water of the Ganges in which
 to make her ablutions, she thought herself the happiest of women.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 Struck with the happiness of this poor creature, I returned to my
 philosopher, whom I thus addressed:
 
 "Are you not ashamed to be thus miserable when, not fifty yards from
 you, there is an old automaton who thinks of nothing and lives
 contented?"
 
 "You are right," he replied. "I have said to myself a thousand times
 that I should be happy if I were but as ignorant as my old neighbor, and
 yet it is a happiness I do not desire."
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 This reply of the Bramin made a greater impression on me than any thing
 that had passed. I consulted my own heart and found that I myself should
 not wish to be happy on condition of being ignorant.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 I submitted this matter to some philosophers, and they were all of my
 opinion: and yet, said I, there is something very contradictory in this
 manner of thinking; for, after all, what is the question? Is it not to
 be happy? What signifies it then whether we have understandings or
 whether we are fools? Besides, there is this to be said: those who are
 contented with their condition are sure of that content; while those
 who have the faculty of reasoning are not always sure of reasoning
 right. It is evident then, I continued, that we ought rather to wish not
 to have common sense, if that common sense contributes to our being
 either miserable or wicked.
 
 They were all of my opinion, and yet not one of them could be found, to
 accept of happiness on the terms of being ignorant. From hence I
 concluded, that although we may set a great value upon happiness, we set
 a still greater upon reason.
 
 But after mature reflection upon this subject I still thought there was
 great madness in preferring reason to happiness. How is this
 contradiction to be explained? Like all other questions, a great deal
 may be said about it.

 THE TWO COMFORTERS.
 
 
 The great philosopher Citosile once said to a woman who was
 disconsolate, and who had good reason to be so: "Madame, the queen of
 England, daughter to Henry IV., was as wretched as you. She was banished
 from her kingdom, was in great danger of losing her life at sea, and saw
 her royal spouse expire on a scaffold."
 
 "I am sorry for her," said the lady, and began again to lament her own
 misfortunes.
 
 "But," said Citosile, "remember the fate of Mary Stuart. She loved, (but
 with a most chaste and virtuous affection,) an excellent musician, who
 played admirably on the bass-viol. Her husband killed her musician
 before her face; and in the sequel, her good friend and relative, queen
 Elizabeth, who called herself a virgin, caused her head to be cut off on
 a scaffold covered with black, after having confined her in prison for
 the space of eighteen years."
 
 "That was very cruel," replied the lady, and presently relapsed into her
 former melancholy.
 
 "Perhaps," said the comforter, "you have heard of the beautiful Joan of
 Naples, who was taken prisoner and strangled."
 
 "I have a dim remembrance of her," said the afflicted lady.
 
 "I must relate to you," continued the other, "the adventure of a
 sovereign princess who, within my recollection, was dethroned after
 supper, and who died in a desert island."
 
 "I know her whole history," replied the lady.
 
 "Well, then," said Citosile, "I will tell you what happened to another
 great princess whom I instructed in philosophy. She had a lover as all
 great and beautiful princesses have. Her father surprised this lover in
 her company, and was so displeased with the young man's confused manner
 and excited countenance, that he gave him one of the most terrible blows
 that had ever been given in his province. The lover seized a pair of
 tongs and broke the head of the angry parent, who was cured with great
 difficulty, and who still bears the marks of the wound. The lady in a
 fright leaped out of the window and dislocated her foot, in consequence
 of which she habitually halts, though still possessed in other respects
 of a very handsome person. The lover was condemned to death for having
 broken the head of a great prince. You can imagine in what a deplorable
 condition the princess must have been when her lover was led to the
 gallows. I have seen her long ago when she was in prison, and she always
 spoke to me of her own misfortunes."
 
 "And why will you not allow me to think of mine?" said the lady.
 
 "Because," said the philosopher, "you ought not to think of them; and
 since so many great ladies have been so unfortunate, it ill becomes you
 to despair. Think of Hecuba, --think of Niobe."
 
 "Ah!" said the lady, "had I lived in their time, or in that of so many
 beautiful princesses, and had you endeavored to console them by a
 relation of my misfortunes, would they have listened to you, do you
 imagine?"
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 Next day the philosopher lost his only son, and was entirely prostrated
 with grief. The lady caused a catalogue to be drawn up of all the kings
 who had lost their children, and carried it to the philosopher. He read
 it--found it very exact--and wept nevertheless.
 
 Three months afterwards they chanced to renew their acquaintance, and
 were mutually surprised to find each other in such a gay and sprightly
 humor. To commemorate this event, they caused to be erected a beautiful
 statue to Time, with this inscription: "TO HIM WHO COMFORTS."
 
 [Illustration: The winged dragon.][1]
 
 
 
 
 ANCIENT FAITH AND FABLE.
 
 
 In order to be successful in their efforts to govern the multitude,
 rulers have endeavored to instill all the visionary notions possible
 into the minds of their subjects.
 
 The good people who read _Virgil_, or the _Provincial Letters_, do not
 know that there are twenty times more copies of the _Almanac of Liège_
 and of the _Courier Boiteux_ printed, than of all the ancient and modern
 books together. No one can have a greater admiration than myself for the
 illustrious authors of these _Almanacs_ and their brethren. I know that
 ever since the time of the ancient Chaldeans there have been fixed and
 stated days for taking physic, paring our nails, giving battle, and
 cleaving wood. I know that the best part of the revenue of an
 illustrious academy consists in the sale of these _Almanacs_. May I
 presume to ask, with all possible submission, and a becoming diffidence
 of my own judgment, what harm it would do to the world if some powerful
 astrologer were to assure the peasants and the good inhabitants of
 little villages that they might safely pare their nails when they
 please, provided it be done with a good intention? The people, I shall
 be told, would not buy the _Almanacs_ of this new astrologer. On the
 contrary, I will venture to affirm, that there would be found among
 your great geniuses many who would make a merit in following this
 novelty. Should it be alleged, however, that these geniuses, in their
 new born zeal, would form factions and kindle a civil war, I would have
 nothing farther to say on the subject, but readily give up for the sake
 of peace my too radical and dangerous opinion.
 
 Every body knows the king of Boutan. He is one of the greatest princes
 in the universe. He tramples under his feet the thrones of the earth;
 and his shoes (if he has any) are provided with sceptres instead of
 buckles. He adores the devil, as is well known, and his example is
 followed by all his courtiers. He one day sent for a famous sculptor of
 my country, and ordered him to make a beautiful statue of Beelzebub. The
 sculptor succeeded admirably. Never before was there seen such an
 interesting and handsome devil. But, unhappily, our Praxiteles had only
 given five clutches to his statue, whereas the devout Boutaniers always
 gave him six. This serious blunder of the artist was aggravated by the
 grand master of ceremonies to the devil with all the zeal of a man
 justly jealous of his master's acknowledged rights, and also of the
 established and sacred customs of the kingdom of Boutan. He insisted
 that the sculptor should be punished for his thoughtless innovation by
 the loss of his head. The anxious sculptor explained that his five
 clutches were exactly equal in weight to six ordinary clutches; and the
 king of Boutan, who was a prince of great clemency, granted him a
 pardon. From that time the people of Boutan no longer believed the dogma
 relating to the devil's six clutches.
 
 The same day it was thought necessary that his majesty should be bled,
 and a surgeon of Gascony, who had come to his court in a ship belonging
 to our East India Company, was appointed to take from him five ounces of
 his precious blood. The astrologer of that quarter cried out that the
 king would be in danger of losing his life if the surgeon opened a vein
 while the heavens were in their present state. The Gascon might have
 told him that the only question was about the king's health; but he
 prudently waited a few moments and then, taking an _Almanac_ in his
 hand, thus addressed the astrologer.
 
 "You was in the right, great man! The king would have died held he been
 bled at the instant you mentioned; but the heavens have since changed
 their aspect, and now is the favorable moment."
 
 The astrologer assented to the surgeon's observation. The king was
 cured; and by degrees it became an established custom among the
 Boutaniers to bleed their kings whenever it was considered necessary.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 Although the Indian astronomers understood the method of calculating
 eclipses, yet the common people obstinately held to the old belief that
 the sun, when obscured, had fallen into the throat of a great dragon,
 and that the only way to free him from thence was by standing naked in
 the water and making a hideous noise to frighten away the monster, and
 oblige him to release his hold.[2] This notion, which is quite prevalent
 among the orientals, is an evident proof how much the symbols of
 religion and natural philosophy have at all times been perverted by the
 common people. The astronomers of all ages have been wont to distinguish
 the two points of intersection, upon which every eclipse happens, and
 which are called the Lunar Nodes, by marking them with a dragon's head
 and tail. Now the vulgar, who are equally ignorant in every part of the
 world, took the symbol or sign for the thing itself. Thus, when the
 astronomers said the sun is in the dragon's head, the common people said
 the dragon is going to swallow up the sun; and yet these people were
 remarkable for their fondness for astrology. But while we laugh at the
 ignorance and credulity of the Indians, we do not reflect that there are
 no less than 300,000 _Almanacs_ sold yearly in Europe, all of them
 filled with observations and predictions equally as false and absurd as
 any to be met with among the Indians. It is surely as reasonable to say
 that the sun is in the mouth or the claws of a dragon, as to tell people
 every year in print that they must not sow, nor plant, nor take physic,
 nor be bled, but on certain days of the moon. It is high time, in an age
 like ours, that some men of learning should think it worth their while
 to compose a calendar that might be of use to the industrious classes by
 instructing instead of deceiving them.
 
 A blustering Dominican at Rome said to an English philosopher with whom
 he was disputing:
 
 "You are a dog; you say that it is the earth that turns round, never
 reflecting that Joshua made the sun to stand still!"
 
 "Well! my reverend father," replied the philosopher, "ever since that
 time hath not the sun been immovable?"
 
 The dog and the Dominican embraced each other, and even the devout
 Italians were at length convinced that the earth turns round.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 An augur and a senator lamented, in the time of Cæsar, the declining
 state of the republic.
 
 "The times, indeed, are very bad," said the senator, "we have reason to
 tremble for the liberty of Rome."
 
 "Ah!" said the augur, "that is not the greatest evil; the people now
 begin to lose the respect which they formerly had for our order. We seem
 barely to be tolerated--we cease to be necessary. Some generals have the
 assurance to give battle without consulting us. And, to complete our
 misfortunes, even those who sell us the sacred pullets begin to reason."
 
 "Well, and why don't you reason likewise?" replied the senator, "and
 since the dealers in pullets in the time of Cæsar are more knowing than
 they were in the time of Numa, ought not you modern augurs to be better
 philosophers than those who lived in former ages?"
 
 
 [1] This dragon was of the same species, _Draco Volans_, as the savage
 reptile slain by St. George, the patron saint of England, or the
 sleepless dragon at Colchis, from which Jason rescued the _golden
 fleece_. The bible history abounds with allusions to dragons, and with
 prophecies of their coming exploits in the stellar spheres. These
 marvels may be considered, however, as more strange than credible, and
 more ancient than authentic--E.
 
 [2] In Rev. XII: 3, 4, the Dragon is represented as deftly seizing
 one-third of the stars of heaven with his tail, and rudely wresting them
 in dire confusion from the celestial spheres.--E.

 _PREFACE_
 
 
 This book does not demand continuous reading; but at whatever place one
 opens it, one will find matter for reflection. The most useful books are
 those of which readers themselves compose half; they extend the thoughts
 of which the germ is presented to them; they correct what seems
 defective to them, and they fortify by their reflections what seems to
 them weak.
 
 It is only really by enlightened people that this book can be read; the
 ordinary man is not made for such knowledge; philosophy will never be
 his lot. Those who say that there are truths which must be hidden from
 the people, need not be alarmed; the people do not read; they work six
 days of the week, and on the seventh go to the inn. In a word,
 philosophical works are made only for philosophers, and every honest man
 must try to be a philosopher, without pluming himself on being one.
 
 This alphabet is extracted from the most estimable works which are not
 commonly within the reach of the many; and if the author does not always
 mention the sources of his information, as being well enough known to
 the learned, he must not be suspected of wishing to take the credit for
 other people's work, because he himself preserves anonymity, according
 to this word of the Gospel: "Let not thy left hand know what thy right
 hand doeth."

 _ADULTERY_
 
 
 NOTE ON A MAGISTRATE WRITTEN ABOUT 1764
 
 A senior magistrate of a French town had the misfortune to have a wife
 who was debauched by a priest before her marriage, and who since covered
 herself with disgrace by public scandals: he was so moderate as to leave
 her without noise. This man, about forty years old, vigorous and of
 agreeable appearance, needs a woman; he is too scrupulous to seek to
 seduce another man's wife, he fears intercourse with a public woman or
 with a widow who would serve him as concubine. In this disquieting and
 sad state, he addresses to his Church a plea of which the following is a
 precis:
 
 My wife is criminal, and it is I who am punished. Another woman is
 necessary as a comfort to my life, to my virtue even; and the sect of
 which I am a member refuses her to me; it forbids me to marry an honest
 girl. The civil laws of to-day, unfortunately founded on canon law,
 deprive me of the rights of humanity. The Church reduces me to seeking
 either the pleasures it reproves, or the shameful compensations it
 condemns; it tries to force me to be criminal.
 
 I cast my eyes over all the peoples of the earth; there is not a single
 one except the Roman Catholic people among whom divorce and a new
 marriage are not natural rights.
 
 What upheaval of the rule has therefore made among the Catholics a
 virtue of undergoing adultery, and a duty of lacking a wife when one has
 been infamously outraged by one's own?
 
 Why is a bond that has rotted indissoluble in spite of the great law
 adopted by the code, _quidquid ligatur dissolubile est_? I am allowed a
 separation _a mensa et thoro_, and I am not allowed divorce. The law
 can deprive me of my wife, and it leaves me a name called "sacrament"!
 What a contradiction! what slavery! and under what laws did we receive
 birth!
 
 What is still more strange is that this law of my Church is directly
 contrary to the words which this Church itself believes to have been
 uttered by Jesus Christ: "Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it
 be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery" (Matt.
 xix. 9).
 
 I do not examine whether the pontiffs of Rome are in the right to
 violate at their pleasure the law of him they regard as their master;
 whether when a state has need of an heir, it is permissible to repudiate
 her who can give it one. I do not inquire if a turbulent woman,
 demented, homicidal, a poisoner, should not be repudiated equally with
 an adulteress: I limit myself to the sad state which concerns me: God
 permits me to remarry, and the Bishop of Rome does not permit me.
 
 Divorce was a practice among Catholics under all the emperors; it was
 also in all the dismembered states of the Roman Empire. The kings of
 France, those called "of the first line," almost all repudiated their
 wives in order to take new ones. At last came Gregory IX., enemy of the
 emperors and kings, who by a decree made marriage an unshakeable yoke;
 his decretal became the law of Europe. When the kings wanted to
 repudiate a wife who was an adulteress according to Jesus Christ's law,
 they could not succeed; it was necessary to find ridiculous pretexts.
 Louis the younger was obliged, to accomplish his unfortunate divorce
 from Eleanor of Guienne, to allege a relationship which did not exist.
 Henry IV., to repudiate Marguerite de Valois, pretexted a still more
 false cause, a refusal of consent. One had to lie to obtain a divorce
 legitimately.
 
 What! a king can abdicate his crown, and without the Pope's permission
 he cannot abdicate his wife! Is it possible that otherwise enlightened
 men have wallowed so long in this absurd servitude!
 
 That our priests, that our monks renounce wives, to that I consent; it
 is an outrage against population, it is a misfortune for them, but they
 merit this misfortune which they have made for themselves. They have
 been the victims of the popes who wanted to have in them slaves,
 soldiers without families and without fatherland, living solely for the
 Church: but I, magistrate, who serve the state all day, I need a wife in
 the evening; and the Church has not the right to deprive me of a benefit
 which God accords me. The apostles were married, Joseph was married, and
 I want to be. If I, Alsacian, am dependent on a priest who dwells at
 Rome, if this priest has the barbarous power to rob me of a wife, let
 him make a eunuch of me for the singing of _Misereres_ in his chapel.
 
 
 NOTE FOR WOMEN
 
 Equity demands that, having recorded this note in favour of husbands, we
 should also put before the public the case in favour of wives, presented
 to the junta of Portugal by a Countess of Arcira. This is the substance
 of it:
 
 The Gospel has forbidden adultery for my husband just as for me; he will
 be damned as I shall, nothing is better established. When he committed
 twenty infidelities, when he gave my necklace to one of my rivals, and
 my ear-rings to another, I did not ask the judges to have him shaved, to
 shut him up among monks and to give me his property. And I, for having
 imitated him once, for having done with the most handsome young man in
 Lisbon what he did every day with impunity with the most idiotic
 strumpets of the court and the town, have to answer at the bar before
 licentiates each of whom would be at my feet if we were alone together
 in my closet; have to endure at the court the usher cutting off my hair
 which is the most beautiful in the world; and being shut up among nuns
 who have no common sense, deprived of my dowry and my marriage
 covenants, with all my property given to my coxcomb of a husband to help
 him seduce other women and to commit fresh adulteries.
 
 I ask if it is just, and if it is not evident that the laws were made by
 cuckolds?
 
 In answer to my plea I am told that I should be happy not to be stoned
 at the city gate by the canons, the priests of the parish and the whole
 populace. This was the practice among the first nation of the earth, the
 chosen nation, the cherished nation, the only one which was right when
 all the others were wrong.
 
 To these barbarities I reply that when the poor adulteress was presented
 by her accusers to the Master of the old and new law, He did not have
 her stoned; that on the contrary He reproached them with their
 injustice, that he laughed at them by writing on the ground with his
 finger, that he quoted the old Hebraic proverb--"He that is without sin
 among you, let him first cast a stone at her"; that then they all
 retired, the oldest fleeing first, because the older they were the more
 adulteries had they committed.
 
 The doctors of canon law answer me that this history of the adulteress
 is related only in the Gospel of St. John, that it was not inserted
 there until later. Leontius, Maldonat, affirm that it is not to be found
 in a single ancient Greek copy; that none of the twenty-three early
 commentators mentions it. Origen, St. Jerome, St. John Chrysostom,
 Theophilact, Nonnus, do not recognize it at all. It is not to be found
 in the Syriac Bible, it is not in Ulphilas' version.
 
 That is what my husband's advocates say, they who would have me not only
 shaved, but also stoned.
 
 But the advocates who pleaded for me say that Ammonius, author of the
 third century, recognized this story as true, and that if St. Jerome
 rejects it in some places, he adopts it in others; that, in a word, it
 is authentic to-day. I leave there, and I say to my husband: "If you are
 without sin, shave me, imprison me, take my property; but if you have
 committed more sins than I have, it is for me to shave you, to have you
 imprisoned, and to seize your fortune. In justice these things should be
 equal."
 
 My husband answers that he is my superior and my chief, that he is more
 than an inch taller, that he is shaggy as a bear; that consequently I
 owe him everything, and that he owes me nothing.
 
 But I ask if Queen Anne of England is not her husband's chief? if her
 husband the Prince of Denmark, who is her High Admiral, does not owe her
 entire obedience? and if she would not have him condemned by the court
 of peers if the little man's infidelity were in question? It is
 therefore clear that if the women do not have the men punished, it is
 when they are not the stronger.
 
 
 
 
 _ADVOCATE_
 
 
 An advocate is a man who, not having a sufficient fortune to buy one of
 those resplendent offices on which the universe has its eyes, studies
 the laws of Theodosius and Justinian for three years, so that he may
 learn the usages of Paris, and who finally, being registered, has the
 right to plead causes for money, if he have a strong voice.
 
 
 
 
 _ANCIENTS AND MODERNS_
 
 
 The great dispute between the ancients and the moderns is not yet
 settled; it has been on the table since the silver age succeeded the
 golden age. Mankind has always maintained that the good old times were
 much better than the present day. Nestor, in the "Iliad," wishing to
 insinuate himself as a wise conciliator into the minds of Achilles and
 Agamemnon, starts by saying to them--"I lived formerly with better men
 than you; no, I have never seen and I shall never see such great
 personages as Dryas, Cenaeus, Exadius, Polyphemus equal to the gods,
 etc."
 
 Posterity has well avenged Achilles for Nestor's poor compliment. Nobody
 knows Dryas any longer; one has hardly heard speak of Exadius, or of
 Cenaeus; and as for Polyphemus equal to the gods, he has not too good a
 reputation, unless the possession of a big eye in one's forehead, and
 the eating of men raw, are to have something of the divine.
 
 Lucretius does not hesitate to say that nature has degenerated (lib. II.
 v. 1159). Antiquity is full of eulogies of another more remote
 antiquity. Horace combats this prejudice with as much finesse as force
 in his beautiful Epistle to Augustus (Epist. I. liv. ii.). "Must our
 poems, then," he says, "be like our wines, of which the oldest are
 always preferred?"
 
 The learned and ingenious Fontenelle expresses himself on this subject
 as follows:
 
 "The whole question of the pre-eminence between the ancients and the
 moderns, once it is well understood, is reduced to knowing whether the
 trees which formerly were in our countryside were bigger than those of
 to-day. In the event that they were, Homer, Plato, Demosthenes cannot
 be equalled in these latter centuries.
 
 "Let us throw light on this paradox. If the ancients had more intellect
 than us, it is that the brains of those times were better ordered,
 formed of firmer or more delicate fibres, filled with more animal
 spirits; but in virtue of what were the brains of those times better
 ordered? The trees also would have been bigger and more beautiful; for
 if nature was then younger and more vigorous, the trees, as well as
 men's brains, would have been conscious of this vigour and this youth."
 ("Digression on the Ancients and the Moderns," vol. 4, 1742 edition.)
 
 With the illustrious academician's permission, that is not at all the
 state of the question. It is not a matter of knowing whether nature has
 been able to produce in our day as great geniuses and as good works as
 those of Greek and Latin antiquity; but to know whether we have them in
 fact. Without a doubt it is not impossible for there to be as big oaks
 in the forest of Chantilli as in the forest of Dodona; but supposing
 that the oaks of Dodona had spoken, it would be quite clear that they
 had a great advantage over ours, which in all probability will never
 speak.
 
 Nature is not bizarre; but it is possible that she gave the Athenians a
 country and a sky more suitable than Westphalia and the Limousin for
 forming certain geniuses. Further, it is possible that the government of
 Athens, by seconding the climate, put into Demosthenes' head something
 that the air of Climart and La Grenouillere and the government of
 Cardinal de Richelieu did not put into the heads of Omer Talon and
 Jerome Bignon.
 
 This dispute is therefore a question of fact. Was antiquity more fecund
 in great monuments of all kinds, up to the time of Plutarch, than modern
 centuries have been from the century of the Medicis up to Louis XIV.
 inclusive?
 
 The Chinese, more than two hundred years before our era, constructed
 that great wall which was not able to save them from the invasion of the
 Tartars. The Egyptians, three thousand years before, had overloaded the
 earth with their astonishing pyramids, which had a base of about ninety
 thousand square feet. Nobody doubts that, if one wished to undertake
 to-day these useless works, one could easily succeed by a lavish
 expenditure of money. The great wall of China is a monument to fear; the
 pyramids are monuments to vanity and superstition. Both bear witness to
 a great patience in the peoples, but to no superior genius. Neither the
 Chinese nor the Egyptians would have been able to make even a statue
 such as those which our sculptors form to-day.
 
 The chevalier Temple, who has made it his business to disparage all the
 moderns, claims that in architecture they have nothing comparable to the
 temples of Greece and Rome: but, for all that he is English, he must
 agree that the Church of St. Peter is incomparably more beautiful than
 the Capitol was.
 
 It is curious with what assurance he maintains that there is nothing new
 in our astronomy, nothing in the knowledge of the human body, unless
 perhaps, he says, the circulation of the blood. Love of his own opinion,
 founded on his vast self-esteem, makes him forget the discovery of the
 satellites of Jupiter, of the five moons and the ring of Saturn, of the
 rotation of the sun on its axis, of the calculated position of three
 thousand stars, of the laws given by Kepler and Newton for the heavenly
 orbs, of the causes of the precession of the equinoxes, and of a hundred
 other pieces of knowledge of which the ancients did not suspect even the
 possibility.
 
 The discoveries in anatomy are as great in number. A new universe in
 little, discovered by the microscope, was counted for nothing by the
 chevalier Temple; he closed his eyes to the marvels of his
 contemporaries, and opened them only to admire ancient ignorance.
 
 He goes so far as to pity us for having nothing left of the magic of the
 Indians, the Chaldeans, the Egyptians; and by this magic he understands
 a profound knowledge of nature, whereby they produced miracles: but he
 does not cite one miracle, because in fact there never were any. "What
 has become," he asks, "of the charms of that music which so often
 enchanted man and beast, the fishes, the birds, the snakes, and changed
 their nature?"
 
 This enemy of his century really believes the fable of Orpheus, and has
 not apparently heard either the beautiful music of Italy, or even that
 of France, which in truth does not charm snakes, but does charm the ears
 of connoisseurs.
 
 What is still more strange is that, having all his life cultivated
 belles-lettres, he does not reason better about our good authors than
 about our philosophers. He looks on Rabelais as a great man. He cites
 the "Amours des Gaules" as one of our best works. He was, however, a
 scholar, a courtier, a man of much wit, an ambassador, a man who had
 reflected profoundly on all he had seen. He possessed great knowledge: a
 prejudice sufficed to spoil all this merit.
 
 There are beauties in Euripides, and in Sophocles still more; but they
 have many more defects. One dares say that the beautiful scenes of
 Corneille and the touching tragedies of Racine surpass the tragedies of
 Sophocles and Euripides as much as these two Greeks surpass Thespis.
 Racine was quite conscious of his great superiority over Euripides; but
 he praised the Greek poet in order to humiliate Perrault.
 
 Moliere, in his good pieces, is as superior to the pure but cold
 Terence, and to the droll Aristophanes, as to Dancourt the buffoon.
 
 There are therefore spheres in which the moderns are far superior to the
 ancients, and others, very few in number, in which we are their
 inferiors. It is to this that the whole dispute is reduced.
 
 
 
 
 _ANIMALS_
 
 
 What a pitiful, what a sorry thing to have said that animals are
 machines bereft of understanding and feeling, which perform their
 operations always in the same way, which learn nothing, perfect nothing,
 etc.!
 
 What! that bird which makes its nest in a semi-circle when it is
 attaching it to a wall, which builds it in a quarter circle when it is
 in an angle, and in a circle upon a tree; that bird acts always in the
 same way? That hunting-dog which you have disciplined for three months,
 does it not know more at the end of this time than it knew before your
 lessons? Does the canary to which you teach a tune repeat it at once? do
 you not spend a considerable time in teaching it? have you not seen that
 it has made a mistake and that it corrects itself?
 
 Is it because I speak to you, that you judge that I have feeling,
 memory, ideas? Well, I do not speak to you; you see me going home
 looking disconsolate, seeking a paper anxiously, opening the desk where
 I remember having shut it, finding it, reading it joyfully. You judge
 that I have experienced the feeling of distress and that of pleasure,
 that I have memory and understanding.
 
 Bring the same judgment to bear on this dog which has lost its master,
 which has sought him on every road with sorrowful cries, which enters
 the house agitated, uneasy, which goes down the stairs, up the stairs,
 from room to room, which at last finds in his study the master it loves,
 and which shows him its joy by its cries of delight, by its leaps, by
 its caresses.
 
 Barbarians seize this dog, which in friendship surpasses man so
 prodigiously; they nail it on a table, and they dissect it alive in
 order to show the mesenteric veins. You discover in it all the same
 organs of feeling that are in yourself. Answer me, machinist, has nature
 arranged all the means of feeling in this animal, so that it may not
 feel? has it nerves in order to be impassible? Do not suppose this
 impertinent contradiction in nature.
 
 But the schoolmasters ask what the soul of animals is? I do not
 understand this question. A tree has the faculty of receiving in its
 fibres its sap which circulates, of unfolding the buds of its leaves and
 its fruit; will you ask what the soul of this tree is? it has received
 these gifts; the animal has received those of feeling, of memory, of a
 certain number of ideas. Who has bestowed these gifts? who has given
 these faculties? He who has made the grass of the fields to grow, and
 who makes the earth gravitate toward the sun.
 
 "Animals' souls are substantial forms," said Aristotle, and after
 Aristotle, the Arab school, and after the Arab school, the angelical
 school, and after the angelical school, the Sorbonne, and after the
 Sorbonne, nobody at all.
 
 "Animals' souls are material," cry other philosophers. These have not
 been in any better fortune than the others. In vain have they been asked
 what a material soul is; they have to admit that it is matter which has
 sensation: but what has given it this sensation? It is a material soul,
 that is to say that it is matter which gives sensation to matter; they
 cannot issue from this circle.
 
 Listen to other brutes reasoning about the brutes; their soul is a
 spiritual soul which dies with the body; but what proof have you of it?
 what idea have you of this spiritual soul, which, in truth, has feeling,
 memory, and its measure of ideas and ingenuity; but which will never be
 able to know what a child of six knows? On what ground do you imagine
 that this being, which is not body, dies with the body? The greatest
 fools are those who have advanced that this soul is neither body nor
 spirit. There is a fine system. By spirit we can understand only some
 unknown thing which is not body. Thus these gentlemen's system comes
 back to this, that the animals' soul is a substance which is neither
 body nor something which is not body.
 
 Whence can come so many contradictory errors? From the habit men have
 always had of examining what a thing is, before knowing if it exists.
 The clapper, the valve of a bellows, is called in French the "soul" of a
 bellows. What is this soul? It is a name that I have given to this valve
 which falls, lets air enter, rises again, and thrusts it through a pipe,
 when I make the bellows move.
 
 There is not there a distinct soul in the machine: but what makes
 animals' bellows move? I have already told you, what makes the stars
 move. The philosopher who said, "_Deus est anima brutorum_," was right;
 but he should go further.
 
 
 
 
 _ANTIQUITY_
 
 
 Have you sometimes seen in a village Pierre Aoudri and his wife
 Peronelle wishing to go before their neighbours in the procession? "Our
 grandfathers," they say, "were tolling the bells before those who jostle
 us to-day owned even a pig-sty."
 
 The vanity of Pierre Aoudri, his wife and his neighbours, knows nothing
 more about it. Their minds kindle. The quarrel is important; honour is
 in question. Proofs are necessary. A scholar who sings in the choir,
 discovers an old rusty iron pot, marked with an "A," first letter of the
 name of the potter who made the pot. Pierre Aoudri persuades himself
 that it was his ancestors' helmet. In this way was Caesar descended from
 a hero and from the goddess Venus. Such is the history of nations; such
 is, within very small margins, the knowledge of early antiquity.
 
 The scholars of Armenia _demonstrate_ that the terrestrial paradise was
 in their land. Some profound Swedes _demonstrate_ that it was near Lake
 Vener which is visibly a remnant of it. Some Spaniards _demonstrate_
 also that it was in Castille; while the Japanese, the Chinese, the
 Indians, the Africans, the Americans are not sufficiently unfortunate to
 know even that there was formerly a terrestrial paradise at the source
 of the Phison, the Gehon, the Tigris and the Euphrates, or, if you
 prefer it, at the source of the Guadalquivir, the Guadiana, the Douro
 and the Ebro; for from Phison one easily makes Phaetis; and from Phaetis
 one makes the Baetis which is the Guadalquivir. The Gehon is obviously
 the Guadiana, which begins with a "G." The Ebro, which is in Catalonia,
 is incontestably the Euphrates, of which the initial letter is "E."
 
 But a Scotsman appears who _demonstrates_ in his turn that the garden of
 Eden was at Edinburgh, which has retained its name; and it is to be
 believed that in a few centuries this opinion will make its fortune.
 
 The whole globe was burned once upon a time, says a man versed in
 ancient and modern history; for I read in a newspaper that some
 absolutely black charcoal has been found in Germany at a depth of a
 hundred feet, between mountains covered with wood. And it is suspected
 even that there were charcoal burners in this place.
 
 Phaeton's adventure makes it clear that everything has boiled right to
 the bottom of the sea. The sulphur of Mount Vesuvius proves invincibly
 that the banks of the Rhine, Danube, Ganges, Nile and the great Yellow
 River are merely sulphur, nitre and Guiac oil, which only await the
 moment of the explosion to reduce the earth to ashes, as it has already
 been. The sand on which we walk is evident proof that the earth has been
 vitrified, and that our globe is really only a glass ball, just as are
 our ideas.
 
 But if fire has changed our globe, water has produced still finer
 revolutions. For you see clearly that the sea, the tides of which mount
 as high as eight feet in our climate, has produced mountains of a height
 of sixteen to seventeen thousand feet. This is so true that some learned
 men who have never been in Switzerland have found a big ship with all
 its rigging petrified on Mount St. Gothard, or at the bottom of a
 precipice, one knows not where; but it is quite certain that it was
 there. Therefore men were originally fish, _quod erat demonstrandum_.
 
 To descend to a less antique antiquity, let us speak of the times when
 the greater part of the barbarous nations left their countries, to go to
 seek others which were hardly any better. It is true, if there be
 anything true in ancient history, that there were some Gaulish brigands
 who went to pillage Rome in the time of Camillus. Other Gaulish brigands
 had passed, it is said, through Illyria on the way to hire their
 services as murderers to other murderers, in the direction of Thrace;
 they exchanged their blood for bread, and later established themselves
 in Galatia. But who were these Gauls? were they Berichons and Angevins?
 They were without a doubt Gauls whom the Romans called Cisalpines, and
 whom we call Transalpines, famished mountain-dwellers, neighbours of the
 Alps and the Apennines. The Gauls of the Seine and the Marne did not
 know at that time that Rome existed, and could not take it into their
 heads to pass Mount Cenis, as Hannibal did later, to go to steal the
 wardrobes of Roman senators who at that time for all furniture had a
 robe of poor grey stuff, ornamented with a band the colour of ox blood;
 two little pummels of ivory, or rather dog's bone, on the arms of a
 wooden chair; and in their kitchens a piece of rancid bacon.
 
 The Gauls, who were dying of hunger, not finding anything to eat in
 Rome, went off therefore to seek their fortune farther away, as was the
 practice of the Romans later, when they ravaged so many countries one
 after the other; as did the peoples of the North when they destroyed the
 Roman Empire.
 
 And, further, what is it which instructs very feebly about these
 emigrations? It is a few lines that the Romans wrote at hazard; because
 for the Celts, the Velches or the Gauls, these men who it is desired to
 make pass for eloquent, at that time did not know, they and their bards,
 how either to read or write.
 
 But to infer from that that the Gauls or Celts, conquered after by a few
 of Caesar's legions, and by a horde of Bourguignons, and lastly by a
 horde of Sicamores, under one Clodovic, had previously subjugated the
 whole world, and given their names and laws to Asia, seems to me to be
 very strange: the thing is not mathematically impossible, and if it be
 _demonstrated_, I give way; it would be very uncivil to refuse to the
 Velches what one accords to the Tartars.
 
 
 
 
 _ARTS_
 
 THAT THE NEWNESS OF THE ARTS IN NO WISE PROVES THE NEWNESS OF THE GLOBE
 
 
 All the philosophers thought matter eternal but the arts appear new.
 There is not one, even to the art of making bread, which is not recent.
 The first Romans ate pap; and these conquerors of so many nations never
 thought of either windmills or watermills. This truth seems at first to
 contradict the antiquity of the globe such as it is, or supposes
 terrible revolutions in this globe. The inundations of barbarians can
 hardly annihilate arts which have become necessary. I suppose that an
 army of negroes come among us like locusts, from the mountains of
 Cobonas, through the Monomotapa, the Monoemugi, the Nosseguais, the
 Maracates; that they have traversed Abyssinia, Nubia, Egypt, Syria, Asia
 Minor, the whole of our Europe; that they have overthrown everything,
 ransacked everything; there will still remain a few bakers, a few
 cobblers, a few tailors, a few carpenters: the necessary arts will
 survive; only luxury will be annihilated. It is what was seen at the
 fall of the Roman Empire; the art of writing even became very rare;
 almost all those which contributed to the comfort of life were reborn
 only long after. We invent new ones every day.
 
 From all this one can at bottom conclude nothing against the antiquity
 of the globe. For, supposing even that an influx of barbarians had made
 us lose entirely all the arts even to the arts of writing and making
 bread; supposing, further, that for ten years past we had no bread,
 pens, ink and paper; the land which has been able to subsist for ten
 years without eating bread and without writing its thoughts, would be
 able to pass a century, and a hundred thousand centuries without these
 aids.
 
 It is quite clear that man and the other animals can exist very well
 without bakers, without novelists, and without theologians, witness the
 whole of America, witness three quarters of our continent.
 
 The newness of the arts among us does not therefore prove the newness of
 the globe, as was claimed by Epicurus, one of our predecessors in
 reverie, who supposed that by chance the eternal atoms in declining, had
 one day formed our earth. Pomponace said: "_Se il mondo non e eterno,
 per tutti santi e molto vecchio._"
 
 
 
 
 _ASTROLOGY_
 
 
 Astrology may rest on better foundations than Magic. For if no one has
 seen either Goblins, or Lemures, or Dives, or Peris, or Demons, or
 Cacodemons, the predictions of astrologers have often been seen to
 succeed. If of two astrologers consulted on the life of a child and on
 the weather, one says that the child will live to manhood, the other
 not; if one announces rain, and the other fine weather, it is clear that
 one of them will be a prophet.
 
 The great misfortune of the astrologers is that the sky has changed
 since the rules of the art were established. The sun, which at the
 equinox was in Aries in the time of the Argonauts, is to-day in Taurus;
 and the astrologers, to the great ill-fortune of their art, to-day
 attribute to one house of the sun what belongs visibly to another.
 However, that is not a demonstrative reason against astrology. The
 masters of the art deceive themselves; but it is not demonstrated that
 the art cannot exist.
 
 There is no absurdity in saying: Such and such a child is born in the
 waxing of the moon, during stormy weather, at the rising of such and
 such star; his constitution has been feeble, and his life unhappy and
 short; which is the ordinary lot of poor constitutions: this child, on
 the contrary, was born when the moon was full, the sun strong, the
 weather calm, at the rising of such and such star; his constitution has
 been good, his life long and happy. If these observations had been
 repeated, if they had been found accurate, experience would have been
 able after some thousands of years to form an art which it would have
 been difficult to doubt: one would have thought, with some likelihood,
 that men are like trees and vegetables which must be planted and sown
 only in certain seasons. It would have been of no avail against the
 astrologers to say: My son was born at a fortunate time, and
 nevertheless died in his cradle; the astrologer would have answered: It
 often happens that trees planted in the proper season perish; I answered
 to you for the stars, but I did not answer for the flaw of conformation
 you communicated to your child. Astrology operates only when no cause
 opposes itself to the good the stars can do.
 
 One would not have succeeded better in discrediting the astrologer by
 saying: Of two children who were born in the same minute, one has been
 king, the other has been only churchwarden of his parish; for the
 astrologer could very well have defended himself by pointing out that
 the peasant made his fortune when he became churchwarden, as the prince
 when he became king.
 
 And if one alleged that a bandit whom Sixtus V. had hanged was born at
 the same time as Sixtus V., who from a pig-herd became Pope, the
 astrologers would say one had made a mistake of a few seconds, and that
 it is impossible, according to the rules, for the same star to give the
 triple crown and the gibbet. It is then only because a host of
 experiences belied the predictions, that men perceived at last that the
 art was illusory; but before being undeceived, they were long credulous.
 
 One of the most famous mathematicians in Europe, named Stoffler, who
 flourished in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and who long worked
 at the reform of the calendar, proposed at the Council of Constance,
 foretold a universal flood for the year 1524. This flood was to arrive
 in the month of February, and nothing is more plausible; for Saturn,
 Jupiter and Mars were then in conjunction in the sign of Pisces. All the
 peoples of Europe, Asia and Africa, who heard speak of the prediction,
 were dismayed. Everyone expected the flood, despite the rainbow. Several
 contemporary authors record that the inhabitants of the maritime
 provinces of Germany hastened to sell their lands dirt cheap to those
 who had most money, and who were not so credulous as they. Everyone
 armed himself with a boat as with an ark. A Toulouse doctor, named
 Auriol, had a great ark made for himself, his family and his friends;
 the same precautions were taken over a large part of Italy. At last the
 month of February arrived, and not a drop of water fell: never was month
 more dry, and never were the astrologers more embarrassed. Nevertheless
 they were not discouraged, nor neglected among us; almost all princes
 continued to consult them.
 
 I have not the honour of being a prince; but the celebrated Count of
 Boulainvilliers and an Italian, named Colonne, who had much prestige in
 Paris, both foretold that I should die infallibly at the age of
 thirty-two. I have been so malicious as to deceive them already by
 nearly thirty years, wherefore I humbly beg their pardon.
 
 
 
 
 _ATHEISM_
 
 
 SECTION I
 
 OF THE COMPARISON SO OFTEN MADE BETWEEN ATHEISM AND IDOLATRY
 
 It seems to me that in the "Encyclopedic Dictionary" the opinion of the
 Jesuit Richeome, on atheists and idolaters, has not been refuted as
 strongly as it might have been; opinion held formerly by St. Thomas, St.
 Gregory of Nazianze, St. Cyprian and Tertullian, opinion that Arnobius
 set forth with much force when he said to the pagans: "Do you not blush
 to reproach us with despising your gods, and is it not much more proper
 to believe in no God at all, than to impute to them infamous
 actions?"[1] opinion established long before by Plutarch, who says "that
 he much prefers people to say there is no Plutarch, than to say--'There
 is an inconstant, choleric, vindictive Plutarch'";[2] opinion
 strengthened finally by all the effort of Bayle's dialectic.
 
 Here is the ground of dispute, brought to fairly dazzling light by the
 Jesuit Richeome, and rendered still more plausible by the way Bayle has
 turned it to account.[3]
 
 "There are two porters at the door of a house; they are asked: 'Can one
 speak to your master?' 'He is not there,' answers one. 'He is there,'
 answers the other, 'but he is busy making counterfeit money, forged
 contracts, daggers and poisons, to undo those who have but accomplished
 his purposes.' The atheist resembles the first of these porters, the
 pagan the other. It is clear, therefore, that the pagan offends the
 Deity more gravely than does the atheist."
 
 With Father Richeome's and even Bayle's permission, that is not at all
 the position of the matter. For the first porter to resemble the
 atheists, he must not say--"My master is not here": he should say--"I
 have no master; him whom you claim to be my master does not exist; my
 comrade is a fool to tell you that he is busy compounding poisons and
 sharpening daggers to assassinate those who have executed his caprices.
 No such being exists in the world."
 
 Richeome has reasoned, therefore, very badly. And Bayle, in his somewhat
 diffuse discourses, has forgotten himself so far as to do Richeome the
 honour of annotating him very malapropos.
 
 Plutarch seems to express himself much better in preferring people who
 affirm there is no Plutarch, to those who claim Plutarch to be an
 unsociable man. In truth, what does it matter to him that people say he
 is not in the world? But it matters much to him that his reputation be
 not tarnished. It is not thus with the Supreme Being.
 
 Plutarch even does not broach the real object under discussion. It is
 not a question of knowing who offends more the Supreme Being, whether it
 be he who denies Him, or he who distorts Him. It is impossible to know
 otherwise than by revelation, if God is offended by the empty things men
 say of Him.
 
 Without a thought, philosophers fall almost always into the ideas of the
 common herd, in supposing God to be jealous of His glory, to be
 choleric, to love vengeance, and in taking rhetorical figures for real
 ideas. The interesting subject for the whole universe, is to know if it
 be not better, for the good of all mankind, to admit a rewarding and
 revengeful God, who recompenses good actions hidden, and who punishes
 secret crimes, than to admit none at all.
 
 Bayle exhausts himself in recounting all the infamies imputed by fable
 to the gods of antiquity. His adversaries answer him with commonplaces
 that signify nothing. The partisans of Bayle and his enemies have
 almost always fought without making contact. They all agree that Jupiter
 was an adulterer, Venus a wanton, Mercury a rogue. But, as I see it,
 that is not what needs consideration. One must distinguish between
 Ovid's Metamorphoses and the religion of the ancient Romans. It is quite
 certain that never among the Romans or even among the Greeks, was there
 a temple dedicated to Mercury the rogue, Venus the wanton, Jupiter the
 adulterer.
 
 The god whom the Romans called _Deus optimus_, very good, very great,
 was not reputed to encourage Clodius to sleep with Caesar's wife, or
 Caesar to be King Nicomedes' Sodomite.
 
 Cicero does not say that Mercury incited Verres to steal Sicily,
 although Mercury, in the fable, had stolen Apollo's cows. The real
 religion of the ancients was that Jupiter, _very good and very just_,
 and the secondary gods, punished the perjurer in the infernal regions.
 Likewise the Romans were long the most religious observers of oaths.
 Religion was very useful, therefore, to the Romans. There was no command
 to believe in Leda's two eggs, in the changing of Inachus' daughter into
 a cow, in the love of Apollo for Hyacinthus.
 
 One must not say therefore that the religion of Numa dishonoured the
 Deity. For a long time, therefore, people have been disputing over a
 chimera; which happens only too often.
 
 The question is then asked whether a nation of atheists can exist; it
 seems to me that one must distinguish between the nation properly so
 called, and a society of philosophers above the nation. It is very true
 that in every country the populace has need of the greatest curb, and
 that if Bayle had had only five or six hundred peasants to govern, he
 would not have failed to announce to them the existence of a God,
 rewarder and revenger. But Bayle would not have spoken of Him to the
 Epicureans who were rich people, fond of rest, cultivating all the
 social virtues, and above all friendship, fleeing the embarrassment and
 danger of public affairs, in fine, leading a comfortable and innocent
 life. It seems to me that in this way the dispute is finished as regards
 society and politics.
 
 For entirely savage races, it has been said already that one cannot
 count them among either the atheists or the theists. Asking them their
 belief would be like asking them if they are for Aristotle or
 Democritus: they know nothing; they are not atheists any more than they
 are Peripatetics.
 
 In this case, I shall answer that the wolves live like this, and that an
 assembly of cannibal barbarians such as you suppose them is not a
 society; and I shall always ask you if, when you have lent your money to
 someone in your society, you want neither your debtor, nor your
 attorney, nor your judge, to believe in God.
 
 
 OF MODERN ATHEISTS. REASONS OF THE WORSHIPPERS OF GOD
 
 We are intelligent beings: intelligent beings cannot have been formed by
 a crude, blind, insensible being: there is certainly some difference
 between the ideas of Newton and the dung of a mule. Newton's
 intelligence, therefore, came from another intelligence.
 
 When we see a beautiful machine, we say that there is a good engineer,
 and that this engineer has excellent judgment. The world is assuredly an
 admirable machine; therefore there is in the world an admirable
 intelligence, wherever it may be. This argument is old, and none the
 worse for that.
 
 All living bodies are composed of levers, of pulleys, which function
 according to the laws of mechanics; of liquids which the laws of
 hydrostatics cause to circulate perpetually; and when one thinks that
 all these beings have a perception quite unrelated to their
 organization, one is overwhelmed with surprise.
 
 The movement of the heavenly bodies, that of our little earth round the
 sun, all operate by virtue of the most profound mathematical law. How
 Plato who was not aware of one of these laws, eloquent but visionary
 Plato, who said that the earth was erected on an equilateral triangle,
 and the water on a right-angled triangle; strange Plato, who says there
 can be only five worlds, because there are only five regular bodies:
 how, I say, did Plato, who did not know even spherical trigonometry,
 have nevertheless a genius sufficiently fine, an instinct sufficiently
 happy, to call God the "Eternal Geometer," to feel the existence of a
 creative intelligence? Spinoza himself admits it. It is impossible to
 strive against this truth which surrounds us and which presses on us
 from all sides.
 
 
 REASONS OF THE ATHEISTS
 
 Notwithstanding, I have known refractory persons who say that there is
 no creative intelligence at all, and that movement alone has by itself
 formed all that we see and all that we are. They tell you brazenly:
 
 "The combination of this universe was possible, seeing that the
 combination exists: therefore it was possible that movement alone
 arranged it. Take four of the heavenly bodies only, Mars, Venus, Mercury
 and the Earth: let us think first only of the place where they are,
 setting aside all the rest, and let us see how many probabilities we
 have that movement alone put them in their respective places. We have
 only twenty-four chances in this combination, that is, there are only
 twenty-four chances against one to bet that these bodies will not be
 where they are with reference to each other. Let us add to these four
 globes that of Jupiter; there will be only a hundred and twenty against
 one to bet that Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury and our globe, will not be
 placed where we see them.
 
 "Add finally Saturn: there will be only seven hundred and twenty chances
 against one, for putting these six big planets in the arrangement they
 preserve among themselves, according to their given distances. It is
 therefore demonstrated that in seven hundred and twenty throws,
 movement alone has been able to put these six principal planets in their
 order.
 
 "Take then all the secondary bodies, all their combinations, all their
 movements, all the beings that vegetate, that live, that feel, that
 think, that function in all the globes, you will have but to increase
 the number of chances; multiply this number in all eternity, up to the
 number which our feebleness calls 'infinity,' there will always be a
 unity in favour of the formation of the world, such as it is, by
 movement alone: therefore it is possible that in all eternity the
 movement of matter alone has produced the entire universe such as it
 exists. It is even inevitable that in eternity this combination should
 occur. Thus," they say, "not only is it possible for the world to be
 what it is by movement alone, but it was impossible for it not to be
 likewise after an infinity of combinations."
 
 ANSWER
 
 All this supposition seems to me prodigiously fantastic, for two
 reasons; first, that in this universe there are intelligent beings, and
 that you would not know how to prove it possible for movement alone to
 produce understanding; second, that, from your own avowal, there is
 infinity against one to bet, that an intelligent creative cause animates
 the universe. When one is alone face to face with the infinite, one
 feels very small.
 
 Again, Spinoza himself admits this intelligence; it is the basis of his
 system. You have not read it, and it must be read. Why do you want to go
 further than him, and in foolish arrogance plunge your feeble reason in
 an abyss into which Spinoza dared not descend? Do you realize thoroughly
 the extreme folly of saying that it is a blind cause that arranges that
 the square of a planet's revolution is always to the square of the
 revolutions of other planets, as the cube of its distance is to the cube
 of the distances of the others to the common centre? Either the
 heavenly bodies are great geometers, or the Eternal Geometer has
 arranged the heavenly bodies.
 
 But where is the Eternal Geometer? is He in one place or in all places,
 without occupying space? I have no idea. Is it of His own substance that
 He has arranged all things? I have no idea. Is He immense without
 quantity and without quality? I have no idea. All that I know is that
 one must worship Him and be just.
 
 
 NEW OBJECTION OF A MODERN ATHEIST[4]
 
 Can one say that the parts of animals conform to their needs: what are
 these needs? preservation and propagation. Is it astonishing then that,
 of the infinite combinations which chance has produced, there has been
 able to subsist only those that have organs adapted to the nourishment
 and continuation of their species? have not all the others perished of
 necessity?
 
 ANSWER
 
 This objection, oft-repeated since Lucretius, is sufficiently refuted by
 the gift of sensation in animals, and by the gift of intelligence in
 man. How should combinations "which chance has produced," produce this
 sensation and this intelligence (as has just been said in the preceding
 paragraph)? Without any doubt the limbs of animals are made for their
 needs with incomprehensible art, and you are not so bold as to deny it.
 You say no more about it. You feel that you have nothing to answer to
 this great argument which nature brings against you. The disposition of
 a fly's wing, a snail's organs suffices to bring you to the ground.
 
 
 MAUPERTUIS' OBJECTION
 
 Modern natural philosophers have but expanded these so-called arguments,
 often they have pushed them to trifling and indecency. They have found
 God in the folds of the skin of the rhinoceros: one could, with equal
 reason, deny His existence because of the tortoise's shell.
 
 ANSWER
 
 What reasoning! The tortoise and the rhinoceros, and all the different
 species, are proof equally in their infinite variety of the same cause,
 the same design, the same aim, which are preservation, generation and
 death.
 
 There is unity in this infinite variety; the shell and the skin bear
 witness equally. What! deny God because shell does not resemble leather!
 And journalists have been prodigal of eulogies about these ineptitudes,
 eulogies they have not given to Newton and Locke, both worshippers of
 the Deity who spoke with full knowledge.
 
 
 MAUPERTUIS' OBJECTION
 
 Of what use are beauty and proportion in the construction of the snake?
 They may have uses, some say, of which we are ignorant. At least let us
 be silent then; let us not admire an animal which we know only by the
 harm it does.
 
 ANSWER
 
 And be you silent too, seeing that you cannot conceive its utility any
 more than I can; or avow that in reptiles everything is admirably
 proportioned.
 
 Some are venomous, you have been so yourself. Here there is question
 only of the prodigious art which has formed snakes, quadrupeds, birds,
 fish and bipeds. This art is sufficiently evident. You ask why the snake
 does harm? And you, why have you done harm so many times? Why have you
 been a persecutor? which is the greatest of all crimes for a
 philosopher. That is another question, a question of moral and physical
 ill. For long has one asked why there are so many snakes and so many
 wicked men worse than snakes. If flies could reason, they would complain
 to God of the existence of spiders; but they would admit what Minerva
 admitted about Arachne, in the fable, that she arranges her web
 marvellously.
 
 One is bound therefore to recognize an ineffable intelligence which even
 Spinoza admitted. One must agree that this intelligence shines in the
 vilest insect as in the stars. And as regards moral and physical ill,
 what can one say, what do? console oneself by enjoying physical and
 moral good, in worshipping the Eternal Being who has made one and
 permitted the other.
 
 One more word on this subject. Atheism is the vice of a few intelligent
 persons, and superstition is the vice of fools. But rogues! what are
 they? rogues.
 
 
 SECTION II
 
 Let us say a word on the moral question set in action by Bayle, to know
 "if a society of atheists could exist?" Let us mark first of all in this
 matter what is the enormous contradiction of men in this dispute; those
 who have risen against Bayle's opinion with the greatest ardour; those
 who have denied with the greatest insults the possibility of a society
 of atheists, have since maintained with the same intrepidity that
 atheism is the religion of the government of China.
 
 Assuredly they are quite mistaken about the Chinese government; they had
 but to read the edicts of the emperors of this vast country to have
 seen that these edicts are sermons, and that everywhere there is mention
 of the Supreme Being, ruler, revenger, rewarder.
 
 But at the same time they are not less mistaken on the impossibility of
 a society of atheists; and I do not know how Mr. Bayle can have
 forgotten one striking example which was capable of making his cause
 victorious.
 
 In what does a society of atheists appear impossible? It is that one
 judges that men who had no check could never live together; that laws
 can do nothing against secret crimes; that a revengeful God who punishes
 in this world or the other the wicked who have escaped human justice is
 necessary.
 
 The laws of Moses, it is true, did not teach a life to come, did not
 threaten punishments after death, did not teach the first Jews the
 immortality of the soul; but the Jews, far from being atheists, far from
 believing in avoiding divine vengeance, were the most religious of all
 men. Not only did they believe in the existence of an eternal God, but
 they believed Him always present among them; they trembled lest they be
 punished in themselves, in their wives, in their children, in their
 posterity, even unto the fourth generation; this curb was very potent.
 
 But, among the Gentiles, many sects had no curb; the sceptics doubted
 everything: the academicians suspended judgment on everything; the
 Epicureans were persuaded that the Deity could not mix Himself in the
 affairs of men; and at bottom, they admitted no Deity. They were
 convinced that the soul is not a substance, but a faculty which is born
 and which perishes with the body; consequently they had no yoke other
 than morality and honour. The Roman senators and knights were veritable
 atheists, for the gods did not exist for men who neither feared nor
 hoped anything from them. The Roman senate in the time of Caesar and
 Cicero, was therefore really an assembly of atheists.
 
 That great orator, in his harangue for Cluentius, says to the whole
 senate in assembly: "What ill does death do him? we reject all the inept
 fables of the nether regions: of what then has death deprived him? of
 nothing but the consciousness of suffering."
 
 Does not Caesar, the friend of Cataline, wishing to save his friend's
 life against this same Cicero, object to him that to make a criminal die
 is not to punish him at all, that death _is nothing_, that it is merely
 the end of our ills, that it is a moment more happy than calamitous? And
 do not Cicero and the whole senate surrender to these reasons? The
 conquerors and the legislators of the known universe formed visibly
 therefore a society of men who feared nothing from the gods, who were
 real atheists.
 
 Further on Bayle examines whether idolatry is more dangerous than
 atheism, if it is a greater crime not to believe in the Deity than to
 have unworthy opinions thereof: in that he is of Plutarch's opinion; he
 believes it is better to have no opinion than to have a bad opinion; but
 with all deference to Plutarch, it was clearly infinitely better for the
 Greeks to fear Ceres, Neptune and Jupiter, than to fear nothing at all.
 The sanctity of oaths is clearly necessary, and one should have more
 confidence in those who believe that a false oath will be punished, than
 in those who think they can make a false oath with impunity. It is
 indubitable that in a civilized town, it is infinitely more useful to
 have a religion, even a bad one, than to have none at all.
 
 It looks, therefore, that Bayle should have examined rather which is the
 more dangerous, fanaticism or atheism. Fanaticism is certainly a
 thousand times more deadly; for atheism inspires no bloody passion,
 whereas fanaticism does: atheism is not opposed to crime, but fanaticism
 causes crimes to be committed. Fanatics committed the massacres of St.
 Bartholomew. Hobbes passed for an atheist; he led a tranquil and
 innocent life. The fanatics of his time deluged England, Scotland and
 Ireland with blood. Spinoza was not only atheist, but he taught atheism;
 it was not he assuredly who took part in the judicial assassination of
 Barneveldt; it was not he who tore the brothers De Witt in pieces, and
 who ate them grilled.
 
 The atheists are for the most part impudent and misguided scholars who
 reason badly, and who not being able to understand the creation, the
 origin of evil, and other difficulties, have recourse to the hypothesis
 of the eternity of things and of inevitability.
 
 The ambitious, the sensual, have hardly time for reasoning, and for
 embracing a bad system; they have other things to do than comparing
 Lucretius with Socrates. That is how things go among us.
 
 That was not how things went with the Roman senate which was almost
 entirely composed of atheists in theory and in practice, that is to say,
 who believed in neither a Providence nor a future life; this senate was
 an assembly of philosophers, of sensualists and ambitious men, all very
 dangerous, who ruined the republic. Epicureanism existed under the
 emperors: the atheists of the senate had been rebels in the time of
 Sylla and Caesar: under Augustus and Tiberius they were atheist slaves.
 
 I would not wish to have to deal with an atheist prince, who would find
 it to his interest to have me ground to powder in a mortar: I should be
 quite sure of being ground to powder. If I were a sovereign, I would not
 wish to have to deal with atheist courtiers, whose interest it would be
 to poison me: I should have to be taking antidotes every day. It is
 therefore absolutely necessary for princes and for peoples, that the
 idea of a Supreme Being, creator, ruler, rewarder, revenger, shall be
 deeply engraved in people's minds.
 
 Bayle says, in his "Thoughts on the Comets," that there are atheist
 peoples. The Caffres, the Hottentots, the Topinambous, and many other
 small nations, have no God: they neither deny nor affirm; they have
 never heard speak of Him; tell them that there is a God: they will
 believe it easily; tell them that everything happens through the nature
 of things; they will believe you equally. To claim that they are
 atheists is to make the same imputation as if one said they are
 anti-Cartesian; they are neither for nor against Descartes. They are
 real children; a child is neither atheist nor deist, he is nothing.
 
 What conclusion shall we draw from all this? That atheism is a very
 pernicious monster in those who govern; that it is also pernicious in
 the persons around statesmen, although their lives may be innocent,
 because from their cabinets it may pierce right to the statesmen
 themselves; that if it is not so deadly as fanaticism, it is nearly
 always fatal to virtue. Let us add especially that there are less
 atheists to-day than ever, since philosophers have recognized that there
 is no being vegetating without germ, no germ without a plan, etc., and
 that wheat comes in no wise from putrefaction.
 
 Some geometers who are not philosophers have rejected final causes, but
 real philosophers admit them; a catechist proclaims God to the children,
 and Newton demonstrates Him to the learned.
 
 If there are atheists, whom must one blame, if not the mercenary tyrants
 of souls, who, making us revolt against their knaveries, force a few
 weak minds to deny the God whom these monsters dishonour. How many times
 have the people's leeches brought oppressed citizens to the point of
 revolting against their king!
 
 Men fattened on our substance cry to us: "Be persuaded that a she-ass
 has spoken; believe that a fish has swallowed a man and has given him up
 at the end of three days safe and sound on the shore; have no doubt that
 the God of the universe ordered one Jewish prophet to eat excrement
 (Ezekiel), and another prophet to buy two whores and to make with them
 sons of whoredom (Hosea). These are the very words that the God of truth
 and purity has been made to utter; believe a hundred things either
 visibly abominable or mathematically impossible; unless you do, the God
 of pity will burn you, not only during millions of thousands of millions
 of centuries in the fire of hell, but through all eternity, whether you
 have a body, whether you have not."
 
 These inconceivable absurdities revolt weak and rash minds, as well as
 wise and resolute minds. They say: "Our masters paint God to us as the
 most insensate and the most barbarous of all beings; therefore there is
 no God;" but they should say: therefore our masters attribute to God
 their absurdities and their furies, therefore God is the contrary of
 what they proclaim, therefore God is as wise and as good as they make
 him out mad and wicked. It is thus that wise men account for things. But
 if a bigot hears them, he denounces them to a magistrate who is a
 watchdog of the priests; and this watchdog has them burned over a slow
 fire, in the belief that he is avenging and imitating the divine majesty
 he outrages.

 _AUTHORITY_
 
 
 Wretched human beings, whether you wear green robes, turbans, black
 robes or surplices, cloaks and neckbands, never seek to use authority
 where there is question only of reason, or consent to be scoffed at
 throughout the centuries as the most impertinent of all men, and to
 suffer public hatred as the most unjust.
 
 A hundred times has one spoken to you of the insolent absurdity with
 which you condemned Galileo, and I speak to you for the hundred and
 first, and I hope you will keep the anniversary of it for ever; I desire
 that there be graved on the door of your Holy Office:
 
 "Here seven cardinals, assisted by minor brethren, had the master of
 thought in Italy thrown into prison at the age of seventy; made him fast
 on bread and water because he instructed the human race, and because
 they were ignorant."
 
 There was pronounced a sentence in favour of Aristotle's categories, and
 there was decreed learnedly and equitably the penalty of the galleys for
 whoever should be sufficiently daring as to have an opinion different
 from that of the Stagyrite, whose books were formerly burned by two
 councils.
 
 Further on a faculty, which had not great faculties, issued a decree
 against innate ideas, and later a decree for innate ideas, without the
 said faculty being informed by its beadles what an idea is.
 
 In the neighbouring schools judicial proceedings were instituted against
 the circulation of the blood.
 
 An action was started against inoculation, and parties have been
 subpoenaed.
 
 At the Customs of thought twenty-one folio volumes were seized, in which
 it was stated treacherously and wickedly that triangles always have
 three angles; that a father is older than his son; that Rhea Silvia lost
 her virginity before giving birth to her child, and that flour is not an
 oak leaf.
 
 In another year was judged the action: _Utrum chimera bombinans in vacuo
 possit comedere secundas intentiones_, and was decided in the
 affirmative.
 
 In consequence, everyone thought themselves far superior to Archimedes,
 Euclid, Cicero, Pliny, and strutted proudly about the University
 quarter.
 
 
 
 
 _AUTHORS_
 
 
 Author is a generic name which can, like the name of all other
 professions, signify good or bad, worthy of respect or ridicule, useful
 and agreeable, or trash for the wastepaper-basket.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 We think that the author of a good work should refrain from three
 things--from putting his name, save very modestly, from the epistle
 dedicatory, and from the preface. Others should refrain from a
 fourth--that is, from writing.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 Prefaces are another stumbling-block. "The 'I,'" said Pascal, "is
 hateful." Speak as little of yourself as possible; for you must know
 that the reader's self-esteem is as great as yours. He will never
 forgive you for wanting to condemn him to have a good opinion of you. It
 is for your book to speak for you, if it comes to be read by the crowd.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 If you want to be an author, if you want to write a book; reflect that
 it must be useful and new, or at least infinitely agreeable.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 If an ignoramus, a pamphleteer, presumes to criticize without
 discrimination, you can confound him; but make rare mention of him, for
 fear of sullying your writings.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 If you are attacked as regards your style, never reply; it is for your
 work alone to make answer.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 Someone says you are ill, be content that you are well, without wanting
 to prove to the public that you are in perfect health. And above all
 remember that the public cares precious little whether you are well or
 ill.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 A hundred authors make compilations in order to have bread, and twenty
 pamphleteers make excerpts from these compilations, or apology for them,
 or criticism and satire of them, also with the idea of having bread,
 because they have no other trade. All these persons go on Friday to the
 police lieutenant of Paris to ask permission to sell their rubbish. They
 have audience immediately after the strumpets who do not look at them
 because they know that these are underhand dealings.[5]
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 Real authors are those who have succeeded in one of the real arts, in
 epic poetry, in tragedy or comedy, in history or philosophy, who have
 taught men or charmed them. The others of whom we have spoken are, among
 men of letters, what wasps are among birds.
 
 
 FOOTNOTES:
 
 [5] When Voltaire was writing, it was the police lieutenant of Paris who
 had, under the chancellor, the inspection of books: since then, a part
 of his department has been taken from him. He has kept only the
 inspection of theatrical plays and works below those on printed sheets.
 The detail of this part is immense. In Paris one is not permitted to
 print that one has lost one's dog, unless the police are assured that in
 the poor beast's description there is no proposition contrary to
 morality and religion (1819).
 
 
 
 
 _BANISHMENT_
 
 
 Banishment for a period or for life, punishment to which one condemns
 delinquents, or those one wishes to appear as such.
 
 Not long ago one banished outside the sphere of jurisdiction a petty
 thief, a petty forger, a man guilty of an act of violence. The result
 was that he became a big robber, a forger on a big scale, and murderer
 within the sphere of another jurisdiction. It is as if we threw into our
 neighbours' fields the stones which incommode us in our own.
 
 Those who have written on the rights of men, have been much tormented to
 know for certain if a man who has been banished from his fatherland
 still belongs to his fatherland. It is nearly the same thing as asking
 if a gambler who has been driven away from the gaming-table is still one
 of the gamblers.
 
 If to every man it is permitted by natural right to choose his
 fatherland, he who has lost the right of citizen can, with all the more
 reason, choose for himself a new fatherland; but can he bear arms
 against his former fellow-citizens? There are a thousand examples of it.
 How many French protestants naturalized in Holland, England and Germany
 have served against France, and against armies containing their own
 kindred and their own brothers! The Greeks who were in the King of
 Persia's armies made war on the Greeks, their former compatriots. One
 has seen the Swiss in the Dutch service fire on the Swiss in the French
 service. It is still worse than to fight against those who have banished
 you; for, after all, it seems less dishonest to draw the sword for
 vengeance than to draw it for money.
 
 
 
 
 _BANKRUPTCY_
 
 
 Few bankruptcies were known in France before the sixteenth century. The
 great reason is that there were no bankers. Lombards, Jews lent on
 security at ten per cent: trade was conducted in cash. Exchange,
 remittances to foreign countries were a secret unknown to all judges.
 
 It is not that many people were not ruined; but that was not called
 _bankruptcy_; one said _discomfiture_; this word is sweeter to the ear.
 One used the word _rupture_ as did the Boulonnais; but rupture does not
 sound so well.
 
 The bankruptcies came to us from Italy, _bancorotto, bancarotta,
 gambarotta e la giustizia non impicar_. Every merchant had his bench
 (_banco_) in the place of exchange; and when he had conducted his
 business badly, declared himself _fallito_, and abandoned his property
 to his creditors with the proviso that he retain a good part of it for
 himself, be free and reputed a very upright man. There was nothing to be
 said to him, his bench was broken, _banco rotto, banca rotta_; he could
 even, in certain towns, keep all his property and baulk his creditors,
 provided he seated himself bare-bottomed on a stone in the presence of
 all the merchants. This was a mild derivation of the old Roman
 proverb--_solvere aut in aere aut in cute_, to pay either with one's
 money or one's skin. But this custom no longer exists; creditors have
 preferred their money to a bankrupt's hinder parts.
 
 In England and in some other countries, one declares oneself bankrupt in
 the gazettes. The partners and creditors gather together by virtue of
 this announcement which is read in the coffee-houses, and they come to
 an arrangement as best they can.
 
 As among the bankruptcies there are frequently fraudulent cases, it has
 been necessary to punish them. If they are taken to court they are
 everywhere regarded as theft, and the guilty are condemned to
 ignominious penalties.
 
 It is not true that in France the death penalty was decreed against
 bankrupts without distinction. Simple failures involved no penalty;
 fraudulent bankrupts suffered the penalty of death in the states of
 Orleans, under Charles IX., and in the states of Blois in 1576, but
 these edicts, renewed by Henry IV., were merely comminatory.
 
 It is too difficult to prove that a man has dishonoured himself on
 purpose, and has voluntarily ceded all his goods to his creditors in
 order to cheat them. When there has been a doubt, one has been content
 with putting the unfortunate man in the pillory, or with sending him to
 the galleys, although ordinarily a banker makes a poor convict.
 
 Bankrupts were very favourably treated in the last year of Louis XIV.'s
 reign, and during the Regency. The sad state to which the interior of
 the kingdom was reduced, the multitude of merchants who could not or
 would not pay, the quantity of unsold or unsellable effects, the fear of
 interrupting all commerce, obliged the government in 1715, 1716, 1718,
 1721, 1722, and 1726 to suspend all proceedings against all those who
 were in a state of insolvency. The discussions of these actions were
 referred to the judge-consuls; this is a jurisdiction of merchants very
 expert in these cases, and better constituted for going into these
 commercial details than the parliaments which have always been more
 occupied with the laws of the kingdom than with finance. As the state
 was at that time going bankrupt, it would have been too hard to punish
 the poor middle-class bankrupts.
 
 Since then we have had eminent men, fraudulent bankrupts, but they have
 not been punished.
 
 
 
 
 _BEAUTY_
 
 
 Ask a toad what beauty is, the _to kalon_? He will answer you that it is
 his toad wife with two great round eyes issuing from her little head, a
 wide, flat mouth, a yellow belly, a brown back. Interrogate a Guinea
 negro, for him beauty is a black oily skin, deep-set eyes, a flat nose.
 Interrogate the devil; he will tell you that beauty is a pair of horns,
 four claws and a tail. Consult, lastly, the philosophers, they will
 answer you with gibberish: they have to have something conforming to the
 arch-type of beauty in essence, to the _to kalon_.
 
 One day I was at a tragedy near by a philosopher. "How beautiful that
 is!" he said.
 
 "What do you find beautiful there?" I asked.
 
 "It is beautiful," he answered, "because the author has reached his
 goal."
 
 The following day he took some medicine which did him good. "The
 medicine has reached its goal," I said to him. "What a beautiful
 medicine!" He grasped that one cannot say a medicine is beautiful, and
 that to give the name of "beauty" to something, the thing must cause you
 to admire it and give you pleasure. He agreed that the tragedy had
 inspired these sentiments in him, and that there was the _to kalon_,
 beauty.
 
 We journeyed to England: the same piece, perfectly translated, was
 played there; it made everybody in the audience yawn. "Ho, ho!" he said,
 "the _to kalon_ is not the same for the English and the French." After
 much reflection he came to the conclusion that beauty is often very
 relative, just as what is decent in Japan is indecent in Rome, and what
 is fashionable in Paris, is not fashionable in Pekin; and he saved
 himself the trouble of composing a long treatise on beauty.
 
 There are actions which the whole world finds beautiful. Two of Caesar's
 officers, mortal enemies, send each other a challenge, not as to who
 shall shed the other's blood with tierce and quarte behind a thicket as
 with us, but as to who shall best defend the Roman camp, which the
 Barbarians are about to attack. One of them, having repulsed the enemy,
 is near succumbing; the other rushes to his aid, saves his life, and
 completes the victory.
 
 A friend sacrifices his life for his friend; a son for his father....
 The Algonquin, the Frenchman, the Chinaman, will all say that that is
 very _beautiful_, that these actions give them pleasure, that they
 admire them.
 
 They will say as much of the great moral maxims, of Zarathustra's--"In
 doubt if an action be just, abstain..."; of Confucius'--"Forget
 injuries, never forget kindnesses."
 
 The negro with the round eyes and flat nose, who will not give the name
 of "beauties" to the ladies of our courts, will without hesitation give
 it to these actions and these maxims. The wicked man even will recognize
 the beauty of these virtues which he dare not imitate. The beauty which
 strikes the senses merely, the imagination, and that which is called
 "intelligence," is often uncertain therefore. The beauty which speaks to
 the heart is not that. You will find a host of people who will tell you
 that they have found nothing beautiful in three-quarters of the Iliad;
 but nobody will deny that Codrus' devotion to his people was very
 beautiful, supposing it to be true.
 
 There are many other reasons which determine me not to write a treatise
 on beauty.
 
 
 
 
 _BISHOP_
 
 
 Samuel Ornik, native of Basle, was, as you know, a very amiable young
 man who, besides, knew his New Testament by heart in Greek and German.
 When he was twenty his parents sent him on a journey. He was charged to
 carry some books to the coadjutor of Paris, at the time of the Fronde.
 He arrived at the door of the archbishop's residence; the Swiss told him
 that Monseigneur saw nobody. "Comrade," said Ornik to him, "you are very
 rude to your compatriots. The apostles let everyone approach, and Jesus
 Christ desired that people should suffer all the little children to come
 to him. I have nothing to ask of your master; on the contrary, I have
 brought him something."
 
 "Come inside, then," said the Swiss.
 
 He waits an hour in a first antechamber. As he was very naive, he began
 a conversation with a servant, who was very fond of telling all he knew
 of his master. "He must be mightily rich," said Ornik, "to have this
 crowd of pages and flunkeys whom I see running about the house."
 
 "I don't know what his income is," answered the other, "but I heard it
 said to Joly and the Abbe Charier that he already had two millions of
 debts."
 
 "But who is that lady coming out of the room?"
 
 "That is Madame de Pomereu, one of his mistresses."
 
 "She is really very pretty; but I have not read that the apostles had
 such company in their bedrooms in the mornings. Ah! I think the
 archbishop is going to give audience."
 
 "Say--'His Highness, Monseigneur.'"
 
 "Willingly." Ornik salutes His Highness, presents his books, and is
 received with a very gracious smile. The archbishop says four words to
 him, then climbs into his coach, escorted by fifty horsemen. In
 climbing, Monseigneur lets a sheath fall. Ornik is quite astonished that
 Monseigneur carries so large an ink-horn in his pocket. "Don't you see
 that's his dagger?" says the chatterbox. "Everyone carries a dagger when
 he goes to parliament."
 
 "That's a pleasant way of officiating," says Ornik; and he goes away
 very astonished.
 
 He traverses France, and enlightens himself from town to town; thence he
 passes into Italy. When he is in the Pope's territory, he meets one of
 those bishops with a thousand crowns income, walking on foot. Ornik was
 very polite; he offers him a place in his cambiature. "You are doubtless
 on your way to comfort some sick man, Monseigneur?"
 
 "Sir, I am on my way to my master's."
 
 "Your master? that is Jesus Christ, doubtless?"
 
 "Sir, it is Cardinal Azolin; I am his almoner. He pays me very poorly;
 but he has promised to place me in the service of Donna Olimpia, the
 favourite sister-in-law _di nostro signore_."
 
 "What! you are in the pay of a cardinal? But do you not know that there
 were no cardinals in the time of Jesus Christ and St. John?"
 
 "Is it possible?" cried the Italian prelate.
 
 "Nothing is more true; you have read it in the Gospel."
 
 "I have never read it," answered the bishop; "all I know is Our Lady's
 office."
 
 "I tell you there were neither cardinals nor bishops, and when there
 were bishops, the priests were their equals almost, according to
 Jerome's assertions in several places."
 
 "Holy Virgin," said the Italian. "I knew nothing about it: and the
 popes?"
 
 "There were not any popes any more than cardinals."
 
 The good bishop crossed himself; he thought he was with an evil spirit,
 and jumped out of the cambiature.
 
 
 
 
 _BOOKS_
 
 
 You despise them, books, you whose whole life is plunged in the vanities
 of ambition and in the search for pleasure or in idleness; but think
 that the whole of the known universe, with the exception of the savage
 races is governed by books alone. The whole of Africa right to Ethiopia
 and Nigritia obeys the book of the Alcoran, after having staggered under
 the book of the Gospel. China is ruled by the moral book of Confucius; a
 greater part of India by the book of the Veidam. Persia was governed for
 centuries by the books of one of the Zarathustras.
 
 If you have a law-suit, your goods, your honour, your life even depends
 on the interpretation of a book which you never read.
 
 _Robert the Devil_, the _Four Sons of Aymon_, the _Imaginings of Mr.
 Oufle_, are books also; but it is with books as with men; the very small
 number play a great part, the rest are mingled in the crowd.
 
 Who leads the human race in civilized countries? those who know how to
 read and write. You do not know either Hippocrates, Boerhaave or
 Sydenham; but you put your body in the hands of those who have read
 them. You abandon your soul to those who are paid to read the Bible,
 although there are not fifty among them who have read it in its entirety
 with care.
 
 To such an extent do books govern the world, that those who command
 to-day in the city of the Scipios and the Catos have desired that the
 books of their law should be only for them; it is their sceptre; they
 have made it a crime of _lese-majeste_ for their subjects to look there
 without express permission. In other countries it has been forbidden to
 think in writing without letters patent.
 
 There are nations among whom thought is regarded purely as an object of
 commerce. The operations of the human mind are valued there only at two
 sous the sheet.
 
 In another country, the liberty of explaining oneself by books is one of
 the most inviolable prerogatives. Print all that you like under pain of
 boring or of being punished if you abuse too considerably your natural
 right.
 
 Before the admirable invention of printing, books were rarer and more
 expensive than precious stones. Almost no books among the barbarian
 nations until Charlemagne, and from him to the French king Charles V.,
 surnamed "the wise"; and from this Charles right to Francois Ier, there
 is an extreme dearth.
 
 The Arabs alone had books from the eighth century of our era to the
 thirteenth.
 
 China was filled with them when we did not know how to read or write.
 
 Copyists were much employed in the Roman Empire from the time of the
 Scipios up to the inundation of the barbarians.
 
 The Greeks occupied themselves much in transcribing towards the time of
 Amyntas, Philip and Alexander; they continued this craft especially in
 Alexandria.
 
 This craft is somewhat ungrateful. The merchants always paid the authors
 and the copyists very badly. It took two years of assiduous labour for a
 copyist to transcribe the Bible well on vellum. What time and what
 trouble for copying correctly in Greek and Latin the works of Origen, of
 Clement of Alexandria, and of all those other authors called "fathers."
 
 The poems of Homer were long so little known that Pisistratus was the
 first who put them in order, and who had them transcribed in Athens,
 about five hundred years before the era of which we are making use.
 
 To-day there are not perhaps a dozen copies of the Veidam and the
 Zend-Avesta in the whole of the East.
 
 You would not have found a single book in the whole of Russia in 1700,
 with the exception of Missals and a few Bibles in the homes of aged men
 drunk on brandy.
 
 To-day people complain of a surfeit: but it is not for readers to
 complain; the remedy is easy; nothing forces them to read. It is not any
 the more for authors to complain. Those who make the crowd must not cry
 that they are being crushed. Despite the enormous quantity of books, how
 few people read! and if one read profitably, one would see the
 deplorable follies to which the common people offer themselves as prey
 every day.
 
 What multiplies books, despite the law of not multiplying beings
 unnecessarily, is that with books one makes others; it is with several
 volumes already printed that a new history of France or Spain is
 fabricated, without adding anything new. All dictionaries are made with
 dictionaries; almost all new geography books are repetitions of
 geography books. The Summation of St. Thomas has produced two thousand
 fat volumes of theology; and the same family of little worms that have
 gnawed the mother, gnaw likewise the children.
 
 
 
 
 _BOULEVERD OR BOULEVART_
 
 
 Boulevart, fortification, rampart. Belgrade is the boulevart of the
 Ottoman Empire on the Hungarian side. Who would believe that this word
 originally signified only a game of bowls? The people of Paris played
 bowls on the grass of the rampart; this grass was called the _verd_,
 like the grass market. _On boulait sur le verd._ From there it comes
 that the English, whose language is a copy of ours in almost all the
 words which are not Saxon, have called the game of bowls
 "bowling-green," the _verd_ (green) of the game of bowls. We have taken
 back from them what we had lent them. Following their example, we gave
 the name of _boulingrins_, without knowing the strength of the word, to
 the grass-plots we introduced into our gardens.
 
 I once heard two good dames who were going for a walk on the
 _Bouleverd_, and not on the _Boulevart_. People laughed at them, and
 wrongly. But in all matters custom carries the day; and everyone who is
 right against custom is hissed or condemned.
 
 
 
 
 _BOURGES_
 
 
 Our questions barely turn on geography; but let us be permitted to mark
 in two words our astonishment about the town of Bourges. The
 "Dictionnaire de Trevoux" claims that "it is one of the most ancient
 towns of Europe, that it was the seat of the empire of the Gauls, and
 gave kings to the Celts."
 
 I do not wish to combat the ancientness of any town or any family. But
 was there ever an empire of the Gauls? Did the Celts have kings? This
 mania for antiquity is a malady from which one will not be healed so
 soon. The Gauls, Germany, Scandinavia have nothing that is antique save
 the land, the trees and the animals. If you want antiquities, go toward
 Asia, and even then it is very small beer. Man is ancient and monuments
 new, that is what we have in view in more than one article.
 
 If it were a real benefit to be born in a stone or wooden enclosure more
 ancient than another, it would be very reasonable to make the foundation
 of one's town date back to the time of the war of the giants; but since
 there is not the least advantage in this vanity, one must break away
 from it. That is all I had to say about Bourges.
 
 
 
 
 _BRAHMINS_
 
 
 Is it not probable that the Brahmins were the first legislators of the
 earth, the first philosophers, the first theologians?
 
 Do not the few monuments of ancient history which remain to us form a
 great presumption in their favour, since the first Greek philosophers
 went to them to learn mathematics, and since the most ancient
 curiosities collected by the emperors of China are all Indian?
 
 We will speak elsewhere of the "Shasta"; it is the first book of
 theology of the Brahmins, written about fifteen hundred years before
 their "Veidam," and anterior to all the other books.
 
 Their annals make no mention of any war undertaken by them at any time.
 The words for _arms_, to _kill_, to _maim_, are not to be found either
 in the fragments of the "Shasta" which we have, or in the "Ezourveidam,"
 or in the "Cormoveidam." I can at least give the assurance that I did
 not see them in these last two collections: and what is still more
 singular is that the "Shasta" which speaks of a conspiracy in heaven,
 makes no mention of any war in the great peninsula enclosed between the
 Indus and the Ganges.
 
 The Hebrews, who were known so late, never name the Brahmins; they had
 no knowledge of India until after the conquests of Alexander, and their
 settling in Egypt, of which they had said so much evil. The name of
 India is to be found only in the Book of Esther, and in that of Job
 which was not Hebrew. One remarks a singular contrast between the sacred
 books of the Hebrews, and those of the Indians. The Indian books
 announce only peace and gentleness; they forbid the killing of animals:
 the Hebrew books speak only of killing, of the massacre of men and
 beasts; everything is slaughtered in the name of the Lord; it is quite
 another order of things.
 
 It is incontestably from the Brahmins that we hold the idea of the fall
 of the celestial beings in revolt against the Sovereign of nature; and
 it is from there probably that the Greeks drew the fable of the Titans.
 It is there also that the Jews at last took the idea of the revolt of
 Lucifer, in the first century of our era.
 
 How could these Indians suppose a revolt in heaven without having seen
 one on earth? Such a jump from human nature to divine nature is barely
 conceivable. Usually one goes from known to unknown.
 
 One does not imagine a war of giants until one has seen some men more
 robust than the others tyrannize over their fellows. The first Brahmins
 must either have experienced violent discords, or at least have seen
 them in heaven.
 
 It is a very astonishing phenomenon for a society of men who have never
 made war to have invented a species of war made in the imaginary spaces,
 or in a globe distant from ours, or in what is called the "firmament,"
 the "empyrean." But it must be carefully observed that in this revolt of
 celestial beings against their Sovereign no blows were struck, no
 celestial blood flowed, no mountains hurled at the head, no angels cut
 in two, as in Milton's sublime and grotesque poem.
 
 According to the "Shasta," it is only a formal disobedience to the
 orders of the Most High, a cabal which God punishes by relegating the
 rebellious angels to a vast place of shadows called "Ondera" during the
 period of an entire mononthour. A mononthour is four hundred and
 twenty-six millions of our years. But God deigned to pardon the guilty
 after five thousand years, and their ondera was only a purgatory.
 
 He made "Mhurd" of them, men, and placed them in our globe on condition
 that they should not eat animals, and that they should not copulate with
 the males of their new species, under pain of returning to ondera.
 
 Those are the principal articles of the Brahmins' faith, which have
 lasted without interruption from immemorial times right to our day: it
 seems strange to us that among them it should be as grave a sin to eat a
 chicken as to commit sodomy.
 
 This is only a small part of the ancient cosmogony of the Brahmins.
 Their rites, their pagodas, prove that among them everything was
 allegorical; they still represent virtue beneath the emblem of a woman
 who has ten arms, and who combats ten mortal sins represented by
 monsters. Our missionaries have not failed to take this image of virtue
 for that of the devil, and to assure us that the devil is worshipped in
 India. We have never been among these people but to enrich ourselves and
 to calumniate them.
 
 Really we have forgotten a very essential thing in this little article
 on the Brahmins; it is that their sacred books are filled with
 contradictions. But the people do not know of them, and the doctors have
 solutions ready, figurative meanings, allegories, symbols, express
 declarations of Birma, Brahma and Vitsnou, which should close the mouths
 of all who reason.
 
 
 
 
 _CHARACTER_
 
 
 From the Greek word _impression_, _engraving_.
 
 It is what nature has graved in us.
 
 Can one change one's character? Yes, if one changes one's body. It is
 possible for a man born blunderer, unbending and violent, being stricken
 with apoplexy in his old age, to become a foolish, tearful child, timid
 and peaceable. His body is no longer the same. But as long as his
 nerves, his blood and his marrow are in the same state, his nature will
 not change any more than a wolf's and a marten's instinct.
 
 The character is composed of our ideas and our feelings: well, it is
 substantiated that we give ourselves neither feelings nor ideas;
 therefore our character does not depend on us.
 
 If it depended on us, there is nobody who would not be perfect.
 
 We cannot give ourselves tastes, talents; why should we give ourselves
 qualities?
 
 If one does not reflect, one thinks oneself master of everything; when
 one reflects thereon, one sees that one is master of nothing.
 
 Should you wish to change a man's character completely, purge him with
 diluents every day until you have killed him. Charles XII., in his
 suppurative fever on the road to Bender, was no longer the same man. One
 prevailed upon him as upon a child.
 
 If I have a crooked nose and two cat's eyes, I can hide them with a
 mask. Can I do more with the character which nature has given me?
 
 A man born violent, hasty, presented himself before Francois I., King of
 France, to complain of an injustice; the prince's countenance, the
 respectful bearing of the courtiers, the very place where he is, make a
 powerful impression on this man; mechanically he lowers his eyes, his
 rough voice softens, he presents his petition humbly, one would believe
 him born as gentle as are (at that moment at least) the courtiers,
 amongst whom he is even disconcerted; but Francois I. understands
 physiognomy, he easily discovers in the lowered eyes, burning
 nevertheless with sombre fire, in the strained facial muscles, in the
 compressed lips, that this man is not so gentle as he is forced to
 appear. This man follows him to Pavia, is taken with him, led to the
 same prison in Madrid: Francois I.'s majesty no longer makes the same
 impression on him; he grows familiar with the object of his respect. One
 day when pulling off the king's boots, and pulling them off badly, the
 king, embittered by his misfortune, gets angry; my man sends the king
 about his business, and throws his boots out of the window.
 
 Sixtus V. was born petulant, stubborn, haughty, impetuous, vindictive,
 arrogant; this character seemed softened during the trials of his
 novitiate. He begins to enjoy a certain credit in his order; he flies
 into a passion with a guard, and batters him with his fist: he is
 inquisitor at Venice; he performs his duties with insolence: behold him
 cardinal, he is possessed _dalla rabbia papale_: this fury triumphs over
 his nature; he buries his person and his character in obscurity; he apes
 the humble and the dying man; he is elected Pope; this moment gives back
 to the spring, which politics have bent, all its long curbed elasticity;
 he is the haughtiest and most despotic of sovereigns.
 
      _Naturam expella furca, tamen usque recurret._
 
                                  (Hor. L. I., ep. x).
 
      Drive away nature, it returns at the gallop.
 
                                  (DESTOUCHES, _Glorieux_, Act 3, Sc. 5.)
 
 Religion, morality put a brake on a nature's strength; they cannot
 destroy it. The drunkard in a cloister, reduced to a half-setier of
 cider at each meal, will no longer get drunk, but he will always like
 wine.
 
 Age enfeebles character; it is a tree that produces only degenerate
 fruit, but the fruit is always of the same nature; it is knotted and
 covered with moss, it becomes worm-eaten, but it is always oak or pear
 tree. If one could change one's character, one would give oneself one,
 one would be master of nature. Can one give oneself anything? do we not
 receive everything? Try to animate an indolent man with a continued
 activity; to freeze with apathy the boiling soul of an impetuous fellow,
 to inspire someone who has neither ear nor taste with a taste for music
 and poetry, you will no more succeed than if you undertook to give sight
 to a man born blind. We perfect, we soften, we conceal what nature has
 put in us, but we do not put in ourselves anything at all.
 
 One says to a farmer: "You have too many fish in this pond, they will
 not prosper; there are too many cattle in your meadows, grass lacks,
 they will grow thin." It happens after this exhortation that the pikes
 eat half my man's carp, and the wolves the half of his sheep; the rest
 grow fat. Will he congratulate himself on his economy? This countryman,
 it is you; one of your passions has devoured the others, and you think
 you have triumphed over yourself. Do not nearly all of us resemble that
 old general of ninety who, having met some young officers who were
 debauching themselves with some girls, says to them angrily: "Gentlemen,
 is that the example I give you?"
 
 
 
 
 _CHARLATAN_
 
 
 The article entitled "Charlatan" in the "Encyclopedic Dictionary" is
 filled with useful truths agreeably presented. The Chevalier de Jaucourt
 has there presented the charlatanry of medicine.
 
 We will take the liberty of adding here a few reflections. The abode of
 the doctors is in the large towns; there are barely any doctors in the
 country. It is in the great towns that the rich invalids are;
 debauchery, the excesses of the table, the passions, are the cause of
 their maladies. Dumoulin, not the lawyer, the doctor, who was as good a
 practician as the other, said as he was dying, that he left two great
 doctors behind him, diet and river water.
 
 In 1728, in the time of Law, the most famous charlatan of the first
 species, another, Villars by name, confided to some friends that his
 uncle who had lived nearly a hundred years, and who died only by
 accident, had left him the secret of a water which could easily prolong
 life to a hundred and fifty years, provided a man was temperate. When he
 saw a funeral pass, he shrugged his shoulders in pity; if the defunct,
 he observed, had drunk my water, he would not be where he is. His
 friends to whom he gave generously of the water, and who observed the
 prescribed regime in some degree, thrived on it and praised it. He then
 sold the bottle for six francs; the sale was prodigious. It was water
 from the Seine with a little nitre. Those who took it and who subjected
 themselves to a certain amount of regime, above all those who were born
 with a good constitution, recovered perfect health in a few days. He
 said to the others: "It is your fault if you are not entirely cured:
 correct these two vices and you will live at least a hundred and fifty
 years." Some of them reformed; this good charlatan's fortune increased
 like his reputation. The Abbe de Pons, the enthusiast, put him far above
 the Marechal de Villars: "The Marechal kills men," he said to him, "but
 you make them live."
 
 People learned at last that Villars Water was only river water; they
 would have no more of it; and went to other charlatans.
 
 It is certain that he had done good, and that the only reproach one
 could make against him was that he had sold Seine water a little too
 dear. He led men to temperance by which fact he was superior to the
 apothecary Arnoult, who stuffed Europe with his sachets against
 apoplexy, without recommending any virtue.
 
 I knew in London a doctor named Brown, who practised in Barbados. He had
 a sugar refinery and negroes; he was robbed of a considerable sum; he
 assembled his negroes: "My lads," he said to them, "the great serpent
 appeared to me during the night, he told me that the thief would at this
 moment have a parrot's feather on the end of his nose." The guilty man
 promptly put his hand to his nose. "It is you who robbed me," said the
 master; "the great serpent has just told me so." And he regained his
 money. One can hardly condemn such a charlatanry; but one must be
 dealing with negroes.
 
 Scipio Africanus, this great Scipio very different otherwise from Dr.
 Brown, willingly made his soldiers believe that he was inspired by the
 gods. This great charlatanry was long the custom. Can one blame Scipio
 to have availed himself of it? he was the man who perhaps did most
 honour to the Roman Republic; but why did the gods inspire him not to
 render his accounts?
 
 Numa did better; it was necessary to police some brigands and a senate
 which was the most difficult section of these brigands to govern. If he
 had proposed his laws to the assembled tribes, the assassins of his
 predecessor would have made a thousand difficulties. He addressed
 himself to the goddess Egeria, who gave him some pandects from Jupiter;
 he was obeyed without contradiction, and he reigned happily. His
 instructions were good, his charlatanry did good; but if some secret
 enemy had discovered the imposture, if he had said: "Exterminate an
 impostor who prostitutes the name of the gods in order to deceive men,"
 Numa ran the risk of being sent to heaven with Romulus.
 
 It is probable that Numa took his measures very carefully, and that he
 deceived the Romans for their benefit, with a dexterity suitable to the
 time, the place, the intelligence of the early Romans.
 
 Mahomet was twenty times on the point of failing, but he succeeded at
 last with the Arabs of Medina; and people believed that he was the
 intimate friend of the Archangel Gabriel. If to-day someone came to
 Constantinople to announce that he was the favourite of the Archangel
 Raphael, far superior to Gabriel in dignity, and that it was in him
 alone people should believe, he would be impaled in the public place. It
 is for charlatans to choose their time well.
 
 Was there not a little charlatanry in Socrates with his familiar demon,
 and Apollo's precise declaration which proclaimed him the wisest of all
 men? How can Rollin, in his history, reason from this oracle? How is it
 that he does not let the young idea know that it was pure charlatanry?
 Socrates chose his time badly. A hundred years earlier, maybe, he would
 have governed Athens.
 
 All leaders of sects in philosophy have been somewhat charlatans: but
 the greatest of all have been those who have aspired to domination.
 Cromwell was the most terrible of all our charlatans. He appeared at
 precisely the only time he could succeed: under Elizabeth he would have
 been hanged; under Charles II. he would have been merely ridiculous. He
 came happily at a time when people were disgusted with kings; and his
 son, at a time when people were weary of a protector.
 
 
 OF CHARLATANRY IN SCIENCE AND LITERATURE
 
 The sciences can barely be without charlatanry. People wish to have
 their opinions accepted; the quibbling doctor wishes to eclipse the
 angelic doctor; the recondite doctor wishes to reign alone. Each builds
 his system of physics, metaphysics, scholastic theology; it is a
 competition in turning one's merchandise to account. You have agents who
 extol it, fools who believe you, protectors who support you.
 
 Is there a greater charlatanry than that of substituting words for
 things, and of wanting others to believe what you do not believe
 yourself?
 
 One establishes whirlwinds of subtle matter, ramous, globulous,
 striated, channelled; the other elements of matter which are not matter
 at all, and a pre-established harmony which makes the clock of the body
 sound the hour, when the clock of the soul shows it with its hand. These
 chimeras find partisans for a few years. When this rubbish has passed
 out of fashion, new fanatics appear on the itinerant theatre; they
 banish germs from the world, they say that the sea produced the
 mountains, and that men were once fish.
 
 How much charlatanry has been put into history, either by astonishing
 the reader with prodigies, by titillating human malignity with satire,
 or by flattering the families of tyrants with infamous eulogy?
 
 The wretched species that writes for a living is charlatan in another
 way. A poor man who has no trade, who has had the misfortune to go to
 college, and who thinks he knows how to write, goes to pay his court to
 a bookseller, and asks him for work. The bookseller knows that the
 majority of most people who live in houses want to have little
 libraries, that they need abridgments and new titles; he orders from the
 writer an abridgment of the "History by Rapin-Thoyras," an abridgment of
 the "History of the Church," a "Collection of Witty Sayings" drawn from
 the "Menagiana," a "Dictionary of Great Men," where an unknown pedant
 is placed beside Cicero, and a _sonettiero_ of Italy near Virgil.
 
 Another bookseller orders novels, or translations of novels. "If you
 have no imagination," he says to the workman, "you will take a few of
 the adventures in 'Cyrus,' in 'Gusman d'Alfarache,' in the 'Secret
 Memoirs of a Gentleman of Quality,' or 'Of a Lady of Quality'; and from
 the total you will prepare a volume of four hundred pages at twenty sous
 the sheet."
 
 Another bookseller gives the gazettes and almanacs for ten years past to
 a man of genius. "You will make me an extract of all that, and you will
 bring it me back in three months under the name of 'Faithful History of
 the Times,' by the Chevalier de Trois Etoiles, Lieutenant of the Navy,
 employed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."
 
 Of this kind of book there are about fifty thousand in Europe; and it
 all passes just like the secret of whitening the skin, of darkening the
 hair, and the universal panacea.
 
 
 
 
 _CIVIL LAWS_
 
 
 EXTRACT FROM SOME NOTES FOUND AMONG A LAWYER'S PAPERS, WHICH MAYBE MERIT
 EXAMINATION.
 
 Let the punishments of criminals be useful. A hanged man is good for
 nothing, and a man condemned to public works still serves the country,
 and is a living lesson.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 Let all laws be clear, uniform and precise: to interpret laws is almost
 always to corrupt them.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 Let nothing be infamous save vice.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 Let taxes be always proportional.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 Let the law never be contradictory to custom: for if the custom be good,
 the law is worthless.
 
 
 
 
 _CLIMATE_
 
 
 Climate influences religion as regards customs and ceremonies. A
 legislator will not have had difficulty in making the Indians bathe in
 the Ganges at certain seasons of the moon; it is a great pleasure for
 them. He would have been stoned if he had proposed the same bath to the
 peoples who dwell on the banks of the Dwina near Archangel. Forbid pig
 to an Arab who would have leprosy if he ate of this flesh which is very
 bad and disgusting in his country, he will obey you joyfully. Issue the
 same veto to a Westphalian and he will be tempted to fight you.
 
 Abstinence from wine is a good religious precept in Arabia where orange
 water, lemon water, lime water are necessary to health. Mohammed would
 not have forbidden wine in Switzerland perhaps, especially before going
 to battle.
 
 There are customs of pure fantasy. Why did the priests of Egypt imagine
 circumcision? it is not for health. Cambyses who treated them as they
 deserved, they and their bull Apis, Cambyses' courtiers, Cambyses'
 soldiers, had not had their prepuces lopped, and were very well. Climate
 does nothing to a priest's genitals. One offered one's prepuce to Isis,
 probably as one presented everywhere the first fruits of the earth. It
 was offering the first fruits of life.
 
 Religions have always rolled on two pivots; observance and creed:
 observance depends largely on climate; creed not at all. One could as
 easily make a dogma accepted on the equator as the polar circle. It
 would later be rejected equally at Batavia and in the Orkneys, while it
 would be maintained _unguibus et rostro_ at Salamanca. That depends in
 no way on the soil and the atmosphere, but solely on opinion, that
 fickle queen of the world.
 
 Certain libations of wine will be precept in a vine-growing country, and
 it will not occur to a legislator's mind to institute in Norway sacred
 mysteries which cannot be performed without wine.
 
 It will be expressly ordered to burn incense in the parvis of a temple
 where beasts are slaughtered in the Deity's honour, and for the priests'
 supper. This butcher's shop called "temple" would be a place of
 abominable infection if it were not continually purified: and without
 the assistance of aromatics, the religion of the ancients would have
 caused the plague. Even the interior of the temple was decked with
 festoons of flowers in order to make the air sweeter.
 
 No cow will be sacrificed in the burning land of the Indian peninsula;
 because this animal which furnishes necessary milk is very rare in an
 arid country, its flesh is dry, tough, contains very little nourishment,
 and the Brahmins would live very badly. On the contrary, the cow will
 become sacred, in view of its rarity and utility.
 
 One will only enter barefoot the temple of Jupiter Ammon where the heat
 is excessive: one must be well shod to perform one's devotions in
 Copenhagen.
 
 It is not so with dogma. People have believed in polytheism in all
 climates; and it is as easy for a Crimean Tartar as for an inhabitant of
 Mecca to recognize a single God, incommunicable, non-begetting,
 non-begotten. It is through its dogma still more than through its rites
 that a religion is spread from one climate to another. The dogma of the
 unity of God soon passed from Medina to the Caucasus; then the climate
 cedes to opinion.
 
 The Arabs said to the Turks: "We had ourselves circumcised in Arabia
 without really knowing why; it was an old fashion of the priests of
 Egypt to offer to Oshireth or Osiris a little part of what they held
 most precious. We had adopted this custom three thousand years before we
 became Mohammedans. You will be circumcised like us; like us you will be
 obliged to sleep with one of your wives every Friday, and to give each
 year two and a half per cent of your income to the poor. We drink only
 water and sherbet; all intoxicating liquor is forbidden us; in Arabia it
 is pernicious. You will embrace this regime although you love wine
 passionately, and although it may even be often necessary for you to go
 on the banks of the Phasis and Araxes. Lastly, if you want to go to
 Heaven, and be well placed there, you will take the road to Mecca."
 
 The inhabitants of the north of the Caucasus submit to these laws, and
 embrace throughout the country a religion which was not made for them.
 
 In Egypt the symbolic worship of animals succeeded the dogmas of Thaut.
 The gods of the Romans later shared Egypt with the dogs, the cats and
 the crocodiles. To the Roman religion succeeded Christianity; it was
 entirely driven out by Mohammedanism, which perhaps will cede its place
 to a new religion.
 
 In all these vicissitudes climate has counted for nothing: government
 has done everything. We are considering here second causes only, without
 raising profane eyes to the Providence which directs them. The Christian
 religion, born in Syria, having received its principal development in
 Alexandria, inhabits to-day the lands where Teutate, Irminsul, Frida,
 Odin were worshipped.
 
 There are peoples whose religion has been made by neither climate nor
 government. What cause detached the north of Germany, Denmark,
 three-quarters of Switzerland, Holland, England, Scotland, Ireland, from
 the Roman communion? Poverty. Indulgences and deliverance from purgatory
 were sold too dear to souls whose bodies had at that time very little
 money. The prelates, the monks devoured a province's whole revenue.
 People took a cheaper religion. At last, after twenty civil wars,
 people believed that the Pope's religion was very good for great lords,
 and the reformed religion for citizens. Time will show whether the Greek
 religion or the Turkish religion will prevail by the AEgean Sea and the
 Pont-Euxine.
 
 
 
 
 _COMMON SENSE_
 
 
 There are sometimes in common expressions an image of what passes in the
 depths of all men's hearts. Among the Romans _sensus communis_ signified
 not only common sense, but humanity, sensibility. As we are not as good
 as the Romans, this word signifies among us only half of what it
 signified among them. It means only good sense, plain reason, reason set
 in operation, a first notion of ordinary things, a state midway between
 stupidity and intelligence. "This man has no common sense" is a great
 insult. "A common-sense man" is an insult likewise; it means that he is
 not entirely stupid, and that he lacks what is called wit and
 understanding. But whence comes this expression _common sense_, unless
 it be from the senses? Men, when they invented this word, avowed that
 nothing entered the soul save through the senses; otherwise, would they
 have used the word _sense_ to signify common reasoning?
 
 People say sometimes--"Common sense is very rare." What does this phrase
 signify? that in many men reason set in operation is stopped in its
 progress by prejudices, that such and such man who judges very sanely in
 one matter, will always be vastly deceived in another. This Arab, who
 will be a good calculator, a learned chemist, an exact astronomer, will
 believe nevertheless that Mohammed put half the moon in his sleeve.
 
 Why will he go beyond common sense in the three sciences of which I
 speak, and why will he be beneath common sense when there is question of
 this half moon? Because in the first cases he has seen with his eyes,
 he has perfected his intelligence; and in the second, he has seen with
 other people's eyes, he has closed his own, he has perverted the common
 sense which is in him.
 
 How has this strange mental alienation been able to operate? How can the
 ideas which move with so regular and so firm a step in the brain on a
 great number of subjects limp so wretchedly on another a thousand times
 more palpable and easy to comprehend? This man always has inside him the
 same principles of intelligence; he must have some organ vitiated then,
 just as it happens sometimes that the finest _gourmet_ may have a
 depraved taste as regards a particular kind of food.
 
 How is the organ of this Arab, who sees half the moon in Mohammed's
 sleeve, vitiated? It is through fear. He has been told that if he did
 not believe in this sleeve, his soul, immediately after his death, when
 passing over the pointed bridge, would fall for ever into the abyss. He
 has been told even worse things: If ever you have doubts about this
 sleeve, one dervish will treat you as impious; another will prove to you
 that you are an insensate fool who, having all possible motives for
 believing, have not wished to subordinate your superb reason to the
 evidence; a third will report you to the little divan of a little
 province, and you will be legally impaled.
 
 All this terrifies the good Arab, his wife, his sister, all his little
 family into a state of panic. They have good sense about everything
 else, but on this article their imagination is wounded, as was the
 imagination of Pascal, who continually saw a precipice beside his
 armchair. But does our Arab believe in fact in Mohammed's sleeve? No. He
 makes efforts to believe; he says it is impossible, but that it is true;
 he believes what he does not believe. On the subject of this sleeve he
 forms in his head a chaos of ideas which he is afraid to disentangle;
 and this veritably is not to have common sense.
 
 
 
 
 _CONCATENATION OF EVENTS_
 
 
 The present is delivered, it is said, of the future. Events are linked
 to each other by an invincible fatality: it is Destiny which, in Homer,
 is above even Jupiter. This master of gods and men declares roundly that
 he cannot stop his son Sarpedon dying in his appointed time. Sarpedon
 was born at the moment when he had to be born, and could not be born at
 another moment; he could not die otherwise than before Troy; he could
 not be buried elsewhere than in Lycia; had at the appointed time to
 produce vegetables which had to be changed into the substance of a few
 Lycians; his heirs had to establish a new order in his states; this new
 order had to exert an influence over the neighbouring kingdoms; from it
 resulted a new arrangement of war and peace with the neighbours of the
 neighbours of Lycia: thus, step by step, the destiny of the whole world
 has been dependent on Sarpedon's death, which depended on Helen being
 carried off; and this carrying off was necessarily linked to Hecuba's
 marriage, which by tracing back to other events was linked to the origin
 of things.
 
 If only one of these facts had been arranged differently, another
 universe would have resulted: but it was not possible for the present
 universe not to exist; therefore it was not possible for Jupiter to save
 his son's life, for all that he was Jupiter.
 
 This system of necessity and fatality has been invented in our time by
 Leibnitz, according to what people say, under the name of
 _self-sufficient reason_; it is, however, very ancient: that there is no
 effect without a cause and that often the smallest cause produces the
 greatest effects, does not date from to-day.
 
 Lord Bolingbroke avows that the little quarrels of Madame Marlborough
 and Madame Masham gave birth to his chance of making Queen Anne's
 private treaty with Louis XIV.; this treaty led to the Peace of Utrecht;
 this Peace of Utrecht established Philip V. on the throne of Spain.
 Philip V. took Naples and Sicily from the house of Austria; the Spanish
 prince who is to-day King of Naples clearly owes his kingdom to my lady
 Masham: and he would not have had it, he would not perhaps even have
 been born, if the Duchess of Marlborough had been more complaisant
 towards the Queen of England. His existence at Naples depended on one
 foolishness more or less at the court of London.
 
 Examine the position of all the peoples of the universe; they are
 established like this on a sequence of facts which appear to be
 connected with nothing and which are connected with everything.
 Everything is cog, pulley, cord, spring, in this vast machine.
 
 It is likewise in the physical sphere. A wind which blows from the
 depths of Africa and the austral seas, brings a portion of the African
 atmosphere, which falls in rain in the valleys of the Alps; these rains
 fertilize our lands; our north wind in its turn sends our vapours among
 the negroes; we do good to Guinea, and Guinea does good to us. The chain
 stretches from one end of the universe to the other.
 
 But it seems to me that a strange abuse is made of the truth of this
 principle. From it some people conclude that there is not a sole minute
 atom whose movement has not exerted its influence in the present
 arrangement of the world; that there is not a single minute accident,
 among either men or animals, which is not an essential link in the great
 chain of fate.
 
 Let us understand each other: every effect clearly has its cause, going
 back from cause to cause in the abyss of eternity; but every cause has
 not its effect going forward to the end of the centuries. All events are
 produced by each other, I admit; if the past is delivered of the
 present, the present is delivered of the future; everything has father,
 but everything has not always children. Here it is precisely as with a
 genealogical tree; each house goes back, as we say, to Adam; but in the
 family there are many persons who have died without leaving issue.
 
 There is a genealogical tree of the events of this world. It is
 incontestable that the inhabitants of Gaul and Spain are descended from
 Gomer, and the Russians from Magog, his younger brother: one finds this
 genealogy in so many fat books! On this basis one cannot deny that the
 Great Turk, who is also descended from Magog, was not bound to be well
 beaten in 1769 by Catherine II., Empress of Russia. This adventure is
 clearly connected with other great adventures. But that Magog spat to
 right or left, near Mount Caucasus, and that he made two circles in a
 well or three, that he slept on the left side or on the right; I do not
 see that that has had much influence on present affairs.
 
 One must think that everything is not complete in nature, as Newton has
 demonstrated, and that every movement is not communicated step by step
 until it makes a circuit of the world, as he has demonstrated still
 further. Throw into water a body of like density, you calculate easily
 that after a short time the movement of this body, and the movement it
 has communicated to the water, are destroyed; the movement disappears
 and is effaced; therefore the movement that Magog might produce by
 spitting in a well cannot influence what is passing to-day in Moldavia
 and Wallachia; therefore present events are not the children of all past
 events: they have their direct lines; but a thousand little collateral
 lines do not serve them at all. Once more, every being has a father, but
 every being has not children.
 
 
 
 
 _CONTRADICTIONS_
 
 
 If some literary society wishes to undertake the dictionary of
 contradictions, I subscribe for twenty folio volumes.
 
 The world can exist only by contradictions: what is needed to abolish
 them? to assemble the states of the human race. But from the manner in
 which men are made, it would be a fresh contradiction if they were to
 agree. Assemble all the rabbits of the universe, there will not be two
 different opinions among them.
 
 I know only two kinds of immutable beings on the earth, mathematicians
 and animals; they are led by two invariable rules, demonstration and
 instinct: and even the mathematicians have had some disputes, but the
 animals have never varied.
 
 The contrasts, the light and shade in which public men are represented
 in history, are not contradictions, they are faithful portraits of human
 nature.
 
 Every day people condemn and admire Alexander the murderer of Clitus,
 but the avenger of Greece, the conqueror of the Persians, and the
 founder of Alexandria;
 
 Caesar the debauchee, who robs the public treasury of Rome to reduce his
 country to dependence; but whose clemency equals his valour, and whose
 intelligence equals his courage;
 
 Mohammed, impostor, brigand; but the sole religious legislator who had
 courage, and who founded a great empire;
 
 Cromwell the enthusiast, a rogue in his fanaticism even, judicial
 assassin of his king, but as profound politician as brave warrior.
 
 A thousand contrasts frequently crowd together, and these contrasts are
 in nature; they are no more astonishing than a fine day followed by
 storm.
 
 Men are equally mad everywhere; they have made the laws little by
 little, as gaps are repaired in a wall. Here eldest sons have taken all
 they could from younger sons, there younger sons share equally.
 Sometimes the Church has commanded the duel, sometimes she has
 anathematized it. The partisans and the enemies of Aristotle have each
 been excommunicated in their turn, as have those who wore long hair and
 those who wore short. In this world we have perfect law only to rule a
 species of madness called gaming. The rules of gaming are the only ones
 which admit neither exception, relaxation, variety nor tyranny. A man
 who has been a lackey, if he play at lansquenet with kings, is paid
 without difficulty if he win; everywhere else the law is a sword with
 which the stronger cut the weaker in pieces.
 
 Nevertheless, this world exists as if everything were well ordered; the
 irregularity is of our nature; our political world is like our globe, a
 misshapen thing which always preserves itself. It would be mad to wish
 that the mountains, the seas, the rivers, were traced in beautiful
 regular forms; it would be still more mad to ask perfect wisdom of men;
 it would be wishing to give wings to dogs or horns to eagles.
 
 
 
 
 _CORN_
 
 
 The Gauls had corn in Caesar's time: one is curious to know where they
 and the Teutons found it to sow. People answer you that the Tyrians had
 brought it into Spain, the Spaniards into Gaul, the Gauls into Germany.
 And where did the Tyrians get this corn? Among the Greeks probably, from
 whom they received it in exchange for their alphabet.
 
 Who had made this present to the Greeks? It was formerly Ceres without a
 doubt; and when one has gone back to Ceres one can hardly go farther.
 Ceres must have come down on purpose from the sky to give us wheat, rye,
 barley, etc.
 
 But as the credit of Ceres who gave the corn to the Greeks, and that of
 Isheth or Isis who bestowed it on the Egyptians, is very much fallen in
 these days, we remain in uncertainty as to the origin of corn.
 
 Sanchoniathon affirms that Dagon or Dagan, one of the grandsons of
 Thaut, had the control of corn in Phoenicia. Well, his Thaut is of
 about the same time as our Jared. From this it results that corn is very
 old, and that it is of the same antiquity as grass. Perhaps this Dagon
 was the first man to make bread, but that is not demonstrated.
 
 Strange thing! we know positively that it is to Noah that we are under
 an obligation for wine, and we do not know to whom we owe bread. And,
 still more strange thing, we are so ungrateful to Noah, that we have
 more than two thousand songs in honour of Bacchus, and we chant barely
 one in honour of Noah our benefactor.
 
 A Jew has assured me that corn came by itself in Mesopotamia, like the
 apples, wild pears, chestnuts, medlars in the West. I want to believe
 it until I am sure of the contrary; for corn must certainly grow
 somewhere. It has become the ordinary and indispensable food in the good
 climates, and throughout the North.
 
 Some great philosophers whose talents we esteem and whose systems we do
 not follow (Buffon) have claimed on page 195 of the "Natural History of
 the Dog," that mankind has made corn; that our fathers by virtue of
 sowing lolium and gramina changed them into wheat. As these philosophers
 are not of our opinion about shells, they will permit us not to be of
 theirs about corn. We do not believe that one has ever made tulips grow
 from jasmin. We find that the germ of corn is quite different from that
 of lolium, and we do not believe in any transmutation. When somebody
 shows it to us we will retract.
 
 Corn assuredly is not the food of the greater part of the world. Maize,
 tapioca, feed the whole of America. We have entire provinces where the
 peasants eat nothing but chestnut bread, more nourishing and of better
 flavour than that of rye and barley which so many people eat, and which
 is much better than the ration bread which is given to the soldier. The
 whole of southern Africa does not know of bread. The immense archipelago
 of the Indies, Siam, Laos, Pegu, Cochin China, Tonkin, a part of China,
 Japan, the coast of Malabar and Coromandel, the banks of the Ganges
 furnish a rice, the cultivation of which is much easier than that of
 wheat, and which causes it to be neglected. Corn is absolutely unknown
 for the space of fifteen hundred leagues on the coasts of the Glacial
 Sea. This food, to which we are accustomed, is among us so precious that
 the fear of seeing a dearth of it alone causes riots among the most
 subjugated peoples. The corn trade is everywhere one of the great
 objects of government; it is a part of our being, and yet this essential
 commodity is sometimes squandered ridiculously. The powder merchants use
 the best flour for covering the heads of our young men and women. But
 over three-quarters of the earth bread is not eaten at all. People
 maintain that the Ethiopians mocked at the Egyptians who lived on
 bread. But since it is our chief food, corn has become one of the great
 objects of trade and politics. So much has been written on this subject,
 that if a husbandman sowed as much corn as the weight of the volumes we
 have about this commodity, he might hope for the amplest harvest, and
 become richer than those who in their gilded and lacquered drawing-rooms
 ignore his exceeding labour and wretchedness.
 
 
 
 
 _CROMWELL_
 
 
 SECTION I
 
 Cromwell is painted as a man who was an impostor all his life. I have
 difficulty in believing it. I think that first of all he was an
 enthusiast, and that later he made even his fanaticism serve his
 greatness. A novice who is fervent at the age of twenty often becomes a
 skilful rogue at forty. In the great game of human life one begins by
 being a dupe, and one finishes by being a rogue. A statesman takes as
 almoner a monk steeped in the pettinesses of his monastery, devout,
 credulous, clumsy, quite new to the world: the monk learns, forms
 himself, intrigues, and supplants his master.
 
 Cromwell did not know at first whether he would be an ecclesiastic or a
 soldier. He was both. In 1622 he served a campaign in the army of
 Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, a great man, brother of two great
 men; and when he returned to England, he went into the service of Bishop
 Williams, and was his grace's theologian, while his grace passed as his
 wife's lover. His principles were those of the Puritans; thus he had to
 hate a bishop with all his heart, and not have a liking for kings. He
 was driven from Bishop Williams' house because he was a Puritan; and
 there is the origin of his fortune. The English Parliament declared
 itself against the throne and against the episcopacy; some of his
 friends in this parliament procured the nomination of a village for him.
 Only at this time did he begin to exist, and he was more than forty
 before he had ever made himself talked of. In vain was he conversant
 with Holy Writ, in vain did he argue about the rights of priests and
 deacons, and preach a few poor sermons and libels, he was ignored. I
 have seen one of his sermons which is very insipid, and which bears
 sufficient resemblance to the predications of the quakers; assuredly
 there is to be found there no trace of that persuasive eloquence with
 which later he carried the parliaments away. The reason is that in fact
 he was much more suited to public affairs than to the Church. It was
 above all in his tone and in his air that his eloquence consisted; a
 gesture of that hand that had won so many battles and killed so many
 royalists, was more persuasive than the periods of Cicero. It must be
 avowed that it was his incomparable bravery which made him known, and
 which led him by degrees to the pinnacle of greatness.
 
 He began by launching out as a volunteer who wished to make his fortune,
 in the town of Hull, besieged by the king. There he did many fine and
 happy actions, for which he received a gratification of about six
 thousand francs from the parliament. This present made by the parliament
 to an adventurer made it clear that the rebel party must prevail. The
 king was not in a position to give to his general officers what the
 parliament gave to volunteers. With money and fanaticism one is bound in
 the long run to be master of everything. Cromwell was made colonel. Then
 his great talents for war developed to the point that when the
 parliament created the Count of Manchester general of its armies, it
 made Cromwell lieutenant-general, without his having passed through the
 other ranks. Never did man appear more worthy of commanding; never were
 more activity and prudence, more boldness and more resource seen than in
 Cromwell. He is wounded at the battle of York; and while the first
 dressing is being put on his wound, he learns that his general,
 Manchester, is retiring, and that the battle is lost. He hastens to
 Manchester's side; he finds him fleeing with some officers; he takes him
 by the arm, and says to him with an air of confidence and grandeur: "You
 are mistaken, my lord; it is not on this side that the enemy is." He
 leads him back near the battlefield, rallies during the night more than
 twelve thousand men, speaks to them in the name of God, quotes Moses,
 Gideon and Joshua, at daybreak recommences the battle against the
 victorious royal army, and defeats it completely. Such a man had to
 perish or be master. Nearly all the officers of his army were
 enthusiasts who carried the New Testament at their saddle-bow: in the
 army as in the parliament men spoke only of making Babylon fall, of
 establishing the religion in Jerusalem, of shattering the colossus.
 Among so many madmen Cromwell ceased to be mad, and thought that it was
 better to govern them than to be governed by them. The habit of
 preaching as though he were inspired remained to him. Picture a fakir
 who has put an iron belt round his waist as a penitence, and who then
 takes off his belt to beat the other fakirs' ears: there you have
 Cromwell. He becomes as intriguing as he was intrepid; he associates
 himself with all the colonels of the army, and thus forms among the
 troops a republic which forces the commander-in-chief to resign. Another
 commander-in-chief is nominated, he disgusts him. He governs the army,
 and by it he governs the parliament; he puts this parliament in the
 necessity of making him commander-in-chief at last. All this was a great
 deal; but what is essential is that he wins all the battles he engages
 in in England, Scotland and Ireland; and he wins them, not in watching
 the fighting and in taking care of himself, but always by charging the
 enemy, rallying his troops, rushing everywhere, often wounded, killing
 many royalist officers with his own hand, like a desperate and
 infuriated grenadier.
 
 Amid this frightful war Cromwell made love; he went, his Bible under his
 arm, to sleep with the wife of his major-general, Lambert. She loved the
 Count of Holland, who was serving in the king's army. Cromwell took him
 prisoner in a battle, and enjoyed the pleasure of having his rival's
 head cut off. His maxim was to shed the blood of every important enemy,
 either on the field of battle, or by the executioner's hand. He always
 increased his power, by always daring to abuse it; the profundity of his
 plans took away nothing from his ferocious impetuosity. He goes into the
 House of Parliament and, taking his watch, which he threw on the ground
 and which he shattered to atoms: "I will break you," he said, "like this
 watch." He returns there some time after, drives all the members out one
 after the other, making them defile before him. Each is obliged, as he
 passes, to make him a deep bow: one of them passes with his hat on his
 head; Cromwell takes his hat from him and throws it on the ground:
 "Learn to respect me," he says.
 
 When he had outraged all kings by having his own legitimate king's head
 cut off, and when he started to reign himself, he sent his portrait to a
 crowned head; it was to Christine, Queen of Sweden. Marvell, a famous
 English poet, who wrote very good Latin verse, accompanied this portrait
 with six verses where he made Cromwell himself speak. Cromwell corrected
 the last two as follows:
 
      _At tibi submittit frontem reverentior umbra,
      Non sunt hi vultus regibus usque truces._
 
 This queen was the first to recognize him as soon as he was protector of
 the three kingdoms. Almost all the sovereigns of Europe sent their
 ambassadors _to their brother_ Cromwell, to this bishop's servant, who
 had just caused a sovereign, their own kin, to perish at the hand of the
 executioner. They vied with each in soliciting his alliance. Cardinal
 Mazarin, to please him, drove out of France the two sons of Charles I.,
 the two grandsons of Henry IV., the two first cousins of Louis XIV.
 France conquered Dunkirk for him, and sent him the keys. After his
 death, Louis XIV. and all his court wore mourning, excepting
 Mademoiselle, who had the courage to come to the company in a coloured
 habit, and alone maintained the honour of her race.
 
 Never was a king more absolute than he was. He said that he had
 preferred governing under the name of _protector_ rather than under that
 of _king_, because the English knew the point to which a King of
 England's prerogative extended, and did not know to what point a
 protector's might go. That was to understand men, who are governed by
 opinion, and whose opinion depends on a name. He had conceived a
 profound scorn for the religion which had served to his fortune. There
 is a certain anecdote preserved in the house of St. John, which proves
 sufficiently the little account which Cromwell made of the instrument
 which had produced such great effects in his hands. He was drinking one
 day with Ireton, Fleetwood and St. John, great-grandfather of the
 celebrated Lord Bolingbroke; they wished to uncork a bottle, and the
 corkscrew fell under the table; they all looked for it and did not find
 it. Meanwhile a deputation from the Presbyterian churches was waiting in
 the antechamber, and an usher came to announce them. "Tell them," said
 Cromwell, "that I have retired, _and that I am seeking the Lord_." It
 was the expression which the fanatics used when they were saying their
 prayers. When he had thus dismissed the band of ministers, he said these
 very words to his confidants: "Those puppies think that we are seeking
 the Lord, and we are only seeking the corkscrew."
 
 There is barely an example in Europe of any man who, come from so low,
 raised himself so high. But what was absolutely essential to him with
 all his talents? Fortune. He had this fortune; but was he happy? He
 lived poorly and anxiously until he was forty-three; from that time he
 bathed himself in blood, passed his life in turmoil, and died before his
 time at the age of fifty-seven. Let us compare this life with that of
 Newton, who lived eighty-four years, always tranquil, always honoured,
 always the light of all thinking beings, seeing increase each day his
 renown, his reputation, his fortune, without ever having either care or
 remorse; and let us judge which of the two had the better part.
 
 
 SECTION II
 
 Oliver Cromwell was regarded with admiration by the Puritans and
 independents of England; he is still their hero; but Richard Cromwell,
 his son, is my man.
 
 The first is a fanatic who would be hissed to-day in the House of
 Commons, if he uttered there one single one of the unintelligible
 absurdities which he gave out with so much confidence before other
 fanatics who listened to him open-mouthed and wide-eyed, in the name of
 the Lord. If he said that one must seek the Lord, and fight the Lord's
 battles; if he introduced the Jewish jargon into the parliament of
 England, to the eternal shame of the human intelligence, he would be
 nearer to being led to Bedlam than to being chosen to command armies.
 
 He was brave without a doubt; so are wolves; there are even monkeys as
 fierce as tigers. From being a fanatic he became an adroit politician,
 that is to say that from a wolf he became fox, climbed by imposture from
 the first steps where the infuriated enthusiasm of the times had placed
 him, right to the pinnacle of greatness; and the impostor walked on the
 heads of the prostrated fanatics. He reigned, but he lived in the
 horrors of anxiety. He knew neither serene days nor tranquil nights. The
 consolations of friendship and society never approached him; he died
 before his time, more worthy, without a doubt, of execution than the
 king whom he had conducted from a window of his own palace to the
 scaffold.
 
 Richard Cromwell, on the contrary, born with a gentle, wise spirit,
 refused to keep his father's crown at the price of the blood of two or
 three rebels whom he could sacrifice to his ambition. He preferred to be
 reduced to private life rather than be an omnipotent assassin. He left
 the protectorate without regret to live as a citizen. Free and tranquil
 in the country, he enjoyed health there, and there did he possess his
 soul in peace for eighty-six years, loved by his neighbours, to whom he
 was arbiter and father.
 
 Readers, give your verdict. If you had to choose between the destiny of
 the father and that of the son, which would you take?
 
 
 
 
 _CUSTOMS_
 
 CONTEMPTIBLE CUSTOMS DO NOT ALWAYS SUPPOSE A CONTEMPTIBLE NATION
 
 
 There are cases where one must not judge a nation by its customs and
 popular superstitions. I suppose that Caesar, having conquered Egypt,
 wanting to make trade flourish in the Roman Empire, has sent an embassy
 to China, by the port of Arsinoe, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean. The
 Emperor Yventi, first of his name, was then reigning; the annals of
 China represent him as a very wise and learned prince. After receiving
 Caesar's ambassadors with all the Chinese politeness, he informs himself
 secretly through his interpreters of the customs, science and religion
 of this Roman people, as celebrated in the West as the Chinese people is
 in the East. He learns first of all that this people's pontiffs have
 arranged their year in so absurd a fashion that the sun has already the
 heavenly signs of spring when the Romans are celebrating the first
 festivals of winter.
 
 He learns that this nation supports at great cost a college of priests
 who know exactly the time when one should set sail and when one should
 give battle, by inspecting an ox's liver, or by the way in which the
 chickens eat barley. This sacred science was brought formerly to the
 Romans by a little god named Tages, who emerged from the earth in
 Tuscany. These peoples worship one supreme God whom they always call the
 very great and very good God. Nevertheless, they have built a temple to
 a courtesan named Flora; and almost all the good women of Rome have in
 their homes little household gods four or five inches high. One of
 these little divinities is the goddess of the breasts; the other the
 goddess of the buttocks. There is a household god who is called the god
 Pet. The emperor Yventi starts laughing: the tribunals of Nankin think
 first of all with him that the Roman ambassadors are madmen or impostors
 who have taken the title of envoys of the Roman Republic; but as the
 emperor is as just as he is polite, he has private talks with the
 ambassadors. He learns that the Roman pontiffs have been very ignorant,
 but that Caesar is now reforming the calendar; they admit to him that the
 college of augurs was established in early barbarous times; that this
 ridiculous institution, become dear to a people long uncivilized, has
 been allowed to subsist; that all honest people laugh at the augurs;
 that Caesar has never consulted them; that according to a very great man
 named Cato, never has an augur been able to speak to his comrade without
 laughter; and that finally Cicero, the greatest orator and the best
 philosopher in Rome, has just written against the augurs a little work
 entitled "Of Divination," in which he commits to eternal ridicule all
 the soothsayers, all the predictions, and all the sorcery of which the
 world is infatuated. The emperor of China is curious to read Cicero's
 book, the interpreters translate it; he admires the book and the Roman
 Republic.
 
 
 
 
 _DEMOCRACY_
 
 
 Ordinarily there is no comparison between the crimes of the great who
 are always ambitious, and the crimes of the people who always want, and
 can want only liberty and equality. These two sentiments, Liberty and
 Equality, do not lead direct to calumny, rapine, assassination,
 poisoning, the devastation of one's neighbours' lands, etc.; but
 ambitious might and the mania for power plunge into all these crimes
 whatever be the time, whatever be the place.
 
 Popular government is in itself, therefore, less iniquitous, less
 abominable than despotic power.
 
 The great vice of democracy is certainly not tyranny and cruelty: there
 have been mountain-dwelling republicans, savage, ferocious; but it is
 not the republican spirit that made them so, it is nature.
 
 The real vice of a civilized republic is in the Turkish fable of the
 dragon with many heads and the dragon with many tails. The many heads
 hurt each other, and the many tails obey a single head which wants to
 devour everything.
 
 Democracy seems suitable only to a very little country, and further it
 must be happily situated. Small though it be, it will make many
 mistakes, because it will be composed of men. Discord will reign there
 as in a monastery; but there will be no St. Bartholomew, no Irish
 massacres, no Sicilian vespers, no inquisition, no condemnation to the
 galleys for having taken some water from the sea without paying for it,
 unless one supposes this republic composed of devils in a corner of
 hell.
 
 One questions every day whether a republican government is preferable to
 a king's government? The dispute ends always by agreeing that to govern
 men is very difficult. The Jews had God Himself for master; see what has
 happened to them on that account: nearly always have they been beaten
 and slaves, and to-day do you not find that they cut a pretty figure?
 
 
 
 
 _DESTINY_
 
 
 Of all the books of the Occident which have come down to us, the most
 ancient is Homer; it is there that one finds the customs of profane
 antiquity, of the gross heroes, of the gross gods, made in the image of
 men; but it is there that among the reveries and inconsequences, one
 finds too the seeds of philosophy, and above all the idea of the destiny
 which is master of the gods, as the gods are masters of the world.
 
 When the magnanimous Hector wishes absolutely to fight the magnanimous
 Achilles, and with this object starts fleeing with all his might, and
 three times makes the circuit of the city before fighting, in order to
 have more vigour; when Homer compares fleet-of-foot Achilles, who
 pursues him, to a man who sleeps; when Madame Dacier goes into ecstasies
 of admiration over the art and mighty sense of this passage, then
 Jupiter wants to save great Hector who has made so many sacrifices to
 him, and he consults the fates; he weighs the destinies of Hector and
 Achilles in the balance (Iliad, liv. xxii.): he finds that the Trojan
 must absolutely be killed by the Greek; he cannot oppose it; and from
 this moment, Apollo, Hector's guardian genius, is forced to abandon him.
 It is not that Homer is not often prodigal, and particularly in this
 place, of quite contrary ideas, following the privilege of antiquity;
 but he is the first in whom one finds the notion of destiny. This
 notion, therefore, was very much in vogue in his time.
 
 The Pharisees, among the little Jewish people, did not adopt destiny
 until several centuries later; for these Pharisees themselves, who were
 the first literates among the Jews, were very new fangled. In
 Alexandria they mixed a part of the dogmas of the Stoics with the old
 Jewish ideas. St. Jerome claims even that their sect is not much
 anterior to the Christian era.
 
 The philosophers never had need either of Homer or the Pharisees to
 persuade themselves that everything happens through immutable laws, that
 everything is arranged, that everything is a necessary effect. This is
 how they argued.
 
 Either the world exists by its own nature, by its physical laws, or a
 supreme being has formed it according to his supreme laws: in both
 cases, these laws are immutable; in both cases everything is necessary;
 heavy bodies tend towards the centre of the earth, without being able to
 tend to pause in the air. Pear-trees can never bear pineapples. A
 spaniel's instinct cannot be an ostrich's instinct; everything is
 arranged, in gear, limited.
 
 Man can have only a certain number of teeth, hair and ideas; there comes
 a time when he necessarily loses his teeth, hair and ideas.
 
 It would be a contradiction that what was yesterday was not, that what
 is to-day is not; it is also a contradiction that what must be cannot
 be.
 
 If you could disturb the destiny of a fly, there would be no reason that
 could stop your making the destiny of all the other flies, of all the
 other animals, of all men, of all nature; you would find yourself in the
 end more powerful than God.
 
 Imbeciles say: "My doctor has extricated my aunt from a mortal malady;
 he has made my aunt live ten years longer than she ought to have lived."
 Others who affect knowledge, say: "The prudent man makes his own
 destiny."
 
 But often the prudent, far from making their destinies, succumb to them;
 it is destiny which makes them prudent.
 
 Profound students of politics affirm that, if Cromwell, Ludlow, Ireton
 and a dozen other parliamentarians had been assassinated a week before
 Charles I.'s head was cut off, this king might have lived longer and
 died in his bed; they are right; they can add further that if the whole
 of England had been swallowed up in the sea, this monarch would not
 have perished on a scaffold near Whitehall; but things were arranged so
 that Charles had to have his neck severed.
 
 Cardinal d'Ossat was doubtless more prudent than a madman in Bedlam; but
 is it not clear that the organs of d'Ossat the sage were made otherwise
 than those of the scatter-brain? just as a fox's organs are different
 from a stork's and a lark's.
 
 Your doctor saved your aunt; but assuredly he did not in that contradict
 nature's order; he followed it. It is clear that your aunt could not
 stop herself being born in such and such town, that she could not stop
 herself having a certain malady at a particular time, that the doctor
 could not be elsewhere than in the town where he was, that your aunt had
 to call him, that he had to prescribe for her the drugs which cured her,
 or which one thinks cured her, when nature was the only doctor.
 
 A peasant thinks that it has hailed on his field by chance; but the
 philosopher knows that there is no chance, and that it was impossible,
 in the constitution of this world, for it not to hail on that day in
 that place.
 
 There are persons who, frightened by this truth, admit half of it as
 debtors who offer half to their creditors, and ask respite for the rest.
 "There are," they say, "some events which are necessary, and others
 which are not." It would be very comic that one part of the world was
 arranged, and that the other were not; that a part of what happens had
 to happen, and that another part of what happens did not have to happen.
 If one looks closely at it, one sees that the doctrine contrary to that
 of destiny is absurd; but there are many people destined to reason
 badly, others not to reason at all, others to persecute those who
 reason.
 
 Some say to you: "Do not believe in fatalism; for then everything
 appearing inevitable, you will work at nothing, you will wallow in
 indifference, you will love neither riches, nor honours, nor glory; you
 will not want to acquire anything, you will believe yourself without
 merit as without power; no talent will be cultivated, everything will
 perish through apathy."
 
 Be not afraid, gentlemen, we shall ever have passions and prejudices,
 since it is our destiny to be subjected to prejudices and passions: we
 shall know that it no more depends on us to have much merit and great
 talent, than to have a good head of hair and beautiful hands: we shall
 be convinced that we must not be vain about anything, and yet we shall
 always have vanity.
 
 I necessarily have the passion for writing this, and you have the
 passion for condemning me; both of us are equally fools, equally the
 toys of destiny. Your nature is to do harm, mine is to love truth, and
 to make it public in spite of you.
 
 The owl, which feeds on mice in its ruins, said to the nightingale:
 "Finish singing under your beautiful shady trees, come into my hole,
 that I may eat you"; and the nightingale answered: "I was born to sing
 here, and to laugh at you."
 
 You ask me what will become of liberty? I do not understand you. I do
 not know what this liberty is of which you speak; so long have you been
 disputing about its nature, that assuredly you are not acquainted with
 it. If you wish, or rather, if you are able to examine peaceably with me
 what it is, pass to the letter L.
 
 
 
 
 _DEVOUT_
 
 
 The word "devout" signifies "devoted"; and in the strict sense of the
 term this qualification should belong only to monks and nuns who make
 vows. But as in the Gospel there is no more mention of vows than of
 devout persons, this title does not in fact belong to anyone. Everyone
 should be equally righteous. A man who styles himself devout resembles a
 commoner who styles himself a marquis; he arrogates to himself a quality
 he does not possess. He thinks himself more worthy than his neighbour.
 One can forgive such foolishness in women; their frailty and their
 frivolity render them excusable; the poor creatures pass from a lover to
 a director in good faith: but one cannot pardon the rogues who direct
 them, who abuse their ignorance, who establish the throne of their pride
 on the credulity of the sex. They resolve themselves into a little
 mystic seraglio composed of seven or eight aged beauties, subdued by the
 weight of their lack of occupation, and almost always do these persons
 pay tribute to their new masters. No young woman without a lover, no
 aged devout woman without a director. Oh! the Orientals are wiser than
 we are! Never does a pasha say: "We supped yesterday with the Aga of the
 Janissaries who is my sister's lover, and the vicar of the mosque who is
 my wife's director."
 
 
 
 
 _THE ECCLESIASTICAL MINISTRY_
 
 
 The institution of religion exists only to keep mankind in order, and to
 make men merit the goodness of God by their virtue. Everything in a
 religion which does not tend towards this goal must be considered
 foreign or dangerous.
 
 Instruction, exhortation, menaces of pains to come, promises of immortal
 beatitude, prayers, counsels, spiritual help are the only means
 ecclesiastics may use to try to make men virtuous here below, and happy
 for eternity.
 
 All other means are repugnant to the liberty of the reason, to the
 nature of the soul, to the inalterable rights of the conscience, to the
 essence of religion and of the ecclesiastical ministry, to all the
 rights of the sovereign.
 
 Virtue supposes liberty, as the carrying of a burden supposes active
 force. Under coercion no virtue, and without virtue no religion. Make a
 slave of me, I shall be no better for it.
 
 The sovereign even has no right to use coercion to lead men to religion,
 which supposes essentially choice and liberty. My thought is subordinate
 to authority no more than is sickness or health.
 
 In order to disentangle all the contradictions with which books on canon
 law have been filled, and to fix our ideas on the ecclesiastical
 ministry, let us investigate amid a thousand equivocations what the
 Church is.
 
 The Church is the assembly of all the faithful summoned on certain days
 to pray in common, and at all times to do good actions.
 
 The priests are persons established under the authority of the sovereign
 to direct these prayers and all religious worship.
 
 A numerous Church could not exist without ecclesiastics; but these
 ecclesiastics are not the Church.
 
 It is no less evident that if the ecclesiastics, who are part of civil
 society, had acquired rights which might trouble or destroy society,
 these rights ought to be suppressed.
 
 It is still more evident that, if God has attached to the Church
 prerogatives or rights, neither these rights nor these prerogatives
 should belong exclusively either to the chief of the Church or to the
 ecclesiastics, because they are not the Church, just as the magistrates
 are not the sovereign in either a democratic state or in a monarchy.
 
 Finally, it is quite evident that it is our souls which are under the
 clergy's care, solely for spiritual things.
 
 Our soul acts internally; internal acts are thought, volition,
 inclinations, acquiescence in certain truths. All these acts are above
 all coercion, and are within the ecclesiastical minister's sphere only
 in so far as he must instruct and never command.
 
 This soul acts also externally. External actions are under the civil
 law. Here coercion may have a place; temporal or corporal pains maintain
 the law by punishing those who infringe it.
 
 Obedience to ecclesiastical order must consequently always be free and
 voluntary: no other should be possible. Submission, on the other hand,
 to civil order may be coerced and compulsory.
 
 For the same reason, ecclesiastical punishments, always spiritual, do
 not reach here below any but those who are convinced inwardly of their
 fault. Civil pains, on the contrary, accompanied by a physical ill, have
 their physical effects, whether or no the guilty recognize their
 justice.
 
 From this it results obviously that the authority of the clergy is and
 can be spiritual only; that it should not have any temporal power; that
 no coercive force is proper to its ministry, which would be destroyed by
 it.
 
 It follows from this further that the sovereign, careful not to suffer
 any partition of his authority, must permit no enterprise which puts
 the members of society in external and civil dependence on an
 ecclesiastical body.
 
 Such are the incontestable principles of real canon law, of which the
 rules and decisions should be judged at all times by the eternal and
 immutable truths which are founded on natural law and the necessary
 order of society.
 
 
 
 
 _EMBLEM_
 
 
 In antiquity everything is symbol or emblem. In Chaldea it starts by
 putting a ram, two kids, a bull in the sky, to mark the productions of
 the earth in the spring. Fire is the symbol of the Deity in Persia; the
 celestial dog warns the Egyptians of the Nile floods; the serpent which
 hides its tail in its head, becomes the image of eternity. The whole of
 nature is represented and disguised.
 
 In India again you find many of those old statues, uncouth and
 frightful, of which we have already spoken, representing virtue provided
 with ten great arms with which to combat vice, and which our poor
 missionaries have taken for the picture of the devil.
 
 Put all these symbols of antiquity before the eyes of a man of the
 soundest sense, who has never heard speak of them, he will not
 understand anything: it is a language to be learned.
 
 The old theological poets were in the necessity of giving God eyes,
 hands, feet; of announcing Him in the form of a man. St. Clement of
 Alexandria records some verses of Xenophanes the Colophonian (Stromates
 liv. v.), from which one sees that it is not merely from to-day that men
 have made God in their own image. Orpheus of Thrace, the first
 theologian of the Greeks, long before Homer, expresses himself
 similarly, according to the same Clement of Alexandria.
 
 Everything being symbol and emblem, the philosophers, and especially
 those who had travelled in India, employed this method; their precepts
 were emblems and enigmas.
 
 _Do not stir the fire with a sword_, that is, do not irritate angry
 men.
 
 _Do not hide the light under the bushel._--Do not hide the truth from
 men.
 
 _Abstain from beans._--Flee frequently public assemblies in which one
 gave one's suffrage with black or white beans.
 
 _Do not have swallows in your house._--That it may not be filled with
 chatterers.
 
 _In the tempest worship the echo._--In times of public trouble retire to
 the country.
 
 _Do not write on the snow._--Do not teach feeble and sluggish minds.
 
 _Do not eat either your heart or your brain._--Do not give yourself up
 to either grief or to too difficult enterprises, etc.
 
 Such are the maxims of Pythagoras, the sense of which is not hard to
 understand.
 
 The most beautiful of all the emblems is that of God, whom Timaeus of
 Locres represents by this idea: _A circle the centre of which is
 everywhere and the circumference nowhere._ Plato adopted this emblem;
 Pascal had inserted it among the material which he intended using, and
 which has been called his "Thoughts."
 
 In metaphysics, in moral philosophy, the ancients have said everything.
 We coincide with them, or we repeat them. All modern books of this kind
 are only repetitions.
 
 It is above all among the Indians, the Egyptians, the Syrians, that
 these emblems, which to us appear most strange, were consecrated. It is
 there that the two organs of generation, the two symbols of life, were
 carried in procession with the greatest respect. We laugh at it, we dare
 treat these peoples as barbarous idiots, because they innocently thanked
 God for having given them existence. What would they have said if they
 had seen us enter our temples with the instrument of destruction at our
 side?
 
 At Thebes the sins of the people were represented by a goat. On the
 coast of Phoenicia a naked woman, with a fish's tail, was the emblem
 of nature.
 
 One must not be astonished, therefore, if this use of symbols reached
 the Hebrews when they had formed a body of people near the Syrian
 desert.
 
 One of the most beautiful emblems of the Judaic books is this passage of
 Ecclesiastes: "... when the grinders cease because they are few, and
 those that look out of the windows be darkened, when the almond-tree
 shall flourish and the grasshopper shall be a burden: or ever the silver
 cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken
 at the fountain...."
 
 That signifies that the old men lose their teeth, that their sight is
 dim, that their hair whitens like the flower of the almond-tree, that
 their feet swell like the grasshopper, that they are no more fit for
 engendering children, and that then they must prepare for the great
 journey.
 
 The "Song of Songs" is (as one knows) a continual emblem of the marriage
 of Jesus Christ with the Church. It is an emblem from beginning to end.
 Especially does the ingenious Dom Calmet demonstrate that the palm-tree
 to which the well-beloved goes is the cross to which our Lord Jesus
 Christ was condemned. But it must be avowed that a pure and healthy
 moral philosophy is still preferable to these allegories.
 
 One sees in this people's books a crowd of typical emblems which revolt
 us to-day and which exercise our incredulity and our mockery, but which
 appeared ordinary and simple to the Asiatic peoples.
 
 In Ezekiel are images which appear to us as licentious and revolting: in
 those times they were merely natural. There are thirty examples in the
 "Song of Songs," model of the most chaste union. Remark carefully that
 these expressions, these images are always quite serious, and that in no
 book of this distant antiquity will you find the least mockery on the
 great subject of generation. When lust is condemned it is in definite
 terms; but never to excite to passion, nor to make the smallest
 pleasantry. This far-distant antiquity did not have its Martial, its
 Catullus, or its Petronius.
 
 It results from all the Jewish prophets and from all the Jewish books,
 as from all the books which instruct us in the usages of the Chaldeans,
 the Persians, the Phoenicians, the Syrians, the Indians, the
 Egyptians; it results, I say, that their customs were not ours, that
 this ancient world in no way resembled our world. Go from Gibraltar to
 Mequinez merely, the manners are no longer the same; no longer does one
 find the same ideas; two leagues of sea have changed everything.
 
 
 
 
 _ON THE ENGLISH THEATRE_
 
 
 I have cast my eyes on an edition of Shakespeare issued by Master Samuel
 Johnson. I saw there that foreigners who are astonished that in the
 plays of the great Shakespeare a Roman senator plays the buffoon, and
 that a king appears on the stage drunk, are treated as little-minded. I
 do not desire to suspect Master Johnson of being a sorry jester, and of
 being too fond of wine; but I find it somewhat extraordinary that he
 counts buffoonery and drunkenness among the beauties of the tragic
 stage: and no less singular is the reason he gives, that the poet
 disdains accidental distinctions of circumstance and country, like a
 painter who, content with having painted the figure, neglects the
 drapery. The comparison would be more just if he were speaking of a
 painter who in a noble subject should introduce ridiculous grotesques,
 should paint Alexander the Great mounted on an ass in the battle of
 Arbela, and Darius' wife drinking at an inn with rapscallions.
 
 But there is one thing more extraordinary than all, that is that
 Shakespeare is a genius. The Italians, the French, the men of letters of
 all other countries, who have not spent some time in England, take him
 only for a clown, for a joker far inferior to Harlequin, for the most
 contemptible buffoon who has ever amused the populace. Nevertheless, it
 is in this same man that one finds pieces which exalt the imagination
 and which stir the heart to its depths. It is Truth, it is Nature
 herself who speaks her own language with no admixture of artifice. It is
 of the sublime, and the author has in no wise sought it.
 
 What can one conclude from this contrast of grandeur and sordidness, of
 sublime reason and uncouth folly, in short from all the contrasts that
 we see in Shakespeare? That he would have been a perfect poet had he
 lived in the time of Addison.
 
 The famous Addison, who flourished under Queen Anne, is perhaps of all
 English writers the one who best knew how to guide genius with taste. He
 had a correct style, an imagination discreet in expression, elegance,
 strength and simplicity in his verse and in his prose. A friend of
 propriety and orderliness, he wanted tragedy to be written with dignity,
 and it is thus that his "Cato" is composed.
 
 From the very first act the verses are worthy of Virgil, and the
 sentiments worthy of Cato. There is no theatre in Europe where the scene
 of Juba and Syphax was not applauded as a masterpiece of skill, of
 well-developed characters, of fine contrasts, and of pure and noble
 diction. Literary Europe, which knows the translations of this piece,
 applauded even to the philosophic traits with which the role of Cato is
 filled.
 
 The piece had the great success which its beauty of detail merited, and
 which was assured to it by the troubles in England to which this tragedy
 was in more than one place a striking allusion. But the appositeness of
 these allusions having passed, the verse being only beautiful, the
 maxims being only noble and just, and the piece being cold, people no
 longer felt anything more than the coldness. Nothing is more beautiful
 than Virgil's second canto; recite it on the stage, it will bore: on the
 stage one must have passion, live dialogue, action. People soon returned
 to Shakespeare's uncouth but captivating aberrations.
 
 
 
 
 _ENVY_
 
 
 One knows well enough what antiquity has said of this shameful passion,
 and what the moderns have repeated. Hesiod is the first classic author
 who speaks of it.
 
 "The potter is envious of the potter, the artisan of the artisan, the
 poor man even of the poor man, the musician of the musician (or if one
 would give another sense to the word _Aoidos_) the poet of the poet."
 
 Long before Hesiod, Job had said: "Envy slayeth the silly one" (Job.
 chap. v. verse 2).
 
 I think that Mandeville, author of the "Fable of the Bees," was the
 first to try to prove that envy is a very good thing, a very useful
 passion. His first reason is that envy is as natural to man as hunger
 and thirst; that it can be found in children, as well as in horses and
 dogs. Do you want your children to hate each other, kiss one more than
 the other; the secret is infallible.
 
 He maintains that the first thing that two young women meeting each
 other do is to cast about for what is ridiculous in each other, and the
 second to flatter each other.
 
 He believes that without envy the arts would be indifferently
 cultivated, and that Raphael would not have been a great painter if he
 had not been jealous of Michael Angelo.
 
 Mandeville has taken emulation for envy, maybe; maybe, also, emulation
 is only envy kept within the bounds of decency.
 
 Michael Angelo might say to Raphael: "Your envy has only led you to work
 still better than me; you have not decried me, you have not intrigued
 against me with the Pope, you have not tried to have me excommunicated
 for having put cripples and one-eyed men in paradise, and succulent
 cardinals with beautiful women naked as your hand in hell, in my picture
 of the last judgment. Your envy is very praiseworthy; you are a fine
 envious fellow; let us be good friends."
 
 But if the envious man is a wretch without talent, jealous of merit as
 beggars are of the rich; if, pressed by the indigence as by the
 turpitude of his character he writes you some "News from Parnassus,"
 some "Letters of Madame la Comtesse," some "Annees Litteraires," this
 animal displays an envy that is good for nothing, and for which
 Mandeville could never make an apology.
 
 One asks why the ancients thought that the eye of the envious man
 bewitched those who looked at it. It is the envious, rather, who are
 bewitched.
 
 Descartes says: "That envy impels the yellow bile which comes from the
 lower part of the liver, and the black bile which comes from the spleen,
 which is diffused from the heart through the arteries, etc." But as no
 kind of bile is formed in the spleen, Descartes, by speaking thus, does
 not seem to merit too much that his natural philosophy should be envied.
 
 A certain Voet or Voetius, a theological scamp, who accused Descartes of
 atheism, was very ill with the black bile; but he knew still less than
 Descartes how his detestable bile was diffused in his blood.
 
 Madame Pernelle is right: "The envious will die, but envy never."
 (Tartufe, Act v, Scene iii.)
 
 But it is good proverb which says that "it is better to be envious than
 to have pity." Let us be envious, therefore, as hard as we can.
 
 
 
 
 _EQUALITY_
 
 
 SECTION I
 
 It is clear that men, enjoying the faculties connected with their
 nature, are equal; they are equal when they perform animal functions,
 and when they exercise their understanding. The King of China, the Great
 Mogul, the Padisha of Turkey, cannot say to the least of men: "I forbid
 you to digest, to go to the privy and to think." All the animals of each
 species are equal among themselves. Animals by nature have over us the
 advantage of independence. If a bull which is wooing a heifer is driven
 away with the blows of the horns by a stronger bull, it goes in search
 of another mistress in another field, and lives free. A cock, beaten by
 a cock, consoles itself in another poultry-house. It is not so with us.
 A little vizier exiles a bostangi to Lemnos: the vizier Azem exiles the
 little vizier to Tenedos: the padisha exiles the little vizier Azem to
 Rhodes: the Janissaries put the padisha in prison, and elect another who
 will exile good Mussulmans as he chooses; people will still be very
 obliged to him if he limits his sacred authority to this little
 exercise.
 
 If this world were what it seems it should be, if man could find
 everywhere in it an easy subsistence, and a climate suitable to his
 nature, it is clear that it would be impossible for one man to enslave
 another. If this globe were covered with wholesome fruits; if the air,
 which should contribute to our life, gave us no diseases and a premature
 death; if man had no need of lodging and bed other than those of the
 buck and the deer; then the Gengis-kans and the Tamerlans would have no
 servants other than their children, who would be folk honourable enough
 to help them in their old age.
 
 In the natural state enjoyed by all untamed quadrupeds, birds and
 reptiles, man would be as happy as they; domination would then be a
 chimera, an absurdity of which no one would think; for why seek servants
 when you have no need of their service?
 
 If it came into the head of some individual of tyrannous mind and brawny
 arm to enslave a neighbour less strong than he, the thing would be
 impossible; the oppressed would be on the Danube before the oppressor
 had taken his measures on the Volga.
 
 All men would then be necessarily equal, if they were without needs; the
 poverty connected with our species subordinates one man to another; it
 is not the inequality which is the real misfortune, it is the
 dependence. It matters very little that So-and-so calls himself "His
 Highness," and So-and-so "His Holiness"; but to serve the one or the
 other is hard.
 
 A big family has cultivated fruitful soil; two little families near by
 have thankless and rebellious fields; the two poor families have to
 serve the opulent family, or slaughter it: there is no difficulty in
 that. One of the two indigent families offers its arms to the rich
 family in order to have bread; the other goes to attack it and is
 beaten. The serving family is the origin of the servants and the
 workmen; the beaten family is the origin of the slaves.
 
 In our unhappy world it is impossible for men living in society not to
 be divided into two classes, the one the rich that commands, the other
 the poor that serves; and these two are subdivided into a thousand, and
 these thousand still have different gradations.
 
 When the prizes are drawn you come to us: "I am a man like you," you
 say. "I have two hands and two feet, as much pride as you, nay more, a
 mind as disordered, at least, as inconsequent, as contradictory as
 yours. I am a citizen of San Marino, or of Ragusa, or Vaugirard: give
 me my share of the land. In our known hemisphere there are about fifty
 thousand million arpents to cultivate, some passable, some sterile. We
 are only about a thousand million featherless bipeds in this continent;
 that makes fifty arpents apiece: be just; give me my fifty arpents."
 
 "Go and take them in the land of the Cafres," we answer, "or the
 Hottentots, or the Samoyedes; come to an amicable arrangement with them;
 here all the shares are taken. If among us you want to eat, be clothed,
 lodged, warmed, work for us as your father did; serve us or amuse us,
 and you will be paid; otherwise you will be obliged to ask charity,
 which would be too degrading to your sublime nature, and would stop your
 being really the equal of kings, and even of country parsons, according
 to the pretensions of your noble pride."
 
 
 SECTION II
 
 All the poor are not unhappy. The majority were born in that state, and
 continual work stops their feeling their position too keenly; but when
 they feel it, then one sees wars, like that of the popular party against
 the senate party in Rome, like those of the peasants in Germany, England
 and France. All these wars finish sooner or later with the subjection of
 the people, because the powerful have money, and money is master of
 everything in a state: I say in a state; for it is not the same between
 nations. The nation which makes the best use of the sword will always
 subjugate the nation which has more gold and less courage.
 
 All men are born with a sufficiently violent liking for domination,
 wealth and pleasure, and with much taste for idleness; consequently, all
 men want their money and the wives or daughters of others, to be their
 master, to subject them to all their caprices, and to do nothing, or at
 least to do only very agreeable things. You see clearly that with these
 fine inclinations it is as impossible for men to be equal as it is
 impossible for two predicants or two professors of theology not to be
 jealous of each other.
 
 The human race, such as it is, cannot subsist unless there is an
 infinity of useful men who possess nothing at all; for it is certain
 that a man who is well off will not leave his own land to come to till
 yours; and if you have need of a pair of shoes, it is not the Secretary
 to the Privy Council who will make them for you. Equality, therefore, is
 at once the most natural thing and the most fantastic.
 
 As men go to excess in everything when they can, this inequality has
 been exaggerated. It has been maintained in many countries that it was
 not permissible for a citizen to leave the country where chance has
 caused him to be born; the sense of this law is visibly: "This land is
 so bad and so badly governed, that we forbid any individual to leave it,
 for fear that everyone will leave it." Do better: make all your subjects
 want to live in your country, and foreigners to come to it.
 
 All men have the right in the bottom of their hearts to think themselves
 entirely equal to other men: it does not follow from that that the
 cardinal's cook should order his master to prepare him his dinner; but
 the cook can say: "I am a man like my master; like him I was born
 crying; like me he will die with the same pangs and the same ceremonies.
 Both of us perform the same animal functions. If the Turks take
 possession of Rome, and if then I am cardinal and my master cook, I
 shall take him into my service." This discourse is reasonable and just;
 but while waiting for the Great Turk to take possession of Rome, the
 cook must do his duty, or else all human society is perverted.
 
 As regards a man who is neither a cardinal's cook, nor endowed with any
 other employment in the state; as regards a private person who is
 connected with nothing, but who is vexed at being received everywhere
 with an air of being patronized or scorned, who sees quite clearly that
 many _monsignors_ have no more knowledge, wit or virtue than he, and who
 at times is bored at waiting in their antechambers, what should he
 decide to do? Why, to take himself off.
 
 
 
 
 _EXPIATION_
 
 
 Maybe the most beautiful institution of antiquity is that solemn
 ceremony which repressed crimes by warning that they must be punished,
 and which calmed the despair of the guilty by making them atone for
 their transgressions by penitences. Remorse must necessarily have
 preceded the expiations; for the maladies are older than the medicine,
 and all needs have existed before relief.
 
 It was, therefore, before all the creeds, a natural religion, which
 troubled man's heart when in his ignorance or in his hastiness he had
 committed an inhuman action. A friend killed his friend in a quarrel, a
 brother killed his brother, a jealous and frantic lover even killed her
 without whom he could not live. The head of a nation condemned a
 virtuous man, a useful citizen. These are men in despair, if they have
 sensibility. Their conscience harries them; nothing is more true; and it
 is the height of unhappiness. Only two choices remain, either
 reparation, or a settling in crime. All sensitive souls choose the
 first, monsters choose the second.
 
 As soon as religions were established, there were expiations; the
 ceremonies accompanying them were ridiculous: for what connection
 between the water of the Ganges and a murder? how could a man repair a
 homicide by bathing himself? We have already remarked this excess of
 aberration and absurdity, of imagining that he who washes his body
 washes his soul, and wipes away the stains of bad actions.
 
 The water of the Nile had later the same virtue as the water of the
 Ganges: to these purifications other ceremonies were added: I avow that
 they were still more impertinent. The Egyptians took two goats, and drew
 lots for which of the two should be thrown below, charged with the sins
 of the guilty. The name of "Hazazel," the expiator, was given to this
 goat. What connection, I ask you, between a goat and a man's crime?
 
 It is true that since, God permitted this ceremony to be sanctified
 among the Jews our fathers, who took so many Egyptian rites; but
 doubtless it was the repentance, and not the goat, which purified the
 Jewish souls.
 
 Jason, having killed Absyrthe his step-brother, comes, it is said, with
 Medea, more guilty than he, to have himself absolved by Circe, queen and
 priestess of Aea, who ever after passed for a great magician. Circe
 absolves them with a sucking-pig and salt cakes. That may make a fairly
 good dish, but can barely either pay for Absyrthe's blood or render
 Jason and Medea more honourable people, unless they avow a sincere
 repentance while eating their sucking-pig.
 
 Orestes' expiation (he had avenged his father by murdering his mother)
 was to go to steal a statue from the Tartars of Crimea. The statue must
 have been very badly made, and there was nothing to gain on such an
 effect. Since then we have done better, we have invented the mysteries;
 the guilty might there receive their absolution by undergoing painful
 ordeals, and by swearing that they would lead a new life. It is from
 this oath that the new members were called among all nations by a name
 which corresponds to initiates, _qui ineunt vitam novam_, who began a
 new career, who entered into the path of virtue.
 
 The Christian catechumens were called _initiates_ only when they were
 baptised.
 
 It is undoubted that in these mysteries one was washed of one's faults
 only by the oath to be virtuous; that is so true that the hierophant in
 all the Greek mysteries, in sending away the assembly, pronounced these
 two Egyptian words--"_Koth_, _ompheth_, watch, be pure"; which is a
 proof at once that the mysteries came originally from Egypt, and that
 they were invented only to make men better.
 
 The sages in all times did what they could, therefore, to inspire
 virtue, and not to reduce human frailty to despair; but also there are
 crimes so horrible that no mystery accorded expiation for them. Nero,
 for all that he was emperor, could not get himself initiated into the
 mysteries of Ceres. Constantine, on the Report of Zosimus, could not
 obtain pardon for his crimes: he was stained with the blood of his wife,
 his son and all his kindred. It was in the interest of the human race
 that such great transgressions should remain without expiation, in order
 that absolution should not invite their committal, and that universal
 horror might sometimes stop the villains.
 
 The Roman Catholics have expiations which are called "penitences."
 
 By the laws of the barbarians who destroyed the Roman Empire, crimes
 were expiated with money. That was called _compounding_, _componat cum
 decem, viginti, triginta solidis_. It cost two hundred sous of that time
 to kill a priest, and four hundred for killing a bishop; so that a
 bishop was worth precisely two priests.
 
 Having thus compounded with men, one compounded with God, when
 confession was generally established. Finally, Pope John XXII., who made
 money out of everything, prepared a tariff of sins.
 
 The absolution of an incest, four turonenses for a layman; _ab incestu
 pro laico in foro conscientiae turonenses quatuor_. For the man and the
 woman who have committed incest, eighteen turonenses four ducats and
 nine carlins. That is not just; if one person pays only four turonenses,
 the two owed only eight turonenses.
 
 Sodomy and bestiality are put at the same rate, with the inhibitory
 clause to title XLIII: that amounts to ninety turonenses twelve ducats
 and six carlins: _cum inhibitione turonenses 90, ducatos 12, carlinos
 6_, _etc._
 
 It is very difficult to believe that Leo X. was so imprudent as to have
 this impost printed in 1514, as is asserted; but it must be considered
 that no spark appeared at that time of the conflagration which reformers
 kindled later, that the court of Rome slumbered on the people's
 credulity, and neglected to cover its exactions with the lightest veil.
 The public sale of indulgences, which followed soon after, makes it
 clear that this court took no precaution to hide the turpitudes to which
 so many nations were accustomed. As soon as complaints against the
 Church's abuses burst forth, the court did what it could to suppress the
 book; but it could not succeed.
 
 If I dare give my opinion of this impost, I think that the various
 editions are not reliable; the prices are not at all proportionate:
 these prices do not agree with those which are alleged by d'Aubigne,
 grandfather of Madame de Maintenon, in the "Confession de Sanci"; he
 rates virginity at six _gros_, and incest with his mother and sister at
 five _gros_; this account is ridiculous. I think that there was in fact
 a tariff established in the datary's office, for those who came to Rome
 to be absolved, or to bargain for dispensations; but that the enemies of
 Rome added much to it in order to render it more odious.
 
 What is quite certain is that these imposts were never authorized by any
 council; that it was an enormous abuse invented by avarice, and
 respected by those whose interest it was not to abolish it. The buyers
 and the sellers were equally satisfied: thus, barely anybody protested,
 until the troubles of the reformation. It must be admitted that an exact
 note of all these imposts would be of great service to the history of
 the human mind.
 
 
 
 
 _EXTREME_
 
 
 We shall try to extract from this word _extreme_ a notion which may be
 useful.
 
 One disputes every day if, in war, luck or leadership produces
 successes.
 
 If, in disease, nature acts more than medicine for curing or killing.
 
 If, in jurisprudence, it is not very advantageous to come to terms when
 one is in the right, and to plead when one is in the wrong.
 
 If literature contributes to the glory of a nation or to its decadence.
 
 If one should or should not make the people superstitious.
 
 If there is anything true in metaphysics, history and moral philosophy.
 
 If taste is arbitrary, and if there is in fact good taste and bad taste,
 etc., etc.
 
 To decide all these questions right away, take an example of what is the
 most extreme in each; compare the two opposed extremes, and you will at
 once discover which is true.
 
 You wish to know if leadership can infallibly determine the success of
 the war; look at the most extreme case, the most opposed situations, in
 which leadership alone will infallibly triumph. The enemy's army is
 forced to pass through a deep mountain gorge; your general knows it: he
 makes a forced march, he takes possession of the heights, he holds the
 enemy shut in a pass; they must either die or surrender. In this extreme
 case, luck cannot have any part in the victory. It is therefore
 demonstrated that skill can determine the success of a campaign; from
 that alone is it proved that war is an art.
 
 Now imagine an advantageous but less decisive position; success is not
 so certain, but it is always very probable. You arrive thus, step by
 step, to a perfect equality between the two armies. What will decide
 then? luck, that is to say an unforeseen event, a general officer killed
 when he is on his way to execute an important order, a corps which is
 shaken by a false rumour, a panic and a thousand other cases which
 cannot be remedied by prudence; but it still remains certain that there
 is an art, a generalship.
 
 As much must be said of medicine, of this art of operating on the head
 and the hand, to restore life to a man who is about to lose it.
 
 The first man who at the right moment bled and purged a sufferer from an
 apoplectic fit; the first man who thought of plunging a knife into the
 bladder in order to extract a stone, and of closing the wound again; the
 first man who knew how to stop gangrene in a part of the body, were
 without a doubt almost divine persons, and did not resemble Moliere's
 doctors.
 
 Descend from this obvious example to experiments that are less striking
 and more equivocal; you see fevers, ills of all kinds which are cured,
 without it being well proved if it be nature or the doctor who has cured
 them; you see diseases of which the result cannot be guessed; twenty
 doctors are deceived; the one that has the most intelligence, the surest
 eye, guesses the character of the malady. There is therefore an art; and
 the superior man knows the finenesses of it. Thus did La Peyronie guess
 that a man of the court had swallowed a pointed bone which had caused an
 ulcer, and put him in danger of death; thus did Boerhaave guess the
 cause of the malady as unknown as cruel of a count of Vassenaar. There
 is therefore really an art of medicine; but in all arts there are men
 like Virgil and Maevius.
 
 In jurisprudence, take a clear case, in which the law speaks clearly; a
 bill of exchange properly prepared and accepted; the acceptor must be
 condemned to pay it in every country. There is therefore a useful
 jurisprudence, although in a thousand cases judgments are arbitrary, to
 the misfortune of the human race, because the laws are badly made.
 
 Do you desire to know if literature does good to a nation; compare the
 two extremes, Cicero and an uncouth ignoramus. See if it is Pliny or
 Attila who caused the fall of Rome.
 
 One asks if one should encourage superstition in the people; see above
 all what is most extreme in this disastrous matter, St. Bartholomew, the
 massacres in Ireland, the crusades; the question is soon answered.
 
 Is there any truth in metaphysics? Seize first of all the points that
 are most astonishing and the most true; something exists for all
 eternity. An eternal Being exists by Himself; this Being cannot be
 either wicked or inconsequent. One must surrender to these truths;
 almost all the rest is given over to dispute, and the justest mind
 unravels the truth while the others are seeking in the shadows.
 
 It is with all things as with colours; the weakest eyes distinguish
 black from white; the better, more practised eyes, discern shades that
 resemble each other.
 
 
 
 
 _EZOURVEIDAM_
 
 
 What is this "Ezourveidam" which is in the King of France's library? It
 is an ancient commentary which an ancient Brahmin composed once upon a
 time, before the epoch of Alexander, on the ancient "Veidam," which was
 itself much less ancient than the book of the "Shasta."
 
 Let us respect, I tell you, all these ancient Indians. They invented the
 game of chess, and the Greeks went among them to learn geometry.
 
 This "Ezourveidam" was lastly translated by a Brahmin, correspondent of
 the unfortunate French India Company. It was brought to me on Mount
 Krapack, where I have long been observing the snows; and I sent it to
 the great Library of Paris, where it is better placed than in my home.
 
 Those who wish to consult it will see that after many revolutions
 produced by the Eternal, it pleased the Eternal to form a man who was
 called _Adimo_, and a woman whose name corresponds to that of life.
 
 Is this Indian anecdote taken from the Jewish books? have the Jews
 copied it from the Indians? or can one say that both wrote it
 originally, and that fine minds meet?
 
 The Jews were not permitted to think that their writers had drawn
 anything from the Brahmins, for they had never heard tell of them. We
 are not permitted to think about Adam otherwise than the Jews.
 Consequently I hold my tongue, and I do not think at all.
 
 
 
 
 _FAITH_
 
 
 _We have long pondered whether or no we should print this article, which
 we found in an old book. Our respect for St. Peter's see restrained us.
 But some pious men having convinced us that Pope Alexander VI. had
 nothing in common with St. Peter, we at last decided to bring this
 little piece into the light, without scruple._
 
 One day Prince Pico della Mirandola met Pope Alexander VI. at the house
 of the courtesan Emilia, while Lucretia, the holy father's daughter, was
 in child-bed, and one did not know in Rome if the child was the Pope's,
 or his son's the Duke of Valentinois, or Lucretia's husband's, Alphonse
 of Aragon, who passed for impotent. The conversation was at first very
 sprightly. Cardinal Bembo records a part of it.
 
 "Little Pic," said the Pope, "who do you think is my grandson's father?"
 
 "Your son-in-law, I think," answered Pic.
 
 "Eh! how can you believe such folly?"
 
 "I believe it through faith."
 
 "But do you not know quite well that a man who is impotent does not make
 children?"
 
 "Faith consists," returned Pic, "in believing things because they are
 impossible; and, further, the honour of your house demands that
 Lucretia's son shall not pass as the fruit of an incest. You make me
 believe more incomprehensible mysteries. Have I not to be convinced that
 a serpent spoke, that since then all men have been damned, that Balaam's
 she-ass also spoke very eloquently, and that the walls of Jericho fell
 at the sound of trumpets?" Pic forthwith ran through a litany of all
 the admirable things he believed.
 
 Alexander fell on his sofa by dint of laughing.
 
 "I believe all that like you," he said, "for I know well that only by
 faith can I be saved, and that I shall not be saved by my works."
 
 "Ah! Holy Father," said Pic, "you have need of neither works nor faith;
 that is good for poor profane people like us; but you who are vice-god
 can believe and do all you want to. You have the keys of heaven; and
 without a doubt St. Peter will not close the door in your face. But for
 myself, I avow I should need potent protection if, being only a poor
 prince, I had slept with my daughter, and if I had used the stiletto and
 the cantarella as often as your Holiness."
 
 Alexander could take a jest. "Let us talk seriously," he said to Prince
 della Mirandola. "Tell me what merit one can have in telling God that
 one is persuaded of things of which in fact one cannot be persuaded?
 What pleasure can that give God? Between ourselves, saying that one
 believes what is impossible to believe is lying."
 
 Pico della Mirandola made a great sign of the cross. "Eh! paternal God,"
 he cried, "may your Holiness pardon me, you are not a Christian."
 
 "No, by my faith," said the Pope.
 
 "I thought as much," said Pico della Mirandola.
 
 
 
 
 _FALSE MINDS_
 
 
 We have blind men, one-eyed men, squint-eyed men, men with long sight,
 short sight, clear sight, dim sight, weak sight. All that is a faithful
 enough image of our understanding; but we are barely acquainted with
 false sight. There are hardly men who always take a cock for a horse, or
 a chamber-pot for a house. Why do we often come across minds otherwise
 just enough, which are absolutely false on important things? Why does
 this same Siamese who will never let himself be cheated when there is
 question of counting him three rupees, firmly believe in the
 metamorphoses of Sammonocodom? By what strange singularity do sensible
 men resemble Don Quixote who thought he saw giants where other men saw
 only windmills? Still, Don Quixote was more excusable than the Siamese
 who believes that Sammonocodom came several times on earth, and than the
 Turk who is persuaded that Mahomet put half the moon in his sleeve; for
 Don Quixote, struck with the idea that he must fight giants, can figure
 to himself that a giant must have a body as big as a mill; but from what
 supposition can a sensible man set off to persuade himself that the half
 of the moon has gone into a sleeve, and that a Sammonocodom has come
 down from heaven to play at shuttlecock, cut down a forest, and perform
 feats of legerdemain?
 
 The greatest geniuses can have false judgment about a principle they
 have accepted without examination. Newton had very false judgment when
 he commentated the Apocalypse.
 
 All that certain tyrants of the souls desire is that the men they teach
 shall have false judgment. A fakir rears a child who gives much promise;
 he spends five or six years in driving into his head that the god Fo
 appeared to men as a white elephant, and he persuades the child that he
 will be whipped after his death for five hundred thousand years if he
 does not believe these metamorphoses. He adds that at the end of the
 world the enemy of the god Fo will come to fight against this divinity.
 
 The child studies and becomes a prodigy; he argues on his master's
 lessons; he finds that Fo has only been able to change himself into a
 white elephant, because that is the most beautiful of animals. "The
 kings of Siam and Pegu," he says, "have made war for a white elephant;
 certainly if Fo had not been hidden in that elephant, these kings would
 not have been so senseless as to fight simply for the possession of an
 animal.
 
 "The enemy of Fo will come to defy him at the end of the world;
 certainly this enemy will be a rhinoceros, for the rhinoceros fights the
 elephant." It is thus that in mature age the fakir's learned pupil
 reasons, and he becomes one of the lights of India; the more subtle his
 mind, the more false is it, and he forms later minds as false as his.
 
 One shows all these fanatics a little geometry, and they learn it easily
 enough; but strange to relate, their minds are not straightened for
 that; they perceive the truths of geometry; but they do not learn to
 weigh probabilities; they have got into a habit; they will reason
 crookedly all their lives, and I am sorry for them.
 
 There are unfortunately many ways of having a false mind:
 
 1. By not examining if the principle is true, even when one deduces
 accurate consequences therefrom; and this way is common.
 
 2. By drawing false consequences from a principle recognized as true.
 For example, a servant is asked if his master is in his room, by persons
 he suspects of wanting his life: if he were foolish enough to tell them
 the truth on the pretext that one must not lie, it is clear he would be
 drawing an absurd consequence from a very true principle.
 
 A judge who would condemn a man who has killed his assassin, because
 homicide is forbidden, would be as iniquitous as he was poor reasoner.
 
 Similar cases are subdivided in a thousand different gradations. The
 good mind, the just mind, is that which distinguishes them; whence comes
 that one has seen so many iniquitous judgments, not because the judges'
 hearts were bad, but because they were not sufficiently enlightened.
 
 
 
 
 _FATHERLAND_
 
 
 A young journeyman pastrycook who had been to college, and who still
 knew a few of Cicero's phrases, boasted one day of loving his
 fatherland. "What do you mean by your fatherland?" a neighbour asked
 him. "Is it your oven? is it the village where you were born and which
 you have never seen since? is it the street where dwelled your father
 and mother who have been ruined and have reduced you to baking little
 pies for a living? is it the town-hall where you will never be police
 superintendent's clerk? is it the church of Our Lady where you have not
 been able to become a choir-boy, while an absurd man is archbishop and
 duke with an income of twenty thousand golden louis?"
 
 The journeyman pastrycook did not know what to answer. A thinker who was
 listening to this conversation, concluded that in a fatherland of some
 extent there were often many thousand men who had no fatherland.
 
 You, pleasure loving Parisian, who have never made any great journey
 save that to Dieppe to eat fresh fish; who know nothing but your
 varnished town house, your pretty country house, and your box at that
 Opera where the rest of Europe persists in feeling bored; who speak your
 own language agreeably enough because you know no other, you love all
 that, and you love further the girls you keep, the champagne which comes
 to you from Rheims, the dividends which the Hotel-de-Ville pays you
 every six months, and you say you love your fatherland!
 
 In all conscience, does a financier cordially love his fatherland?
 
 The officer and the soldier who will pillage their winter quarters, if
 one lets them, have they a very warm love for the peasants they ruin?
 
 Where was the fatherland of the scarred Duc de Guise, was it in Nancy,
 Paris, Madrid, Rome?
 
 What fatherland have you, Cardinals de La Balue, Duprat, Lorraine,
 Mazarin?
 
 Where was the fatherland of Attila and of a hundred heroes of this type?
 
 I would like someone to tell me which was Abraham's fatherland.
 
 The first man to write that the fatherland is wherever one feels
 comfortable was, I believe, Euripides in his "Phaeton." But the first
 man who left his birthplace to seek his comfort elsewhere had said it
 before him.
 
 Where then is the fatherland? Is it not a good field, whose owner,
 lodged in a well-kept house, can say: "This field that I till, this
 house that I have built, are mine; I live there protected by laws which
 no tyrant can infringe. When those who, like me, possess fields and
 houses, meet in their common interest, I have my voice in the assembly;
 I am a part of everything, a part of the community, a part of the
 dominion; there is my fatherland."?
 
 Well now, is it better for your fatherland to be a monarchy or a
 republic? For four thousand years has this question been debated. Ask
 the rich for an answer, they all prefer aristocracy; question the
 people, they want democracy: only kings prefer royalty. How then is it
 that nearly the whole world is governed by monarchs? Ask the rats who
 proposed to hang a bell round the cat's neck. But in truth, the real
 reason is, as has been said, that men are very rarely worthy of
 governing themselves.
 
 It is sad that often in order to be a good patriot one is the enemy of
 the rest of mankind. To be a good patriot is to wish that one's city may
 be enriched by trade, and be powerful by arms. It is clear that one
 country cannot gain without another loses, and that it cannot conquer
 without making misery. Such then is the human state that to wish for
 one's country's greatness is to wish harm to one's neighbours. He who
 should wish that his fatherland might never be greater, smaller, richer,
 poorer, would be the citizen of the world.
 
 
 
 
 _FINAL CAUSES_
 
 
 If a clock is not made to tell the hour, I will then admit that final
 causes are chimeras; and I shall consider it quite right for people to
 call me "_cause-finalier_," that is--an imbecile.
 
 All the pieces of the machine of this world seem, however, made for each
 other. A few philosophers affect to mock at the final causes rejected by
 Epicurus and Lucretius. It is, it seems to me, at Epicurus and Lucretius
 rather that they should mock. They tell you that the eye is not made for
 seeing, but that man has availed himself of it for this purpose when he
 perceived that eyes could be so used. According to them, the mouth is
 not made for speaking, for eating, the stomach for digesting, the heart
 for receiving the blood from the veins and for dispatching it through
 the arteries, the feet for walking, the ears for hearing. These persons
 avow nevertheless that tailors make them coats to clothe them, and
 masons houses to lodge them, and they dare deny to nature, to the great
 Being, to the universal Intelligence, what they accord to the least of
 their workmen.
 
 Of course one must not make an abuse of final causes; we have remarked
 that in vain Mr. Prieur, in "The Spectacle of Nature," maintains that
 the tides are given to the ocean so that vessels may enter port more
 easily, and to stop the water of the sea from putrefying. In vain would
 he say that legs are made to be booted, and the nose to wear spectacles.
 
 In order that one may be certain of the true end for which a cause
 functions, it is essential that that effect shall exist at all times
 and in all places. There were not ships at all times and on all the
 seas; hence one cannot say that the ocean was made for the ships. One
 feels how ridiculous it would be to maintain that nature had worked from
 all time in order to adjust herself to the inventions of our arbitrary
 arts, which appeared so late; but it is quite evident that if noses were
 not made for spectacles, they were for smelling, and that there have
 been noses ever since there have been men. Similarly, hands not having
 been given on behalf of glove-makers, they are visibly destined for all
 the purposes which the metacarpal bones and the phalanges and the
 circular muscle of the wrist may procure for us.
 
 Cicero, who doubted everything, did not, however, doubt final causes.
 
 It seems especially difficult for the organs of generation not to be
 destined to perpetuate the species. This mechanism is very admirable,
 but the sensation which nature has joined to this mechanism is still
 more admirable. Epicurus had to avow that pleasure is divine; and that
 this pleasure is a final cause, by which are ceaselessly produced
 sentient beings who have not been able to give themselves sensation.
 
 This Epicurus was a great man for his time; he saw what Descartes
 denied, what Gassendi affirmed, what Newton demonstrated, that there is
 no movement without space. He conceived the necessity of atoms to serve
 as constituent parts of invariable species. Those are exceedingly
 philosophical ideas. Nothing was especially more worthy of respect than
 the moral system of the true Epicureans; it consisted in the removal to
 a distance of public matters incompatible with wisdom, and in
 friendship, without which life is a burden. But as regards the rest of
 Epicurus' physics, they do not appear any more admissible than
 Descartes' channelled matter. It is, it seems to me, to stop one's eyes
 and understanding to maintain that there is no design in nature; and if
 there is design, there is an intelligent cause, there exists a God.
 
 People present to us as objections the irregularities of the globe, the
 volcanoes, the plains of shifting sands, a few small mountains destroyed
 and others formed by earthquakes, etc. But from the fact that the naves
 of the wheels of your coach have caught fire, does it ensue that your
 coach was not made expressly to carry you from one place to another?
 
 The chains of mountains which crown the two hemispheres, and more than
 six hundred rivers which flow right to the sea from the feet of these
 rocks; all the streams which come down from these same reservoirs, and
 which swell the rivers, after fertilizing the country; the thousands of
 fountains which start from the same source, and which water animal and
 vegetable kind; all these things seem no more the effect of a fortuitous
 cause and of a declension of atoms, than the retina which receives the
 rays of light, the crystalline lens which refracts them, the incus, the
 malleus, the stapes, the tympanic membrane of the ear, which receives
 the sounds, the paths of the blood in our veins, the systole and
 diastole of the heart, this pendulum of the machine which makes life.
 
 
 
 
 _FRAUD_
 
 
 Bambabef the fakir one day met one of the disciples of Confutzee, whom
 we call "Confucius," and this disciple was named "Ouang," and Bambabef
 maintained that the people had need of being deceived, and Ouang claimed
 that one should never deceive anybody; and here is the summary of their
 dispute:
 
 
 BAMBABEF:
 
 We must imitate the Supreme Being who does not show us things as they
 are; he makes us see the sun in a diameter of two or three feet,
 although this star is a million times bigger than the earth; he makes us
 see the moon and the stars set on the same blue background, whereas they
 are at different depths. He requires that a square tower shall appear
 round to us from a distance; he requires that fire shall seem hot to us,
 although it is neither hot nor cold; in fine, he surrounds us with
 errors suited to our nature.
 
 OUANG:
 
 What you name error is not one at all. The sun, placed as it is at
 millions of millions of lis[6] beyond our globe, is not the sun we see.
 We perceive in reality, and we can perceive, only the sun which is
 depicted in our retina at a determined angle. Our eyes have not been
 given us for appreciating sizes and distances, we need other aids and
 other operations to appreciate them.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 Bambabef seemed very astonished at this proposition. Ouang, who was very
 patient, explained to him the theory of optics; and Bambabef, who had a
 quick understanding, surrendered to the demonstrations of Confutzee's
 disciple, then he resumed the argument.
 
 
 BAMBABEF:
 
 If God does not deceive us through the medium of our senses, as I
 believed, avow at least that doctors always deceive children for their
 good; they tell them that they are giving them sugar, and in fact they
 are giving them rhubarb. I, a fakir, may then deceive the people who are
 as ignorant as the children.
 
 OUANG:
 
 I have two sons; I have never deceived them; when they have been ill I
 have told them that there was a very bitter medicine, and that they must
 have the courage to take it; "it would harm you if it were sweet." I
 have never allowed their masters and teachers to make them afraid of
 spirits, ghosts, goblins, sorcerers; by this means I have made brave,
 wise young citizens of them.
 
 BAMBABEF:
 
 The people are not born so happily as your family.
 
 OUANG:
 
 All men are alike, or nearly so; they are born with the same
 dispositions. One must not corrupt men's natures.
 
 BAMBABEF:
 
 We teach them errors, I admit, but it is for their good. We make them
 believe that if they do not buy the nails we have blessed, if they do
 not expiate their sins by giving us money, they will become, in another
 life, post-horses, dogs or lizards. That intimidates them, and they
 become honest people.
 
 OUANG:
 
 Do you not see that you are perverting these poor people? There are
 among them many more than you think who reason, who laugh at your
 miracles, at your superstitions, who see quite well that they will not
 be changed into either lizards or post-horses. What is the consequence?
 They have enough sense to see that you are telling them impertinences,
 and they have not enough to raise themselves toward a religion that is
 pure and free from superstition, such as ours. Their passions make them
 believe that there is no religion at all, because the only one that is
 taught them is ridiculous; you become guilty of all the vices in which
 they are plunged.
 
 BAMBABEF:
 
 Not at all, for we do not teach them anything but good morality.
 
 OUANG:
 
 You would have yourselves stoned by the people if you taught them impure
 morality. Men are so made that they want to do evil, but that they do
 not want it preached to them. All that is necessary is that you should
 not mix a wise moral system with absurd fables, because you weaken
 through your impostures, which you can do without, the morality that you
 are forced to teach.
 
 BAMBABEF:
 
 What! you believe that one can teach the people truth without
 strengthening it with fables?
 
 OUANG:
 
 I firmly believe it. Our literati are of the same stuff as our tailors,
 our weavers and our husbandmen. They worship a God creator, rewarder,
 avenger. They do not sully their worship, either by absurd systems, or
 by extravagant ceremonies; and there are far less crimes among the
 literati than among the people. Why not deign to instruct our workmen as
 we instruct our literati?
 
 BAMBABEF:
 
 You would be very foolish; it is as if you wanted them to have the same
 courtesy, to be lawyers; that is neither possible nor proper. There must
 be white bread for the masters, and brown bread for the servants.
 
 OUANG:
 
 I admit that all men should not have the same learning; but there are
 some things necessary to all. It is necessary that all men should be
 just; and the surest way of inspiring all men with justice is to inspire
 in them religion without superstition.
 
 BAMBABEF:
 
 It is a fine project, but it is impracticable. Do you think that men
 will be satisfied to believe in a God who punishes and rewards? You have
 told me that it often happens that the most shrewd among the people
 revolt against my fables; they will revolt in the same way against
 truth. They will say: "Who will assure me that God punishes and
 rewards? where is the proof of it? what is your mission? what miracle
 have you performed that I may believe you?" They will laugh at you much
 more than at me.
 
 OUANG:
 
 That is where you are mistaken. You imagine that people will shake off
 the yoke of an honest, probable idea that is useful to everyone, of an
 idea in accordance with human reason, because people reject things that
 are dishonest, absurd, useless, dangerous, that make good sense shudder.
 
 The people are very disposed to believe their magistrates: when their
 magistrates propose to them only a reasonable belief, they embrace it
 willingly. There is no need of prodigies for believing in a just God,
 who reads in man's heart; this idea is too natural, too necessary, to be
 combated. It is not necessary to say precisely how God will punish and
 reward; it suffices that people believe in His justice. I assure you I
 have seen entire towns which have had barely any other dogma, and that
 it is in those towns that I have seen most virtue.
 
 BAMBABEF:
 
 Take care; in those towns you will find philosophers who will deny you
 both your pains and your recompenses.
 
 OUANG:
 
 You will admit to me that these philosophers will deny your inventions
 still more strongly; so you gain nothing from that. Though there are
 philosophers who do not agree with my principles, there are honest
 people none the less; none the less do they cultivate the virtue of
 them, which must be embraced by love, and not by fear. But, further, I
 maintain that no philosopher would ever be assured that Providence did
 not reserve pains for the wicked and rewards for the good. For if they
 ask me who told me that God punishes? I shall ask them who has told them
 that God does not punish. In fine, I maintain that these philosophers,
 far from contradicting me, will help me. Would you like to be a
 philosopher?
 
 BAMBABEF:
 
 Willingly; but do not tell the fakirs.
 
 OUANG:
 
 Let us think above all that, if a philosopher wishes to be useful to
 human society, he must announce a God.

 _FREE-WILL_
 
 
 Ever since men have reasoned, the philosophers have obscured this
 matter: but the theologians have rendered it unintelligible by absurd
 subtleties about grace. Locke is perhaps the first man to find a thread
 in this labyrinth; for he is the first who, without having the arrogance
 of trusting in setting out from a general principle, examined human
 nature by analysis. For three thousand years people have disputed
 whether or no the will is free. In the "Essay on the Human
 Understanding," chapter on "Power," Locke shows first of all that the
 question is absurd, and that liberty can no more belong to the will than
 can colour and movement.
 
 What is the meaning of this phrase "to be free"? it means "to be able,"
 or assuredly it has no sense. For the will "to be able" is as ridiculous
 at bottom as to say that the will is yellow or blue, round or square. To
 will is to wish, and to be free is to be able. Let us note step by step
 the chain of what passes in us, without obfuscating our minds by any
 terms of the schools or any antecedent principle.
 
 It is proposed to you that you mount a horse, you must absolutely make a
 choice, for it is quite clear that you either will go or that you will
 not go. There is no middle way. It is therefore of absolute necessity
 that you wish yes or no. Up to there it is demonstrated that the will is
 not free. You wish to mount the horse; why? The reason, an ignoramus
 will say, is because I wish it. This answer is idiotic, nothing happens
 or can happen without a reason, a cause; there is one therefore for your
 wish. What is it? the agreeable idea of going on horseback which
 presents itself in your brain, the dominant idea, the determinant idea.
 But, you will say, can I not resist an idea which dominates me? No, for
 what would be the cause of your resistance? None. By your will you can
 obey only an idea which will dominate you more.
 
 Now you receive all your ideas; therefore you receive your wish, you
 wish therefore necessarily. The word "liberty" does not therefore belong
 in any way to your will.
 
 You ask me how thought and wish are formed in us. I answer you that I
 have not the remotest idea. I do not know how ideas are made any more
 than how the world was made. All that is given to us is to grope for
 what passes in our incomprehensible machine.
 
 The will, therefore, is not a faculty that one can call free. A free
 will is an expression absolutely void of sense, and what the scholastics
 have called will of indifference, that is to say willing without cause,
 is a chimera unworthy of being combated.
 
 Where will be liberty then? in the power to do what one wills. I wish to
 leave my study, the door is open, I am free to leave it.
 
 But, say you, if the door is closed, and I wish to stay at home, I stay
 there freely. Let us be explicit. You exercise then the power that you
 have of staying; you have this power, but you have not that of going
 out.
 
 The liberty about which so many volumes have been written is, therefore,
 reduced to its accurate terms, only the power of acting.
 
 In what sense then must one utter the phrase--"Man is free"? in the same
 sense that one utters the words, health, strength, happiness. Man is not
 always strong, always healthy, always happy.
 
 A great passion, a great obstacle, deprive him of his liberty, his power
 of action.
 
 The word "liberty," "free-will," is therefore an abstract word, a
 general word, like beauty, goodness, justice. These terms do not state
 that all men are always beautiful, good and just; similarly, they are
 not always free.
 
 Let us go further: this liberty being only the power of acting, what is
 this power? It is the effect of the constitution and present state of
 our organs. Leibnitz wishes to resolve a geometrical problem, he has an
 apoplectic fit, he certainly has not liberty to resolve his problem. Is
 a vigorous young man, madly in love, who holds his willing mistress in
 his arms, free to tame his passion? undoubtedly not. He has the power of
 enjoying, and has not the power of refraining. Locke was therefore very
 right to call liberty "power." When is it that this young man can
 refrain despite the violence of his passion? when a stronger idea
 determines in a contrary sense the activity of his body and his soul.
 
 But what! the other animals will have the same liberty, then, the same
 power? Why not? They have senses, memory, feeling, perceptions, as we
 have. They act with spontaneity as we act. They must have also, as we
 have, the power of acting by virtue of their perceptions, by virtue of
 the play of their organs.
 
 Someone cries: "If it be so, everything is only machine, everything in
 the universe is subjected to eternal laws." Well! would you have
 everything at the pleasure of a million blind caprices? Either
 everything is the sequence of the necessity of the nature of things, or
 everything is the effect of the eternal order of an absolute master; in
 both cases we are only wheels in the machine of the world.
 
 It is a vain witticism, a commonplace to say that without the pretended
 liberty of the will, all pains and rewards are useless. Reason, and you
 will come to a quite contrary conclusion.
 
 If a brigand is executed, his accomplice who sees him expire has the
 liberty of not being frightened at the punishment; if his will is
 determined by itself, he will go from the foot of the scaffold to
 assassinate on the broad highway; if his organs, stricken with horror,
 make him experience an unconquerable terror, he will stop robbing. His
 companion's punishment becomes useful to him and an insurance for
 society only so long as his will is not free.
 
 Liberty then is only and can be only the power to do what one will. That
 is what philosophy teaches us. But if one considers liberty in the
 theological sense, it is a matter so sublime that profane eyes dare not
 raise themselves to it.[7]

 _FRENCH_
 
 
 The French language did not begin to have any form until towards the
 tenth century; it was born from the ruins of Latin and Celtic, mixed
 with a few Germanic words. This language was first of all the _romanum
 rusticum_, rustic Roman, and the Germanic language was the court
 language up to the time of Charles the Bald; Germanic remained the sole
 language of Germany after the great epoch of the partition of 843.
 Rustic Roman, the Romance language, prevailed in Western France; the
 people of the country of Vaud, of the Valais, of the Engadine valley,
 and of a few other cantons, still retain to-day manifest vestiges of
 this idiom.
 
 At the end of the tenth century French was formed; people wrote in
 French at the beginning of the eleventh; but this French still retained
 more of Rustic Roman than the French of to-day. The romance of
 Philomena, written in the tenth century in rustic Roman, is not in a
 tongue very different from that of the Norman laws. One still remarks
 Celtic, Latin and German derivations. The words signifying the parts of
 the human body, or things of daily use, and which have nothing in common
 with Latin or German, are in old Gaulish or Celtic, such as _tete_,
 _jambe_, _sabre_, _pointe_, _aller_, _parler_, _ecouter_, _regarder_,
 _aboyer_, _crier_, _coutume_, _ensemble_, and many others of this kind.
 Most of the terms of war were Frank or German: _Marche_, _halte_,
 _marechal_, _bivouac_, _reitre_, _lansquenet_. All the rest is Latin;
 and all the Latin words were abridged, according to the custom and
 genius of the nations of the north; thus from _palatium_, palais; from
 _lupus_, loup; from _Auguste_, aout; from _Junius_, juin; from _unctus_,
 oint; from _purpura_, pourpre; from _pretium_, prix, etc. Hardly were
 there left any vestiges of the Greek tongue, which had been so long
 spoken at Marseilles.
 
 In the twelfth century there began to be introduced into the language
 some of the terms of Aristotle's philosophy; and towards the sixteenth
 century one expressed by Greek terms all the parts of the human body,
 their diseases, their remedies; whence the words _cardiaque_,
 _cephalique_, _podagre_, _apoplectique_, _asthmatique_, _iliaque_,
 _empyeme_, and so many others. Although the language then enriched
 itself from the Greek, and although since Charles VIII. it had drawn
 much aid from Italian already perfected, the French language had not yet
 taken regular consistence. Francois Ier abolished the ancient custom of
 pleading, judging, contracting in Latin; custom which bore witness to
 the barbarism of a language which one did not dare use in public
 documents, a pernicious custom for citizens whose lot was regulated in a
 language they did not understand. One was obliged then to cultivate
 French; but the language was neither noble nor regular. The syntax was
 left to caprice. The genius for conversation being turned to
 pleasantries, the language became very fertile in burlesque and naive
 expressions, and very sterile in noble and harmonious terms: from this
 it comes that in rhyming dictionaries one finds twenty terms suitable
 for comic poetry, for one for more exalted use; and it is, further, a
 reason why Marot never succeeded in a serious style, and why Amyot could
 render Plutarch's elegance only with naivete.
 
 French acquired vigour beneath the pen of Montaigne; but it still had
 neither nobility nor harmony. Ronsard spoiled the language by bringing
 into French poetry the Greek compounds which the doctors and
 philosophers used. Malherbe repaired Ronsard's mischief somewhat. The
 language became more noble and more harmonious with the establishment of
 the Academie Francaise, and acquired finally, in the reign of Louis
 XIV., the perfection whereby it might be carried into all forms of
 composition.
 
 The genius of this language is order and clarity; for each language has
 its genius, and this genius consists in the facility which the language
 gives for expressing oneself more or less happily, for using or
 rejecting the familiar twists of other languages. French having no
 declensions, and being always subject to the article, cannot adopt Greek
 and Latin inversions; it obliges words to arrange themselves in the
 natural order of ideas. Only in one way can one say "_Plancus a pris
 soin des affaires de Cesar._" That is the only arrangement one can give
 to these words. Express this phrase in Latin--_Res Caesaris Plancus
 diligenter curavit_: one can arrange these words in a hundred and twenty
 ways, without injuring the sense and without troubling the language. The
 auxiliary verbs which eke out and enervate the phrases in modern
 languages, still render the French tongue little suited to the concise
 lapidary style. The auxiliary verbs, its pronouns, its articles, its
 lack of declinable participles, and finally its uniform gait, are
 injurious to the great enthusiasm of poetry, in which it has less
 resources than Italian and English; but this constraint and this bondage
 render it more suitable for tragedy and comedy than any language in
 Europe. The natural order in which one is obliged to express one's
 thoughts and construct one's phrases, diffuses in this language a
 sweetness and easiness that is pleasing to all peoples; and the genius
 of the nation mingling with the genius of the language has produced more
 agreeably written books than can be seen among any other people.
 
 The pleasure and liberty of society having been long known only in
 France, the language has received therefrom a delicacy of expression and
 a finesse full of simplicity barely to be found elsewhere. This finesse
 has sometimes been exaggerated, but people of taste have always known
 how to reduce it within just limits.
 
 Many persons have thought that the French language has become
 impoverished since the time of Amyot and Montaigne: one does indeed
 find in many authors expressions which are no longer admissible; but
 they are for the most part familiar expressions for which equivalents
 have been substituted. The language has been enriched with a quantity of
 noble and energetic expressions; and without speaking here of the
 eloquence of things, it has acquired the eloquence of words. It is in
 the reign of Louis XIV., as has been said, that this eloquence had its
 greatest splendour, and that the language was fixed. Whatever changes
 time and caprice prepare for it, the good authors of the seventeenth and
 eighteenth centuries will always serve as models.
 
 
 
 
 _FRIENDSHIP_
 
 
 Friendship is the marriage of the soul; and this marriage is subject to
 divorce. It is a tacit contract between two sensitive and virtuous
 persons. I say "sensitive," because a monk, a recluse can be not wicked
 and live without knowing what friendship is. I say "virtuous," because
 the wicked have only accomplices; voluptuaries have companions in
 debauch, self-seekers have partners, politicians get partisans; the
 generality of idle men have attachments; princes have courtiers;
 virtuous men alone have friends. Cethegus was the accomplice of
 Catilina, and Maecenas the courtier of Octavius; but Cicero was the
 friend of Atticus.
 
 
 
 
 _GOD_
 
 
 During the reign of Arcadius, Logomacos, lecturer in theology of
 Constantinople, went to Scythia and halted at the foot of the Caucasus,
 in the fertile plains of Zephirim, on the frontier of Colchis. That good
 old man Dondindac was in his great lower hall, between his sheepfold and
 his vast barn; he was kneeling with his wife, his five sons and five
 daughters, his kindred and his servants, and after a light meal they
 were all singing God's praises. "What do you there, idolator?" said
 Logomacos to him.
 
 "I am not an idolator," answered Dondindac.
 
 "You must be an idolator," said Logomacos, "seeing that you are not
 Greek. Tell me, what was that you were singing in your barbarous
 Scythian jargon?"
 
 "All tongues are equal in the ears of God," answered the Scythian. "We
 were singing His praises."
 
 "That's very extraordinary," returned the theologian. "A Scythian family
 who pray God without having been taught by us!" He soon engaged
 Dondindac the Scythian in conversation, for he knew a little Scythian,
 and the other a little Greek. The following conversation was found in a
 manuscript preserved in the library of Constantinople.
 
 
 LOGOMACOS:
 
 Let us see if you know your catechism. Why do you pray God?
 
 DONDINDAC:
 
 Because it is right to worship the Supreme Being from whom we hold
 everything.
 
 LOGOMACOS:
 
 Not bad for a barbarian! And what do you ask of Him?
 
 DONDINDAC:
 
 I thank Him for the benefits I enjoy, and even for the ills with which
 He tries me; but I take good care not to ask Him for anything; He knows
 better than us what we need, and besides, I am afraid to ask Him for
 good weather when my neighbour is asking for rain.
 
 LOGOMACOS:
 
 Ah! I thought he was going to say something silly. Let us start again
 farther back. Barbarian, who has told you there is a God?
 
 DONDINDAC:
 
 The whole of nature.
 
 LOGOMACOS:
 
 That does not suffice. What idea have you of God?
 
 DONDINDAC:
 
 The idea of my creator, of my master, who will reward me if I do good,
 and who will punish me if I do ill.
 
 LOGOMACOS:
 
 Trash, nonsense all that! Let us come to essentials. Is God infinite
 _secundum quid_, or in essence?
 
 DONDINDAC:
 
 I don't understand you.
 
 LOGOMACOS:
 
 Brutish fool! Is God in one place, beyond all places, or in all places?
 
 DONDINDAC:
 
 I have no idea ... just as you please.
 
 LOGOMACOS:
 
 Dolt! Is it possible for what has been not to have been, and can a stick
 not have two ends? Does He see the future as future or as present? how
 does He draw the being out of non-existence, and how annihilate the
 being?
 
 DONDINDAC:
 
 I have never examined these things.
 
 LOGOMACOS:
 
 What a blockhead! Come, one must humble oneself, see things in
 proportion. Tell me, my friend, do you think that matter can be eternal?
 
 DONDINDAC:
 
 What does it matter to me whether it exists from all eternity or not? I
 do not exist from all eternity. God is always my master; He has given me
 the notion of justice, I must follow it; I do not want to be a
 philosopher, I want to be a man.
 
 LOGOMACOS:
 
 These blockheads are troublesome. Let us go step by step. What is God?
 
 DONDINDAC:
 
 My sovereign, my judge, my father.
 
 LOGOMACOS:
 
 That's not what I'm asking you. What is His nature?
 
 DONDINDAC:
 
 To be potent and good.
 
 LOGOMACOS:
 
 But, is He corporeal or spiritual?
 
 DONDINDAC:
 
 How should I know?
 
 LOGOMACOS:
 
 What! you don't know what a spirit is?
 
 DONDINDAC:
 
 Not in the least: of what use would it be to me? should I be more just?
 should I be a better husband, a better father, a better master, a better
 citizen?
 
 LOGOMACOS:
 
 It is absolutely essential you should learn what a spirit is. It is, it
 is, it is ... I will tell you another time.
 
 DONDINDAC:
 
 I'm very much afraid that you may tell me less what it is than what it
 is not. Allow me to put a question to you in my turn. I once saw one of
 your temples; why do you depict God with a long beard?
 
 LOGOMACOS:
 
 That's a very difficult question which needs preliminary instruction.
 
 DONDINDAC:
 
 Before receiving your instruction, I must tell you what happened to me
 one day. I had just built a closet at the end of my garden; I heard a
 mole arguing with a cockchafer. "That's a very fine building," said the
 mole. "It must have been a very powerful mole who did that piece of
 work."
 
 "You're joking," said the cockchafer. "It was a cockchafer bubbling over
 with genius who is the architect of this building." From that time I
 resolved never to argue.
 
 
 
 
 _HELVETIA_
 
 
 Happy Helvetia! to what charter do you owe your liberty? to your
 courage, to your resolution, to your mountains.
 
 "But I am your emperor."
 
 "But I do not want you any longer."
 
 "But your fathers were my father's slaves."
 
 "It is for that very reason that their children do not wish to serve
 you."
 
 "But I had the right belonging to my rank."
 
 "And we have the right of nature."
 
 Why is liberty so rare?
 
 Because it is the chiefest good.
 
 
 
 
 _HISTORY_
 
 
 DEFINITION
 
 History is the recital of facts given as true, in contradistinction to
 the fable, which is the recital of facts given as false.
 
 There is the history of opinions which is hardly anything but a
 collection of human errors.
 
 The history of the arts can be the most useful of all when it joins to
 the knowledge of the invention and the progress of the arts the
 description of their mechanism.
 
 Natural history, improperly called _history_, is an essential part of
 natural philosophy. The history of events has been divided into sacred
 history and profane history; sacred history is a series of divine and
 miraculous operations whereby it pleased God once on a time to lead the
 Jewish nation, and to-day to exercise our faith.
 
 
 FIRST FOUNDATIONS OF HISTORY
 
 The first foundations of all history are the recitals of the fathers to
 the children, transmitted afterward from one generation to another; at
 their origin they are at the very most probable, when they do not shock
 common sense, and they lose one degree of probability in each
 generation. With time the fable grows and the truth grows less; from
 this it comes that all the origins of peoples are absurd. Thus the
 Egyptians had been governed by the gods for many centuries; then they
 had been governed by demi-gods; finally they had had kings for eleven
 thousand three hundred and forty years; and in that space of time the
 sun had changed four times from east to west.
 
 The Phoenicians of Alexander's time claimed to have been established
 in their country for thirty thousand years; and these thirty thousand
 years were filled with as many prodigies as the Egyptian chronology. I
 avow that physically it is very possible that Phoenicia has existed
 not merely thirty thousand years, but thirty thousand milliards of
 centuries, and that it experienced like the rest of the world thirty
 million revolutions. But we have no knowledge of it.
 
 One knows what a ridiculously marvellous state of affairs ruled in the
 ancient history of the Greeks.
 
 The Romans, for all that they were serious, did not any the less envelop
 the history of their early centuries in fables. This nation, so recent
 compared with the Asiatic peoples, was five hundred years without
 historians. It is not surprising, therefore, that Romulus was the son of
 Mars, that a she-wolf was his foster mother, that he marched with a
 thousand men of his village of Rome against twenty-five thousand
 combatants of the village of the Sabines: that later he became a god;
 that Tarquin, the ancient, cut a stone with a razor, and that a vestal
 drew a ship to land with her girdle, etc.
 
 The early annals of all our modern nations are no less fabulous; the
 prodigious and improbable things must sometimes be reported, but as
 proofs of human credulity: they enter the history of opinions and
 foolishnesses; but the field is too vast.
 
 
 OF RECORDS
 
 In order to know with a little certainty something of ancient history,
 there is only one means, it is to see if any incontestable records
 remain. We have only three in writing: the first is the collection of
 astronomical observations made for nineteen hundred consecutive years at
 Babylon, sent by Alexander to Greece. This series of observations, which
 goes back to two thousand two hundred and thirty-four years before our
 era, proves invincibly that the Babylonians existed as a body of people
 several centuries before; for the arts are only the work of time, and
 men's natural laziness leaves them for some thousands of years without
 other knowledge and without other talents than those of feeding
 themselves, of defending themselves against the injuries of the air, and
 of slaughtering each other. Let us judge by the Germans and by the
 English in Caesar's time, by the Tartars to-day, by the two-thirds of
 Africa, and by all the peoples we have found in America, excepting in
 some respects the kingdoms of Peru and of Mexico, and the republic of
 Tlascala. Let us remember that in the whole of this new world nobody
 knew how to read or write.
 
 The second record is the central eclipse of the sun, calculated in China
 two thousand one hundred and fifty-five years before our era, and
 recognized true by our astronomers. Of the Chinese the same thing must
 be said as of the peoples of Babylon; they already comprised a vast
 civilized empire without a doubt. But what puts the Chinese above all
 the peoples of the earth is that neither their laws, nor their customs,
 nor the language spoken among them by their lettered mandarins has
 changed for about four thousand years. Nevertheless, this nation and the
 nation of India, the most ancient of all those that exist to-day, which
 possess the vastest and the most beautiful country, which invented
 almost all the arts before we had learned any of them, have always been
 omitted right to our days in all so-called universal histories. And when
 a Spaniard and a Frenchman took a census of the nations, neither one nor
 the other failed to call his country the first monarchy in the world,
 and his king the greatest king in the world, flattering himself that his
 king would give him a pension as soon as he had read his book.
 
 The third record, very inferior to the two others, exists in the Arundel
 marbles: the chronicle of Athens is graved there two hundred and
 sixty-three years before our era; but it goes back only to Cecrops,
 thirteen hundred and nineteen years beyond the time when it was
 engraved. In the history of antiquity those are the sole incontestable
 epochs that we have.
 
 Let us give serious attention to these marbles brought back from Greece
 by Lord Arundel. Their chronicle begins fifteen hundred and eighty-two
 years before our era. That is to-day (1771) an antiquity of 3,353 years,
 and you do not see there a single fact touching on the miraculous, on
 the prodigious. It is the same with the Olympiads; it is not there that
 one should say _Graecia mendax_, lying Greece. The Greeks knew very well
 how to distinguish between history and fable, between real facts and the
 tales of Herodotus: just as in their serious affairs their orators
 borrowed nothing from the speeches of the sophists or from the images of
 the poets.
 
 The date of the taking of Troy is specified in these marbles; but no
 mention is made of Apollo's arrows, or of the sacrifice of Iphigenia, or
 of the ridiculous combats of the gods. The date of the inventions of
 Triptolemy and Ceres is found there; but Ceres is not called _goddess_.
 Mention is made of a poem on the abduction of Prosperine; it is not said
 that she is the daughter of Jupiter and a goddess, and that she is wife
 of the god of the infernal regions.
 
 Hercules is initiated into the mysteries of Eleusis; but not a word on
 his twelve labours, nor on his passage into Africa in his cup, nor on
 his divinity, nor on the big fish by which he was swallowed, and which
 kept him in its belly three days and three nights, according to
 Lycophron.
 
 Among us, on the contrary, a standard is brought from heaven by an angel
 to the monks of Saint-Denis; a pigeon brings a bottle of oil to a church
 in Rheims; two armies of snakes give themselves over to a pitched battle
 in Germany; an archbishop of Mayence is besieged and eaten by rats; and,
 to crown everything, great care has been taken to mark the year of these
 adventures.
 
 All history is recent. It is not astonishing that we have no ancient
 profane history beyond about four thousand years. The revolutions of
 this globe, the long and universal ignorance of that art which transmits
 facts by writing are the cause of it. This art was common only among a
 very small number of civilized nations; and was in very few hands even.
 Nothing rarer among the French and the Germans than to know how to
 write; up to the fourteenth century of our era nearly all deeds were
 only attested by witnesses. It was, in France, only under Charles VII.,
 in 1454, that one started to draft in writing some of the customs of
 France. The art of writing was still rarer among the Spanish, and from
 that it results that their history is so dry and so uncertain, up to the
 time of Ferdinand and Isabella. One sees by that to what extent the very
 small number of men who knew how to write could deceive, and how easy it
 was to make us believe the most enormous absurdities.
 
 There are nations which have subjugated a part of the world without
 having the usage of characters. We know that Gengis-khan conquered a
 part of Asia at the beginning of the thirteenth century, but it is not
 through either him or the Tartars that we know it. Their history,
 written by the Chinese and translated by Father Gaubil, states that
 these Tartars had not at that time the art of writing.
 
 This art cannot have been less unknown to the Scythian Oguskan, named
 Madies by the Persians and the Greeks, who conquered a part of Europe
 and Asia so long before the reign of Cyrus. It is almost certain that at
 that time of a hundred nations there were hardly two or three who used
 characters. It is possible that in an ancient world destroyed, men knew
 writing and the other arts; but in ours they are all very recent.
 
 There remain records of another kind, which serve to establish merely
 the remote antiquity of certain peoples, and which precede all the known
 epochs, and all the books; these are the prodigies of architecture, like
 the pyramids and the palaces of Egypt, which have resisted time.
 Herodotus, who lived two thousand two hundred years ago, and who had
 seen them, was not able to learn from the Egyptian priests at what time
 they had been erected.
 
 It is difficult to give to the most ancient of the pyramids less than
 four thousand years of antiquity; but one must consider that these
 efforts of the ostentation of the kings could only have been commenced
 long after the establishment of the towns. But to build towns in a land
 inundated every year, let us always remark that it was first necessary
 to raise the land of the towns on piles in this land of mud, and to
 render them inaccessible to the flood; it was essential, before taking
 this necessary course, and before being in a state to attempt these
 great works, for the people to have practised retreating during the
 rising of the Nile, amid the rocks which form two chains right and left
 of this river. It was necessary for these mustered peoples to have the
 instruments for tilling, those of architecture, a knowledge of
 surveying, with laws and a police. All this necessarily requires a
 prodigious space of time. We see by the long details which face every
 day the most necessary and the smallest of our undertakings, how
 difficult it is to do great things, and it needs not only indefatigable
 stubbornness, but several generations animated with this stubbornness.
 
 However, whether it be Menes, Thaut or Cheops, or Rameses who erected
 one or two of these prodigious masses, we shall not be the more
 instructed of the history of ancient Egypt: the language of this people
 is lost. We therefore know nothing but that before the most ancient
 historians there was matter for making an ancient history.
 
 
 
 
 _IGNORANCE_
 
 
 I am ignorant of how I was formed, and of how I was born. For a quarter
 of my life I was absolutely ignorant of the reasons for all that I saw,
 heard and felt, and I was nothing but a parrot at whom other parrots
 chattered.
 
 When I looked round me and within me, I conceived that something exists
 for all eternity; since there are beings who exist to-day, I concluded
 that there is a being who is necessary and necessarily eternal. Thus,
 the first step I took to emerge from my ignorance crossed the boundaries
 of all the centuries.
 
 But when I tried to walk in this infinite quarry open before me, I could
 neither find a single path, nor discern plainly a single object; and
 from the leap I made to contemplate eternity, I fell back again into the
 abyss of my ignorance.
 
 I saw what was called "matter," from the star Sirius and the stars of
 the Milky Way, as distant from Sirius as Sirius is from us, right to the
 last atom that can be perceived with the microscope, and I am ignorant
 as to what matter is.
 
 The light which let me see all these beings is unknown to me; I can,
 with the help of a prism, dissect this light, and divide it into seven
 pencils of rays; but I cannot divide these pencils; I am ignorant of
 what they are composed. Light is of the nature of matter, since it has
 movement and makes an impression on objects; but it does not tend toward
 a centre like all bodies: on the contrary, it escapes invincibly from
 the centre, whereas all matter bears towards its centre. Light seems
 penetrable, and matter is impenetrable. Is this light matter? is it not
 matter? with what innumerable properties can it be endowed? I am
 ignorant thereof.
 
 Is this substance which is so brilliant, so swift and so unknown, are
 these other substances which roll in the immensity of space, eternal as
 they seem infinite? I have no idea. Has a necessary being, of sovereign
 intelligence, created them out of nothing, or has he arranged them? did
 he produce this order in Time or before Time? What even is this Time of
 which I speak? I cannot define it. O God! Teach me, for I am enlightened
 neither by other men's darkness nor by my own.
 
 What is sensation? How have I received it? what connection is there
 between the air which strikes my ear and the sensation of sound? between
 this body and the sensation of colour? I am profoundly ignorant thereof,
 and I shall always be ignorant thereof.
 
 What is thought? where does it dwell? how is it formed? who gives me
 thought during my sleep? is it by virtue of my will that I think? But
 always during my sleep, and often while I am awake, I have ideas in
 spite of myself. These ideas, long forgotten, long relegated to the back
 shop of my brain, issue from it without my interfering, and present
 themselves to my memory, which makes vain efforts to recall them.
 
 External objects have not the power to form ideas in me, for one does
 not give oneself what one has not; I am too sensible that it is not I
 who give them to me, for they are born without my orders. Who produces
 them in me? whence do they come? whither do they go? Fugitive phantoms,
 what invisible hand produces you and causes you to disappear?
 
 Why, alone of all animals, has man the mania for dominating his
 fellow-men?
 
 Why and how has it been possible that of a hundred thousand million men
 more than ninety-nine have been immolated to this mania?
 
 How is reason so precious a gift that we would not lose it for anything
 in the world? and how has this reason served only to make us the most
 unhappy of all beings?
 
 Whence comes it that loving truth passionately, we are always betrayed
 to the most gross impostures?
 
 Why is life still loved by this crowd of Indians deceived and enslaved
 by the bonzes, crushed by a Tartar's descendants, overburdened with
 work, groaning in want, assailed by disease, exposed to every scourge?
 
 Whence comes evil, and why does evil exist?
 
 O atoms of a day! O my companions in infinite littleness, born like me
 to suffer everything and to be ignorant of everything, are there enough
 madmen among you to believe that they know all these things? No, there
 are not; no, at the bottom of your hearts you feel your nonentity as I
 render justice to mine. But you are arrogant enough to want people to
 embrace your vain systems; unable to be tyrants over our bodies, you
 claim to be tyrants over our souls.
 
 
 
 
 _THE IMPIOUS_
 
 
 Who are the impious? those who give a white beard, feet and hands to the
 Being of beings, to the great Demiourgos, to the eternal intelligence by
 which nature is governed. But they are only excusably impious, poor
 impious people against whom one must not grow wroth.
 
 If even they paint the great incomprehensible Being born on a cloud
 which can bear nothing; if they are foolish enough to put God in a mist,
 in the rain, or on a mountain, and to surround him with little chubby,
 flushed faces accompanied by two wings; I laugh and I pardon them with
 all my heart.
 
 The impious persons who attribute to the Being of beings preposterous
 predictions and injustices would anger me if this great Being had not
 given me a reason which quells my wrath. The silly fanatic repeats to
 me, after others, that it is not for us to judge what is reasonable and
 just in the great Being, that His reason is not like our reason, that
 His justice is not like our justice. Eh! how, you mad demoniac, do you
 want me to judge justice and reason otherwise than by the notions I have
 of them? do you want me to walk otherwise than with my feet, and to
 speak otherwise than with my mouth?
 
 The impious man who supposes the great Being jealous, arrogant,
 malignant, vindictive, is more dangerous. I would not want to sleep
 under the same roof as this man.
 
 But how would you treat the impious man who says to you: "See only
 through my eyes, do not think; I announce to you a tyrannical God who
 has made me to be your tyrant; I am his well-beloved: during all
 eternity he will torture millions of his creatures whom he detests in
 order to gladden me; I shall be your master in this world, and I shall
 laugh at your torments in the other."
 
 Do you not feel an itching to thrash this cruel, impious fellow? If you
 are born gentle, will you not run with all your might to the west when
 this barbarian utters his atrocious reveries in the east?
 
 
 
 
 _JOAN OF ARC_
 
 
 It is meet that the reader should be acquainted with the true history of
 Joan of Arc surnamed "the Maid." The details of her adventure are very
 little known and may give readers pleasure; here they are.
 
 Paul Jove says that the courage of the French was stimulated by this
 girl, and takes good care not to believe her inspired. Neither Robert,
 Gaguin, Paul Emile, Polydore Vergile, Genebrard, Philip of Bergamo,
 Papyre Masson, nor even Mariana, say that she was sent by God; and even
 though Mariana the Jesuit had said it, that would not deceive me.
 
 Mezerai relates "that the prince of the celestial militia appeared to
 her." I am sorry for Mezerai, and I ask pardon of the prince of the
 celestial militia.
 
 Most of our historians, who copy each other, suppose that the Maid
 uttered prophecies, and that her prophecies were accomplished. She is
 made to say that "she will drive the English out of the kingdom," and
 they were still there five years after her death. She is said to have
 written a long letter to the King of England, and assuredly she could
 neither read nor write; such an education was not given to an inn
 servant in the Barois; and the information laid against her states that
 she could not sign her name.
 
 But, it is said, she found a rusted sword, the blade of which was
 engraved with five golden _fleurs-de-lis_; and this sword was hidden in
 the church of Sainte Catherine de Fierbois at Tours. There, certainly is
 a great miracle!
 
 Poor Joan of Arc having been captured by the English, despite her
 prophecies and her miracles, maintained first of all in her
 cross-examination that St. Catherine and St. Marguerite had honoured her
 with many revelations. I am astonished that she never said anything of
 her talks with the prince of the celestial militia. These two saints
 apparently liked talking better than St. Michael. Her judges thought her
 a sorceress, she thought herself inspired.
 
 One great proof that Charles VII.'s captains made use of the marvellous
 in order to encourage the soldiers, in the deplorable state to which
 France was reduced, is that Saintrailles had his shepherd, as the Comte
 de Dunois had his shepherdess. The shepherd made prophecies on one side,
 while the shepherdess made them on the other.
 
 But unfortunately the Comte de Dunois' prophetess was captured at the
 siege of Compiegne by a bastard of Vendome, and Saintrailles' prophet
 was captured by Talbot. The gallant Talbot was far from having the
 shepherd burned. This Talbot was one of those true Englishmen who scorn
 superstition, and who have not the fanaticism for punishing fanatics.
 
 This, it seems to me, is what the historians should have observed, and
 what they have neglected.
 
 The Maid was taken to Jean de Luxembourg, Comte de Ligny. She was shut
 up in the fortress of Beaulieu, then in that of Beaurevoir, and from
 there in that of Crotoy in Picardy.
 
 First of all Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais, who was of the King of
 England's party against his own legitimate king, claims the Maid as a
 sorceress arrested on the limits of his diocese. He wishes to judge her
 as a sorceress. He supported the right he claimed by a downright lie.
 Joan had been captured on the territory of the bishopric of Noyon: and
 neither the Bishop of Beauvais, nor the Bishop of Noyon assuredly had
 the right of condemning anybody, and still less of committing to death a
 subject of the Duke of Lorraine, and a warrior in the pay of the King of
 France.
 
 There was at that time (who would believe it?) a vicar-general of the
 Inquisition in France, by name Brother Martin.[8] It was one of the most
 horrible effects of the total subversion of that unfortunate country.
 Brother Martin claimed the prisoner as smelling of heresy (_odorantem
 haeresim_). He called upon the Duke of Burgundy and the Comte de Ligny,
 "by the right of his office, and of the authority given to him by the
 Holy See, to deliver Joan to the Holy Inquisition."
 
 The Sorbonne hastened to support Brother Martin, and wrote to the Duke
 of Burgundy and to Jean de Luxembourg--"You have used your noble power
 to apprehend this woman who calls herself the Maid, by means of whom the
 honour of God has been immeasurably offended, the faith exceedingly
 hurt, and the Church too greatly dishonoured; for by reason of her,
 idolatry, errors, bad doctrine, and other inestimable evils have ensued
 in this kingdom ... but what this woman has done would be of small
 account, if did not ensue what is meet for satisfying the offence
 perpetrated by her against our gentle Creator and His faith, and the
 Holy Church with her other innumerable misdeeds ... and it would be
 intolerable offence against the divine majesty if it happened that this
 woman were freed."[9]
 
 Finally, the Maid was awarded to Jean Cauchon whom people called the
 unworthy bishop, the unworthy Frenchman, and the unworthy man. Jean de
 Luxembourg sold the Maid to Cauchon and the English for ten thousand
 livres, and the Duke of Bedford paid them. The Sorbonne, the bishop and
 Brother Martin, then presented a new petition to this Duke of Bedford,
 regent of France, "in honour of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, for
 that the said Joan may be briefly put into the hands of the Church."
 Joan was led to Rouen. The archbishopric was vacant at that time, and
 the chapter permitted the Bishop of Beauvais to _work_ in the town.
 (_Besogner_ is the term which was used.) He chose as assessors nine
 doctors of the Sorbonne with thirty-five other assistants, abbots or
 monks. The vicar of the Inquisition, Martin, presided with Cauchon; and
 as he was only a vicar, he had but second place.
 
 Joan underwent fourteen examinations; they are singular. She said that
 she saw St. Catherine and St. Marguerite at Poitiers. Doctor Beaupere
 asks her how she recognized the saints. She answers that it was by their
 way of bowing. Beaupere asks her if they are great chatterboxes. "Go
 look on the register," she says. Beaupere asks her if, when she saw St.
 Michael, he was naked. She answers: "Do you think our Lord had nothing
 to clothe him with?"
 
 The curious will carefully observe here that Joan had long been directed
 with other religious women of the populace by a rogue named Richard,[10]
 who performed miracles, and who taught these girls to perform them. One
 day he gave communion three times in succession to Joan, in honour of
 the Trinity. It was then the custom in matters of importance and in
 times of great peril. The knights had three masses said, and
 communicated three times when they went to seek fortune or to fight in a
 duel. It is what has been observed on the part of the Chevalier Bayard.
 
 The workers of miracles, Joan's companions, who were submissive to
 Richard, were named Pierrone and Catherine. Pierrone affirmed that she
 had seen that God appeared to her in human form as a friend to a friend.
 God was "clad in a long white robe, etc."
 
 Up to the present the ridiculous; here now is the horrible.
 
 One of Joan's judges, doctor of theology and priest, by name Nicholas
 _the Bird-Catcher_, comes to confess her in prison. He abuses the
 sacrament to the point of hiding behind a piece of serge two priests who
 transcribed Joan of Arc's confession. Thus did the judges use sacrilege
 in order to be murderers. And an unfortunate idiot, who had had enough
 courage to render very great services to the king and the country, was
 condemned to be burned by forty-four French priests who immolated her
 for the English faction.
 
 It is sufficiently well-known how someone had the cunning and meanness
 to put a man's suit beside her to tempt her to wear this suit again, and
 with what absurd barbarism this transgression was claimed as a pretext
 for condemning her to the flames, as if in a warrior girl it was a crime
 worthy of the fire, to put on breeches instead of a skirt. All this
 wrings the heart, and makes common sense shudder. One cannot conceive
 how we dare, after the countless horrors of which we have been guilty,
 call any nation by the name of barbarian.
 
 Most of our historians, lovers of the so-called embellishments of
 history rather than of truth, say that Joan went fearlessly to the
 torture; but as the chronicles of the times bear witness, and as the
 historian Villaret admits, she received her sentence with cries and
 tears; a weakness pardonable in her sex, and perhaps in ours, and very
 compatible with the courage which this girl had displayed amid the
 dangers of war; for one can be fearless in battle, and sensitive on the
 scaffold.
 
 I must add that many persons have believed without any examination that
 the Maid of Orleans was not burned at Rouen at all, although we have the
 official report of her execution. They have been deceived by the account
 we still have of an adventuress who took the name of the "Maid,"
 deceived Joan of Arc's brothers, and under cover of this imposture,
 married in Lorraine a nobleman of the house of Armoise. There were two
 other rogues who also passed themselves off as the "Maid of Orleans."
 All three claimed that Joan was not burned at all, and that another
 woman had been substituted for her. Such stories can be admitted only by
 those who want to be deceived.
 
 
 FOOTNOTES:
 
 [8] Beuchot says: There was at that time in France an
 Inquisitor-General, named Brother Jean or Jacques le Graverend. His
 vice-inquisitor or vicar, who took part in Joan's trial, was not called
 Brother Martin, but Brother Jean Magistri or the Master.
 
 [9] This is a translation of the Latin of the Sorbonne, made long after.
 
 [10] Beuchot says that Berriat Saint-Prix, in his "Jeanne d'Arc,"
 proves, page 341 _et seq._, that the imputations against Brother Richard
 are groundless, and that he could exercise no influence at the trial.
 
 
 
 
 _KISSING_
 
 
 I ask pardon of the boys and the girls; but maybe they will not find
 here what they will seek. This article is only for scholars and serious
 persons for whom it is barely suitable.
 
 There is but too much question of kissing in the comedies of Moliere's
 time. Champagne, in the comedy of "La Mere Coquette" by Quinault, asks
 kisses of Laurette; she says to him--"You are not content, then; really
 it is shameful; I have kissed you twice." Champagne answers her--"What!
 you keep account of your kisses?" (Act I. Sc. 1.).
 
 The valets always used to ask kisses of the soubrettes; people kissed
 each other on the stage. Usually it was very dull and very intolerable,
 particularly in the case of ugly actors, who were nauseating.
 
 If the reader wants kisses, let him look for them in the "Pastor Fido";
 there is one entire chorus where nothing but kisses is mentioned; and
 the piece is founded solely on a kiss that Mirtillo gave one day to
 Amarilli, in a game of blind man's buff, _un bacio molto saporito_.
 
 Everyone knows the chapter on kisses, in which Jean de la Casa,
 Archbishop of Benevento, says that people can kiss each other from head
 to foot. He pities the people with big noses who can only approach each
 other with difficulty; and he counsels ladies with long noses to have
 flat-nosed lovers.
 
 The kiss was a very ordinary form of salutation throughout ancient
 times. Plutarch recalls that the conspirators, before killing Caesar,
 kissed his face, hand and breast. Tacitus says that when Agricola, his
 father-in-law, returned from Rome, Domitian received him with a cold
 kiss, said nothing to him, and left him confounded in the crowd. The
 inferior who could not succeed in greeting his superior by kissing him,
 put his mouth to his own hand, and sent him a kiss that the other
 returned in the same way if he so wished.
 
 This sign was used even for worshipping the gods. Job, in his parable
 (Chap. xxxi.), which is perhaps the oldest of known books, says that he
 has not worshipped the sun and the moon like the other Arabs, that he
 has not carried his hand to his mouth as he looked at the stars.
 
 In our Occident nothing remains of this ancient custom but the puerile
 and genteel civility that is still taught to children in some small
 towns, of kissing their right hands when someone has given them some
 sweets.
 
 It was a horrible thing to betray with a kiss; it was that that made
 Caesar's assassination still more hateful. We know all about Judas'
 kisses; they have become proverbial.
 
 Joab, one of David's captains, being very jealous of Amasa, another
 captain, says to him (2 Sam. xx. 9): "Art thou in health, my brother?
 And he took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him," and
 with his other hand drew his sword and "smote him therewith in the fifth
 rib, and shed out his bowels on the ground."
 
 No other kiss is to be found in the other fairly frequent assassinations
 which were committed among the Jews, unless it be perhaps the kisses
 which Judith gave to the captain Holophernes, before cutting off his
 head while he was in bed asleep; but no mention is made of them, and the
 thing is merely probable.
 
 In one of Shakespeare's tragedies called "Othello," this Othello, who is
 a black, gives two kisses to his wife before strangling her. That seems
 abominable to honourable people; but Shakespeare's partisans say it is
 beautifully natural, particularly in a black.
 
 When Giovanni Galeas Sforza was assassinated in Milan Cathedral, on St.
 Stephen's day, the two Medici in the Reparata church; Admiral Coligny,
 the Prince of Orange, the Marechal d'Ancre, the brothers Witt, and so
 many others; at least they were not kissed.
 
 There was among the ancients I know not what of symbolic and sacred
 attached to the kiss, since one kissed the statues of the gods and their
 beards, when the sculptors had shown them with a beard. Initiates kissed
 each other at the mysteries of Ceres, as a sign of concord.
 
 The early Christians, men and women, kissed each other on the mouth at
 their _agapae_. This word signified "love-feast." They gave each other
 the holy kiss, the kiss of peace, the kiss of brother and sister, +agion
 philema+. This custom lasted for more than four centuries, and was
 abolished at last on account of its consequences. It was these kisses of
 peace, these agapae of love, these names of "brother" and "sister," that
 long drew to the little-known Christians, those imputations of
 debauchery with which the priests of Jupiter and the priestesses of
 Vesta charged them. You see in Petronius, and in other profane authors,
 that the libertines called themselves "brother" and "sister." It was
 thought that among the Christians the same names signified the same
 infamies. They were innocent accomplices in spreading these accusations
 over the Roman empire.
 
 There were in the beginning seventeen different Christian societies,
 just as there were nine among the Jews, including the two kinds of
 Samaritans. The societies which flattered themselves at being the most
 orthodox accused the others of the most inconceivable obscenities. The
 term of "gnostic," which was at first so honourable, signifying
 "learned," "enlightened," "pure," became a term of horror and scorn, a
 reproach of heresy. Saint Epiphanius, in the third century, claimed that
 they used first to tickle each other, the men and the women; that then
 they gave each other very immodest kisses, and that they judged the
 degree of their faith by the voluptuousness of these kisses; that the
 husband said to his wife, in presenting a young initiate to her: "Have
 an agape with my brother," and that they had an agape.
 
 We do not dare repeat here, in the chaste French tongue,[11] what Saint
 Epiphanius adds in Greek (Epiphanius, _contra haeres_, lib. I., vol. ii).
 We will say merely that perhaps this saint was somewhat imposed upon;
 that he allowed himself to be too carried away by zeal, and that all
 heretics are not hideous debauchees.
 
 The sect of Pietists, wishing to imitate the early Christians, to-day
 give each other kisses of peace on leaving the assembly, calling each
 other "my brother, my sister"; it is what, twenty years ago, a very
 pretty and very human Pietist lady avowed to me. The ancient custom was
 to kiss on the mouth; the Pietists have carefully preserved it.
 
 There was no other manner of greeting dames in France, Germany, Italy,
 England; it was the right of cardinals to kiss queens on the mouth, and
 in Spain even. What is singular is that they had not the same
 prerogative in France, where ladies always had more liberty than
 anywhere else, but "every country has its ceremonies," and there is no
 usage so general that chance and custom have not provided exceptions. It
 would have been an incivility, an affront, for an honourable woman, when
 she received a lord's first visit, not to have kissed him, despite his
 moustaches. "It is a displeasing custom," says Montaigne (Book III.,
 chap. v.), "and offensive to ladies, to have to lend their lips to
 whoever has three serving-men in his suite, disagreeable though he be."
 This custom was, nevertheless, the oldest in the world.
 
 If it is disagreeable for a young and pretty mouth to stick itself out
 of courtesy to an old and ugly mouth, there was a great danger between
 fresh, red mouths of twenty to twenty-five years old; and that is what
 finally brought about the abolition of the ceremony of kissing in the
 mysteries and the agapae. It is what caused women to be confined among
 the Orientals, so that they might kiss only their fathers and their
 brothers; custom long since introduced into Spain by the Arabs.
 
 Behold the danger: there is one nerve of the fifth pair which goes from
 the mouth to the heart, and thence lower down, with such delicate
 industry has nature prepared everything! The little glands of the lips,
 their spongy tissue, their velvety paps, the fine skin, ticklish, gives
 them an exquisite and voluptuous sensation, which is not without analogy
 with a still more hidden and still more sensitive part. Modesty may
 suffer from a lengthily savoured kiss between two Pietists of eighteen.
 
 It is to be remarked that the human species, the turtledoves and the
 pigeons alone are acquainted with kisses; thence came among the Latins
 the word _columbatim_, which our language has not been able to render.
 There is nothing of which abuse has not been made. The kiss, designed by
 nature for the mouth, has often been prostituted to membranes which do
 not seem made for this usage. One knows of what the templars were
 accused.
 
 We cannot honestly treat this interesting subject at greater length,
 although Montaigne says: "One should speak thereof shamelessly: brazenly
 do we utter 'killing,' 'wounding,' 'betraying,' but of that we dare not
 speak but with bated breath."

 _LANGUAGES_
 
 
 There is no complete language, no language which can express all our
 ideas and all our sensations; their shades are too numerous, too
 imperceptible. Nobody can make known the precise degree of sensation he
 experiences. One is obliged, for example, to designate by the general
 names of "love" and "hate" a thousand loves and a thousand hates all
 different from each other; it is the same with our pleasures and our
 pains. Thus all languages are, like us, imperfect.
 
 They have all been made successively and by degrees according to our
 needs. It is the instinct common to all men which made the first
 grammars without perceiving it. The Lapps, the Negroes, as well as the
 Greeks, needed to express the past, the present and the future; and they
 did it: but as there has never been an assembly of logicians who formed
 a language, no language has been able to attain a perfectly regular
 plan.
 
 All words, in all possible languages, are necessarily the images of
 sensations. Men have never been able to express anything but what they
 felt. Thus everything has become metaphor; everywhere the soul is
 enlightened, the heart burns, the mind wanders. Among all peoples the
 infinite has been the negation of the finite; immensity the negation of
 measure. It is evident that our five senses have produced all languages,
 as well as all our ideas. The least imperfect are like the laws: those
 in which there is the least that is arbitrary are the best. The most
 complete are necessarily those of the peoples who have cultivated the
 arts and society. Thus the Hebraic language should be one of the
 poorest languages, like the people who used to speak it. How should the
 Hebrews have had maritime terms, they who before Solomon had not a boat?
 how the terms of philosophy, they who were plunged in such profound
 ignorance up to the time when they started to learn something in their
 migration to Babylon? The language of the Phoenicians, from which the
 Hebrews drew their jargon, should be very superior, because it was the
 idiom of an industrious, commercial, rich people, distributed all over
 the earth.
 
 The most ancient known language should be that of the nation most
 anciently gathered together as a body of people. It should be, further,
 that of the people which has been least subjugated, or which, having
 been subjugated, has civilized its conquerors. And in this respect, it
 is constant that Chinese and Arabic are the most ancient of all those
 that are spoken to-day.
 
 There is no mother-tongue. All neighbouring nations have borrowed from
 each other: but one has given the name of "mother-tongue" to those from
 which some known idioms are derived. For example, Latin is the
 mother-tongue in respect of Italian, Spanish and French: but it was
 itself derived from Tuscan; and Tuscan was derived from Celtic and
 Greek.
 
 The most beautiful of all languages must be that which is at once, the
 most complete, the most sonorous, the most varied in its twists and the
 most regular in its progress, that which has most compound words, that
 which by its prosody best expresses the soul's slow or impetuous
 movements, that which most resembles music.
 
 Greek has all these advantages: it has not the roughness of Latin, in
 which so many words end in _um_, _ur_, _us_. It has all the pomp of
 Spanish, and all the sweetness of Italian. It has above all the living
 languages of the world the expression of music, by long and short
 syllables, and by the number and variety of its accents. Thus all
 disfigured as it is to-day in Greece, it can still be regarded as the
 most beautiful language in the universe.
 
 The most beautiful language cannot be the most widely distributed, when
 the people which speaks it is oppressed, not numerous, without commerce
 with other nations, and when these other nations have cultivated their
 own languages. Thus Greek should be less diffused than Arabic, and even
 Turkish.
 
 Of all European languages French should be the most general, because it
 is the most suited to conversation: it has taken its character from that
 of the people which speaks it.
 
 The French have been, for nearly a hundred and fifty years, the people
 which has best known society, which the first discarded all
 embarrassment, and the first among whom women were free and even
 sovereign, when elsewhere they were only slaves. The always uniform
 syntax of this language, which admits no inversions, is a further
 facility barely possessed by other tongues; it is more current coin than
 others, even though it lacks weight. The prodigious quantity of
 agreeably frivolous books which this nation has produced is a further
 reason for the favour which its language has obtained among all nations.
 
 Profound books will not give vogue to a language: they will be
 translated; people will learn Newton's philosophy; but they will not
 learn English in order to understand it.
 
 What makes French still more common is the perfection to which the drama
 has been carried in this tongue. It is to "Cinna," "Phedre," the
 "Misanthrope" that it owes its vogue, and not to the conquests of Louis
 XIV.
 
 It is not so copious and so flexible as Italian, or so majestic as
 Spanish, or so energetic as English; and yet it has had more success
 than these three languages from the sole fact that it is more suited to
 intercourse, and that there are more agreeable books in it than
 elsewhere. It has succeeded like the cooks of France, because it has
 more flattered general taste.
 
 The same spirit which has led the nations to imitate the French in their
 furniture, in the arrangement of rooms, in gardens, in dancing, in all
 that gives charm, has led them also to speak their language. The great
 art of good French writers is precisely that of the women of this
 nation, who dress better than the other women of Europe, and who,
 without being more beautiful, appear to be so by the art with which they
 adorn themselves, by the noble and simple charm they give themselves so
 naturally.
 
 It is by dint of good breeding that this language has managed to make
 the traces of its former barbarism disappear. Everything would bear
 witness to this barbarism to whosoever should look closely. One would
 see that the number _vingt_ comes from _viginti_, and that formerly this
 _g_ and this _t_ were pronounced with a roughness characteristic of all
 the northern nations; of the month of _Augustus_ has been made the month
 of _aout_. Not so long ago a German prince thinking that in France one
 never pronounced the term _Auguste_ otherwise, called King Auguste of
 Poland King Aout. All the letters which have been suppressed in
 pronunciation, but retained in writing, are our former barbarous
 clothes.
 
 It was when manners were softened that the language also was softened:
 before Francois Ier summoned women to his court, it was as clownish as
 we were. It would have been as good to speak old Celtic as the French of
 the time of Charles VIII. and Louis XII.: German was not more harsh.
 
 It has taken centuries to remove this rust. The imperfections which
 remain would still be intolerable, were it not for the continual care
 one takes to avoid them, as a skilful horseman avoids stones in the
 road. Good writers are careful to combat the faulty expressions which
 popular ignorance first brings into vogue, and which, adopted by bad
 authors, then pass into the gazettes and the pamphlets. _Roastbeef_
 signifies in English _roasted ox_, and our waiters talk to us nowadays
 of a "roastbeef of mutton." _Riding-coat_ means _a coat for going on
 horseback_; of it people have made _redingote_, and the populace thinks
 it an ancient word of the language. It has been necessary to adopt this
 expression with the people because it signifies an article of common
 use.
 
 In matters of arts and crafts and necessary things, the common people
 subjugated the court, if one dare say so; just as in matters of religion
 those who most despise the common run of people are obliged to speak and
 to appear to think like them.
 
 To call things by the names which the common people has imposed on them
 is not to speak badly; but one recognizes a people naturally more
 ingenious than another by the proper names which it gives to each thing.
 
 It is only through lack of imagination that a people adapts the same
 expression to a hundred different ideas. It is a ridiculous sterility
 not to have known how to express otherwise _an arm of the sea_, _a scale
 arm_, _an arm of a chair_; there is poverty of thought in saying equally
 the _head of a nail_, the _head of an army_.
 
 Ignorance has introduced another custom into all modern languages. A
 thousand terms no longer signify what they should signify. _Idiot_ meant
 _solitary_, to-day it means _foolish_; _epiphany_ signified
 _appearance_, to-day it is the festival of three kings; _baptize_ is to
 dip in water, we say _baptize with the name_ of John or James.
 
 To these defects in almost all languages are added barbarous
 irregularities. Venus is a charming name, _venereal_ is abominable.
 Another result of the irregularity of these languages composed at hazard
 in uncouth times is the quantity of compound words of which the simple
 form does not exist any more. They are children who have lost their
 father. We have _architects_ and no _tects_; there are things which are
 _ineffable_ and none which are _effable_. One is _intrepid_, one is not
 _trepid_. There are _impudent_ fellows, _insolent_ fellows, but neither
 _pudent_ fellows nor _solent_ fellows. All languages more or less retain
 some of these defects; they are all irregular lands from which the hand
 of the adroit artist knows how to derive advantage.
 
 Other defects which make a nation's character evident always slip into
 languages. In France there are fashions in expressions as in ways of
 doing the hair. A fashionable invalid or doctor will take it into his
 head to say that he has had a _soupcon_ of fever to signify that he has
 had a slight attack; soon the whole nation has _soupcons_ of colics,
 _soupcons_ of hatred, love, ridicule. Preachers in the pulpit tell you
 that you must have at least a _soupcon_ of God's love. After a few
 months this fashion gives place to another.
 
 What does most harm to the nobility of the language is not this passing
 fashion with which people are soon disgusted, not the solecisms of
 fashionable people into which good authors do not fall, but the
 affectation of mediocre authors in speaking of serious things in a
 conversational style. Everything conspires to corrupt a language that is
 rather widely diffused; authors who spoil the style by affectation;
 those who write to foreign countries, and who almost always mingle
 foreign expressions with their natural tongue; merchants who introduce
 into conversation their business terms.
 
 All languages being imperfect, it does not follow that one should change
 them. One must adhere absolutely to the manner in which the good authors
 have spoken them; and when one has a sufficient number of approved
 authors, a language is fixed. Thus one can no longer change anything in
 Italian, Spanish, English, French, without corrupting them; the reason
 is clear: it is that one would soon render unintelligible the books
 which provide the instruction and the pleasure of the nations.
 
 
 
 
 _LAWS_
 
 
 Sheep live very placidly in community, they are considered very
 easy-going, because we do not see the prodigious quantity of animals
 they devour. It is even to be believed that they eat them innocently and
 without knowing it, like us when we eat a Sassenage cheese. The republic
 of the sheep is a faithful representation of the golden age.
 
 A chicken-run is visibly the most perfect monarchic state. There is no
 king comparable to a cock. If he marches proudly in the midst of his
 people, it is not out of vanity. If the enemy approaches, he does not
 give orders to his subjects to go to kill themselves for him by virtue
 of his certain knowledge and plenary power; he goes to battle himself,
 ranges his chickens behind him and fights to the death. If he is the
 victor, he himself sings the _Te Deum_. In civil life there is no one so
 gallant, so honest, so disinterested. He has all the virtues. Has he in
 his royal beak a grain of corn, a grub, he gives it to the first lady
 among his subjects who presents herself. Solomon in his harem did not
 come near a poultry-yard cock.
 
 If it be true that the bees are governed by a queen to whom all her
 subjects make love, that is a still more perfect government.
 
 The ants are considered to be an excellent democracy. Democracy is above
 all the other States, because there everyone is equal, and each
 individual works for the good of all.
 
 The republic of the beavers is still superior to that of the ants, at
 least if we judge by their masonry work.
 
 The monkeys resemble strolling players rather than a civilized people;
 and they do not appear to be gathered together under fixed, fundamental
 laws, like the preceding species.
 
 We resemble the monkeys more than any other animal by the gift of
 imitation, the frivolity of our ideas, and by our inconstancy which has
 never allowed us to have uniform and durable laws.
 
 When nature formed our species and gave us instincts, self-esteem for
 our preservation, benevolence for the preservation of others, love which
 is common to all the species, and the inexplicable gift of combining
 more ideas than all the animals together; when she had thus given us our
 portion, she said to us: "Do as you can."
 
 There is no good code in any country. The reason for this is evident;
 the laws have been made according to the times, the place and the need,
 etc.
 
 When the needs have changed, the laws which have remained, have become
 ridiculous. Thus the law which forbade the eating of pig and the
 drinking of wine was very reasonable in Arabia, where pig and wine are
 injurious; it is absurd at Constantinople.
 
 The law which gives the whole fee to the eldest son is very good in
 times of anarchy and pillage. Then the eldest son is the captain of the
 castle which the brigands will attack sooner or later; the younger sons
 will be his chief officers, the husbandmen his soldiers. All that is to
 be feared is that the younger son may assassinate or poison the Salian
 lord his elder brother, in order to become in his turn the master of the
 hovel; but these cases are rare, because nature has so combined our
 instincts and our passions that we have more horror of assassinating our
 elder brother than we have of being envious of his position. But this
 law, suitable for the owners of dungeons in Chilperic's time is
 detestable when there is question of sharing stocks in a city.
 
 To the shame of mankind, one knows that the laws of games are the only
 ones which everywhere are just, clear, inviolable and executed. Why is
 the Indian who gave us the rules of the game of chess willingly obeyed
 all over the world, and why are the popes' decretals, for example,
 to-day an object of horror and scorn? the reason is that the inventor of
 chess combined everything with precision for the satisfaction of the
 players, and that the popes, in their decretals, had nothing in view but
 their own interest. The Indian wished to exercise men's minds equally,
 and give them pleasure; the popes wished to besot men's minds. Also, the
 essence of the game of chess has remained the same for five thousand
 years, it is common to all the inhabitants of the earth; and the
 decretals are known only at Spoletto, Orvieto, Loretto, where the
 shallowest lawyer secretly hates and despises them.
 
 But I delight in thinking that there is a natural law independent of all
 human conventions: the fruit of my work must belong to me; I must honour
 my father and my mother; I have no right over my fellow's life, and my
 fellow has none over mine, etc. But when I think that from Chedorlaomer
 to Mentzel,[12] colonel of hussars, everyone loyally kills and pillages
 his fellow with a licence in his pocket, I am very afflicted.
 
 I am told that there are laws among thieves, and also laws of war. I ask
 what are these laws of war. I learn that they mean hanging a brave
 officer who has held fast in a bad post without cannon against a royal
 army; that they mean having a prisoner hanged, if the enemy has hanged
 one of yours; that they mean putting to the fire and the sword villages
 which have not brought their sustenance on the appointed day, according
 to the orders of the gracious sovereign of the district. "Good," say I,
 "that is the 'Spirit of the Laws.'"
 
 It seems to me that most men have received from nature enough common
 sense to make laws, but that everyone is not just enough to make good
 laws.

 13th, 1742.
 
 
 
 
 _LIBERTY_
 
 
 Either I am very much mistaken, or Locke the definer has very well
 defined liberty as "power." I am mistaken again, or Collins, celebrated
 London magistrate, is the only philosopher who has really sifted this
 idea, and Clark's answer to him was merely that of a theologian. But of
 all that has been written in France on liberty, the following little
 dialogue seems to me the most clear.
 
 A: There is a battery of guns firing in your ears, have you the liberty
 to hear them or not to hear them?
 
 B: Without doubt, I cannot stop myself hearing them.
 
 A: Do you want this gun to carry off your head and the heads of your
 wife and daughter, who are walking with you?
 
 B: What are you talking about? as long as I am of sound mind, I cannot
 want such a thing; it is impossible.
 
 A: Good; you hear this gun necessarily, and you wish necessarily that
 neither you nor your family shall die from a cannon shot while you are
 out for a walk; you have not the power either of not hearing or of
 wishing to remain here?
 
 B: Clearly.
 
 A: You have consequently taken some thirty steps in order to be
 sheltered from the gun, you have had the power to walk these few steps
 with me?
 
 B: Again very clearly.
 
 A: And if you had been a paralytic, you could not have avoided being
 exposed to this battery, you would necessarily have heard and received a
 gun shot; and you would be dead necessarily?
 
 B: Nothing is more true.
 
 A: In what then does your liberty consist, unless it be in the power
 that your self has exercised in performing what your will required of
 absolute necessity?
 
 B: You embarrass me; liberty then is nothing but the power of doing what
 I want to do?
 
 A: Think about it, and see if liberty can be understood otherwise.
 
 B: In that case my hunting dog is as free as I am; he has necessarily
 the will to run when he sees a hare, and the power of running if he has
 not a pain in his legs. I have then nothing above my dog; you reduce me
 to the state of the beasts.
 
 A: What poor sophistry from the poor sophists who have taught you.
 Indeed you are in a bad way to be free like your dog! Do you not eat,
 sleep, propagate like him, even almost to the attitude? Do you want the
 sense of smell other than through your nose? Why do you want to have
 liberty otherwise than your dog has?
 
 B: But I have a soul which reasons much, and my dog reasons hardly at
 all. He has almost only simple ideas, and I have a thousand metaphysical
 ideas.
 
 A: Well, you are a thousand times freer than he is; that is, you have a
 thousand times more power of thinking than he has; but you do not think
 otherwise than he does.
 
 B: What! I am not free to wish what I wish?
 
 A: What do you mean by that?
 
 B: I mean what everyone means. Doesn't one say every day, wishes are
 free?
 
 A: A proverb is not a reason; explain yourself more clearly.
 
 B: I mean that I am free to wish as I please.
 
 A: With your permission, that has no sense; do you not see that it is
 ridiculous to say, I wish to wish? You wish necessarily, as a result of
 the ideas that have offered themselves to you. Do you wish to be
 married; yes or no?
 
 B: But if I tell you that I want neither the one nor the other?
 
 A: You will be answering like someone who says: "Some believe Cardinal
 Mazarin to be dead, others believe him to be alive, and as for me I
 believe neither the one nor the other."
 
 B: Well, I want to be married.
 
 A: Ah! that is an answer. Why do you want to be married?
 
 B: Because I am in love with a beautiful, sweet, well-bred young girl,
 who is fairly rich and sings very well, whose parents are very honest
 people, and because I flatter myself I am loved by her, and very welcome
 to her family.
 
 A: That is a reason. You see that you cannot wish without reason. I
 declare to you that you are free to marry; that is, that you have the
 power to sign the contract, have your nuptials, and sleep with your
 wife.
 
 B: How now! I cannot wish without reason? And what will become of that
 other proverb: _Sit pro ratione voluntas_; my will is my reason, I wish
 because I wish?
 
 A: That is absurd, my dear fellow; there would be in you an effect
 without a cause.
 
 B: What! When I play at odds and evens, I have a reason for choosing
 evens rather than odds?
 
 A: Yes, undoubtedly.
 
 B: And what is that reason, if you please?
 
 A: The reason is that the idea of even rather than the opposite idea
 presents itself to your mind. It would be comic that there were cases
 where you wished because there was a cause of wishing, and that there
 were cases where you wished without any cause. When you wish to be
 married, you evidently feel the dominating reason; you do not feel it
 when you are playing at odds and evens; and yet there certainly must be
 one.
 
 B: But, I repeat, I am not free then?
 
 A: Your will is not free, but your actions are. You are free to act,
 when you have the power to act.
 
 B: But all the books I have read on the liberty of indifference....
 
 A: What do you mean by the liberty of indifference?
 
 B: I mean the liberty of spitting on the right or on the left, of
 sleeping on my right side or on my left, of taking a walk of four turns
 or five.
 
 A: Really the liberty you would have there would be a comic liberty! God
 would have given you a fine gift! It would really be something to boast
 of! Of what use to you would be a power which was exercised only on such
 futile occasions? But the fact is that it is ridiculous to suppose the
 will to wish to spit on the right. Not only is this will to wish absurd,
 but it is certain that several trifling circumstances determine you in
 these acts that you call indifferent. You are no more free in these acts
 than in the others. But, I repeat, you are free at all times, in all
 places, as soon as you do what you wish to do.
 
 B: I suspect you are right. I will think about it.[13]

 _LIBRARY_
 
 
 A big library has this in it of good, that it dismays those who look at
 it. Two hundred thousand volumes discourage a man tempted to print; but
 unfortunately he at once says to himself: "People do not read all those
 books, and they may read mine." He compares himself to a drop of water
 who complains of being lost in the ocean and ignored: a genius had pity
 on it; he caused it to be swallowed by an oyster; it became the most
 beautiful pearl in the Orient, and was the chief ornament in the throne
 of the Great Mogul. Those who are only compilers, imitators,
 commentators, splitters of phrases, usurious critics, in short, those on
 whom a genius has no pity, will always remain drops of water.
 
 Our man works in his garret, therefore, in the hope of becoming a pearl.
 
 It is true that in this immense collection of books there are about a
 hundred and ninety-nine thousand which will never be read, from cover to
 cover at least; but one may need to consult some of them once in a
 lifetime. It is a great advantage for whoever wishes to learn to find at
 his hand in the king's palace the volume and page he seeks, without
 being kept waiting a moment. It is one of the most noble institutions.
 No expense is more magnificent and more useful.
 
 The public library of the King of France is the finest in the whole
 world, less on account of the number and rarity of the volumes than of
 the ease and courtesy with which the librarians lend them to all
 scholars. This library is incontestably the most precious monument there
 is in France.
 
 This astounding multitude of books should not scare. We have already
 remarked that Paris contains about seven hundred thousand men, that one
 cannot live with them all, and that one chooses three or four friends.
 Thus must one no more complain of the multitude of books than of the
 multitude of citizens.
 
 A man who wishes to learn a little about his existence, and who has no
 time to waste, is quite embarrassed. He wishes to read simultaneously
 Hobbes, Spinoza, Bayle who wrote against them, Leibnitz who disputed
 with Bayle, Clarke who disputed with Leibnitz, Malebranche who differed
 from them all, Locke who passed as having confounded Malebranche,
 Stillingfleet who thought he had vanquished Locke, Cudworth who thinks
 himself above them because he is understood by no one. One would die of
 old age before having thumbed the hundredth part of the metaphysical
 romances.
 
 One is very content to have the most ancient books, as one inquires into
 the most ancient medals. It is that which makes the honour of a library.
 The oldest books in the world are the "Kings" of the Chinese, the
 "Shastabad" of the Brahmins, of which Mr. Holwell has brought to our
 knowledge admirable passages, what remains of the ancient Zarathustra,
 the fragments of Sanchoniathon which Eusebius has preserved for us and
 which bears the characteristics of the most remote antiquity. I do not
 speak of the "Pentateuch" which is above all one could say of it.
 
 We still have the prayer of the real Orpheus, which the hierophant
 recited in the old Greek mysteries. "Walk in the path of justice,
 worship the sole master of the universe. He is one; He is sole by
 Himself. All beings owe Him their existence; He acts in them and by
 them. He sees everything, and never has been seen by mortal eyes."
 
 St. Clement of Alexandria, the most learned of the fathers of the
 Church, or rather the only scholar in profane antiquity, gives him
 almost always the name of Orpheus of Thrace, of Orpheus the Theologian,
 to distinguish him from those who wrote later under his name.
 
 We have no longer anything either of Museus or of Linus. A few passages
 from these predecessors of Homer would well be an adornment to a
 library.
 
 Augustus had formed the library called the Palatine. The statue of
 Apollo presided over it. The emperor embellished it with busts of the
 best authors. One saw in Rome twenty-nine great public libraries. There
 are now more than four thousand important libraries in Europe. Choose
 which suits you, and try not to be bored.
 
 
 
 
 _LIMITS OF THE HUMAN MIND_
 
 
 Someone asked Newton one day why he walked when he wanted to, and how
 his arm and his hand moved at his will. He answered manfully that he had
 no idea. "But at least," his interlocutor said to him, "you who
 understand so well the gravitation of the planets will tell me why they
 turn in one direction rather than in another!" And he again confessed
 that he had no idea.
 
 Those who taught that the ocean was salt for fear that it might become
 putrid, and that the tides were made to bring our ships into port (The
 Abbe Pluche in "The Spectacle of Nature"), were somewhat ashamed when
 the reply was made to them that the Mediterranean has ports and no ebb.
 Musschenbroeck himself fell into this inadvertence.
 
 Has anyone ever been able to say precisely how a log is changed on the
 hearth into burning carbon, and by what mechanism lime is kindled by
 fresh water?
 
 Is the first principle of the movement of the heart in animals properly
 understood? does one know clearly how generation is accomplished? has
 one guessed what gives us sensations, ideas, memory? We do not
 understand the essence of matter any more than the children who touch
 its surface.
 
 Who will teach us by what mechanism this grain of wheat that we throw
 into the ground rises again to produce a pipe laden with an ear of corn,
 and how the same soil produces an apple at the top of this tree, and a
 chestnut on its neighbour? Many teachers have said--"What do I not
 know?" Montaigne used to say--"What do I know?"
 
 Ruthlessly trenchant fellow, wordy pedagogue, meddlesome theorist, you
 seek the limits of your mind. They are at the end of your nose.
 
 
 
 
 _LOCAL CRIMES_
 
 
 Traverse the whole earth, you will find that theft, murder, adultery,
 calumny are regarded as crimes which society condemns and curbs; but
 should what is approved in England, and condemned in Italy, be punished
 in Italy as an outrage against the whole of humanity? That is what I
 call a local crime. Does not that which is criminal only in the
 enclosure of some mountains, or between two rivers, demand of judges
 more indulgence than those outrages which are held in horror in all
 countries? Should not the judge say to himself: "I should not dare
 punish at Ragusa what I punish at Loretto"? Should not this reflection
 soften in his heart the hardness that it is only too easy to contract
 during the long exercise of his office?
 
 You know the _kermesses_ in Flanders; in the last century they were
 carried to a point of indecency which might revolt eyes unaccustomed to
 these spectacles. This is how Christmas was celebrated in some towns.
 First there appeared a young man half naked, with wings on his back; he
 recited the _Ave Maria_ to a young girl who answered him _fiat_, and the
 angel kissed her on the mouth: then a child enclosed in a great
 cardboard cock cried, imitating the cock's cry: _Puer natus est nobis._
 A big ox bellowed _ubi_, which it pronounced _oubi_; a sheep bleated
 _Bethlehem_. An ass cried _hihanus_, to signify _eamus_; a long
 procession, preceded by four fools with baubles and rattles, closed the
 performance. There remain to-day traces of these popular devotions,
 which among more educated peoples would be taken for profanations. A
 bad-tempered Swiss, more drunk maybe than those who played the roles of
 ox and ass, came to words with them in Louvain; blows were given; the
 people wanted to hang the Swiss, who escaped with difficulty.
 
 The same man had a violent quarrel at the Hague in Holland for having
 stoutly taken Barneveldt's part against an extravagant Gomarist. He was
 put into prison in Amsterdam for having said that priests are the
 scourge of humanity and the source of all our misfortunes. "What!" he
 said. "If one believes that good works make for salvation, one finds
 oneself in a dungeon; if one laughs at a cock and an ass, one risks
 being hanged." This adventure, burlesque though it is, makes it quite
 clear that one can be reprehensible on one or two points in our
 hemisphere, and be absolutely innocent in the rest of the world.
 
 
 
 
 _LOVE_
 
 
 There are so many sorts of love that one does not know to whom to
 address oneself for a definition of it. The name of "love" is given
 boldly to a caprice lasting a few days, a sentiment without esteem,
 gallants' affectations, a frigid habit, a romantic fantasy, relish
 followed by prompt disrelish: people give this name to a thousand
 chimeras.
 
 If philosophers want to probe to the bottom this barely philosophical
 matter, let them meditate on the banquet of Plato, in which Socrates,
 honourable lover of Alcibiades and Agathon, converses with them on the
 metaphysics of love.
 
 Lucretius speaks of it more as a natural philosopher: Virgil follows in
 the steps of Lucretius; _amor omnibus idem_.
 
 It is the stuff of nature broidered by nature. Do you want an idea of
 love? look at the sparrows in your garden; look at your pigeons; look at
 the bull which is brought to the heifer; look at this proud horse which
 two of your grooms lead to the quiet mare awaiting him; she draws aside
 her tail to welcome him; see how her eyes sparkle; hark to the neighing;
 watch the prancing, the curvetting, the ears pricked, the mouth opening
 with little convulsions, the swelling nostrils, the flaring breath, the
 manes rising and floating, the impetuous movement with which he hurls
 himself on the object which nature has destined for him; but be not
 jealous of him, and think of the advantages of the human species; in
 love they compensate for all those that nature has given to the
 animals--strength, beauty, nimbleness, speed.
 
 There are animals, even, who have no enjoyment in possession. Scale
 fish are deprived of this delight: the female throws millions of eggs on
 the mud; the male coming across them passes over them, and fertilizes
 them with his seed, without troubling about the female to whom they
 belong.
 
 Most animals that pair, taste pleasure only by a single sense, and as
 soon as the appetite is satisfied, everything is extinguished. No
 animal, apart from you, knows what kissing is; the whole of your body is
 sensitive; your lips especially enjoy a voluptuousness that nothing can
 tire; and this pleasure belongs to no species but yours: you can give
 yourself up to love at any time, and the animals have but a fixed time.
 If you reflect on these superiorities, you will say with the Count of
 Rochester--"In a country of atheists love would cause the Deity to be
 worshipped."
 
 As men have received the gift of perfecting all that nature accords
 them, they have perfected love. Cleanliness, the care of oneself, by
 rendering the skin more delicate, increase the pleasure of contact; and
 attention to one's health renders the organs of voluptuousness more
 sensitive. All the other sentiments that enter into that of love, just
 like metals which amalgamate with gold: friendship, regard, come to
 help; the faculties of mind and body are still further chains.
 
 Self-love above all tightens all these bonds. One applauds oneself for
 one's choice, and a crowd of illusions form the decoration of the
 building of which nature has laid the foundations.
 
 That is what you have above the animals. But if you taste so many
 pleasures unknown to them, how many sorrows too of which the beasts have
 no idea! What is frightful for you is that over three-fourths of the
 earth nature has poisoned the pleasures of love and the sources of life
 with an appalling disease to which man alone is subject, and which
 infects in him the organs of generation alone.
 
 It is in no wise with this plague as with so many other maladies that
 are the result of our excesses. It was not debauch that introduced it
 into the world. Phryne, Lais, Flora, Messalina and those like them,
 were not attacked by it; it was born in some islands where men lived in
 innocence, and thence spread itself over the ancient world.
 
 If ever one could accuse nature of despising her work, of contradicting
 her plans, of acting against her designs, it is in this detestable
 scourge which has soiled the earth with horror and filth. Is that the
 best of all possible worlds? What! if Caesar, Antony, Octavius never had
 this disease, was it not possible for it not to cause the death of
 Francois I.? "No," people say, "things were ordered thus for the best."
 I want to believe it; but it is sad for those to whom Rabelais dedicated
 his book.
 
 Erotic philosophers have often debated the question of whether Heloise
 could still really love Abelard when he was a monk and emasculate? One
 of these qualities did very great harm to the other.
 
 But console yourself, Abelard, you were loved; the root of the hewn tree
 still retains a remnant of sap; the imagination aids the heart. One can
 still be happy at table even though one eats no longer. Is it love? is
 it simply a memory? is it friendship? All that is composed of something
 indescribable. It is an obscure feeling resembling the fantastic
 passions retained by the dead in the Elysian fields. The heroes who,
 during their lifetime, shone in the chariot races, drove imaginary
 chariots when they were dead. Heloise lived with you on illusions and
 supplements. She kissed you sometimes, and with all the more pleasure
 that having taken a vow at the Paraclet monastery to love you no longer,
 her kisses thereby became more precious as more guilty. A woman can
 barely be seized with a passion for a eunuch: but she can keep her
 passion for her lover become eunuch, provided that he remains lovable.
 
 It is not the same, ladies, for a lover who has grown old in service;
 the externals subsist no longer; the wrinkles horrify; the white
 eyebrows shock; the lost teeth disgust; the infirmities estrange: all
 that one can do is to have the virtue of being nurse, and of tolerating
 what one has loved. It is burying a dead man.
 
 
 
 
 _LUXURY_
 
 
 People have declaimed against luxury for two thousand years, in verse
 and in prose, and people have always delighted in it.
 
 What has not been said of the early Romans when these brigands ravaged
 and pillaged the harvests; when, to enlarge their poor village, they
 destroyed the poor villages of the Volscians and the Samnites? They were
 disinterested, virtuous men; they had not yet been able to steal either
 gold, silver, or precious stones, because there were not any in the
 little towns they plundered. Their woods and their marshes produced
 neither pheasants nor partridges, and people praise their temperance.
 
 When gradually they had pillaged everything, stolen everything from the
 far end of the Adriatic Gulf to the Euphrates, and when they had enough
 intelligence to enjoy the fruit of their plundering; when they
 cultivated the arts, when they tasted of all pleasures, and when they
 even made the vanquished taste of them, they ceased then, people say, to
 be wise and honest men.
 
 All these declamations reduce themselves to proving that a robber must
 never either eat the dinner he has taken, or wear the coat he has
 pilfered, or adorn himself with the ring he has filched. He should throw
 all that, people say, in the river, so as to live like an honest man.
 Say rather that he should not have stolen. Condemn brigands when they
 pillage; but do not treat them as senseless when they enjoy. Honestly,
 when a large number of English sailors enriched themselves at the taking
 of Pondicherry and Havana, were they wrong to enjoy themselves later in
 London, as the price of the trouble they had had in the depths of Asia
 and America?
 
 The declaimers want one to bury in the ground the wealth one has amassed
 by the fortune of arms, by agriculture, by commerce and by industry.
 They cite Lacedaemon; why do they not cite also the republic of San
 Marino? What good did Sparto to Greece? Did she ever have Demosthenes,
 Sophocles, Apelles, Phidias? The luxury of Athens produced great men in
 every sphere; Sparta had a few captains, and in less number even than
 other towns. But how fine it is that as small a republic as Lacedaemon
 retains its poverty.[14]
 
 One arrives at death as well by lacking everything as by enjoying what
 can make life pleasant. The Canadian savage subsists, and comes to old
 age like the English citizen who has an income of fifty thousand
 guineas. But who will ever compare the land of the Iroquois to England?
 
 Let the republic of Ragusa and the canton of Zug make sumptuary laws,
 they are right, the poor man must not spend beyond his powers; but I
 have read somewhere:
 
 "Learn that luxury enriches a great state, even if it ruins a
 small."[15]
 
 If by luxury you understand excess, everyone knows that excess in any
 form is pernicious, in abstinence as in gluttony, in economy as in
 generosity. I do not know how it has happened that in my village where
 the land is ungrateful, the taxes heavy, the prohibition against
 exporting the corn one has sown intolerable, there is nevertheless
 barely a cultivator who has not a good cloth coat, and who is not well
 shod and well fed. If this cultivator toiled in his fields in his fine
 coat, with white linen, his hair curled and powdered, there, certainly,
 would be the greatest luxury, and the most impertinent; but that a
 bourgeois of Paris or London should appear at the theatre clad like a
 peasant, there would be the most vulgar and ridiculous niggardliness.
 
 When scissors, which are certainly not of the remotest antiquity, were
 invented, what did people not say against the first men who pared their
 nails, and who cut part of the hair which fell on their noses? They were
 treated, without a doubt, as fops and prodigals, who bought an
 instrument of vanity at a high price, in order to spoil the Creator's
 handiwork. What an enormous sin to cut short the horn which God made to
 grow at the end of our fingers! It was an outrage against the Deity! It
 was much worse when shirts and socks were invented. One knows with what
 fury the aged counsellors who had never worn them cried out against the
 young magistrates who were addicted to this disastrous luxury.[16]
 
 
 FOOTNOTES:
 
 [14] Lacedaemon avoided luxury only by preserving the community or
 equality of property; but she did not preserve either the one or the
 other save by having the land cultivated by an enslaved people. The
 existence of the equality or community of property supposes the
 existence of an enslaved people. The Spartans had virtue, just like
 highwaymen, inquisitors and all classes of men whom habit has
 familiarized with a species of crime, to the point of committing them
 without remorse.
 
 [15] The sumptuary laws are by their nature a violation of the right of
 property. If in a little state there is not a great inequality of
 fortune, there will be no luxury; if this inequality exists, luxury is
 the remedy for it. It is her sumptuary laws that have lost Geneva her
 liberty.
 
 [16] If by luxury one understands everything that is beyond the
 necessary, luxury is a natural consequence of the progress of the human
 species; and to reason consequently every enemy of luxury should believe
 with Rousseau that the state of happiness and virtue for man is that,
 not of the savage, but of the orang-outang. One feels that it would be
 absurd to regard as an evil the comforts which all men would enjoy:
 also, does one not generally give the name of luxury to the
 superfluities which only a small number of individuals can enjoy. In
 this sense, luxury is a necessary consequence of property, without which
 no society can subsist, and of a great inequality between fortunes which
 is the consequence, not of the right of property, but of bad laws.
 Moralists should address their sermons to the legislators, and not to
 individuals, because it is in the order of possible things that a
 virtuous and enlightened man may have the power to make reasonable laws,
 and it is not in human nature for all the rich men of a country to
 renounce through virtue procuring for themselves for money the
 enjoyments of pleasure or vanity.
 
 
 
 
 _GENERAL REFLECTION ON MAN_
 
 
 It needs twenty years to lead man from the plant state in which he is
 within his mother's womb, and the pure animal state which is the lot of
 his early childhood, to the state when the maturity of the reason begins
 to appear. It has needed thirty centuries to learn a little about his
 structure. It would need eternity to learn something about his soul. It
 takes an instant to kill him.
 
 
 
 
 _MAN IN THE IRON MASK_
 
 
 The author of the "Siecle de Louis XIV."[17] is the first to speak of
 the man in the iron mask in an authenticated history. The reason is that
 he was very well informed about the anecdote which astonishes the
 present century, which will astonish posterity, and which is only too
 true. He was deceived about the date of the death of this singularly
 unfortunate unknown. The date of his burial at St. Paul was March 3rd,
 1703, and not 1704. (Note.--According to a certificate reported by
 Saint-Foix, the date was November 20th, 1703.)
 
 He was imprisoned first of all at Pignerol before being so on St.
 Margaret's Islands, and later in the Bastille; always under the same
 man's guard, Saint-Mars, who saw him die. Father Griffet, Jesuit, has
 communicated to the public the diary of the Bastille, which testifies to
 the dates. He had this diary without difficulty, for he held the
 delicate position of confessor of prisoners imprisoned in the Bastille.
 
 The man in the iron mask is a riddle to which everyone wishes to guess
 the answer. Some say that he was the Duc de Beaufort: but the Duc de
 Beaufort was killed by the Turks at the defence of Candia, in 1669; and
 the man in the iron mask was at Pignerol, in 1662. Besides, how would
 one have arrested the Duc de Beaufort surrounded by his army? how would
 one have transferred him to France without anybody knowing anything
 about it? and why should he have been put in prison, and why this mask?
 
 Others have considered the Comte de Vermandois, natural son of Louis
 XIV., who died publicly of the small-pox in 1683, with the army, and was
 buried in the town of Arras.
 
 Later it was thought that the Duke of Monmouth, whose head King James
 II. had cut off publicly in London in 1685, was the man in the iron
 mask. It would have been necessary for him to be resuscitated, and then
 for him to change the order of the times, for him to put the year 1662
 in place of 1685; for King James who never pardoned anyone, and who on
 that account deserved all his misfortunes, to have pardoned the Duke of
 Monmouth, and to have caused the death, in his place, of a man exactly
 like him. It would have been necessary to find this double who would
 have been so kind as to have his neck cut off in public in order to save
 the Duke of Monmouth. It would have been necessary for the whole of
 England to have been under a misapprehension; for James then to have
 sent his earnest entreaties to Louis XIV. to be so good as to serve as
 his constable and gaoler. Then Louis XIV. having done King James this
 little favour, would not have failed to have the same consideration for
 King William and for Queen Anne, with whom he was at war; and he would
 carefully have preserved in these two monarchs' consideration his
 dignity of gaoler, with which King James had honoured him.
 
 All these illusions being dissipated, it remains to be learned who was
 this prisoner who was always masked, the age at which he died, and under
 what name he was buried. It is clear that if he was not allowed to pass
 into the courtyard of the Bastille, if he was not allowed to speak to
 his doctor, unless covered by a mask, it was for fear that in his
 features might be recognized some too striking resemblance. He might
 show his tongue, and never his face. As regards his age, he himself said
 to the Bastille apothecary, a few days before his death, that he thought
 he was about sixty; and Master Marsolan, surgeon to the Marechal de
 Richelieu, and later to the Duc d'Orleans, regent, son-in-law of this
 apothecary, has repeated it to me more than once.
 
 Finally, why give him an Italian name? he was always called Marchiali!
 He who writes this article knows more about it, maybe, than Father
 Griffet, and will not say more.
 
 
 PUBLISHERS NOTE[18]
 
 It is surprising to see so many scholars and so many intelligent and
 sagacious writers torment themselves with guessing who can have been
 the famous man in the iron mask, without the simplest, most natural,
 most probable idea ever presenting itself to them. Once the fact as M.
 de Voltaire reports it is admitted, with its circumstances; the
 existence of a prisoner of so singular a species, put in the rank of the
 best authenticated historical truths; it seems that not only is nothing
 easier than to imagine who this prisoner was, but that it is even
 difficult for there to be two opinions on the subject. The author of
 this article would have communicated his opinion earlier, if he had not
 believed that this idea must already have come to many others, and if he
 were not persuaded that it was not worth while giving as a discovery
 what, according to him, jumps to the eyes of all who read this anecdote.
 
 However, as for some time past this event has divided men's minds, and
 as quite recently the public has again been given a letter in which it
 is claimed as proved that this celebrated prisoner was a secretary of
 the Duke of Mantua (which cannot be reconciled with the great marks of
 respect shown by M. de Saint-Mars to his prisoner), the author has
 thought it his duty to tell at last what has been his opinion for many
 years. Maybe this conjecture will put an end to all other researches,
 unless the secret be revealed by those who can be its guardians, in such
 a way as to remove all doubts.
 
 He will not amuse himself with refuting those who have imagined that
 this prisoner could be the Comte de Vermandois, the Duc de Beaufort, or
 the Duke of Monmouth. The scholarly and very wise author of this last
 opinion has well refuted the others; but he had based his own opinion
 essentially merely on the impossibility of finding in Europe some other
 prince whose detention it would have been of the very highest importance
 should not be known. M. de Saint-Foix is right, if he means to speak
 only of princes whose existence was known; but why has nobody yet
 thought of supposing that the iron mask might have been an unknown
 prince, brought up in secret, and whose existence it was important
 should remain unknown?
 
 The Duke of Monmouth was not for France a prince of such great
 importance; and one does not see even what could have engaged this
 power, at least after the death of this duke and of James II., to make
 so great a secret of his detention, if indeed he was the iron mask. It
 is hardly probable either that M. de Louvois and M. de Saint-Mars would
 have shown the Duke of Monmouth the profound respect which M. de
 Voltaire assures they showed the iron mask.
 
 The author conjectures, from the way that M. de Voltaire has told the
 facts, that this celebrated historian is as persuaded as he is of the
 suspicion which he is going, he says, to bring to light; but that M. de
 Voltaire, as a Frenchman, did not wish, he adds, to publish point-blank,
 particularly as he had said enough for the answer to the riddle not to
 be difficult to guess. Here it is, he continues, as I see it.
 
 "The iron mask was undoubtedly a brother and an elder brother of Louis
 XIV., whose mother had that taste for fine linen on which M. de Voltaire
 lays stress. It was in reading the Memoirs of that time, which report
 this anecdote about the queen, that, recalling this same taste in the
 iron mask, I doubted no longer that he was her son: a fact of which all
 the other circumstances had persuaded me already.
 
 "It is known that Louis XIII. had not lived with the queen for a long
 time; that the birth of Louis XIV. was due only to a happy chance
 skilfully induced; a chance which absolutely obliged the king to sleep
 in the same bed with the queen. This is how I think the thing came to
 pass.
 
 "The queen may have thought that it was her fault that no heir was born
 to Louis XIII. The birth of the iron mask will have undeceived her. The
 cardinal to whom she will have confided the fact will have known, for
 more than one reason, how to turn the secret to account; he will have
 thought of making use of this event for his own benefit and for the
 benefit of the state. Persuaded by this example that the queen could
 give the king children, the plan which produced the chance of one bed
 for the king and the queen was arranged in consequence. But the queen
 and the cardinal, equally impressed with the necessity of hiding from
 Louis XIII. the iron mask's existence, will have had him brought up in
 secret. This secret will have been a secret for Louis XIV. until
 Cardinal Mazarin's death.
 
 "But this monarch learning then that he had a brother, and an elder
 brother whom his mother could not disacknowledge, who further bore maybe
 the marked features which betrayed his origin, reflecting that this
 child born during marriage could not, without great inconvenience and a
 horrible scandal, be declared illegitimate after Louis XIII.'s death,
 Louis XIV. will have judged that he could not use a wiser or juster
 means than the one he employed in order to assure his own tranquillity
 and the peace of the state; means which relieved him of committing a
 cruelty which policy would have represented as necessary to a monarch
 less conscientious and less magnanimous than Louis XIV.
 
 "It seems to me, our author continues, that the more one knows of the
 history of those times, the more one must be struck by these assembled
 circumstances which are in favour of such a supposition."
 
 
 FOOTNOTES:
 
 [17] Voltaire.
 
 [18] This note, given as a publisher's note in the 1771 edition, passes
 among many men of letters as being by Voltaire himself. He knew of this
 edition, and he never contradicted the opinion there advanced on the
 subject of the man in the iron mask.
 
 He was the first to speak of this man. He always combated all the
 conjectures made about the mask: he always spoke as though better
 informed than others on the subject, and as though unwilling to tell all
 he knew.
 
 There is a letter in circulation from Mlle. de Valois, written to the
 Duke, afterward Marechal de Richelieu, where she boasts of having
 learned from the Duc d'Orleans, her father, under strange conditions,
 who the man in the iron mask was; this man, she says, was a twin brother
 of Louis XIV., born a few hours after him.
 
 Either this letter, which it was so useless, so indecent, so dangerous
 to read, is a supposititious letter, or the regent, in giving his
 daughter the reward she had so nobly acquired, thought to weaken the
 danger there was in revealing a state secret, by altering the facts, so
 as to make of this prince a younger son without right to the throne,
 instead of the heir-apparent to the crown.
 
 But Louis XIV., who had a brother; Louis XIV., whose soul was
 magnanimous; Louis XIV., who prided himself even on a scrupulous
 probity, whom history has reproached with no crime, who indeed committed
 no crime apart from letting himself be too swayed by the counsels of
 Louvois and the Jesuits; Louis XIV. would never have detained one of his
 brothers in perpetual prison, in order to forestall the evils announced
 by an astrologer, in whom he did not believe. He needed more important
 motives. Eldest son of Louis XIII., acknowledged by this prince, the
 throne belonged to him; but a son born of Anne of Austria, unknown to
 her husband, had no rights, and could, nevertheless, try to make himself
 acknowledged, rend France with a long civil war, win maybe over Louis
 XIII.'s son, by alleging the right of primogeniture, and substitute a
 new race for the old race of the Bourbons. These motives, if they did
 not entirely justify Louis XIV.'s rigour, serve at least to excuse him;
 and the prisoner, too well-informed of his fate, could be grateful to
 him for not having listened to more rigorous counsels, counsels which
 politics have often employed against those who had pretensions to
 thrones occupied by their competitors.
 
 From his youth Voltaire was connected with the Duc de Richelieu, who was
 not discreet: if Mlle. de Valois' letter is authentic, he knew of it;
 but, possessed of a just mind, he felt the error, and sought other
 information. He was in a position to obtain it; he rectified the truth
 altered in the letter, as he rectified so many other errors.
 
 
 
 
 _MARRIAGE_
 
 
 I came across a reasoner who said: "Engage your subjects to marry as
 soon as possible; let them be exempt from taxes the first year, and let
 their tax be distributed over those who at the same age are celibate.
 
 "The more married men you have, the less crime there will be. Look at
 the frightful records of your registers of crime; you will find there a
 hundred bachelors hanged or wheeled for one father of a family.
 
 "Marriage makes man wiser and more virtuous. The father of a family,
 near to committing a crime, is often stopped by his wife whose blood,
 less feverish than his, makes her gentler, more compassionate, more
 fearful of theft and murder, more timorous, more religious.
 
 "The father of a family does not want to blush before his children. He
 fears to leave them a heritage of shame.
 
 "Marry your soldiers, they will not desert any more. Bound to their
 families, they will be bound also to their fatherland. A bachelor
 soldier often is nothing but a vagabond, to whom it is indifferent
 whether he serves the king of Naples or the king of Morocco."
 
 The Roman warriors were married; they fought for their wives and
 children; and they enslaved the wives and children of other nations.
 
 A great Italian politician, who further was very learned in oriental
 languages, a very rare thing among our politicians, said to me in my
 youth: "_Caro figlio_, remember that the Jews have never had but one
 good institution, that of having a horror of virginity." If this little
 race of superstitious intermediaries had not considered marriage as the
 first law of man, if there had been among them convents of nuns, they
 were irreparably lost.
 
 
 
 
 _MASTER_
 
 
 SECTION I
 
 "Unfortunate that I am to have been born!" said Ardassan Ougli, young
 page of the great Sultan of the Turks. "If it were only the great Sultan
 on whom I am dependent; but I am subject to the chief of my oda, to the
 capigi pasha; and when I receive my pay, I have to bow down to one of
 the tefterdar's clerks who deducts half of it. Before I was seven years
 old I had cut off, in spite of myself, in ceremony, the end of my
 prepuce, and it made me ill for a fortnight. The dervish who prays for
 us is my master; an iman is still more my master; the mollah is still
 more my master than the iman. The cadi is another master; the
 cadi-leskier is master still more; the mufti is much more master than
 all these together. The grand vizier's kaia can with a word have me
 thrown into the canal; and the grand vizier, finally, can have my neck
 wrung at his pleasure, and stuff the skin of my head, without anybody
 even taking notice.
 
 "How many masters, great God! even if I had as many bodies and as many
 souls as I have duties to accomplish, I could not attend to everything.
 Oh, Allah! if only you had made me a screech-owl! I should live free in
 my hole, and I should eat mice at my ease without masters or servants.
 That assuredly is man's real destiny; only since he was perverted has he
 masters. No man was made to serve another man continuously. Each would
 have charitably aided his fellow, if things were as they should be. The
 man with eyes would have led the blind man, the active man would have
 acted as crutch to the cripple. This world would have been the paradise
 of Mohammed; and it is the hell which is exactly under the pointed
 bridge."
 
 Thus did Ardassan Ougli speak, after receiving the stirrup-leather from
 one of his masters.
 
 After a few years Ardassan Ougli became pasha with three tails. He made
 a prodigious fortune, and he firmly believed that all men, excepting the
 Great Turk and the Grand Vizier, were born to serve him, and all women
 to give him pleasure in accordance with his caprice.
 
 
 SECTION II
 
 How has it been possible for one man to become another man's master, and
 by what species of incomprehensible magic has he been able to become the
 master of many other men? On this phenomenon a great number of good
 volumes have been written; but I give the preference to an Indian fable,
 because it is short, and because the fables have said everything.
 
 Adimo, the father of all the Indians, had two sons and two daughters by
 his wife Procriti. The elder son was a giant, the younger was a little
 hunchback, the two daughters were pretty. As soon as the giant was
 conscious of his strength, he lay with his two sisters, and made the
 little hunchback serve him. Of his two sisters, one was his cook, the
 other his gardener. When the giant wanted to sleep, he started by
 chaining his little hunchback brother to a tree; and when the brother
 escaped, he caught him in four strides, and gave him twenty strokes with
 a length of ox sinew.
 
 The hunchback became submissive and the best subject in the world. The
 giant, satisfied to see him fulfilling his duties as subject, permitted
 him to lie with one of his sisters for whom he himself had taken a
 distaste. The children who came of this marriage were not entirely
 hunchbacked; but they had sufficiently misshapen forms. They were
 reared in fear of God and the giant. They received an excellent
 education; they were taught that their great uncle was giant by divine
 right, that he could do with his family as pleased him; that if he had a
 pretty niece or great-niece, she was for him alone without a doubt, and
 that no one could lie with her until he wanted her no longer.
 
 The giant having died, his son, who was not by a long way as strong and
 as big as he, thought nevertheless that he, like his father, was giant
 by divine right. He claimed to make all the men work for him, and to lie
 with all the women. The family leagued itself against him, he was beaten
 to death, and the others turned themselves into a republic.
 
 The Siamese, on the contrary, maintain that the family had started by
 being republican, and that the giant did not come until after a great
 number of years and dissensions; but all the authors of Benares and Siam
 agree that mankind lived an infinity of centuries before having the
 intelligence to make laws; and they prove it by an unanswerable reason,
 which is that even to-day when everyone plumes himself on his
 intelligence, no way has been found of making a score of passably good
 laws.
 
 It is indeed still an insoluble question in India whether republics were
 established before or after monarchies, whether confusion appeared more
 horrible to mankind than despotism. I do not know what happened in order
 of time; but in that of nature it must be agreed that all men being born
 equal, violence and adroitness made the first masters, the laws made the
 last.
 
 
 
 
 _MEN OF LETTERS_
 
 
 In our barbarous times, when the Franks, the Germans, the Bretons, the
 Lombards, the Spanish Muzarabs, knew not how either to read or write,
 there were instituted schools, universities, composed almost entirely of
 ecclesiastics who, knowing nothing but their own jargon, taught this
 jargon to those who wished to learn it; the academies came only a long
 time afterwards; they despised the foolishness of the schools, but did
 not always dare to rise against them, because there are foolishnesses
 that are respected provided that they concern respectable things.
 
 The men of letters who have rendered the greatest services to the small
 number of thinking beings spread over the world, are the isolated
 writers, the true scholars shut in their studies, who have neither
 argued on the benches of the universities, nor told half-truths in the
 academies; and almost all of them have been persecuted. Our wretched
 species is so made that those who walk on the well-trodden path always
 throw stones at those who are showing a new road.
 
 Montesquieu says that the Scythians rent their slaves' eyes, so that
 they might be less distracted while they were churning their butter;
 that is just how the inquisition functions, and in the land where this
 monster reigns almost everybody is blind. In England people have had two
 eyes for more than two hundred years; the French are starting to open
 one eye; but sometimes there are men in power who do not want the people
 to have even this one eye open.
 
 These poor persons in power are like Doctor Balouard of the Italian
 Comedy, who does not want to be served by anyone but the dolt
 Harlequin, and who is afraid of having too shrewd a valet.
 
 Compose some odes in praise of My Lord Superbus Fadus, some madrigals
 for his mistress; dedicate a book on geography to his door-keeper, you
 will be well-received; enlighten mankind, you will be exterminated.
 
 Descartes was forced to leave his country, Gassendi was calumniated,
 Arnauld dragged out his days in exile; every philosopher is treated as
 the prophets were among the Jews.
 
 Who would believe that in the eighteenth century a philosopher was
 dragged before the secular tribunals, and treated as impious by the
 tribunals of arguments, for having said that men could not practise the
 arts if they had no hands? I do not despair that soon the first person
 who is so insolent as to say that men could not think if they had no
 heads will be immediately condemned to the galleys; "for," some young
 graduate will say to him, "the soul is a pure spirit, the head is only
 matter; God can put the soul in the heel, as well as in the brain;
 therefore I denounce you as impious."
 
 The greatest misfortune of a man of letters is not perhaps being the
 object of his confreres' jealousy, the victim of the cabal, the despised
 of the men of power; but of being judged by fools. Fools go far
 sometimes, particularly when bigotry is added to ineptitude, and to
 ineptitude the spirit of vengeance. The further great misfortune of a
 man of letters is that ordinarily he is unattached. A bourgeois buys
 himself a small position, and there he is backed by his colleagues. If
 he suffers an injustice, he finds defenders at once. The man of letters
 is unsuccoured; he resembles a flying-fish; if he rises a little, the
 birds devour him; if he dives, the fish eat him.
 
 Every public man pays tribute to malignity, but he is paid in honours
 and gold.
 
 
 
 
 _METAMORPHOSIS_, _METEMPSYCHOSIS_
 
 
 Is it not very natural that all the metamorphoses with which the world
 is covered should have made people imagine in the Orient, where
 everything has been imagined, that our souls passed from one body to
 another? An almost imperceptible speck becomes a worm, this worm becomes
 a butterfly; an acorn transforms itself into an oak; an egg into a bird;
 water becomes cloud and thunder; wood is changed into fire and ash;
 everything in nature appears, in fine, metamorphosed. Soon people
 attributed to souls, which were regarded as light figures, what they saw
 in more gross bodies. The idea of metempsychosis is perhaps the most
 ancient dogma of the known universe, and it still reigns in a large part
 of India and China.
 
 
 
 
 _MILTON, ON THE REPROACH OF PLAGIARISM AGAINST_
 
 
 Some people have accused Milton of having taken his poem from the
 tragedy of "The Banishment of Adam" by Grotius, and from the "Sarcotis"
 of the Jesuit Masenius, printed at Cologne in 1654 and in 1661, long
 before Milton gave his "Paradise Lost."
 
 As regards Grotius, it was well enough known in England that Milton had
 carried into his epic English poem a few Latin verses from the tragedy
 of "Adam." It is in no wise to be a plagiarist to enrich one's language
 with the beauties of a foreign language. No one accused Euripides of
 plagiarism for having imitated in one of the choruses of "Iphigenia" the
 second book of the Iliad; on the contrary, people were very grateful to
 him for this imitation, which they regarded as a homage rendered to
 Homer on the Athenian stage.
 
 Virgil never suffered a reproach for having happily imitated, in the
 AEneid, a hundred verses by the first of Greek poets.
 
 Against Milton the accusation was pushed a little further. A Scot, Will
 Lauder by name, very attached to the memory of Charles I., whom Milton
 had insulted with the most uncouth animosity, thought himself entitled
 to dishonour the memory of this monarch's accuser. It was claimed that
 Milton was guilty of an infamous imposture in robbing Charles I. of the
 sad glory of being the author of the "Eikon Basilika," a book long dear
 to the royalists, and which Charles I., it was said, had composed in his
 prison to serve as consolation for his deplorable adversity.
 
 Lauder, therefore, about the year of 1752, wanted to begin by proving
 that Milton was only a plagiarist, before proving that he had acted as a
 forger against the memory of the most unfortunate of kings; he procured
 some editions of the poem of the "Sarcotis." It seemed evident that
 Milton had imitated some passages of it, as he had imitated Grotius and
 Tasso.
 
 But Lauder did not rest content there; he unearthed a bad translation in
 Latin verse of the "Paradise Lost" of the English poet; and joining
 several verses of this translation to those by Masenius, he thought
 thereby to render the accusation more grave, and Milton's shame more
 complete. It was in that, that he was badly deceived; his fraud was
 discovered. He wanted to make Milton pass for a forger, and he was
 himself convicted of forging. No one examined Masenius' poem of which at
 that time there were only a few copies in Europe. All England, convinced
 of the Scot's poor trick, asked no more about it. The accuser,
 confounded, was obliged to disavow his manoeuvre, and ask pardon for
 it.
 
 Since then a new edition of Masenius was printed in 1757. The literary
 public was surprised at the large number of very beautiful verses with
 which the Sarcotis was sprinkled. It is in truth nothing but a long
 declamation of the schools on the fall of man: but the exordium, the
 invocation, the description of the garden of Eden, the portrait of Eve,
 that of the devil, are precisely the same as in Milton. Further, it is
 the same subject, the same plot, the same catastrophe. If the devil
 wishes, in Milton, to be revenged on man for the harm which God has done
 him, he has precisely the same plan in the work of the Jesuit Masenius;
 and he manifests it in verses worthy maybe of the century of Augustus.
 ("Sarcotis," I., 271 _et seq._)
 
 One finds in both Masenius and Milton little episodes, trifling
 digressions which are absolutely alike; both speak of Xerxes who covered
 the sea with his ships. Both speak in the same tone of the Tower of
 Babel; both give the same description of luxury, of pride, of avarice,
 of gluttony.
 
 What most persuaded the generality of readers of Milton's plagiarism was
 the perfect resemblance of the beginning of the two poems. Many
 foreigners, after reading the exordium, had no doubt but that the rest
 of Milton's poem was taken from Masenius. It is a very great error and
 easy to recognize.
 
 I do not think that the English poet imitated in all more than two
 hundred of the Jesuit of Cologne's verses; and I dare say that he
 imitated only what was worthy of being imitated. These two hundred
 verses are very beautiful; so are Milton's; and the total of Masenius'
 poem, despite these two hundred beautiful verses, is not worth anything
 at all.
 
 Moliere took two whole scenes from the ridiculous comedy of the "Pedant
 Joue" by Cyrano de Bergerac. "These two scenes are good," he said as he
 was jesting with his friends. "They belong to me by right: I recover my
 property." After that anyone who treated the author of "Tartufe" and "Le
 Misanthrope" as a plagiarist would have been very badly received.
 
 It is certain that generally Milton, in his "Paradise", has in imitating
 flown on his own wings; and it must be agreed that if he borrowed so
 many traits from Grotius and from the Jesuit of Cologne, they are
 blended in the crowd of original things which are his; in England he is
 always regarded as a very great poet.
 
 It is true that he should have avowed having translated two hundred of a
 Jesuit's verses; but in his time, at the court of Charles II., people
 did not worry themselves with either the Jesuits, or Milton, or
 "Paradise Lost", or "Paradise Regained". All those things were either
 scoffed at, or unknown.
 
 
 
 
 _MOHAMMEDANS_
 
 
 I tell you again, ignorant imbeciles, whom other ignoramuses have made
 believe that the Mohammedan religion is voluptuous and sensual, there is
 not a word of truth in it; you have been deceived on this point as on so
 many others.
 
 Canons, monks, vicars even, if a law were imposed on you not to eat or
 drink from four in the morning till ten at night, during the month of
 July, when Lent came at this period; if you were forbidden to play at
 any game of chance under pain of damnation; if wine were forbidden you
 under the same pain; if you had to make a pilgrimage into the burning
 desert; if it were enjoined on you to give at least two and a half per
 cent. of your income to the poor; if, accustomed to enjoy possession of
 eighteen women, the number were cut down suddenly by fourteen; honestly,
 would you dare call that religion sensual?
 
 The Latin Christians have so many advantages over the Mussulmans, I do
 not say in the matter of war, but in the matter of doctrines; the Greek
 Christians have so beaten them latterly from 1769 to 1773, that it is
 not worth the trouble to indulge in unjust reproaches against Islam.
 
 Try to retake from the Mohammedans all that they usurped; but it is
 easier to calumniate them.
 
 I hate calumny so much that I do not want even to impute foolishness to
 the Turks, although I detest them as tyrants over women and enemies of
 the arts.
 
 I do not know why the historian of the Lower Empire maintains that
 Mohammed speaks in his Koran of his journey into the sky: Mohammed does
 not say a word about it; we have proved it.
 
 One must combat ceaselessly. When one has destroyed an error, there is
 always someone who resuscitates it.
 
 
 
 
 _MOUNTAIN_
 
 
 It is a very old, very universal fable that tells of the mountain which,
 having frightened all the countryside by its outcry that it was in
 labour, was hissed by all present when it brought into the world a mere
 mouse. The people in the pit were not philosophers. Those who hissed
 should have admired. It was as fine for the mountain to give birth to a
 mouse, as for the mouse to give birth to a mountain. A rock which
 produces a rat is a very prodigious thing; and never has the world seen
 anything approaching this miracle. All the globes of the universe could
 not call a fly into existence. Where the vulgar laugh, the philosopher
 admires; and he laughs where the vulgar open their big, stupid eyes in
 astonishment.
 
 
 
 
 _NAKEDNESS_
 
 
 Why should one lock up a man or a woman who walked stark naked in the
 street? and why is no one shocked by absolutely nude statues, by
 pictures of the Madonna and of Jesus that may be seen in some churches?
 
 It is probably that the human species lived long without being clothed.
 
 People unacquainted with clothing have been found in more than one
 island and in the American continent.
 
 The most civilized hide the organs of generation with leaves, woven
 rushes, feathers.
 
 Whence comes this form of modesty? is it the instinct for lighting
 desires by hiding what it gives pleasure to discover?
 
 Is it really true that among slightly more civilized nations, such as
 the Jews and half-Jews, there have been entire sects who would not
 worship God save by stripping themselves of all their clothes? such
 were, it is said, the Adamites and the Abelians. They gathered quite
 naked to sing the praises of God: St. Epiphanius and St. Augustine say
 so. It is true that they were not contemporary, and that they were very
 far from these people's country. But at all events this madness is
 possible: it is not even more extraordinary, more mad than a hundred
 other madnesses which have been round the world one after the other.
 
 We have said elsewhere that to-day even the Mohammedans still have
 saints who are madmen, and who go naked like monkeys. It is very
 possible that some fanatics thought it was better to present themselves
 to the Deity in the state in which He formed them, than in the disguise
 invented by man. It is possible that they showed everything out of
 piety. There are so few well-made persons of both sexes, that nakedness
 might have inspired chastity, or rather disgust, instead of increasing
 desire.
 
 It is said particularly that the Abelians renounced marriage. If there
 were any fine lads and pretty lasses among them, they were at least
 comparable to St. Adhelme and to blessed Robert d'Arbrisselle, who slept
 with the prettiest persons, that their continence might triumph all the
 more.
 
 But I avow that it would have been very comic to see a hundred Helens
 and Parises singing anthems, giving each other the kiss of peace, and
 making agapae.
 
 All of which shows that there is no singularity, no extravagance, no
 superstition which has not passed through the heads of mankind. Happy
 the day when these superstitions do not trouble society and make of it a
 scene of disorder, hatred and fury! It is better without doubt to pray
 God stark naked, than to stain His altars and the public places with
 human blood.
 
 
 
 
 _NATURAL LAW_
 
 
 B: What is natural law?
 
 A: The instinct which makes us feel justice.
 
 B: What do you call just and unjust?
 
 A: What appears such to the entire universe.
 
 B: The universe is composed of many heads. It is said that in Lacedaemon
 were applauded thefts for which people in Athens were condemned to the
 mines.
 
 A: Abuse of words, logomachy, equivocation; theft could not be committed
 at Sparta, when everything was common property. What you call "theft"
 was the punishment for avarice.
 
 B: It was forbidden to marry one's sister in Rome. It was allowed among
 the Egyptians, the Athenians and even among the Jews, to marry one's
 sister on the father's side. It is but with regret that I cite that
 wretched little Jewish people, who should assuredly not serve as a rule
 for anyone, and who (putting religion aside) was never anything but a
 race of ignorant and fanatic brigands. But still, according to their
 books, the young Thamar, before being ravished by her brother Amnon,
 says to him:--"Nay, my brother, do not thou this folly, but speak unto
 the king; for he will not withhold me from thee." (2 Samuel xiii. 12,
 13.)
 
 A: Conventional law all that, arbitrary customs, fashions that pass: the
 essential remains always. Show me a country where it was honourable to
 rob me of the fruit of my toil, to break one's promise, to lie in order
 to hurt, to calumniate, to assassinate, to poison, to be ungrateful
 towards a benefactor, to beat one's father and one's mother when they
 offer you food.
 
 B: Have you forgotten that Jean-Jacques, one of the fathers of the
 modern Church, has said that "the first man who dared enclose and
 cultivate a piece of land" was the enemy "of the human race," that he
 should have been exterminated, and that "the fruits of the earth are for
 all, and that the land belongs to none"? Have we not already examined
 together this lovely proposition which is so useful to society
 (Discourse on Inequality, second part)?
 
 A: Who is this Jean-Jacques? he is certainly not either John the
 Baptist, nor John the Evangelist, nor James the Greater, nor James the
 Less[19]; it must be some Hunnish wit who wrote that abominable
 impertinence or some poor joker _bufo magro_ who wanted to laugh at what
 the entire world regards as most serious. For instead of going to spoil
 the land of a wise and industrious neighbour, he had only to imitate
 him; and every father of a family having followed this example, behold
 soon a very pretty village formed. The author of this passage seems to
 me a very unsociable animal.
 
 B: You think then that by outraging and robbing the good man who has
 surrounded his garden and chicken-run with a live hedge, he has been
 wanting in respect towards the duties of natural law?
 
 A: Yes, yes, once again, there is a natural law, and it does not consist
 either in doing harm to others, or in rejoicing thereat.
 
 B: I imagine that man likes and does harm only for his own advantage.
 But so many people are led to look for their own interest in the
 misfortune of others, vengeance is so violent a passion, there are such
 disastrous examples of it; ambition, still more fatal, has inundated the
 world with so much blood, that when I retrace for myself the horrible
 picture, I am tempted to avow that man is a very devil. In vain have I
 in my heart the notion of justice and injustice; an Attila courted by
 St. Leo, a Phocas flattered by St. Gregory with the most cowardly
 baseness, an Alexander VI. sullied with so many incests, so many
 murders, so many poisonings, with whom the weak Louis XII., who is
 called "the good," makes the most infamous and intimate alliance; a
 Cromwell whose protection Cardinal Mazarin seeks, and for whom he drives
 out of France the heirs of Charles I., Louis XIV.'s first cousins, etc.,
 etc.; a hundred like examples set my ideas in disorder, and I know no
 longer where I am.
 
 A: Well, do storms stop our enjoyment of to-day's beautiful sun? Did the
 earthquake which destroyed half the city of Lisbon stop your making the
 voyage to Madrid very comfortably? If Attila was a brigand and Cardinal
 Mazarin a rogue, are there not princes and ministers who are honest
 people? Has it not been remarked that in the war of 1701, Louis XIV.'s
 council was composed of the most virtuous men? The Duc de Beauvilliers,
 the Marquis de Torci, the Marechal de Villars, Chamillart lastly who
 passed for being incapable, but never for dishonest. Does not the idea
 of justice subsist always? It is upon that idea that all laws are
 founded. The Greeks called them "daughters of heaven," which only means
 daughters of nature. Have you no laws in your country?
 
 B: Yes, some good, some bad.
 
 A: Where, if it was not in the notions of natural law, did you get the
 idea that every man has within himself when his mind is properly made?
 You must have obtained it there, or nowhere.
 
 B: You are right, there is a natural law; but it is still more natural
 to many people to forget it.
 
 A: It is natural also to be one-eyed, hump-backed, lame, deformed,
 unhealthy; but one prefers people who are well made and healthy.
 
 B: Why are there so many one-eyed and deformed minds?
 
 A: Peace! But go to the article on "Power."

 _NATURE_
 
 
 DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PHILOSOPHER AND NATURE
 
 THE PHILOSOPHER:
 
 Who are you, Nature? I live in you; for fifty years have I been seeking
 you, and I have not found you yet.
 
 NATURE:
 
 The ancient Egyptians, who lived, it is said, some twelve hundred years,
 made me the same reproach. They called me Isis; they put a great veil on
 my head, and they said that nobody could lift it.
 
 THE PHILOSOPHER:
 
 That is what makes me address myself to you. I have been able to measure
 some of your globes, know their paths, assign the laws of motion; but I
 have not been able to learn who you are.
 
 Are you always active? are you always passive? did your elements arrange
 themselves, as water deposits itself on sand, oil on water, air on oil?
 have you a mind which directs all your operations, as councils are
 inspired as soon as they are assembled, although their members are
 sometimes ignoramuses? I pray you tell me the answer to your riddle.
 
 NATURE:
 
 I am the great everything. I know no more about it. I am not a
 mathematician; and everything is arranged in my world according to
 mathematical laws. Guess if you can how it is all done.
 
 THE PHILOSOPHER:
 
 Certainly, since your great everything does not know mathematics, and
 since all your laws are most profoundly geometrical, there must be an
 eternal geometer who directs you, a supreme intelligence who presides
 over your operations.
 
 NATURE:
 
 You are right; I am water, earth, fire, atmosphere, metal, mineral,
 stone, vegetable, animal. I feel indeed that there is in me an
 intelligence; you have an intelligence, you do not see it. I do not see
 mine either; I feel this invisible power; I cannot know it: why should
 you, who are but a small part of me, want to know what I do not know?
 
 THE PHILOSOPHER:
 
 We are curious. I want to know how being so crude in your mountains, in
 your deserts, in your seas, you appear nevertheless so industrious in
 your animals, in your vegetables?
 
 NATURE:
 
 My poor child do you want me to tell you the truth? It is that I have
 been given a name which does not suit me; my name is "Nature", and I am
 all art.
 
 THE PHILOSOPHER:
 
 That word upsets all my ideas. What! nature is only art?
 
 NATURE:
 
 Yes, without any doubt. Do you not know that there is an infinite art in
 those seas and those mountains that you find so crude? do you not know
 that all those waters gravitate towards the centre of the earth, and
 mount only by immutable laws; that those mountains which crown the
 earth are the immense reservoirs of the eternal snows which produce
 unceasingly those fountains, lakes and rivers without which my animal
 species and my vegetable species would perish? And as for what are
 called my animal kingdom, my vegetable kingdom and my mineral kingdom,
 you see here only three; learn that I have millions of kingdoms. But if
 you consider only the formation of an insect, of an ear of corn, of
 gold, of copper, everything will appear as marvels of art.
 
 THE PHILOSOPHER:
 
 It is true. The more I think about it, the more I see that you are only
 the art of I know not what most potent and industrious great being, who
 hides himself and who makes you appear. All reasoners since Thales, and
 probably long before him, have played at blind man's buff with you; they
 have said: "I have you!" and they had nothing. We all resemble Ixion; he
 thought he was kissing Juno, and all that he possessed was a cloud.
 
 NATURE:
 
 Since I am all that is, how can a being such as you, so small a part of
 myself, seize me? Be content, atoms my children, with seeing a few atoms
 that surround you, with drinking a few drops of my milk, with vegetating
 for a few moments on my breast, and with dying without having known your
 mother and your nurse.
 
 THE PHILOSOPHER:
 
 My dear mother, tell me something of why you exist, of why there is
 anything.
 
 NATURE:
 
 I will answer you as I have answered for so many centuries all those who
 have interrogated me about first principles: I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THEM.
 
 THE PHILOSOPHER:
 
 Would not non-existence be better than this multitude of existences made
 in order to be continually dissolved, this crowd of animals born and
 reproduced in order to devour others and to be devoured, this crowd of
 sentient beings formed for so many painful sensations, that other crowd
 of intelligences which so rarely hear reason. What is the good of all
 that, Nature?
 
 NATURE:
 
 Oh! go and ask Him who made me.
 
 
 
 
 _NECESSARY_
 
 
 OSMIN:
 
 Do you not say that everything is necessary?
 
 SELIM:
 
 If everything were not necessary, it would follow that God had made
 useless things.
 
 OSMIN:
 
 That is to say that it was necessary to the divine nature to make all
 that it has made?
 
 SELIM:
 
 I think so, or at least I suspect it; there are people who think
 otherwise; I do not understand them; maybe they are right. I am afraid
 of disputes on this subject.
 
 OSMIN:
 
 It is also of another necessary that I want to talk to you.
 
 SELIM:
 
 What! of what is necessary to an honest man that he may live? of the
 misfortune to which one is reduced when one lacks the necessary?
 
 OSMIN:
 
 No; for what is necessary to one is not always necessary to the other:
 it is necessary for an Indian to have rice, for an Englishman to have
 meat; a fur is necessary to a Russian, and a gauzy stuff to an African;
 this man thinks that twelve coach-horses are necessary to him, that man
 limits himself to a pair of shoes, a third walks gaily barefoot: I want
 to talk to you of what is necessary to all men.
 
 SELIM:
 
 It seems to me that God has given all that is necessary to this species:
 eyes to see with, feet for walking, a mouth for eating, an oesophagus
 for swallowing, a stomach for digesting, a brain for reasoning, organs
 for producing one's fellow creature.
 
 OSMIN:
 
 How does it happen then that men are born lacking a part of these
 necessary things?
 
 SELIM:
 
 It is because the general laws of nature have brought about some
 accidents which have made monsters to be born; but generally man is
 provided with everything that is necessary to him in order to live in
 society.
 
 OSMIN:
 
 Are there notions common to all men which serve to make them live in
 society?
 
 SELIM:
 
 Yes. I have travelled with Paul Lucas, and wherever I went, I saw that
 people respected their father and their mother, that people believed
 themselves to be obliged to keep their promises, that people pitied
 oppressed innocents, that they hated persecution, that they regarded
 liberty of thought as a rule of nature, and the enemies of this liberty
 as enemies of the human race; those who think differently seemed to me
 badly organized creatures, monsters like those who are born without eyes
 and hands.
 
 OSMIN:
 
 Are these necessary things in all time and in all places?
 
 SELIM:
 
 Yes, if they were not they would not be necessary to the human species.
 
 OSMIN:
 
 So a belief which is new is not necessary to this species. Men could
 very well live in society and accomplish their duty to God, before
 believing that Mahomet had frequent interviews with the angel Gabriel.
 
 SELIM:
 
 Nothing is clearer; it would be ridiculous to think that man could not
 accomplish his duty to God before Mahomet came into the world; it was
 not at all necessary for the human species to believe in the Alcoran:
 the world went along before Mahomet just as it goes along to-day. If
 Mahometanism had been necessary to the world, it would have existed in
 all places; God who has given us all two eyes to see the sun, would have
 given us all an intelligence to see the truth of the Mussulman religion.
 This sect is therefore only like the positive laws that change according
 to time and place, like the fashions, like the opinions of the natural
 philosophers which follow one after the other.
 
 The Mussulman sect could not be essentially necessary to mankind.
 
 OSMIN:
 
 But since it exists, God has permitted it?
 
 SELIM:
 
 Yes, as he permits the world to be filled with foolishness, error and
 calamity; that is not to say that men are all essentially made to be
 fools and miscreants. He permits that some men be eaten by snakes; but
 one cannot say--"God made man to be eaten by snakes."
 
 OSMIN:
 
 What do you mean when you say "God permits"? can nothing happen without
 His order? permit, will and do, are they not the same thing for Him?
 
 SELIM:
 
 He permits crime, but He does not commit it.
 
 OSMIN:
 
 Committing a crime is acting against divine justice, it is disobeying
 God. Well, God cannot disobey Himself, He cannot commit crime; but He
 has made man in such a way that man may commit many crimes: where does
 that come from?
 
 SELIM:
 
 There are people who know, but I do not; all that I know is that the
 Alcoran is ridiculous, although from time to time it has some tolerably
 good things; certainly the Alcoran was not at all necessary to man; I
 stick by that: I see clearly what is false, and I know very little that
 is true.
 
 OSMIN:
 
 I thought you would instruct me, and you teach me nothing.
 
 SELIM:
 
 Is it not a great deal to recognize people who deceive you, and the
 gross and dangerous errors which they retail to you?
 
 OSMIN:
 
 I should have ground for complaint against a doctor who showed me all
 the harmful plants, and who did not show me one salutary plant.
 
 SELIM:
 
 I am not a doctor, and you are not ill; but it seems to me I should be
 giving you a very good prescription if I said to you: "Put not your
 trust in all the inventions of charlatans, worship God, be an honest
 man, and believe that two and two make four."
 
 
 
 
 _NEW NOVELTIES_
 
 
 It seems that the first words of Ovid's "Metamorphoses," _In nova fert
 animus_, are the motto of the human race. Nobody is touched by the
 admirable spectacle of the sun which rises, or rather seems to rise,
 every day; everybody runs to see the smallest little meteor which
 appears for an instant in that accumulation of vapours, called the sky,
 that surround the earth.
 
 An itinerant bookseller does not burden himself with a Virgil, with a
 Horace, but with a new book, even though it be detestable. He draws you
 aside and says to you: "Sir, do you want some books from Holland?"
 
 From the beginning of the world women have complained of the fickleness
 that is imputed to them in favour of the first new object which presents
 itself, and whose novelty is often its only merit. Many ladies (it must
 be confessed, despite the infinite respect we have for them) have
 treated men as they complain they have themselves been treated; and the
 story of Gioconda is much older than Ariosto.
 
 Perhaps this universal taste for novelty is one of nature's favours.
 People cry to us: "Be content with what you have, desire nothing that is
 beyond your estate, restrain your curiosity, tame your intellectual
 disquiet." These are very good maxims; but if we had always followed
 them, we should still be eating acorns, we should be sleeping in the
 open air, and we should not have had Corneille, Racine, Moliere,
 Poussin, Lebrun, Lemoine or Pigalle.
 
 
 
 
 _PHILOSOPHER_
 
 
 Philosopher, _lover of wisdom_, that is to say, _of truth_. All
 philosophers have had this dual character; there is not one in antiquity
 who has not given mankind examples of virtue and lessons in moral
 truths. They have all contrived to be deceived about natural philosophy;
 but natural philosophy is so little necessary for the conduct of life,
 that the philosophers had no need of it. It has taken centuries to learn
 a part of nature's laws. One day was sufficient for a wise man to learn
 the duties of man.
 
 The philosopher is not enthusiastic; he does not set himself up as a
 prophet; he does not say that he is inspired by the gods. Thus I shall
 not put in the rank of philosophers either the ancient Zarathustra, or
 Hermes, or the ancient Orpheus, or any of those legislators of whom the
 nations of Chaldea, Persia, Syria, Egypt and Greece boasted. Those who
 styled themselves children of the gods were the fathers of imposture;
 and if they used lies for the teaching of truths, they were unworthy of
 teaching them; they were not philosophers; they were at best very
 prudent liars.
 
 By what fatality, shameful maybe for the Western peoples, is it
 necessary to go to the far Orient to find a wise man who is simple,
 unostentatious, free from imposture, who taught men to live happily six
 hundred years before our vulgar era, at a time when the whole of the
 North was ignorant of the usage of letters, and when the Greeks were
 barely beginning to distinguish themselves by their wisdom?
 
 This wise man is Confucius, who being legislator never wanted to
 deceive men. What more beautiful rule of conduct has ever been given
 since him in the whole world?
 
 "Rule a state as you rule a family; one can only govern one's family
 well by setting the example.
 
 "Virtue should be common to both husbandman and monarch.
 
 "Apply thyself to the trouble of preventing crimes in order to lessen
 the trouble of punishing them.
 
 "Under the good kings Yao and Xu the Chinese were good; under the bad
 kings Kie and Chu they were wicked.
 
 "Do to others as to thyself.
 
 "Love all men; but cherish honest people. Forget injuries, and never
 kindnesses.
 
 "I have seen men incapable of study; I have never seen them incapable of
 virtue."
 
 Let us admit that there is no legislator who has proclaimed truths more
 useful to the human race.
 
 A host of Greek philosophers have since taught an equally pure moral
 philosophy. If they had limited themselves to their empty systems of
 natural philosophy, their names would be pronounced to-day in mockery
 only. If they are still respected, it is because they were just and that
 they taught men to be so.
 
 One cannot read certain passages of Plato, and notably the admirable
 exordium of the laws of Zaleucus, without feeling in one's heart the
 love of honourable and generous actions. The Romans have their Cicero,
 who alone is worth perhaps all the philosophers of Greece. After him
 come men still more worthy of respect, but whom one almost despairs of
 imitating; Epictetus in bondage, the Antonines and the Julians on the
 throne.
 
 Which is the citizen among us who would deprive himself, like Julian,
 Antoninus and Marcus Aurelius, of all the delicacies of our flabby and
 effeminate lives? who would sleep as they did on the ground? who would
 impose on himself their frugality? who, as they did, would march
 barefoot and bareheaded at the head of the armies, exposed now to the
 heat of the sun, now to the hoar-frost? who would command all their
 passions as they did? There are pious men among us; but where are the
 wise men? where are the resolute, just and tolerant souls?
 
 There have been philosophers of the study in France; and all, except
 Montaigne, have been persecuted. It is, I think, the last degree of the
 malignity of our nature, to wish to oppress these very philosophers who
 would correct it.
 
 I quite understand that the fanatics of one sect slaughter the
 enthusiasts of another sect, that the Franciscans hate the Dominicans,
 and that a bad artist intrigues to ruin one who surpasses him; but that
 the wise Charron should have been threatened with the loss of his life,
 that the learned and generous Ramus should have been assassinated, that
 Descartes should have been forced to flee to Holland to escape the fury
 of the ignorant, that Gassendi should have been obliged to withdraw
 several times to Digne, far from the calumnies of Paris; these things
 are a nation's eternal shame.
 
 
 
 
 _POWER_, _OMNIPOTENCE_
 
 
 I suppose that the man who reads this article is convinced that this
 world is formed with intelligence, and that a little astronomy and
 anatomy suffices to make this universal and supreme intelligence
 admired.
 
 Can he know by himself if this intelligence is omnipotent, that is to
 say, infinitely powerful? Has he the least notion of the infinite, to
 understand what is an infinite power?
 
 The celebrated historian philosopher, David Hume, says in "Particular
 Providence": "A weight of ten ounces is lifted in a balance by another
 weight; therefore this other weight is of more than ten ounces; but one
 can adduce no reason why it should weigh a hundred ounces."
 
 One can say likewise: You recognize a supreme intelligence strong enough
 to form you, to preserve you for a limited time, to reward you, to
 punish you. Do you know enough of this power to demonstrate that it can
 do still more?
 
 How can you prove by your reason that this being can do more than he has
 done?
 
 The life of all animals is short. Could he make it longer?
 
 All animals are the prey of each other: everything is born to be
 devoured. Could he form without destroying?
 
 You do not know what nature is. You cannot therefore know if nature has
 not forced him to do only the things he has done.
 
 This globe is only a vast field of destruction and carnage. Either the
 great Being has been able to make of it an eternal abode of delight for
 all sentient beings, or He has not been able. If He has been able and if
 He has not done so, fear to regard him as malevolent; but if He has not
 been able, fear not to look on Him as a very great power, circumscribed
 by nature in His limits.
 
 Whether or no His power is infinite does not regard you. It is a matter
 of indifference to a subject whether his master possesses five hundred
 leagues of land or five thousand; he is subject neither more nor less.
 
 Which would be the greater insult to this ineffable Being, to say: "He
 has made miserable men without being able to dispense with them, or He
 has made them for His pleasure?"
 
 Many sects represent Him as cruel; others, for fear of admitting a
 wicked God, have the audacity to deny His existence. Is it not better to
 say that probably the necessity of His nature and the necessity of
 things have determined everything?
 
 The world is the theatre of moral ill and physical ill; one is only too
 aware of it: and the "All is good" of Shaftesbury, Bolingbroke and Pope,
 is only a witty paradox, a poor joke.
 
 The two principles of Zarathustra and Manes, so carefully scrutinized by
 Bayle, are a still poorer joke. They are, as has been observed already,
 Moliere's two doctors, one of whom says to the other: "Grant me the
 emetic, and I will grant you the bleeding." Manichaeism is absurd; and
 that is why it has had so many supporters.
 
 I admit that I have not been enlightened by all that Bayle says about
 the Manichaeans and the Paulicians. That is controversy; I would have
 preferred pure philosophy. Why discuss our mysteries beside
 Zarathustra's? As soon as you dare to treat of our mysteries, which need
 only faith and no reasoning, you open precipices for yourself.
 
 The trash in our scholastic theology has nothing to do with the trash in
 Zarathustra's reveries.
 
 Why debate original sin with Zarathustra? There was never any question
 of it save in St. Augustine's time. Neither Zarathustra nor any
 legislator of antiquity had ever heard speak of it.
 
 If you dispute with Zarathustra, put under lock and key the old and the
 new Testaments which he did not know, and which one must revere without
 desiring to explain them.
 
 What then should I have said to Zarathustra? My reason cannot admit two
 gods who fight, that is good only in a poem where Minerva quarrels with
 Mars. My feeble reason is much more content with a single great Being,
 whose essence was to make, and who has made all that nature has
 permitted Him, than it is satisfied with two great Beings, one of whom
 spoils the works of the other. Your bad principle Ahriman, has not been
 able to upset a single one of the astronomical and physical laws of the
 good principle Ormuzd; everything progresses in the heavens with the
 greatest regularity. Why should the wicked Ahriman have had power over
 this little globe of the world?
 
 If I had been Ahriman, I should have attacked Ormuzd in his fine grand
 provinces of so many suns and stars. I should not have limited myself to
 making war on him in a little village.
 
 There is much evil in this village: but whence have you the knowledge
 that this evil is not inevitable?
 
 You are forced to admit an intelligence diffused over the universe; but
 (1) do you know, for instance, if this power reaches right to foreseeing
 the future? You have asserted it a thousand times; but you have never
 been able either to prove it, or to understand it. You cannot know how
 any being whatever sees what is not. Well, the future is not; therefore
 no being can see it. You are reduced to saying that He foresees it; but
 foreseeing is conjecturing. This is the opinion of the Socinians.
 
 Well, a God who, according to you, conjectures, can be mistaken. In your
 system He is really mistaken; for if He had foreseen that His enemy
 would poison all His works here below, He would not have produced them;
 He would not have prepared for Himself the shame of being continually
 vanquished.
 
 (2) Do I not do Him much more honour by saying that He has made
 everything by the necessity of His nature, than you do Him by raising an
 enemy who disfigures, who soils, who destroys all His works here below?
 
 (3) It is not to have an unworthy idea of God to say that, having formed
 thousands of millions of worlds where death and evil do not dwell, it
 was necessary that evil and death should dwell in this world.
 
 (4) It is not to disparage God to say that He could not form man without
 giving him self-esteem; that this self-esteem could not lead him without
 misguiding him almost always; that his passions are necessary, but that
 they are disastrous; that propagation cannot be executed without desire;
 that desire cannot animate man without quarrels; that these quarrels
 necessarily bring wars in their train, etc.
 
 (5) When he sees part of the combinations of the animal, vegetable and
 mineral kingdoms, and this globe pierced everywhere like a sieve, from
 which escape in crowds so many exhalations, what philosopher will be
 bold enough, what scholastic foolish enough to see clearly that nature
 could stop the effects of volcanoes, the inclemencies of the atmosphere,
 the violence of the winds, the plagues, and all the destructive
 scourges?
 
 (6) One must be very powerful, very strong, very industrious, to have
 formed lions which devour bulls, and to have produced men who invent
 arms to kill at one blow, not only bulls and lions, but even each other.
 One must be very powerful to have caused to be born spiders which spin
 webs to catch flies; but that is not to be omnipotent, infinitely
 powerful.
 
 (7) If the great Being had been infinitely powerful, there is no reason
 why He should not have made sentient animals infinitely happy; He has
 not done so, therefore He was not able.
 
 (8) All the sects of the philosophers have stranded on the reef of moral
 and physical ill. It only remains to avow that God having acted for the
 best has not been able to act better.
 
 (9) This necessity settles all the difficulties and finishes all the
 disputes. We have not the impudence to say--"All is good." We say--"All
 is the least bad that is possible."
 
 (10) Why does a child often die in its mother's womb? Why is another who
 has had the misfortune to be born, reserved for torments as long as his
 life, terminated by a frightful death?
 
 Why has the source of life been poisoned all over the world since the
 discovery of America? why since the seventh century of our era does
 smallpox carry off the eighth part of the human race? why since all time
 have bladders been subject to being stone quarries? why the plague, war,
 famine, the inquisition? Turn in every direction, you will find no other
 solution than that everything has been necessary.
 
 I speak here to philosophers only and not to theologians. We know well
 that faith is the thread in the labyrinth. We know that the fall of Adam
 and Eve, original sin, the immense power given to the devil, the
 predilection accorded by the great Being to the Jewish people, and the
 baptism substituted for the amputation of the prepuce, are the answers
 which explain everything. We have argued only against Zarathustra and
 not against the university of Conimbre or Coimbre, to which we submit in
 our articles.
 
 
 
 
 _PRAYERS_
 
 
 We do not know any religion without prayers, even the Jews had some,
 although there was not among them any public form, until the time when
 they sang canticles in their synagogues, which happened very late.
 
 All men, in their desires and their fears, invoked the aid of a deity.
 Some philosophers, more respectful to the Supreme Being, and less
 condescending to human frailty, for all prayer desired only resignation.
 It is indeed what seems proper as between creature and creator. But
 philosophy is not made to govern the world; she rises above the common
 herd; she speaks a language that the crowd cannot understand. It would
 be suggesting to fishwives that they should study conic sections.
 
 Even among the philosophers, I do not believe that anyone apart from
 Maximus of Tyre has treated of this matter; this is the substance of
 Maximus' ideas.
 
 The Eternal has His intentions from all eternity. If prayer accords with
 His immutable wishes, it is quite useless to ask of Him what He has
 resolved to do. If one prays Him to do the contrary of what He has
 resolved, it is praying Him to be weak, frivolous, inconstant; it is
 believing that He is thus, it is to mock Him. Either you ask Him a just
 thing; in this case He must do it, and the thing will be done without
 your praying Him for it; entreating Him is even to distrust Him: or the
 thing is unjust, and then you outrage Him. You are worthy or unworthy of
 the grace you implore: if worthy, He knows it better than you; if
 unworthy, you commit a crime the more in asking for what you do not
 deserve.
 
 In a word, we pray to God only because we have made Him in our own
 image. We treat Him like a pasha, like a sultan whom one may provoke and
 appease.
 
 In short, all nations pray to God: wise men resign themselves and obey
 Him.
 
 Let us pray with the people, and resign ourselves with the wise men.
 
 
 
 
 _PRECIS OF ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY_
 
 
 I have spent nearly forty years of my pilgrimage in two or three corners
 of this world seeking the philosopher's stone that is called Truth. I
 have consulted all the adepts of antiquity, Epicurus and Augustine,
 Plato and Malebranche, and I have remained in my poverty. Maybe in all
 these philosophers' crucibles there are one or two ounces of gold; but
 all the rest is residue, dull mud, from which nothing can be born.
 
 It seems to me that the Greeks our masters wrote much more to show their
 intelligence than that they used their intelligence in order to learn. I
 do not see a single author of antiquity who had a coherent system, a
 clear, methodical system progressing from consequence to consequence.
 
 When I wanted to compare and combine the systems of Plato, of the
 preceptor of Alexander, of Pythagoras and of the Orientals, here, more
 or less, is what I was able to gather:
 
 Chance is a word empty of sense; nothing can exist without a cause. The
 world is arranged according to mathematical laws; it is therefore
 arranged by an intelligence.
 
 It is not an intelligent being such as I am, who directed the formation
 of this world, for I cannot form a mite; therefore this world is the
 work of a prodigiously superior intelligence.
 
 Does this being, who possesses intelligence and power in so high a
 degree, exist necessarily? It must be so, for either the being received
 existence from another, or from its own nature. If the being received
 existence from another, which is very difficult to imagine, I must have
 recourse to this other, and this other will be the prime author. To
 whichever side I turn I have to admit a prime author, potent and
 intelligent, who is such necessarily by his own nature.
 
 Did this prime author produce things out of nothing? that is not
 imaginable; to create out of nothing is to change nothing into
 something. I must not admit such a production unless I find invincible
 reasons which force me to admit what my intelligence can never
 comprehend.
 
 All that exists appears to exist necessarily, since it exists. For if
 to-day there is a reason for the existence of things, there was one
 yesterday, there was one in all time; and this cause must always have
 had its effect, without which it would have been during eternity a
 useless cause.
 
 But how shall things have always existed, being visibly under the hand
 of the prime author? This power therefore must always have acted; in the
 same way, nearly, that there is no sun without light, so there is no
 movement without a being that passes from one point of space to another
 point.
 
 There is therefore a potent and intelligent being who has always acted;
 and if this being had never acted, of what use would his existence have
 been to him?
 
 All things are therefore eternal emanations of this prime author.
 
 But how imagine that stone and mud are emanations of the eternal Being,
 potent and intelligent?
 
 Of two things one, either the matter of this stone and this mud exist
 necessarily by themselves, or they exist necessarily through this prime
 author; there is no middle course.
 
 Thus, therefore, there are only two choices to make, admit either matter
 eternal by itself, or matter issuing eternally from the potent,
 intelligent eternal Being.
 
 But, either subsisting by its own nature, or emanated from the producing
 Being, it exists from all eternity, because it exists, and there is no
 reason why it should not have existed before.
 
 If matter is eternally necessary, it is therefore impossible, it is
 therefore contradictory that it does not exist; but what man can affirm
 that it is impossible, that it is contradictory that this pebble and
 this fly have not existence? One is, nevertheless, forced to suppress
 this difficulty which astonishes the imagination more than it
 contradicts the principles of reasoning.
 
 In fact, as soon as you have imagined that everything has emanated from
 the supreme and intelligent Being, that nothing has emanated from the
 Being without reason, that this Being existing always, must always have
 acted, that consequently all things must have eternally issued from the
 womb of His existence, you should no more refuse to believe in the
 matter of which this pebble and this fly, an eternal production, are
 formed, than you refuse to imagine light as an eternal emanation from
 the omnipotent Being.
 
 Since I am a being with extension and thought, my extension and my
 thought are therefore necessary productions of this Being. It is evident
 to me that I cannot give myself either extension or thought. I have
 therefore received both from this necessary Being.
 
 Can He give me what He has not? I have intelligence and I am in space;
 therefore He is intelligent, and He is in space.
 
 To say that this eternal Being, this omnipotent God, has from all time
 necessarily filled the universe with His productions, is not to deprive
 Him of His liberty; on the contrary, for liberty is only the power of
 acting. God has always acted to the full; therefore God has always made
 use of the fullness of His liberty.
 
 The liberty that is called _liberty of indifference_ is a phrase without
 idea, an absurdity; for it would be determination without reason; it
 would be an effect without a cause. Therefore, God cannot have this
 so-called liberty which is a contradiction in terms. He has therefore
 always acted through this same necessity which makes His existence.
 
 It is therefore impossible for the world to be without God, it is
 impossible for God to be without the world.
 
 This world is filled with beings who succeed each other, therefore God
 has always produced beings who succeed each other.
 
 These preliminary assertions are the basis of the ancient Oriental
 philosophy and of that of the Greeks. One must except Democritus and
 Epicurus, whose corpuscular philosophy combated these dogmas. But let us
 remark that the Epicureans relied on an entirely erroneous natural
 philosophy, and that the metaphysical system of all the other
 philosophers holds good with all the systems of natural philosophy. The
 whole of nature, excepting the vacuum, contradicts Epicurus; and no
 phenomenon contradicts the philosophy which I have just explained. Well,
 is not a philosophy which is in accord with all that passes in nature,
 and which contents the most careful minds, superior to all other
 non-revealed systems?
 
 After the assertions of the ancient philosophers, which I have
 reconciled as far as has been possible for me, what is left to us? a
 chaos of doubts and chimeras. I do not think that there has ever been a
 philosopher with a system who did not at the end of his life avow that
 he had wasted his time. It must be admitted that the inventors of the
 mechanical arts have been much more useful to mankind than the inventors
 of syllogisms: the man who invented the shuttle surpasses with a
 vengeance the man who imagined innate ideas.
 
 
 
 
 _PREJUDICES_
 
 
 Prejudice is an opinion without judgment. Thus all over the world do
 people inspire children with all the opinions they desire, before the
 children can judge.
 
 There are some universal, necessary prejudices, which even make virtue.
 In all countries children are taught to recognize a rewarding and
 revenging God; to respect and love their father and their mother; to
 look on theft as a crime, selfish lying as a vice before they can guess
 what is a vice and what a virtue.
 
 There are then some very good prejudices; they are those which are
 ratified by judgment when one reasons.
 
 Sentiment is not a simple prejudice; it is something much stronger. A
 mother does not love her son because she has been told she must love
 him; she cherishes him happily in spite of herself. It is not through
 prejudice that you run to the help of an unknown child about to fall
 into a precipice, or be eaten by a beast.
 
 But it is through prejudice that you will respect a man clad in certain
 clothes, walking gravely, speaking likewise. Your parents have told you
 that you should bow before this man; you respect him before knowing
 whether he merits your respect; you grow in years and in knowledge; you
 perceive that this man is a charlatan steeped in arrogance,
 self-interest and artifice; you despise what you revered, and the
 prejudice cedes to judgment. Through prejudice you have believed the
 fables with which your childhood was cradled; you have been told that
 the Titans made war on the gods, and Venus was amorous of Adonis; when
 you are twelve you accept these fables as truths; when you are twenty
 you look on them as ingenious allegories.
 
 Let us examine briefly the different sorts of prejudices, so as to set
 our affairs in order. We shall be perhaps like those who, at the time of
 Law's system, perceived that they had calculated imaginary riches.
 
 
 PREJUDICES OF THE SENSES
 
 Is it not strange that our eyes always deceive us, even when we have
 very good sight, and that on the contrary our ears do not deceive us?
 Let your well-informed ear hear "You are beautiful, I love you"; it is
 quite certain that someone has not said "I hate you, you are ugly": but
 you see a smooth mirror; it is demonstrated that you are mistaken, it
 has a very uneven surface. You see the sun as about two feet in
 diameter; it is demonstrated that it is a million times bigger than the
 earth.
 
 It seems that God has put truth in your ears, and error in your eyes;
 but study optics, and you will see that God has not deceived you, and
 that it is impossible for objects to appear to you otherwise than you
 see them in the present state of things.
 
 
 PHYSICAL PREJUDICES
 
 The sun rises, the moon also, the earth is motionless: these are natural
 physical prejudices. But that lobsters are good for the blood, because
 when cooked they are red; that eels cure paralysis because they wriggle;
 that the moon affects our maladies because one day someone observed that
 a sick man had an increase of fever during the waning of the moon; these
 ideas and a thousand others are the errors of ancient charlatans who
 judged without reasoning, and who, being deceived, deceived others.
 
 
 HISTORICAL PREJUDICES
 
 Most historical stories have been believed without examination, and this
 belief is a prejudice. Fabius Pictor relates that many centuries before
 him, a vestal of the town of Alba, going to draw water in her pitcher,
 was ravished, that she gave birth to Romulus and Remus, that they were
 fed by a she-wolf, etc. The Roman people believed this fable; they did
 not examine whether at that time there were vestals in Latium, whether
 it were probable that a king's daughter would leave her convent with her
 pitcher, whether it were likely that a she-wolf would suckle two
 children instead of eating them; the prejudice established itself.
 
 A monk writes that Clovis, being in great danger at the battle of
 Tolbiac, made a vow to turn Christian if he escaped; but is it natural
 to address oneself to a foreign god on such an occasion? is it not then
 that the religion in which one was born acts most potently? Which is the
 Christian who, in a battle against the Turks, will not address himself
 to the Holy Virgin rather than to Mohammed? It is added that a pigeon
 brought the holy phial in its beak to anoint Clovis, and that an angel
 brought the oriflamme to lead him; prejudice believed all the little
 stories of this kind. Those who understand human nature know well that
 Clovis the usurper and Rolon (or Rol) the usurper turned Christian in
 order to govern the Christians more surely, just as the Turkish usurpers
 turned Mussulman in order to govern the Mussulmans more surely.
 
 
 RELIGIOUS PREJUDICES
 
 If your nurse has told you that Ceres rules over the crops, or that
 Vistnou and Xaca made themselves men several times, or that Sammonocodom
 came to cut down a forest, or that Odin awaits you in his hall near
 Jutland, or that Mohammed or somebody else made a journey into the sky;
 if lastly your tutor comes to drive into your brain what your nurse has
 imprinted on it you keep it for life. If your judgment wishes to rise
 against these prejudices, your neighbours and, above all, your
 neighbours' wives cry out "Impious reprobate," and dismay you; your
 dervish, fearing to see his income diminish, accuses you to the cadi,
 and this cadi has you impaled if he can, because he likes ruling over
 fools, and thinks that fools obey better than others: and that will last
 until your neighbours and the dervish and the cadi begin to understand
 that foolishness is good for nothing, and that persecution is
 abominable.
 
 
 
 
 _RARE_
 
 
 Rare in natural philosophy is the opposite of dense. In moral
 philosophy, it is the opposite of common.
 
 This last variety of rare is what excites admiration. One never admires
 what is common, one enjoys it.
 
 An eccentric thinks himself above the rest of wretched mortals when he
 has in his study a rare medal that is good for nothing, a rare book that
 nobody has the courage to read, an old engraving by Albrecht Durer,
 badly designed and badly printed: he triumphs if he has in his garden a
 stunted tree from America. This eccentric has no taste; he has only
 vanity. He has heard say that the beautiful is rare; but he should know
 that all that is rare is not beautiful.
 
 Beauty is rare in all nature's works, and in all works of art.
 
 Whatever ill things have been said of women, I maintain that it is rarer
 to find women perfectly beautiful than passibly good.
 
 You will meet in the country ten thousand women attached to their homes,
 laborious, sober, feeding, rearing, teaching their children; and you
 will find barely one whom you could show at the theatres of Paris,
 London, Naples, or in the public gardens, and who would be looked on as
 a beauty.
 
 Likewise, in works of art, you have ten thousand daubs and scrawls to
 one masterpiece.
 
 If everything were beautiful and good, it is clear that one would no
 longer admire anything; one would enjoy. But would one have pleasure in
 enjoying? that is a big question.
 
 Why have the beautiful passages in "The Cid," "The Horaces," "Cinna,"
 had such a prodigious success? Because in the profound night in which
 people were plunged, they suddenly saw shine a new light that they did
 not expect. It was because this beauty was the rarest thing in the
 world.
 
 The groves of Versailles were a beauty unique in the world, as were then
 certain passages of Corneille. St. Peter's, Rome, is unique.
 
 But let us suppose that all the churches of Europe were equal to St.
 Peter's, Rome, that all statues were Venus dei Medici, that all
 tragedies were as beautiful as Racine's "Iphigenie", all works of poetry
 as well written as Boileau's "Art Poetique", all comedies as good as
 "Tartufe", and thus in every sphere; would you then have as much
 pleasure in enjoying masterpieces become common as they made you taste
 when they were rare? I say boldly "No!"; and I believe that the ancient
 school, which so rarely was right, was right when it said: _Ab assuetis
 non fit passio_, habit does not make passion.
 
 But, my dear reader, will it be the same with the works of nature? Will
 you be disgusted if all the maids are so beautiful as Helen; and you,
 ladies, if all the lads are like Paris? Let us suppose that all wines
 are excellent, will you have less desire to drink? if the partridges,
 pheasants, pullets are common at all times, will you have less appetite?
 I say boldly again "No!", despite the axiom of the schools, "Habit does
 not make passion": and the reason, you know it, is that all the
 pleasures which nature gives us are always recurring needs, necessary
 enjoyments, and that the pleasures of the arts are not necessary. It is
 not necessary for a man to have groves where water gushes to a height of
 a hundred feet from the mouth of a marble face, and on leaving these
 groves to go to see a fine tragedy. But the two sexes are always
 necessary to each other. The table and the bed are necessities. The
 habit of being alternately on these two thrones will never disgust you.
 
 In Paris a few years ago people admired a rhinoceros. If there were in
 one province ten thousand rhinoceroses, men would run after them only to
 kill them. But let there be a hundred thousand beautiful women men will
 always run after them to ... honour them.
 
 
 
 
 _REASON_
 
 
 At the time when all France was mad about Law's system, and Law was
 controller-general, there came to him in the presence of a great
 assembly a man who was always right, who always had reason on his side.
 Said he to Law:
 
 "Sir, you are the biggest madman, the biggest fool, or the biggest rogue
 who has yet appeared among us; and that is saying a great deal: this is
 how I prove it. You have imagined that a state's wealth can be increased
 tenfold with paper; but as this paper can represent only the money that
 is representative of true wealth, the products of the land and industry,
 you should have begun by giving us ten times more corn, wine, cloth,
 canvas, etc. That is not enough, you must be sure of your market. But
 you make ten times as many notes as we have of silver and commodities,
 therefore you are ten times more extravagant, or more inept, or more of
 a rogue than all the comptrollers who have preceded you. This is how I
 prove my major."
 
 Hardly had he started his major than he was conducted to Saint-Lazare.
 
 When he came out of Saint-Lazare, where he studied much and strengthened
 his reason, he went to Rome; he asked for a public audience of the Pope,
 on condition that he was not interrupted in his harangue; and he spoke
 to the Pope in these terms:
 
 "Holy Father, you are an antichrist and this is how I prove it to Your
 Holiness. I call antichrist the man who does the contrary to what Christ
 did and commanded. Now Christ was poor, and you are very rich; he paid
 tribute, and you exact tribute; he submitted to the powers that were,
 and you have become a power; he walked on foot, and you go to
 Castel-Gandolfo in a sumptuous equipage; he ate all that one was so good
 as to give him, and you want us to eat fish on Friday and Saturday, when
 we live far from sea and river; he forbade Simon Barjona to use a sword,
 and you have swords in your service, etc., etc., etc. Therefore in this
 sense Your Holiness is antichrist. In every other sense I hold you in
 great veneration, and I ask you for an indulgence _in articulo mortis_."
 
 My man was put in the Castello St. Angelo.
 
 When he came out of the Castello St. Angelo, he rushed to Venice, and
 asked to speak to the doge.
 
 "Your Serenity," he said, "must be a scatter-brain to marry the sea
 every year: for firstly, one only marries the same person once;
 secondly, your marriage resembles Harlequin's which was half made,
 seeing that it lacked but the consent of the bride; thirdly, who has
 told you that one day other maritime powers will not declare you
 incapable of consummating the marriage?"
 
 He spoke, and was shut up in the Tower of St. Mark's.
 
 When he came out of the Tower of St. Mark's, he went to Constantinople;
 he had audience of the mufti; and spoke to him in these terms:
 
 "Your religion, although it has some good points, such as worship of the
 great Being, and the necessity of being just and charitable, is
 otherwise nothing but a rehash of Judaism and a tedious collection of
 fairy tales. If the archangel Gabriel had brought the leaves of the
 Koran to Mahomet from some planet, all Arabia would have seen Gabriel
 come down: nobody saw him; therefore Mahomet was a brazen impostor who
 deceived imbeciles."
 
 Hardly had he pronounced these words than he was impaled. Nevertheless
 he had always been right, and had always had reason on his side.
 
 
 
 
 _RELIGION_
 
 
 I meditated last night; I was absorbed in the contemplation of nature; I
 admired the immensity, the course, the harmony of these infinite globes
 which the vulgar do not know how to admire.
 
 I admired still more the intelligence which directs these vast forces. I
 said to myself: "One must be blind not to be dazzled by this spectacle;
 one must be stupid not to recognize the author of it; one must be mad
 not to worship Him. What tribute of worship should I render Him? Should
 not this tribute be the same in the whole of space, since it is the same
 supreme power which reigns equally in all space? Should not a thinking
 being who dwells in a star in the Milky Way offer Him the same homage as
 the thinking being on this little globe where we are? Light is uniform
 for the star Sirius and for us; moral philosophy must be uniform. If a
 sentient, thinking animal in Sirius is born of a tender father and
 mother who have been occupied with his happiness, he owes them as much
 love and care as we owe to our parents. If someone in the Milky Way sees
 a needy cripple, if he can relieve him and if he does not do it, he is
 guilty toward all globes. Everywhere the heart has the same duties: on
 the steps of the throne of God, if He has a throne; and in the depth of
 the abyss, if He is an abyss."
 
 I was plunged in these ideas when one of those genii who fill the
 intermundane spaces came down to me. I recognized this same aerial
 creature who had appeared to me on another occasion to teach me how
 different God's judgments were from our own, and how a good action is
 preferable to a controversy.
 
 He transported me into a desert all covered with piled up bones; and
 between these heaps of dead men there were walks of ever-green trees,
 and at the end of each walk a tall man of august mien, who regarded
 these sad remains with pity.
 
 "Alas! my archangel," said I, "where have you brought me?"
 
 "To desolation," he answered.
 
 "And who are these fine patriarchs whom I see sad and motionless at the
 end of these green walks? they seem to be weeping over this countless
 crowd of dead."
 
 "You shall know, poor human creature," answered the genius from the
 intermundane spaces; "but first of all you must weep."
 
 He began with the first pile. "These," he said, "are the twenty-three
 thousand Jews who danced before a calf, with the twenty-four thousand
 who were killed while lying with Midianitish women. The number of those
 massacred for such errors and offences amounts to nearly three hundred
 thousand.
 
 "In the other walks are the bones of the Christians slaughtered by each
 other for metaphysical disputes. They are divided into several heaps of
 four centuries each. One heap would have mounted right to the sky; they
 had to be divided."
 
 "What!" I cried, "brothers have treated their brothers like this, and I
 have the misfortune to be of this brotherhood!"
 
 "Here," said the spirit, "are the twelve million Americans killed in
 their fatherland because they had not been baptized."
 
 "My God! why did you not leave these frightful bones to dry in the
 hemisphere where their bodies were born, and where they were consigned
 to so many different deaths? Why assemble here all these abominable
 monuments to barbarism and fanaticism?"
 
 "To instruct you."
 
 "Since you wish to instruct me," I said to the genius, "tell me if there
 have been peoples other than the Christians and the Jews in whom zeal
 and religion wretchedly transformed into fanaticism, have inspired so
 many horrible cruelties."
 
 "Yes," he said. "The Mohammedans were sullied with the same
 inhumanities, but rarely; and when one asked _amman_, pity, of them and
 offered them tribute, they pardoned. As for the other nations there has
 not been one right from the existence of the world which has ever made a
 purely religious war. Follow me now." I followed him.
 
 A little beyond these piles of dead men we found other piles; they were
 composed of sacks of gold and silver, and each had its label: _Substance
 of the heretics massacred in the eighteenth century, the seventeenth and
 the sixteenth._ And so on in going back: _Gold and silver of Americans
 slaughtered_, etc., etc. And all these piles were surmounted with
 crosses, mitres, croziers, triple crowns studded with precious stones.
 
 "What, my genius! it was then to have these riches that these dead were
 piled up?"
 
 "Yes, my son."
 
 I wept; and when by my grief I had merited to be led to the end of the
 green walks, he led me there.
 
 "Contemplate," he said, "the heroes of humanity who were the world's
 benefactors, and who were all united in banishing from the world, as far
 as they were able, violence and rapine. Question them."
 
 I ran to the first of the band; he had a crown on his head, and a little
 censer in his hand; I humbly asked him his name. "I am Numa Pompilius,"
 he said to me. "I succeeded a brigand, and I had brigands to govern: I
 taught them virtue and the worship of God; after me they forgot both
 more than once; I forbade that in the temples there should be any image,
 because the Deity which animates nature cannot be represented. During my
 reign the Romans had neither wars nor seditions, and my religion did
 nothing but good. All the neighbouring peoples came to honour me at my
 funeral: that happened to no one but me."
 
 I kissed his hand, and I went to the second. He was a fine old man about
 a hundred years old, clad in a white robe. He put his middle-finger on
 his mouth, and with the other hand he cast some beans behind him. I
 recognized Pythagoras. He assured me he had never had a golden thigh,
 and that he had never been a cock; but that he had governed the
 Crotoniates with as much justice as Numa governed the Romans, almost at
 the same time; and that this justice was the rarest and most necessary
 thing in the world. I learned that the Pythagoreans examined their
 consciences twice a day. The honest people! how far we are from them!
 But we who have been nothing but assassins for thirteen hundred years,
 we say that these wise men were arrogant.
 
 In order to please Pythagoras, I did not say a word to him and I passed
 to Zarathustra, who was occupied in concentrating the celestial fire in
 the focus of a concave mirror, in the middle of a hall with a hundred
 doors which all led to wisdom. (Zarathustra's precepts are called
 _doors_, and are a hundred in number.) Over the principal door I read
 these words which are the precis of all moral philosophy, and which cut
 short all the disputes of the casuists: "When in doubt if an action is
 good or bad, refrain."
 
 "Certainly," I said to my genius, "the barbarians who immolated all
 these victims had never read these beautiful words."
 
 We then saw the Zaleucus, the Thales, the Aniximanders, and all the
 sages who had sought truth and practised virtue.
 
 When we came to Socrates, I recognized him very quickly by his flat
 nose. "Well," I said to him, "here you are then among the number of the
 Almighty's confidants! All the inhabitants of Europe, except the Turks
 and the Tartars of the Crimea, who know nothing, pronounce your name
 with respect. It is revered, loved, this great name, to the point that
 people have wanted to know those of your persecutors. Melitus and
 Anitus are known because of you, just as Ravaillac is known because of
 Henry IV.; but I know only this name of Anitus. I do not know precisely
 who was the scoundrel who calumniated you, and who succeeded in having
 you condemned to take hemlock."
 
 "Since my adventure," replied Socrates, "I have never thought about that
 man; but seeing that you make me remember it, I have much pity for him.
 He was a wicked priest who secretly conducted a business in hides, a
 trade reputed shameful among us. He sent his two children to my school.
 The other disciples taunted them with having a father who was a currier;
 they were obliged to leave. The irritated father had no rest until he
 had stirred up all the priests and all the sophists against me. They
 persuaded the counsel of the five hundred that I was an impious fellow
 who did not believe that the Moon, Mercury and Mars were gods. Indeed, I
 used to think, as I think now, that there is only one God, master of all
 nature. The judges handed me over to the poisoner of the republic; he
 cut short my life by a few days: I died peacefully at the age of
 seventy; and since that time I pass a happy life with all these great
 men whom you see, and of whom I am the least."
 
 After enjoying some time in conversation with Socrates, I went forward
 with my guide into a grove situated above the thickets where all the
 sages of antiquity seemed to be tasting sweet repose.
 
 I saw a man of gentle, simple countenance, who seemed to me to be about
 thirty-five years old. From afar he cast compassionate glances on these
 piles of whitened bones, across which I had had to pass to reach the
 sages' abode. I was astonished to find his feet swollen and bleeding,
 his hands likewise, his side pierced, and his ribs flayed with whip
 cuts. "Good Heavens!" I said to him, "is it possible for a just man, a
 sage, to be in this state? I have just seen one who was treated in a
 very hateful way, but there is no comparison between his torture and
 yours. Wicked priests and wicked judges poisoned him; is it by priests
 and judges that you have been so cruelly assassinated?"
 
 He answered with much courtesy--"_Yes._"
 
 "And who were these monsters?"
 
 "_They were hypocrites._"
 
 "Ah! that says everything; I understand by this single word that they
 must have condemned you to death. Had you then proved to them, as
 Socrates did, that the Moon was not a goddess, and that Mercury was not
 a god?"
 
 "_No, these planets were not in question. My compatriots did not know at
 all what a planet is; they were all arrant ignoramuses. Their
 superstitions were quite different from those of the Greeks._"
 
 "You wanted to teach them a new religion, then?"
 
 "_Not at all; I said to them simply--'Love God with all your heart and
 your fellow-creature as yourself, for that is man's whole duty.' Judge
 if this precept is not as old as the universe; judge if I brought them a
 new religion. I did not stop telling them that I had come not to destroy
 the law but to fulfil it; I had observed all their rites; circumcised as
 they all were, baptized as were the most zealous among them, like them I
 paid the Corban; I observed the Passover as they did, eating standing up
 a lamb cooked with lettuces. I and my friends went to pray in the
 temple; my friends even frequented this temple after my death; in a
 word, I fulfilled all their laws without a single exception._"
 
 "What! these wretches could not even reproach you with swerving from
 their laws?"
 
 "_No, without a doubt._"
 
 "Why then did they put you in the condition in which I now see you?"
 
 "_What do you expect me to say! they were very arrogant and selfish.
 They saw that I knew them; they knew that I was making the citizens
 acquainted with them; they were the stronger; they took away my life:
 and people like them will always do as much, if they can, to whoever
 does them too much justice._"
 
 "But did you say nothing, do nothing that could serve them as a
 pretext?"
 
 "_To the wicked everything serves as pretext._"
 
 "Did you not say once that you were come not to send peace, but a
 sword?"
 
 "_It is a copyist's error; I told them that I sent peace and not a
 sword. I have never written anything; what I said can have been changed
 without evil intention._"
 
 "You therefore contributed in no way by your speeches, badly reported,
 badly interpreted, to these frightful piles of bones which I saw on my
 road in coming to consult you?"
 
 "_It is with horror only that I have seen those who have made themselves
 guilty of these murders._"
 
 "And these monuments of power and wealth, of pride and avarice, these
 treasures, these ornaments, these signs of grandeur, which I have seen
 piled up on the road while I was seeking wisdom, do they come from you?"
 
 "_That is impossible; I and my people lived in poverty and meanness: my
 grandeur was in virtue only._"
 
 I was about to beg him to be so good as to tell me just who he was. My
 guide warned me to do nothing of the sort. He told me that I was not
 made to understand these sublime mysteries. Only did I conjure him to
 tell me in what true religion consisted.
 
 "_Have I not already told you? Love God and your fellow-creature as
 yourself._"
 
 "What! if one loves God, one can eat meat on Friday?"
 
 "_I always ate what was given me; for I was too poor to give anyone
 food._"
 
 "In loving God, in being just, should one not be rather cautious not to
 confide all the adventures of one's life to an unknown man?"
 
 "_That was always my practice._"
 
 "Can I not, by doing good, dispense with making a pilgrimage to St.
 James of Compostella?"
 
 "_I have never been in that country._"
 
 "Is it necessary for me to imprison myself in a retreat with fools?"
 
 "_As for me, I always made little journeys from town to town._"
 
 "Is it necessary for me to take sides either for the Greek Church or the
 Latin?"
 
 "_When I was in the world I never made any difference between the Jew
 and the Samaritan._"
 
 "Well, if that is so, I take you for my only master." Then he made me a
 sign with his head which filled me with consolation. The vision
 disappeared, and a clear conscience stayed with me.
 
 
 
 
 _SECT_
 
 
 SECTION I
 
 Every sect, in whatever sphere, is the rallying-point of doubt and
 error. Scotist, Thomist, Realist, Nominalist, Papist, Calvinist,
 Molinist, Jansenist, are only pseudonyms.
 
 There are no sects in geometry; one does not speak of a Euclidian, an
 Archimedean.
 
 When the truth is evident, it is impossible for parties and factions to
 arise. Never has there been a dispute as to whether there is daylight at
 noon.
 
 The branch of astronomy which determines the course of the stars and the
 return of eclipses being once known, there is no more dispute among
 astronomers.
 
 In England one does not say--"I am a Newtonian, a Lockian, a Halleyan."
 Why? Those who have read cannot refuse their assent to the truths taught
 by these three great men. The more Newton is revered, the less do people
 style themselves Newtonians; this word supposes that there are
 anti-Newtonians in England. Maybe we still have a few Cartesians in
 France; that is solely because Descartes' system is a tissue of
 erroneous and ridiculous imaginings.
 
 It is likewise with the small number of truths of fact which are well
 established. The records of the Tower of London having been
 authentically gathered by Rymer, there are no Rymerians, because it
 occurs to no one to combat this collection. In it one finds neither
 contradictions, absurdities nor prodigies; nothing which revolts the
 reason, nothing, consequently, which sectarians strive to maintain or
 upset by absurd arguments. Everyone agrees, therefore, that Rymer's
 records are worthy of belief.
 
 You are Mohammedan, therefore there are people who are not, therefore
 you might well be wrong.
 
 What would be the true religion if Christianity did not exist? the
 religion in which there were no sects; the religion in which all minds
 were necessarily in agreement.
 
 Well, to what dogma do all minds agree? to the worship of a God and to
 integrity. All the philosophers of the world who have had a religion
 have said in all time--"There is a God, and one must be just." There,
 then, is the universal religion established in all time and throughout
 mankind.
 
 The point in which they all agree is therefore true, and the systems
 through which they differ are therefore false.
 
 "My sect is the best," says a Brahmin to me. But, my friend, if your
 sect is good, it is necessary; for if it were not absolutely necessary
 you would admit to me that it was useless: if it is absolutely
 necessary, it is for all men; how then can it be that all men have not
 what is absolutely necessary to them? How is it possible for the rest of
 the world to laugh at you and your Brahma?
 
 When Zarathustra, Hermes, Orpheus, Minos and all the great men say--"Let
 us worship God, and let us be just," nobody laughs; but everyone hisses
 the man who claims that one cannot please God unless when one dies one
 is holding a cow's tail, and the man who wants one to have the end of
 one's prepuce cut off, and the man who consecrates crocodiles and
 onions, and the man who attaches eternal salvation to the dead men's
 bones one carries under one's shirt, or to a plenary indulgence which
 one buys at Rome for two and a half sous.
 
 Whence comes this universal competition in hisses and derision from one
 end of the world to the other? It is clear that the things at which
 everyone sneers are not of a very evident truth. What shall we say of
 one of Sejan's secretaries who dedicated to Petronius a bombastic book
 entitled--"The Truths of the Sibylline Oracles, Proved by the Facts"?
 
 This secretary proves to you first that it was necessary for God to send
 on earth several sibyls one after the other; for He had no other means
 of teaching mankind. It is demonstrated that God spoke to these sibyls,
 for the word _sibyl_ signifies _God's counsel_. They had to live a long
 time, for it is the very least that persons to whom God speaks should
 have this privilege. They were twelve in number, for this number is
 sacred. They had certainly predicted all the events in the world, for
 Tarquinius Superbus bought three of their Books from an old woman for a
 hundred crowns. "What incredulous fellow," adds the secretary, "will
 dare deny all these evident facts which happened in a corner before the
 whole world? Who can deny the fulfilment of their prophecies? Has not
 Virgil himself quoted the predictions of the sibyls? If we have not the
 first examples of the Sibylline Books, written at a time when people did
 not know how to read or write, have we not authentic copies? Impiety
 must be silent before such proofs." Thus did Houttevillus speak to
 Sejan. He hoped to have a position as augur which would be worth an
 income of fifty thousand francs, and he had nothing.[20]
 
 "What my sect teaches is obscure, I admit it," says a fanatic; "and it
 is because of this obscurity that it must be believed; for the sect
 itself says it is full of obscurities. My sect is extravagant, therefore
 it is divine; for how should what appears so mad have been embraced by
 so many peoples, if it were not divine?" It is precisely like the
 Alcoran which the Sonnites say has an angel's face and an animal's
 snout; be not scandalized by the animal's snout, and worship the angel's
 face. Thus speaks this insensate fellow. But a fanatic of another sect
 answers--"It is you who are the animal, and I who am the angel."
 
 Well, who shall judge the suit? who shall decide between these two
 fanatics? The reasonable, impartial man learned in a knowledge that is
 not that of words; the man free from prejudice and lover of truth and
 justice; in short, the man who is not the foolish animal, and who does
 not think he is the angel.
 
 
 SECTION II
 
 _Sect_ and _error_ are synonymous. You are Peripatetic and I
 Platonician; we are therefore both wrong; for you combat Plato only
 because his fantasies have revolted you, and I am alienated from
 Aristotle only because it seems to me that he does not know what he is
 talking about. If one or the other had demonstrated the truth, there
 would be a sect no longer. To declare oneself for the opinion of the one
 or the other is to take sides in a civil war. There are no sects in
 mathematics, in experimental physics. A man who examines the relations
 between a cone and a sphere is not of the sect of Archimedes: he who
 sees that the square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is
 equal to the square of the two other sides is not of the sect of
 Pythagoras.
 
 When you say that the blood circulates, that the air is heavy, that the
 sun's rays are pencils of seven refrangible rays, you are not either of
 the sect of Harvey, or the sect of Torricelli, or the sect of Newton;
 you agree merely with the truth demonstrated by them, and the entire
 universe will ever be of your opinion.
 
 This is the character of truth; it is of all time; it is for all men; it
 has only to show itself to be recognized; one cannot argue against it. A
 long dispute signifies--"Both parties are wrong."

 _SELF-ESTEEM_
 
 
 Nicole in his "Essais de Morale," written after two or three thousand
 volumes of ethics ("Treatise on Charity," Chap. II), says that "by means
 of the wheels and gibbets which people establish in common are repressed
 the tyrannous thoughts and designs of each individual's self-esteem."
 
 I shall not examine whether people have gibbets in common, as they have
 meadows and woods in common, and a common purse, and if one represses
 ideas with wheels; but it seems very strange to me that Nicole should
 take highway robbery and assassination for self-esteem. One should
 distinguish shades of difference a little better. The man who said that
 Nero had his mother assassinated through self-esteem, that Cartouche had
 much self-esteem, would not be expressing himself very correctly.
 Self-esteem is not wickedness, it is a sentiment that is natural to all
 men; it is much nearer vanity than crime.
 
 A beggar in the suburbs of Madrid nobly begged charity; a passer-by says
 to him: "Are you not ashamed to practise this infamous calling when you
 are able to work?"
 
 "Sir," answered the beggar, "I ask for money, not advice." And he turned
 on his heel with full Castillian dignity.
 
 This gentleman was a proud beggar, his vanity was wounded by a trifle.
 He asked charity out of love for himself, and could not tolerate the
 reprimand out of further love for himself.
 
 A missionary travelling in India met a fakir laden with chains, naked as
 a monkey, lying on his stomach, and having himself whipped for the sins
 of his compatriots, the Indians, who gave him a few farthings.
 
 "What self-denial!" said one of the lookers-on.
 
 "Self-denial!" answered the fakir. "Learn that I have myself flogged in
 this world in order to return it in another, when you will be horses and
 I horseman."
 
 Those who have said that love of ourselves is the basis of all our
 opinions and all our actions, have therefore been quite right in India,
 Spain, and all the habitable world: and as one does not write to prove
 to men that they have faces, it is not necessary to prove to them that
 they have self-esteem. Self-esteem is the instrument of our
 conservation; it resembles the instrument of the perpetuity of the
 species: it is necessary, it is dear to us, it gives us pleasure, and it
 has to be hidden.
 
 
 
 
 _SOUL_
 
 
 SECTION I
 
 This is a vague, indeterminate term, which expresses an unknown
 principle of known effects that we feel in us. The word _soul_
 corresponds to the Latin _anima_, to the Greek +pneuma+, to the term of
 which all nations have made use to express what they did not understand
 any better than we do.
 
 In the proper and literal sense of the Latin and the languages derived
 from Latin, it signifies _that which animates_. Thus people have spoken
 of the soul of men, of animals, sometimes of plants, to signify their
 principal of vegetation and life. In pronouncing this word, people have
 never had other than a confused idea, as when it is said in
 Genesis--"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
 breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
 soul; and the soul of animals is in the blood; and kill not my soul,
 etc."
 
 Thus the soul was generally taken for the origin and the cause of life,
 for life itself. That is why all known nations long imagined that
 everything died with the body. If one can disentangle anything in the
 chaos of ancient histories, it seems that the Egyptians at least were
 the first to distinguish between the intelligence and the soul: and the
 Greeks learned from them to distinguish their +nous+, their +pneuma+,
 their +skia+. The Latins, following their example, distinguish _animus_
 and _anima_; and we, finally, have also had our _soul_ and our
 _understanding_. But is that which is the principle of our life
 different from that which is the principle of our thoughts? is it the
 same being? Does that which directs us and gives us sensation and
 memory resemble that which is in animals the cause of digestion and the
 cause of their sensations and of their memory?
 
 There is the eternal object of the disputes of mankind; I say eternal
 object; for not having any first notion from which we can descend in
 this examination, we can only rest for ever in a labyrinth of doubt and
 feeble conjecture.
 
 We have not the smallest step where we may place a foot in order to
 reach the most superficial knowledge of what makes us live and of what
 makes us think. How should we have? we should have had to see life and
 thought enter a body. Does a father know how he has produced his son?
 does a mother how she conceived him? Has anyone ever been able to divine
 how he acts, how he wakes, how he sleeps? Does anyone know how his limbs
 obey his will? has anyone discovered by what art ideas are marked out in
 his brain and issue from it at his command? Frail automatons moved by
 the invisible hand which directs us on this stage of the world, which of
 us has been able to detect the wire which guides us?
 
 We dare question whether the soul is "spirit" or "matter"; if it is
 created before us, if it issues from non-existence at our birth, if
 after animating us for one day on earth, it lives after us into
 eternity. These questions appear sublime; what are they? questions of
 blind men saying to other blind men--"What is light?"
 
 When we want to learn something roughly about a piece of metal, we put
 it in a crucible in the fire. But have we a crucible in which to put the
 soul? "The soul is _spirit_," says one. But what is spirit? Assuredly no
 one has any idea; it is a word that is so void of sense that one is
 obliged to say what spirit is not, not being able to say what it is.
 "The soul is matter," says another. But what is matter? We know merely
 some of its appearances and some of its properties; and not one of these
 properties, not one of these appearances, seems to have the slightest
 connection with thought.
 
 "Thought is something distinct from matter," say you. But what proof of
 it have you? Is it because matter is divisible and figurable, and
 thought is not? But who has told you that the first principles of matter
 are divisible and figurable? It is very probable that they are not;
 entire sects of philosophers maintain that the elements of matter have
 neither form nor extension. With a triumphant air you cry--"Thought is
 neither wood, nor stone, nor sand, nor metal, therefore thought does not
 belong to matter." Weak, reckless reasoners! gravitation is neither
 wood, nor sand, nor metal, nor stone; movement, vegetation, life are not
 these things either, and yet life, vegetation, movement, gravitation,
 are given to matter. To say that God cannot make matter think is to say
 the most insolently absurd thing that anyone has ever dared utter in the
 privileged schools of lunacy. We are not certain that God has treated
 matter like this; we are only certain that He can. But what matters all
 that has been said and all that will be said about the soul? what does
 it matter that it has been called entelechy, quintessence, flame, ether?
 that it has been thought universal, uncreated, transmigrant, etc.?
 
 In these matters that are inaccessible to the reason, what do these
 romances of our uncertain imaginations matter? What does it matter that
 the Fathers of the first four centuries thought the soul corporeal? What
 does it matter that Tertullian, by a contradiction frequent in him, has
 decided that it is simultaneously corporeal, formed and simple? We have
 a thousand witnesses to ignorance, and not one that gives a glimmer of
 probability.
 
 How then are we so bold as to assert what the soul is? We know certainly
 that we exist, that we feel, that we think. Do we want to take a step
 beyond? we fall into a shadowy abyss; and in this abyss we are still so
 madly reckless as to dispute whether this soul, of which we have not the
 least idea, was made before us or with us, and whether it perishes or is
 immortal.
 
 The article SOUL, and all the articles of the nature of metaphysics,
 must start by a sincere submission to the incontrovertible dogmas of
 the Church. Revelation is worth more, without doubt, than the whole of
 philosophy. Systems exercise the mind, but faith illumines and guides
 it.
 
 Do we not often pronounce words of which we have only a very confused
 idea, or even of which we have none at all? Is not the word _soul_ an
 instance? When the clapper or valve of a bellows is out of order, and
 when air which is in the bellows leaves it by some unexpected opening in
 this valve, so that it is no longer compressed against the two blades,
 and is not thrust violently towards the hearth which it has to light,
 French servants say--"The soul of the bellows has burst." They know no
 more about it than that; and this question in no wise disturbs their
 peace of mind.
 
 The gardener utters the phrase "the soul of the plants," and cultivates
 them very well without knowing what he means by this term.
 
 The violin-maker poses, draws forward or back the "soul of a violin"
 beneath the bridge in the belly of the instrument; a puny piece of wood
 more or less gives the violin or takes away from it a harmonious soul.
 
 We have many industries in which the workmen give the qualification of
 "soul" to their machines. Never does one hear them dispute about this
 word. Such is not the case with philosophers.
 
 For us the word "soul" signifies generally that which animates. Our
 ancestors the Celts gave to their soul the name of _seel_, from which
 the English _soul_, and the German _seel_; and probably the ancient
 Teutons and the ancient Britons had no quarrels in their universities
 over this expression.
 
 The Greeks distinguished three sorts of souls--+psyche+, which signified
 the sensitive soul, the soul of the senses; and that is why Love, child
 of Aphrodite, had so much passion for Psyche, and why Psyche loved him
 so tenderly: +pneuma+, the breath which gives life and movement to the
 whole machine, and which we have translated by _spiritus_, spirit;
 vague word to which have been given a thousand different meanings: and
 finally +nous+, the intelligence.
 
 We possessed therefore three souls, without having the least notion of
 any of them. St. Thomas Aquinas (Summation of St. Thomas. Lyons edition,
 1738) admits these three souls as a peripatetic, and distinguishes each
 of these three souls in three parts. +psyche+ was in the breast,
 +pneuma+ was distributed throughout the body, and +nous+ was in the
 head. There has been no other philosophy in our schools up to our day,
 and woe betide any man who took one of these souls for the other.
 
 In this chaos of ideas there was, nevertheless, a foundation. Men had
 noticed that in their passions of love, hate, anger, fear, their
 internal organs were stimulated to movement. The liver and the heart
 were the seat of the passions. If one thought deeply, one felt a strife
 in the organs of the head; therefore the intellectual soul was in the
 head. Without respiration no vegetation, no life; therefore the
 vegetative soul was in the breast which receives the breath of air.
 
 When men saw in dreams their dead relatives or friends, they had to seek
 what had appeared to them. It was not the body which had been consumed
 on a funeral pyre, or swallowed up in the sea and eaten by the fishes.
 It was, however, something, so they maintained; for they had seen it;
 the dead man had spoken; the dreamer had questioned him. Was it
 +psyche+, was it +pneuma+, was it +nous+, with whom one had conversed in
 the dream? One imagined a phantom, an airy figure: it was +skia+, it was
 +daimon+, a ghost from the shades, a little soul of air and fire, very
 unrestricted, which wandered I know not where.
 
 Eventually, when one wanted to sift the matter, it became a constant
 that this soul was corporeal; and the whole of antiquity never had any
 other idea. At last came Plato who so subtilized this soul that it was
 doubtful if he did not separate it entirely from matter; but that was a
 problem that was never solved until faith came to enlighten us.
 
 In vain do the materialists quote some of the fathers of the Church who
 did not express themselves with precision. St. Irenaeus says (liv. v.
 chaps. vi and vii) that the soul is only the breath of life, that it is
 incorporeal only by comparison with the mortal body, and that it
 preserves the form of man so that it may be recognized.
 
 In vain does Tertullian express himself like this--"The corporeality of
 the soul shines bright in the Gospel." (_Corporalitas animae in ipso
 Evangelio relucescit_, DE ANIMA, cap. vii.) For if the soul did
 not have a body, the image of the soul would not have the image of the
 body.
 
 In vain does he record the vision of a holy woman who had seen a very
 shining soul, of the colour of air.
 
 In vain does Tatien say expressly (_Oratio ad Graecos_, c. xxiii.)--"The
 soul of man is composed of many parts."
 
 In vain is St. Hilarius quoted as saying in later times (St. Hilarius on
 St. Matthew)--"There is nothing created which is not corporeal, either
 in heaven, or on earth, or among the visible, or among the invisible:
 everything is formed of elements; and souls, whether they inhabit a
 body, or issue from it, have always a corporeal substance."
 
 In vain does St. Ambrose, in the sixth century, say (On Abraham, liv.
 ii., ch. viii.)--"We recognize nothing but the material, except the
 venerable Trinity alone."
 
 The body of the entire Church has decided that the soul is immaterial.
 These saints fell into an error at that time universal; they were men;
 but they were not mistaken over immortality, because that is clearly
 announced in the Gospels.
 
 We have so evident a need of the decision of the infallible Church on
 these points of philosophy, that we have not indeed by ourselves any
 sufficient notion of what is called "pure spirit," and of what is named
 "matter." Pure spirit is an expression which gives us no idea; and we
 know matter only by a few phenomena. We know it so little that we call
 it "substance"; well, the word substance means "that which is under";
 but what is under will be eternally hidden from us. What is _under_ is
 the Creator's secret; and this secret of the Creator is everywhere. We
 do not know either how we receive life, or how we give it, or how we
 grow, or how we digest, or how we sleep, or how we think, or how we
 feel.
 
 The great difficulty is to understand how a being, whoever he be, has
 thoughts.
 
 
 SECTION II
 
 The author of the article SOUL in the "Encyclopedia" (the Abbe Yvon)
 followed Jaquelot scrupulously; but Jaquelot teaches us nothing. He sets
 himself also against Locke, because the modest Locke said (liv. iv, ch.
 iii, para. vi.)--"We possibly shall never be able to know whether any
 mere material being thinks or no; it being impossible for us, by the
 contemplation of our own ideas without revelation, to discover whether
 Omnipotency has not given to some systems of matter, fitly disposed, a
 power to perceive and think, or else joined and fixed to matter, so
 disposed, a thinking immaterial substance: it being, in respect of our
 notions, not much more remote from our comprehension to conceive that
 God can, if he pleases, superadd to matter a faculty of thinking, than
 that he should superadd to it another substance with a faculty of
 thinking; since we know not wherein thinking consists, nor to what sort
 of substances the Almighty has been pleased to give that power which
 cannot be in any created being but merely by the good pleasure and
 bounty of the Creator, for I see no contradiction in it, that the first
 eternal thinking Being should, if he pleased, give to certain systems of
 created senseless matter, put together as he thinks fit, some degrees of
 sense, perception and thought."
 
 Those are the words of a profound, religious and modest man.
 
 We know what quarrels he had to undergo on account of this opinion which
 appeared bold, but which was in fact in him only a consequence of his
 conviction of the omnipotence of God and the weakness of man. He did not
 say that matter thought; but he said that we have not enough knowledge
 to demonstrate that it is impossible for God to add the gift of thought
 to the unknown being called "matter", after according it the gift of
 gravitation and the gift of movement, both of which are equally
 incomprehensible.
 
 Locke was not assuredly the only one who had advanced this opinion; it
 was the opinion of all antiquity, who, regarding the soul as very
 unrestricted matter, affirmed consequently that matter could feel and
 think.
 
 It was Gassendi's opinion, as may be seen in his objections to
 Descartes. "It is true," says Gassendi, "that you know what you think;
 but you are ignorant of what species of substance you are, you who
 think. Thus although the operation of thought is known to you, the
 principle of your essence is hidden from you; and you do not know what
 is the nature of this substance, one of the operations of which is to
 think. You are like a blind man who, feeling the heat of the sun and
 being informed that it is caused by the heat of the sun, thinks he has a
 clear and distinct idea of this luminary; because if he were asked what
 the sun was, he could reply that it is a thing which heats, etc."
 
 The same Gassendi, in his "Epicurean Philosophy," repeats several times
 that there is no mathematical evidence of the pure spirituality of the
 soul.
 
 Descartes, in one of his letters to the Palatine Princess Elisabeth,
 says to her--"I confess that by the natural reason alone we can make
 many conjectures on the soul, and have gratifying hopes, but no
 certainty." And in that sentence Descartes combats in his letters what
 he puts forward in his works; a too ordinary contradiction.
 
 In fine we have seen that all the Fathers of the first centuries of the
 Church, while believing the soul immortal, believed it at the same time
 material; they thought that it is as easy for God to conserve as to
 create. They said--"God made the soul thinking, He will preserve it
 thinking."
 
 Malebranche has proved very well that we have no idea by ourselves, and
 that objects are incapable of giving us ideas: from that he concludes
 that we see everything in God. That is at the bottom the same thing as
 making God the author of all our ideas; for with what should we see in
 Him, if we had not instruments for seeing? and these instruments, it is
 He alone who holds them and guides them. This system is a labyrinth, one
 lane of which would lead you to Spinozism, another to Stoicism, another
 to chaos.
 
 When one has had a good argument about spirit and matter, one always
 finishes by not understanding each other. No philosopher has been able
 with his own strength to lift this veil stretched by nature over all the
 first principles of things. Men argue, nature acts.
 
 
 SECTION III
 
 OF THE SOUL OF ANIMALS, AND OF SOME EMPTY IDEAS
 
 Before the strange system which supposes animals to be pure machines
 without any sensation, men had never thought that the beasts possessed
 an immaterial soul; and nobody had pushed recklessness to the point of
 saying that an oyster has a spiritual soul. Everyone concurred peaceably
 in agreeing that the beasts had received from God feeling, memory,
 ideas, and no pure spirit. Nobody had abused the gift of reason to the
 point of saying that nature had given the beasts all the organs of
 feeling so that they might not feel anything. Nobody had said that they
 cry when they are wounded, and that they fly when pursued, without
 experiencing pain or fear.
 
 At that time people did not deny the omnipotence of God; He had been
 able to communicate to the organized matter of animals pleasure, pain,
 remembrance, the combination of a few ideas; He had been able to give to
 several of them, such as the monkey, the elephant, the hunting-dog, the
 talent of perfecting themselves in the arts which were taught to them;
 not only had He been able to endow nearly all carnivorous animals with
 the talent of warring better in their experienced old age than in their
 too trustful youth; not only, I say, had He been able to do these
 things, but He had done them: the universe bore witness thereto.
 
 Pereira and Descartes maintained that the universe was mistaken, that
 God was a juggler, that He had given animals all the instruments of life
 and sensation, so that they might have neither life nor sensation,
 properly speaking. But I do not know what so-called philosophers, in
 order to answer Descartes' chimera, leaped into the opposite chimera;
 they gave liberally of pure spirit to the toads and the insects.
 
 Between these two madnesses, the one refusing feeling to the organs of
 feeling, the other lodging a pure spirit in a bug, somebody thought of a
 middle path. It was instinct. And what is instinct? Oh, oh, it is a
 substantial form; it is a plastic form; it is I do not know what! it is
 instinct. I shall be of your opinion so long as you will call the
 majority of things, "I do not know what"; so long as your philosophy
 begins and ends with "I do not know what", I shall quote Prior to you in
 his poem on the vanity of the world.
 
 The author of the article SOUL in the "Encyclopedia" explains
 himself like this:--"I picture the animals' soul as an immaterial and
 intelligent substance, but of what species? It must, it seems to me, be
 an active principle which has sensations, and which has only that.... If
 we reflect on the nature of the soul of animals, it supplies us with
 groundwork which might lead us to think that its spirituality will save
 it from annihilation."
 
 I do not know how one pictures an immaterial substance. To picture
 something is to make an image of it; and up till now nobody has been
 able to paint the spirit. For the word "picture", I want the author to
 understand "I conceive"; speaking for myself, I confess I do not
 conceive it. I confess still less that a spiritual soul may be
 annihilated, because I do not conceive either creation or non-existence;
 because I have never been present at God's council; because I know
 nothing at all about the principle of things.
 
 If I wish to prove that the soul is a real being, someone stops me by
 telling me that it is a faculty. If I assert that it is a faculty, and
 that I have the faculty of thinking, I am told that I am mistaken; that
 God, the eternal master of all nature, does everything in me, and
 directs all my actions and all my thoughts; that if I produced my
 thoughts, I should know the thought I will have in a minute; that I
 never know it; that I am only an automaton with sensations and ideas,
 necessarily dependent, and in the hands of the Supreme Being, infinitely
 more compliant to Him than clay is to the potter.
 
 I confess my ignorance, therefore; I avow that four thousand tomes of
 metaphysics will not teach us what our soul is.
 
 An orthodox philosopher said to a heterodox philosopher--"How have you
 been able to come to the point of imagining that the soul is mortal by
 nature, and eternal only by the pure wish of God?"
 
 "By my own experience," said the other.
 
 "How! are you dead?"
 
 "Yes, very often. I suffered from epilepsy in my youth, and I assure you
 that I was completely dead for several hours. No sensation, no
 remembrance even of the moment that I fell ill. The same thing happens
 to me now nearly every night. I never feel the precise moment that I go
 to sleep; my sleep is absolutely dreamless. I cannot imagine by
 conjecture how long I have slept. I am dead regularly six hours out of
 the twenty-four. That is a quarter of my life."
 
 The orthodox then asserted that he always thought during his sleep
 without knowing anything about it. The heterodox answered him--"I
 believe through revelation that I shall always think in the other life;
 but I assure you I think rarely in this one."
 
 The orthodox was not mistaken in asserting the immortality of the soul,
 for faith and reason demonstrate this truth; but he might be mistaken in
 asserting that a sleeping man always thinks.
 
 Locke admitted frankly that he did not always think while he was asleep:
 another philosopher has said--"Thought is characteristic of man; but it
 is not his essence."
 
 Let us leave to each man the liberty and consolation of seeking himself,
 and of losing himself in his ideas.
 
 It is good, however, to know, that in 1730 a philosopher[21] suffered a
 severe enough persecution for having confessed, with Locke, that his
 understanding was not exercised at every moment of the day and night,
 just as he did not use his arms and his legs at all moments. Not only
 did court ignorance persecute him, but the malignant influence of a few
 so-called men of letters was let loose against him. What in England had
 produced merely a few philosophical disputes, produced in France the
 most cowardly atrocities; a Frenchman suffered by Locke.
 
 There have always been in the mud of our literature more than one of
 these miscreants who have sold their pens, and intrigued against their
 benefactors even. This remark is rather foreign to the article
 SOUL; but should one miss an opportunity of dismaying those who
 make themselves unworthy of the name of men of letters, who prostitute
 the little mind and conscience they have to a vile self-interest, to a
 fantastic policy, who betray their friends to flatter fools, who in
 secret powder the hemlock which the powerful and malicious ignoramus
 wants to make useful citizens drink?
 
 In short, while we worship God with all our soul, let us confess always
 our profound ignorance of this soul, of this faculty of feeling and
 thinking which we possess from His infinite goodness. Let us avow that
 our feeble reasonings can take nothing away from, or add anything to
 revelation and faith. Let us conclude in fine that we should use this
 intelligence, the nature of which is unknown, for perfecting the
 sciences which are the object of the "Encyclopedia"; just as watchmakers
 use springs in their watches, without knowing what a spring is.
 
 
 SECTION IV
 
 ABOUT THE SOUL, AND ABOUT OUR LITTLE KNOWLEDGE
 
 On the testimony of our acquired knowledge, we have dared question
 whether the soul is created before us, whether it comes from
 non-existence into our body? at what age it came to settle between a
 bladder and the intestines _caecum_ and _rectum_? if it brought ideas
 with it or received them there, and what are these ideas? if after
 animating us for a few moments, its essence is to live after us into
 eternity without the intervention of God Himself? if being spirit, and
 God being spirit, they are both of like nature? These questions seem
 sublime; what are they? questions about light by men born blind.
 
 What have all the philosophers, ancient and modern, taught us? a child
 is wiser than they are; he does not think about things of which he can
 form no conception.
 
 You will say that it is sad for our insatiable curiosity, for our
 inexhaustible thirst for happiness, to be thus ignorant of ourselves! I
 agree, and there are still sadder things; but I shall answer you:
 
      _Sors tua mortalis, non est mortale quod optas._
 
                                          --Ovid, Met. II. 56
 
      "You have a man's fate, and a god's desires."
 
 Once again, it seems that the nature of every principle of things is the
 Creator's secret. How does the air carry sound? how are animals formed?
 how do some of our limbs constantly obey our wills? what hand puts ideas
 in our memory, keeps them there as in a register, and pulls them out
 sometimes when we want them and sometimes in spite of ourselves? Our
 nature, the nature of the universe, the nature of the least plant,
 everything for us is sunk in a shadowy pit.
 
 Man is an acting, feeling, thinking being: that is all we know of him:
 it is not given to us to know what makes us feel and think, or what
 makes us act, or what makes us exist. The acting faculty is as
 incomprehensible for us as the thinking faculty. The difficulty is less
 to conceive how a body of mud has feelings and ideas, than to conceive
 how a being, whatever it be, has ideas and feelings.
 
 Here on one side the soul of Archimedes, on the other the soul of an
 idiot; are they of the same nature? If their essence is to think, they
 think always, and independently of the body which cannot act without
 them. If they think by their own nature, can the species of a soul which
 cannot do a sum in arithmetic be the same as that which measured the
 heavens? If it is the organs of the body which made Archimedes think,
 why is it that my idiot, who has a stronger constitution than
 Archimedes, who is more vigorous, digests better and performs all his
 functions better, does not think at all? It is, you say, because his
 brain is not so good. But you are making a supposition; you do not know
 at all. No difference has ever been found between healthy brains that
 have been dissected. It is even very probable that a fool's cerebellum
 will be in better condition than Archimedes', which has worked
 prodigiously, and which might be worn out and shrivelled.
 
 Let us conclude therefore what we have already concluded, that we are
 ignoramuses about all first principles. As regards ignoramuses who pride
 themselves on their knowledge, they are far inferior to monkeys.
 
 Now dispute, choleric arguers: present your petitions against each
 other; proffer your insults, pronounce your sentences, you who do not
 know one word about the matter.
 
 
 SECTION V
 
 OF WARBURTON'S PARADOX ON THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL
 
 Warburton, editor and commentator of Shakespeare and Bishop of
 Gloucester, making use of English freedom, and abuse of the custom of
 hurling insults at one's adversaries, has composed four volumes to prove
 that the immortality of the soul was never announced in the Pentateuch,
 and to conclude from this same proof that Moses' mission is divine. Here
 is the precis of his book, which he himself gives, pages 7 and 8 of the
 first volume.
 
 "1. The doctrine of a life to come, of rewards and punishments after
 death, is necessary to all civil society.
 
 "2. The whole human race (_and this is where he is mistaken_), and
 especially the wisest and most learned nations of antiquity, concurred
 in believing and teaching this doctrine.
 
 "3. It cannot be found in any passage of the law of Moses; therefore the
 law of Moses is of divine origin. Which I am going to prove by the two
 following syllogisms:
 
 
 _First Syllogism_
 
 "Every religion, every society that has not the immortality of the soul
 for its basis, can be maintained only by an extraordinary providence;
 the Jewish religion had not the immortality of the soul for basis;
 therefore the Jewish religion was maintained by an extraordinary
 providence.
 
 
 _Second Syllogism_
 
 "All the ancient legislators have said that a religion which did not
 teach the immortality of the soul could not be maintained but by an
 extraordinary providence; Moses founded a religion which is not founded
 on the immortality of the soul; therefore Moses believed his religion
 maintained by an extraordinary providence."
 
 What is much more extraordinary is this assertion of Warburton's, which
 he has put in big letters at the beginning of his book. He has often
 been reproached with the extreme rashness and bad faith with which he
 dares to say that all the ancient legislators believed that a religion
 which is not founded on pains and recompenses after death, can be
 maintained only by an extraordinary providence; not one of them ever
 said it. He does not undertake even to give any example in his huge book
 stuffed with a vast number of quotations, all of which are foreign to
 his subject. He has buried himself beneath a pile of Greek and Latin
 authors, ancient and modern, for fear one might see through him on the
 other side of a horrible multitude of envelopes. When criticism finally
 probed to the bottom, he was resurrected from among all these dead men
 in order to load all his adversaries with insults.
 
 It is true that towards the end of his fourth volume, after having
 walked through a hundred labyrinths, and having fought with everybody he
 met on the road, he comes at last to his great question which he had
 left there. He lays all the blame on the Book of Job which passes among
 scholars for an Arab work, and he tries to prove that Job did not
 believe in the immortality of the soul. Later he explains in his own way
 all the texts of Holy Writ by which people have tried to combat this
 opinion.
 
 All one can say about it is that, if he was right, it was not for a
 bishop to be right in such a way. He should have felt that one might
 draw dangerous inferences; but everything in this world is a mass of
 contradiction. This man, who became accuser and persecutor, was not made
 bishop by a minister of state's patronage until immediately after he had
 written his book.
 
 At Salamanca, Coimbre or Rome, he would have been obliged to recant and
 to ask pardon. In England he became a peer of the realm with an income
 of a hundred thousand _livres_; it was enough to modify his methods.
 
 
 SECTION VI
 
 OF THE NEED OF REVELATION
 
 The greatest benefit we owe to the New Testament is that it has revealed
 to us the immortality of the soul. It is in vain, therefore, that this
 fellow Warburton tried to cloud over this important truth, by
 continually representing in his legation of Moses that "the ancient Jews
 knew nothing of this necessary dogma, and that the Sadducees did not
 admit it in the time of our Lord Jesus."
 
 He interprets in his own way the very words that have been put into
 Jesus Christ's mouth: "... have ye not read that which was spoken unto
 you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and
 the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living"
 (St. Matt. xxii. 31, 32). He gives to the parable of the wicked rich man
 a sense contrary to that of all the Churches. Sherlock, Bishop of
 London, and twenty other scholars refuted him. English philosophers even
 reproached him with the scandal of an Anglican bishop manifesting an
 opinion so contrary to the Anglican Church; and after that, this man
 takes it into his head to treat these persons as impious: like the
 character of _Arlequin_ in the comedy of the _Devaliseur de maisons_,
 who, after throwing the furniture out of the window, sees a man carrying
 some of it off, and cries with all his might "Stop thief!"
 
 One should bless the revelation of the immortality of the soul, and of
 rewards and punishments after death, all the more that mankind's vain
 philosophy has always been sceptical of it. The great Caesar did not
 believe in it at all, he made himself quite clear in full senate when,
 in order to stop Catalina being put to death, he represented that death
 left man without sensation, that everything died with him; and nobody
 refuted this view.
 
 The Roman Empire was divided between two principal sects: that of
 Epicurus which asserted that deity was useless to the world, and that
 the soul perished with the body: and that of the Stoics who regarded the
 soul as part of the Deity, which after death was joined again to its
 origin, to the great everything from which it emanated. Thus, whether
 one believed the soul mortal, or whether one believed it immortal, all
 the sects were agreed in laughing at pains and punishments after death.
 
 We still have a hundred monuments of this belief of the Romans. It is by
 virtue of this opinion graved profoundly in their hearts, that so many
 simple Roman citizens killed themselves without the least scruple; they
 did not wait for a tyrant to hand them over to the executioners.
 
 The most virtuous men even, and those most persuaded of the existence of
 a God, hoped for no reward, and feared no punishment. Clement, who later
 was Pope and saint, began by himself doubting what the early Christians
 said of another life, and consulted St. Peter at Caesarea. We are far
 from believing that St. Clement wrote the history that is attributed to
 him; but this history makes evident the need the human race had of a
 precise revelation. All that can surprise us is that so repressive and
 salutary a doctrine has left a prey to so many horrible crimes men who
 have so little time to live, and who see themselves squeezed between two
 eternities.
 
 
 SECTION VII
 
 SOULS OF FOOLS AND MONSTERS
 
 A deformed child is born absolutely imbecile, it has no ideas and lives
 without ideas; we have seen examples of this. How shall this animal be
 defined? doctors have said that it is something between man and beast;
 others have said that it had a sensitive soul, but not an intellectual
 soul. It eats, drinks, sleeps, wakes, has sensations; but it does not
 think.
 
 Is there another life for this creature, or is there none? The question
 has been posed, and has not yet been completely answered.
 
 Some say that this creature must have a soul, because its father and
 mother had one. But by this reasoning one would prove that if it came
 into the world without a nose it would be deemed to have one, because
 its father and its mother had noses.
 
 A woman gives birth to child with no chin, its forehead is receding and
 rather black, its nose is slim and pointed, its eyes are round, it bears
 not a bad resemblance to a swallow; the rest of its body, nevertheless,
 is made like ours. The parents have it baptised; by a plurality of votes
 it is considered a man and possessor of an immortal soul. But if this
 ridiculous little figure has pointed nails and beak-like mouth, it is
 declared a monster, it has no soul, and is not baptised.
 
 It is well known that in London in 1726 there was a woman who gave birth
 every week to a rabbit. No difficulty was made about refusing baptism to
 this child, despite the epidemic mania there was for three weeks in
 London for believing that this poor rogue was making wild rabbits. The
 surgeon who attended her, St. Andre by name, swore that nothing was
 more true, and people believed him. But what reason did the credulous
 have for refusing a soul to this woman's children? she had a soul, her
 children should be provided with souls also; whether they had hands,
 whether they had paws, whether they were born with a little snout or
 with a face; cannot the Supreme Being bestow the gift of thought and
 sensation on a little I know not what, born of a woman, shaped like a
 rabbit, as well as to a little I know not what, shaped like a man? Shall
 the soul that was ready to lodge in this woman's foetus go back again
 into space?
 
 Locke makes the sound observation, about monsters, that one must not
 attribute immortality to the exterior of a body; that the form has
 nothing to do with it. This immortality, he says, is no more attached to
 the form of his face or his chest, than to the way his beard is dressed
 or his coat cut.
 
 He asks what is the exact measure of deformity by which you can
 recognize whether or no a child has a soul? What is the precise degree
 at which it must be declared a monster and deprived of a soul?
 
 One asks still further what would be a soul which never has any but
 fantastic ideas? there are some which never escape from them. Are they
 worthy or unworthy? what is to be done with their pure spirit?
 
 What is one to think of a child with two heads? without deformity apart
 from this? Some say that it has two souls because it is provided with
 two pineal glands, with two _corpus callosum_, with two _sensorium
 commune_. Others reply that one cannot have two souls when one has only
 one chest and one navel.[22]
 
 In fine, so many questions have been asked about this poor human soul,
 that if it were necessary to answer them all, this examination of its
 own person would cause it the most intolerable boredom. There would
 happen to it what happened to Cardinal de Polignac at a conclave. His
 steward, tired of never being able to make him settle his accounts, made
 the journey from Rome, and came to the little window of his cell
 burdened with an immense bundle of papers. He read for nearly two hours.
 At last, seeing that no reply was forthcoming, he put his head forward.
 The cardinal had departed nearly two hours before. Our souls will depart
 before their stewards have acquainted them with the facts: but let us be
 exact before God, whatever sort of ignoramuses we are, we and our
 stewards.
 
 
 FOOTNOTES:
 
 [21] Voltaire himself.
 
 [22] The Chevalier d'Angos, learned astronomer, has carefully observed a
 two-headed lizard for several days; and he has assured himself that the
 lizard had two independent wills, each of which had an almost equal
 power over the body. When the lizard was given a piece of bread, in such
 a way that it could see it with only one head, this head wanted to go
 after the bread, and the other wanted the body to remain at rest.
 
 
 
 
 _STATES_, _GOVERNMENTS_
 
 
 The ins and outs of all governments have been closely examined recently.
 Tell me then, you who have travelled, in what state, under what sort of
 government you would choose to be born. I imagine that a great
 land-owning lord in France would not be vexed to be born in Germany; he
 would be sovereign instead of subject. A peer of France would be very
 glad to have the privileges of the English peerage; he would be
 legislator. The lawyer and the financier would be better off in France
 than elsewhere.
 
 But what country would a wise, free man, a man with a moderate fortune,
 and without prejudices, choose?
 
 A member of the government of Pondicherry, a learned man enough,
 returned to Europe by land with a Brahmin better educated than the
 ordinary Brahmin. "What do you think of the government of the Great
 Mogul?" asked the councillor.
 
 "I think it abominable," answered the Brahmin. "How can you expect a
 state to be happily governed by the Tartars? Our rajahs, our omrahs, our
 nabobs, are very content, but the citizens are hardly so; and millions
 of citizens are something."
 
 Reasoning, the councillor and the Brahmin traversed the whole of Upper
 Asia. "I make the observation," said the Brahmin, "that there is not one
 republic in all this vast part of the world."
 
 "Formerly there was the republic of Tyre," said the councillor, "but it
 did not last long; there was still another one in the direction of
 Arabia Petrea, in a little corner called Palestine, if one can honour
 with the name of republic a horde of thieves and usurers sometimes
 governed by judges, sometimes by a species of kings, sometimes by
 grand-pontiffs, become slave seven or eight times, and finally driven
 out of the country which it had usurped."
 
 "I imagine," said the Brahmin, "that one ought to find very few
 republics on the earth. Men are rarely worthy of governing themselves.
 This happiness should belong only to little peoples who hide themselves
 in islands, or among the mountains, like rabbits who shun carnivorous
 beasts; but in the long run they are discovered and devoured."
 
 When the two travellers reached Asia Minor, the councillor said to the
 Brahmin: "Would you believe that a republic was formed in a corner of
 Italy, which lasted more than five hundred years, and which owned Asia
 Minor, Asia, Africa, Greece, Gaul, Spain and the whole of Italy?"
 
 "She soon became a monarchy, then," said the Brahmin.
 
 "You have guessed right," said the other. "But this monarchy fell, and
 every day we compose beautiful dissertations in order to find the cause
 of its decadence and downfall."
 
 "You take a deal of trouble," said the Indian. "This empire fell because
 it existed. Everything has to fall. I hope as much will happen to the
 Grand Mogul's empire."
 
 "By the way," said the European, "do you consider that there should be
 more honour in a despotic state, and more virtue in a republic?"
 
 The Indian, having had explained to him what we mean by honour, answered
 that honour was more necessary in a republic, and that one had more need
 of virtue in a monarchical state. "For," said he, "a man who claims to
 be elected by the people, will not be if he is dishonoured; whereas at
 the court he could easily obtain a place, in accordance with a great
 prince's maxim, that in order to succeed a courtier should have neither
 honour nor character. As regards virtue, one must be prodigiously
 virtuous to dare to say the truth. The virtuous man is much more at his
 ease in a republic; he has no one to flatter."
 
 "Do you think," said the man from Europe, "that laws and religions are
 made for climates, just as one has to have furs in Moscow, and gauzy
 stuffs in Delhi?"
 
 "Without a doubt," answered the Brahmin. "All the laws which concern
 material things are calculated for the meridian one lives in. A German
 needs only one wife, and a Persian three or four.
 
 "The rites of religion are of the same nature. How, if I were Christian,
 should I say mass in my province where there is neither bread nor wine?
 As regards dogmas, that is another matter; the climate has nothing to do
 with them. Did not your religion begin in Asia, whence it was driven
 out? does it not exist near the Baltic Sea, where it was unknown?"
 
 "In what state, under what domination, would you like best to live?"
 asked the councillor.
 
 "Anywhere but where I do live," answered his companion. "And I have met
 many Siamese, Tonkinese, Persians and Turks who said as much."
 
 "But, once again," persisted the European, "what state would you
 choose?"
 
 The Brahmin answered: "The state where only the laws are obeyed."
 
 "That is an old answer," said the councillor.
 
 "It is none the worse for that," said the Brahmin.
 
 "Where is that country?" asked the councillor.
 
 "We must look for it," answered the Brahmin.
 
 
 
 
 _SUPERSTITION_
 
 
 The superstitious man is to the rogue what the slave is to the tyrant.
 Further, the superstitious man is governed by the fanatic and becomes
 fanatic. Superstition born in Paganism, adopted by Judaism, infested the
 Christian Church from the earliest times. All the fathers of the Church,
 without exception, believed in the power of magic. The Church always
 condemned magic, but she always believed in it: she did not
 excommunicate sorcerers as madmen who were mistaken, but as men who were
 really in communication with the devil.
 
 To-day one half of Europe thinks that the other half has long been and
 still is superstitious. The Protestants regard the relics, the
 indulgences, the mortifications, the prayers for the dead, the holy
 water, and almost all the rites of the Roman Church, as a superstitious
 dementia. Superstition, according to them, consists in taking useless
 practices for necessary practices. Among the Roman Catholics there are
 some more enlightened than their ancestors, who have renounced many of
 these usages formerly considered sacred; and they defend themselves
 against the others who have retained them, by saying: "They are
 indifferent, and what is merely indifferent cannot be an evil."
 
 It is difficult to mark the limits of superstition. A Frenchman
 travelling in Italy finds almost everything superstitious, and is hardly
 mistaken. The Archbishop of Canterbury maintains that the Archbishop of
 Paris is superstitious; the Presbyterians make the same reproach against
 His Grace of Canterbury, and are in their turn treated as superstitious
 by the Quakers, who are the most superstitious of all in the eyes of
 other Christians.
 
 In Christian societies, therefore, no one agrees as to what superstition
 is. The sect which seems to be the least attacked by this malady of the
 intelligence is that which has the fewest rites. But if with few
 ceremonies it is still strongly attached to an absurd belief, this
 absurd belief is equivalent alone to all the superstitious practices
 observed from the time of Simon the magician to that of Father
 Gauffridi.
 
 It is therefore clear that it is the fundamentals of the religion of one
 sect which is considered as superstition by another sect.
 
 The Moslems accuse all Christian societies of it, and are themselves
 accused. Who will judge this great matter? Will it be reason? But each
 sect claims to have reason on its side. It will therefore be force which
 will judge, while awaiting the time when reason will penetrate a
 sufficient number of heads to disarm force.
 
 Up to what point does statecraft permit superstition to be destroyed?
 This is a very thorny question; it is like asking up to what point one
 should make an incision in a dropsical person, who may die under the
 operation. It is a matter for the doctor's discretion.
 
 Can there exist a people free from all superstitious prejudices? That is
 to ask--Can there exist a nation of philosophers? It is said that there
 is no superstition in the magistrature of China. It is probable that
 none will remain in the magistrature of a few towns of Europe.
 
 Then the magistrates will stop the superstition of the people from being
 dangerous. These magistrates' example will not enlighten the mob, but
 the principal persons of the middle-classes will hold the mob in check.
 There is not perhaps a single riot, a single religious outrage in which
 the middle-classes were not formerly imbrued, because these middle
 classes were then the mob; but reason and time will have changed them.
 Their softened manners will soften those of the lowest and most savage
 populace; it is a thing of which we have striking examples in more than
 one country. In a word, less superstition, less fanaticism; and less
 fanaticism, less misery.
 
 
 
 
 _TEARS_
 
 
 Tears are the mute language of sorrow. But why? What connection is there
 between a sad idea and this limpid, salt liquid, filtered through a
 little gland at the external corner of the eye, which moistens the
 conjunctiva and the small lachrymal points, whence it descends into the
 nose and mouth through the reservoir called the lachrymal sack and its
 ducts?
 
 Why in women and children, whose organs are part of a frail and delicate
 network, are tears more easily excited by sorrow than in grown men,
 whose tissue is firmer?
 
 Did nature wish compassion to be born in us at sight of these tears
 which soften us, and lead us to help those who shed them? The woman of a
 savage race is as firmly determined to help the child that cries as
 would be a woman of the court, and maybe more, because she has fewer
 distractions and passions.
 
 In the animal body everything has an object without a doubt. The eyes
 especially bear such evident, such proven, such admirable relation to
 the rays of light; this mechanism is so divine, that I should be tempted
 to take for a delirium of burning fever the audacity which denies the
 final causes of the structure of our eyes.
 
 The use of tears does not seem to have so well determined and striking
 an object; but it would be beautiful that nature made them flow in order
 to stir us to pity.
 
 There are women who are accused of weeping when they wish. I am not at
 all surprised at their talent. A live, sensitive, tender imagination can
 fix itself on some object, on some sorrowful memory, and picture it in
 such dominating colours that they wring tears from it. It is what
 happens to many actors, and principally to actresses, on the stage.
 
 The women who imitate them in their own homes add to this talent the
 petty fraud of appearing to weep for their husbands, whereas in fact
 they are weeping for their lovers. Their tears are true, but the object
 of them is false.
 
 One asks why the same man who has watched the most atrocious events
 dry-eyed, who even has committed cold-blooded crimes, will weep at the
 theatre at the representation of these events and crimes? It is that he
 does not see them with the same eyes, he sees them with the eyes of the
 author and the actor. He is no longer the same man; he was a barbarian,
 he was agitated by furious passions when he saw an innocent woman
 killed, when he stained himself with his friend's blood. His soul was
 filled with stormy tumult; it is tranquil, it is empty; nature returns
 to it; he sheds virtuous tears. That is the true merit, the great good
 of the theatres; there is achieved what can never be achieved by the
 frigid declamations of an orator paid to bore the whole of an audience
 for an hour.
 
 David the capitoul, who, without emotion, caused and saw the death of
 innocent Calas on the wheel, would have shed tears at the sight of his
 own crime in a well-written and well-spoken tragedy.
 
 It is thus that Pope has said in the prologue to Addison's Cato:--
 
      "Tyrants no more their savage nature kept;
      And foes to virtue wondered how they wept."
 
 
 
 
 _THEIST_
 
 
 The theist is a man firmly persuaded of the existence of a Supreme Being
 as good as He is powerful, who has formed all beings with extension,
 vegetating, sentient and reflecting; who perpetuates their species, who
 punishes crimes without cruelty, and rewards virtuous actions with
 kindness.
 
 The theist does not know how God punishes, how he protects, how he
 pardons, for he is not reckless enough to flatter himself that he knows
 how God acts, but he knows that God acts and that He is just.
 Difficulties against Providence do not shake him in his faith, because
 they are merely great difficulties, and not proofs. He submits to this
 Providence, although he perceives but a few effects and a few signs of
 this Providence: and, judging of the things he does not see by the
 things he sees, he considers that this Providence reaches all places and
 all centuries.
 
 Reconciled in this principle with the rest of the universe, he does not
 embrace any of the sects, all of which contradict each other; his
 religion is the most ancient and the most widespread; for the simple
 worship of a God has preceded all the systems of the world. He speaks a
 language that all peoples understand, while they do not understand one
 another. He has brothers from Pekin to Cayenne, and he counts all wise
 men as his brethren. He believes that religion does not consist either
 in the opinions of an unintelligible metaphysic, or in vain display, but
 in worship and justice. The doing of good, there is his service; being
 submissive to God, there is his doctrine. The Mahometan cries to
 him--"Have a care if you do not make the pilgrimage to Mecca!" "Woe unto
 you," says a Recollet, "if you do not make a journey to Notre-Dame de
 Lorette!" He laughs at Lorette and at Mecca; but he succours the needy
 and defends the oppressed.
 
 
 
 
 _TOLERANCE_
 
 
 What is tolerance? it is the consequence of humanity. We are all formed
 of frailty and error; let us pardon reciprocally each other's
 folly--that is the first law of nature.
 
 It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother,
 because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster. That admits of no
 difficulty. But the government! but the magistrates! but the princes!
 how do they treat those who have another worship than theirs? If they
 are powerful strangers, it is certain that a prince will make an
 alliance with them. Francois I., very Christian, will unite with
 Mussulmans against Charles V., very Catholic. Francois I. will give
 money to the Lutherans of Germany to support them in their revolt
 against the emperor; but, in accordance with custom, he will start by
 having Lutherans burned at home. For political reasons he pays them in
 Saxony; for political reasons he burns them in Paris. But what will
 happen? Persecutions make proselytes? Soon France will be full of new
 Protestants. At first they will let themselves be hanged, later they in
 their turn will hang. There will be civil wars, then will come the St.
 Bartholomew; and this corner of the world will be worse than all that
 the ancients and moderns have ever told of hell.
 
 Madmen, who have never been able to give worship to the God who made
 you! Miscreants, whom the example of the Noachides, the learned Chinese,
 the Parsees and all the sages, has never been able to lead! Monsters,
 who need superstitions as crows' gizzards need carrion! you have been
 told it already, and there is nothing else to tell you--if you have two
 religions in your countries, they will cut each other's throat; if you
 have thirty religions, they will dwell in peace. Look at the great Turk,
 he governs Guebres, Banians, Greek Christians, Nestorians, Romans. The
 first who tried to stir up tumult would be impaled; and everyone is
 tranquil.
 
 Of all religions, the Christian is without doubt the one which should
 inspire tolerance most, although up to now the Christians have been the
 most intolerant of all men. The Christian Church was divided in its
 cradle, and was divided even in the persecutions which under the first
 emperors it sometimes endured. Often the martyr was regarded as an
 apostate by his brethren, and the Carpocratian Christian expired beneath
 the sword of the Roman executioners, excommunicated by the Ebionite
 Christian, the which Ebionite was anathema to the Sabellian.
 
 This horrible discord, which has lasted for so many centuries, is a very
 striking lesson that we should pardon each other's errors; discord is
 the great ill of mankind; and tolerance is the only remedy for it.
 
 There is nobody who is not in agreement with this truth, whether he
 meditates soberly in his study, or peaceably examines the truth with his
 friends. Why then do the same men who admit in private indulgence,
 kindness, justice, rise in public with so much fury against these
 virtues? Why? it is that their own interest is their god, and that they
 sacrifice everything to this monster that they worship.
 
 I possess a dignity and a power founded on ignorance and credulity; I
 walk on the heads of the men who lie prostrate at my feet; if they
 should rise and look me in the face, I am lost; I must bind them to the
 ground, therefore, with iron chains.
 
 Thus have reasoned the men whom centuries of bigotry have made powerful.
 They have other powerful men beneath them, and these have still others,
 who all enrich themselves with the spoils of the poor, grow fat on their
 blood, and laugh at their stupidity. They all detest tolerance, as
 partisans grown rich at the public expense fear to render their
 accounts, and as tyrants dread the word liberty. And then, to crown
 everything, they hire fanatics to cry at the top of their voices:
 "Respect my master's absurdities, tremble, pay, and keep your mouths
 shut."
 
 It is thus that a great part of the world long was treated; but to-day
 when so many sects make a balance of power, what course to take with
 them? Every sect, as one knows, is a ground of error; there are no sects
 of geometers, algebraists, arithmeticians, because all the propositions
 of geometry, algebra and arithmetic are true. In every other science one
 may be deceived. What Thomist or Scotist theologian would dare say
 seriously that he is sure of his case?
 
 If it were permitted to reason consistently in religious matters, it is
 clear that we all ought to become Jews, because Jesus Christ our Saviour
 was born a Jew, lived a Jew, died a Jew, and that he said expressly that
 he was accomplishing, that he was fulfilling the Jewish religion. But it
 is clearer still that we ought to be tolerant of one another, because we
 are all weak, inconsistent, liable to fickleness and error. Shall a reed
 laid low in the mud by the wind say to a fellow reed fallen in the
 opposite direction: "Crawl as I crawl, wretch, or I shall petition that
 you be torn up by the roots and burned?"
 
 
 
 
 _TRUTH_
 
 
 "Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered,
 Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause
 came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.
 Everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice.
 
 "Pilate saith unto Him, What is truth? And when he had said this he went
 out, etc." (St. John xviii. 37.)
 
 It is a sad thing for the human race that Pilate went out without
 waiting for the answer; we should know what truth is. Pilate had very
 little curiosity. The accused led before him, says he is king, that he
 was to be king; and Pilate does not inquire how that can be. He is
 supreme judge in Caesar's name, he has power of life and death; his duty
 was to probe the sense of these words. He ought to say--"Tell me what
 you understand by being king. How were you born to be king and to bear
 witness to the truth? It is maintained that truth reaches but with
 difficulty to the ear of kings. I am judge, I have always had great
 trouble in finding it. While your enemies are howling against you
 without, give me some information on the point; you will be doing me the
 greatest service that has ever been done a judge; and I much prefer to
 learn to recognize truth, than to accede to the Jews' clamorous demand
 to have you hanged."
 
 We shall not dare, to be sure, seek what the author of all truth would
 have been able to reply to Pilate.
 
 Would he have said: "Truth is an abstract word which most men use
 indifferently in their books and judgments, for error and falsehood?"
 This definition would have been marvellously appropriate to all makers
 of systems. Similarly is the word "wisdom" taken often for folly, and
 "wit" for nonsense.
 
 Humanly speaking, let us define truth, while waiting for a better
 definition, as--"a statement of the facts as they are."
 
 I suppose that if one had given only six months to teaching Pilate the
 truths of logic, he would assuredly have made this conclusive syllogism.
 One must not take away the life of a man who has only preached good
 morality: well, the man who has been impeached has, on the showing of
 his enemies even, often preached excellent morality; therefore he should
 not be punished with death.
 
 He might have drawn this further argument.
 
 My duty is to disperse the riotous assemblage of a seditious people who
 demand a man's death, unreasonably and without legal form; well, that is
 the position of the Jews in this instance; therefore I must drive them
 away and break up their meeting.
 
 We suppose that Pilate knew arithmetic; hence we will not speak of those
 forms of truth.
 
 As regards mathematical truths, I think it would have taken at least
 three years before he could have learned higher geometry. The truths of
 physics combined with those of geometry would have demanded more than
 four years. We spend six, ordinarily, in studying theology; I ask twelve
 for Pilate, seeing that he was pagan, and that six years would not have
 been too much for eradicating all his old errors, and six years more for
 making him fit to receive a doctor's hood.
 
 If Pilate had had a well-balanced mind, I should have asked only two
 years to teach him metaphysical truth; and as metaphysical truth is
 necessarily allied to moral truth, I flatter myself that in less than
 nine years he would have become a real scholar and a perfectly honest
 man.
 
 I should then have said to Pilate:--Historical truths are merely
 probabilities. If you had fought at the battle of Philippi, that is for
 you a truth which you know by intuition, by perception. But for us who
 dwell near the Syrian desert, it is merely a very probable thing, which
 we know by hearsay. How much hearsay is necessary to form a conviction
 equal to that of a man who, having seen the thing, can flatter himself
 that he has a sort of certainty?
 
 He who has heard the thing told by twelve thousand eyewitnesses, has
 only twelve thousand probabilities, equal to one strong probability,
 which is not equal to certainty.
 
 If you have the thing from only one of these witnesses, you know
 nothing; you should be sceptical. If the witness is dead, you should be
 still more sceptical, for you cannot enlighten yourself. If from several
 witnesses who are dead, you are in the same plight. If from those to
 whom the witnesses have spoken, your scepticism should increase still
 more.
 
 From generation to generation scepticism increases, and probability
 diminishes; and soon probability is reduced to zero.
 
 
 
 
 _TYRANNY_
 
 
 One gives the name of tyrant to the sovereign who knows no laws but
 those of his caprice, who takes his subjects' property, and who
 afterwards enrols them to go to take the property of his neighbours.
 There are none of these tyrants in Europe.
 
 One distinguishes between the tyranny of one man and that of many. The
 tyranny of many would be that of a body which invaded the rights of
 other bodies, and which exercised despotism in favour of the laws
 corrupted by it. Nor are there any tyrants of this sort in Europe.
 
 Under which tyranny would you like to live? Under neither; but if I had
 to choose, I should detest the tyranny of one man less than that of
 many. A despot always has his good moments; an assembly of despots
 never. If a tyrant does me an injustice, I can disarm him through his
 mistress, his confessor or his page; but a company of grave tyrants is
 inaccessible to all seductions. When it is not unjust, it is at the
 least hard, and never does it bestow favours.
 
 If I have only one despot, I am quit of him by drawing myself up against
 a wall when I see him pass, or by bowing low, or by striking the ground
 with my forehead, according to the custom of the country; but if there
 is a company of a hundred despots, I am exposed to repeating this
 ceremony a hundred times a day, which in the long run is very annoying
 if one's hocks are not supple. If I have a farm in the neighbourhood of
 one of our lords, I am crushed; if I plead against a relation of the
 relations of one of our lords, I am ruined. What is to be done? I fear
 that in this world one is reduced to being either hammer or anvil; lucky
 the man who escapes these alternatives!
 
 
 
 
 _VIRTUE_
 
 
 SECTION I
 
 It is said of Marcus Brutus that, before killing himself, he uttered
 these words: "O virtue! I thought you were something; but you are only
 an empty phantom!"
 
 You were right, Brutus, if you considered virtue as being head of a
 faction, and assassin of your benefactor; but if you had considered
 virtue as consisting only of doing good to those dependent on you, you
 would not have called it a phantom, and you would not have killed
 yourself in despair.
 
 I am very virtuous says this excrement of theology, for I have the four
 cardinal virtues, and the three divine. An honest man asks him--"What is
 the cardinal virtue?" The other answers--"Strength, prudence, temperance
 and justice."
 
 
 THE HONEST MAN:
 
 If you are just, you have said everything; your strength, your prudence,
 your temperance, are useful qualities. If you have them, so much the
 better for you; but if you are just, so much the better for the others.
 But it is not enough to be just, you must do good; that is what is
 really cardinal. And your divine virtues, which are they?
 
 THE EXCREMENT:
 
 Faith, hope, charity.
 
 THE HONEST MAN:
 
 Is it a virtue to believe? either what you believe seems true to you,
 and in this case there is no merit in believing; or it seems false to
 you, and then it is impossible for you to believe.
 
 Hope cannot be a virtue any more than fear; one fears and one hopes,
 according as one receives a promise or a threat. As for charity, is it
 not what the Greeks and the Romans understood by humanity, love of one's
 neighbour? this love is nothing if it be not active; doing good,
 therefore, is the sole true virtue.
 
 THE EXCREMENT:
 
 One would be a fool! Really, I am to give myself a deal of torment in
 order to serve mankind, and I shall get no return! all work deserves
 payment. I do not mean to do the least honest action, unless I am
 certain of paradise.
 
 THE HONEST MAN:
 
 Ah, master! that is to say that, if you did not hope for paradise, and
 if you did not fear hell, you would never do any good action. Believe
 me, master, there are two things worthy of being loved for themselves,
 God and virtue.
 
 THE EXCREMENT:
 
 I see, sir, you are a disciple of Fenelon.
 
 THE HONEST MAN:
 
 Yes, master.
 
 THE EXCREMENT:
 
 I shall denounce you to the judge of the ecclesiastical court at Meaux.
 
 THE HONEST MAN:
 
 Go along, denounce!
 
 
 SECTION II
 
 What is virtue? Beneficence towards the fellow-creature. Can I call
 virtue things other than those which do me good? I am needy, you are
 generous. I am in danger, you help me. I am deceived, you tell me the
 truth. I am neglected, you console me. I am ignorant, you teach me.
 Without difficulty I shall call you virtuous. But what will become of
 the cardinal and divine virtues? Some of them will remain in the
 schools.
 
 What does it matter to me that you are temperate? you observe a precept
 of health; you will have better health, and I am happy to hear it. You
 have faith and hope, and I am happy still; they will procure you eternal
 life. Your divine virtues are celestial gifts; your cardinal virtues are
 excellent qualities which serve to guide you: but they are not virtues
 as regards your fellow-creature. The prudent man does good to himself,
 the virtuous man does good to mankind. St. Paul was right to tell you
 that charity prevails over faith and hope.
 
 But shall only those that are useful to one's fellow-creature be
 admitted as virtues? How can I admit any others? We live in society;
 really, therefore, the only things that are good for us are those that
 are good for society. A recluse will be sober, pious; he will be clad in
 hair-cloth; he will be a saint: but I shall not call him virtuous until
 he has done some act of virtue by which other men have profited. So long
 as he is alone, he is doing neither good nor evil; for us he is nothing.
 If St. Bruno brought peace to families, if he succoured want, he was
 virtuous; if he fasted, prayed in solitude, he was a saint. Virtue among
 men is an interchange of kindness; he who has no part in this
 interchange should not be counted. If this saint were in the world, he
 would doubtless do good; but so long as he is not in the world, the
 world will be right in refusing him the title of virtuous; he will be
 good for himself and not for us.
 
 But, you say to me, if a recluse is a glutton, a drunkard, given to
 secret debauches with himself, he is vicious; he is virtuous, therefore,
 if he has the opposite qualities. That is what I cannot agree: he is a
 very disagreeable fellow if he has the faults you mention; but he is not
 vicious, wicked, punishable as regards society to whom these infamies do
 no harm. It is to be presumed that were he to return to society he would
 do harm there, that he would be very vicious; and it is even more
 probable that he would be a wicked man, than it is sure that the other
 temperate and chaste recluse would be a virtuous man, for in society
 faults increase, and good qualities diminish.
 
 A much stronger objection is made; Nero, Pope Alexander VI., and other
 monsters of this species, have bestowed kindnesses; I answer hardily
 that on that day they were virtuous.
 
 A few theologians say that the divine emperor Antonine was not virtuous;
 that he was a stubborn Stoic who, not content with commanding men,
 wished further to be esteemed by them; that he attributed to himself the
 good he did to the human race; that all his life he was just, laborious,
 beneficent through vanity, and that he only deceived men through his
 virtues. "My God!" I exclaim. "Give us often rogues like him!"
 
 
 
 
 _WHY?_
 
 
 Why does one hardly ever do the tenth part of the good one might do?
 
 Why in half Europe do girls pray to God in Latin, which they do not
 understand?
 
 Why in antiquity was there never a theological quarrel, and why were no
 people ever distinguished by the name of a sect? The Egyptians were not
 called Isiacs or Osiriacs; the peoples of Syria did not have the name of
 Cybelians. The Cretans had a particular devotion to Jupiter, and were
 never entitled Jupiterians. The ancient Latins were very attached to
 Saturn; there was not a village in Latium called Saturnian: on the
 contrary, the disciples of the God of truth taking their master's title,
 and calling themselves "anointed" like Him, declared, as soon as they
 could, an eternal war on all the peoples who were not anointed, and made
 war among themselves for fourteen hundred years, taking the names of
 Arians, Manicheans, Donatists, Hussites, Papists, Lutherans, Calvinists.
 And lastly, the Jansenists and the Molinists have had no more poignant
 mortification than that of not having been able to slaughter each other
 in pitched battle. Whence does this come?
 
 Why is the great number of hard-working, innocent men who till the land
 every day of the year that you may eat all its fruits, scorned,
 vilified, oppressed, robbed; and why is it that the useless and often
 very wicked man who lives only by their work, and who is rich only
 through their poverty, is on the contrary respected, courted,
 considered?
 
 Why is it that, the fruits of the earth being so necessary for the
 conservation of men and animals, one yet sees so many years and so many
 countries where there is entire lack of these fruits?
 
 Why is the half of Africa and America covered with poisons?
 
 Why is there no land where insects are not far in excess of men?
 
 Why does a little whitish, evil-smelling secretion form a being which
 has hard bones, desires and thoughts? and why do these beings always
 persecute each other?
 
 Why does so much evil exist, seeing that everything is formed by a God
 whom all theists are agreed in naming "good?"
 
 Why, since we complain ceaselessly of our ills, do we spend all our time
 in increasing them?
 
 Why, as we are so miserable, have we imagined that not to be is a great
 ill, when it is clear that it was not an ill not to be before we were
 born?
 
 Why and how does one have dreams during sleep, if one has no soul; and
 how is it that these dreams are always so incoherent, so extravagant, if
 one has a soul?
 
 Why do the stars move from west to east rather than from east to west?
 
 Why do we exist? why is there anything?
 
 
 
 
 _DECLARATION OF THE ADMIRERS, QUESTIONERS AND DOUBTERS WHO HAVE AMUSED
 THEMSELVES BY PROPOUNDING TO THE SCHOLARS THE ABOVE QUESTIONS IN NINE
 VOLUMES._[23]
 
 
 We declare to the scholars that, being like them prodigiously ignorant
 about the first principles of all things, and about the natural,
 typical, mystic, allegorical sense of many things, we refer these things
 to the infallible judgment of the Holy Inquisition of Rome, Florence,
 Madrid, Lisbon, and to the decrees of the Sorbonne of Paris, perpetual
 council of the Gauls.
 
 Our errors springing in no wise from malice, but being the natural
 consequence of human frailty, we hope that they will be pardoned to us
 in this world and the other.
 
 We beseech the small number of heavenly spirits who are still shut up in
 France in mortal bodies, and who, from there, enlighten the universe at
 _thirty sous_ the sheet, to communicate their luminousness to us for the
 tenth volume which we reckon on publishing at the end of Lent 1772, or
 in Advent 1773; and for their luminousness we will pay _forty sous_.
 
 This tenth volume will contain some very curious articles, which, if God
 favours us, will give new point to the salt which we shall endeavour to
 bestow in the thanks we shall give to these gentlemen.

 TO THE
 
 SULTANA _SHERAA_,
 
 BY
 
 _SADI_.
 
 The 18th of the Month _Scheval_, in the Year of the _Hegira_, 837.
 
 Thou Joy of ev'ry Eye! Thou Torment of every Heart! Thou Intellectual
 Light! I do not kiss the Dust of thy Feet; because thou seldom art
 seen out of the Seraglio, and when thou art, thou walkest only on
 the Carpets of _Iran_, or on Beds of Roses.
 
 I here present you with a Translation of the Work of an ancient
 _Sage_, who having the Happiness of living free from all Avocations,
 thought proper, by Way of Amusement, to write the History of
 _Zadig_; a Performance, that comprehends in it more Instruction
 than, 'tis possible, you may at first be aware of. I beg you would
 indulge me so far as to read it over, and then pass your impartial
 Judgment upon it: For notwithstanding you are in the Bloom of your
 Life; tho' ev'ry Pleasure courts you; tho' you are Nature's Darling,
 and have internal Qualities in proportion to your Beauty; tho' the
 World resounds your Praises from Morning till Night, and consequently
 you must have a just Title to a superior Degree of Understanding
 than the rest of your Sex; Yet your Wit is no ways flashy; Your
 Taste is refin'd, and I have had the Honour to hear you talk more
 learnedly than the wisest _Dervise_, with his venerable Beard, and
 pointed Bonnet: You are discreet, and yet not mistrustful; you are
 easy, but not weak; you are beneficent with Discretion; you love
 your Friends, and create yourself no Enemies. Your most sprightly
 Flights borrow no Graces from Detraction; you never speak a
 misbecoming Word, nor do an ill-natur'd Action, tho' 'tis always in
 your Power. In a Word, your Soul is as spotless as your Person. You
 have, moreover, a little Fund of Philosophy, which gives me just
 Grounds to hope that you'll relish this Historical Performance
 better than any other Lady of your Quality would do.
 
 It was originally compos'd in the _Chaldean_ Language, to which both
 you and my self are perfect Strangers. It was translated, however,
 into _Arabic_, for the Amusement of the celebrated Sultan OULOUG-BEG.
 It first appear'd in Public, when the _Arabian_ and _Persian_ Tales
 of One Thousand and One Nights, and One Thousand and One Days, were
 most in Vogue: OULOUG chose rather to entertain himself with the
 Adventures of _Zadig_. The Sultanas indeed were more fond of the
 former. How can you, said the judicious OULOUG, be so partial, as to
 prefer a Set of Tales, that are no ways interesting or instructive,
 to a Work, that has a Variety of Beauties to recommend it? Oh!
 replied the Sultanas, the less Sense there is in them, the more they
 are in Taste; and the less their Merit, the greater their
 Commendation.
 
 I flatter my self, thou Patroness of Wisdom, that thou wilt not copy
 after those thoughtless Sultanas, but give into the Sentiments of
 OULOUG. I am in hopes likewise, when you are tir'd with the
 Conversation of such as make those senseless Romances abovemention'd
 their favourite Amusements, you will vouchsafe to listen for one
 Minute or two, to the Dictates of solid Sense. Had you been
 _Thalestris_ in the Days of _Scander_, the Son of _Philip_; had you
 been the Queen of _Sheba_, in the Reign of _Solomon_, those Kings
 would have been proud to have taken a Tour to visit you.
 
 May the Celestial Virtues grant, that your Pleasures may meet with
 no Interruption; your Charms know no Decay; and may your Felicity be
 everlasting!

 which Reason, I have depretiated it, as it deserves, and have in
 direct Terms told the CADI-LESQUIER, that 'tis a most detestable
 Performance.

 _The Blind_ EYE.
 
 
 In the Reign of King _Moabdar_, there was a young Man, a Native of
 _Babylon_, by name _Zadig_; who was not only endowed by Nature with
 an uncommon Genius, but born of illustrious Parents, who bestowed on
 him an Education no ways inferior to his Birth. Tho' rich and young,
 he knew how to give a Check to his Passions; he was no ways
 self-conceited; he didn't always act up to the strictest Rules of
 Reason himself, and knew how to look on the Foibles of others, with
 an Eye of Indulgence. Every one was surpriz'd to find, that
 notwithstanding he had such a Fund of Wit, he never insulted; nay,
 never so much as rallied any of his Companions, for that Tittle
 Tattle, which was so vague and empty, so noisy and confus'd; for
 those rash Reflections, those illiterate Conclusions, and those
 insipid Jokes; and, in short, for that Flow of unmeaning Words,
 which was call'd polite Conversation in _Babylon_. He had learned
 from the first Book of _Zoroaster_, that Self-love is like a Bladder
 full blown, which when once prick'd, discharges a kind of petty
 Tempest. _Zadig_, in particular, never boasted of his Contempt of
 the Fair Sex, or of his Facility to make Conquests amongst them. He
 was of a generous Spirit; insomuch, that he was not afraid of
 obliging even an ungrateful Man; strictly adhering to that wise
 Maxim of _Zoroaster_. _When you are eating, throw an Offal to the
 Dogs that are under the Table, lest they should be tempted to bite
 you._ He was as wise as he could well be wish'd; since he was fond
 of no Company, but such as were distinguish'd for Men of Sense. As
 he was well-grounded, in all the Sciences of the antient
 _Chaldeans_, he was no Stranger to those Principles of Natural
 Philosophy, which were then known: And understood as much of
 Metaphysics as any one in all Ages after him; that is to say, he
 knew little or nothing of the Matter. He was firmly convinc'd, that
 the Year consisted of 365 Days and an half, tho' directly repugnant
 to the new Philosophy of the Age he liv'd in; and that the Sun was
 situated in the Center of the Earth; And when the Chief Magi told
 him, with an imperious Air, that he maintain'd erroneous Principles;
 and that it was an Indignity offered to the Government under which
 he liv'd, to imagine the Sun should roll round its own Axis, and
 that the Year consisted of twelve Months, he knew how to sit still
 and quiet, without shewing the least Tokens of Resentment or
 Contempt.
 
 As _Zadig_ was immensely rich, and had consequently Friends without
 Number; and as he was a Gentleman of a robust Constitution, and
 remarkably handsome; as he was endowed with a plentiful Share of
 ready and inoffensive Wit: And, in a Word, as his Heart was
 perfectly sincere and open, he imagin'd himself, in some Measure,
 qualified to be perfectly happy. For which Purpose he determin'd to
 marry a gay young Lady (one _Semira_ by name) whose Beauty, Birth
 and Fortune, render'd her the most desirable Person in all
 _Babylon_. He had a sincere Affection for her, grounded on Honour,
 and _Semira_ conceiv'd as tender a Passion for him. They were just
 upon the critical Minute of a mutual Conjunction in the Bands of
 Matrimony, when, as they were walking Hand in Hand together towards
 one of the Gates of _Babylon_, under the Shade of a Row of
 Palm-trees, that grew on the Banks of the River _Euphrates_, they
 were beset by a Band of Ruffians, arm'd with Sabres, Bows and
 Arrows. They were the Guards, it seems, of young _Orcan_ (Nephew of
 a certain Minister of State) whom the Parasites, kept by his Uncle,
 had buoy'd up with a Permission to do, with Impunity, whatever he
 thought proper. This young Rival, tho' he had none of those internal
 Qualities to boast of that _Zadig_ had, yet he imagin'd himself a
 Man of more Power; and for that Reason, was perfectly outrageous to
 see the other preferr'd before him. This Fit of Jealousy, the Result
 of mere Vanity, prompted him to think that he was deeply in Love
 with the fair _Semira_; and fir'd with that amorous Notion, he was
 determin'd to take her away from _Zadig_, by Dint of Arms. The
 Ravishers rush'd rudely upon her, and in the Transport of their
 Rage, drew the Blood of a Beauty, the Sight of whose Charms would
 have soften'd the very Tigers of Mount _Imaues_. The injur'd Lady
 rent the very Heavens with her Exclamations. Where's my dear
 Husband, she cried? They have torn me from the Arms of the only Man
 whom I adore. She never reflected on the Danger to which she was
 expos'd; her sole Concern was for her beloved _Zadig_. At the same
 Time, he defended her, like a Lover, and a Man of Integrity and
 Courage. With the Assistance only of two domestic Servants, he put
 those Sons of Violence to Flight, and conducted _Semira_, bloody as
 she was, and in fainting Fits, to her own House. No sooner was she
 come to her self, but she fix'd her lovely Eyes on her Dear
 Deliverer. O _Zadig_, said she, I love thee as affectionately, as if
 I were actually thy Bride: I love thee, as the Man, to whom I owe my
 Life, and what is dearer to me, the Preservation of my Honour. No
 Heart sure could be more deeply smitten than that of _Semira_. Never
 did the Lips of the fairest Creature living utter softer Sounds;
 never did the most enamoured Lady breathe such tender Sentiments of
 Love and Gratitude for his signal Service; never, in short, did the
 most affectionate Bride express such Transports of Joy for the
 fondest Husband. Her Wounds, however, were but very superficial, and
 she was soon recover'd. _Zadig_ receiv'd a Wound that was much more
 dangerous: An unlucky Arrow had graz'd one of his Eyes, and the
 Orifice was deep. _Semira_ was incessant in her Prayers to the Gods
 that they might restore her _Zadig_. Her Eyes were Night and Day
 overwhelm'd with Tears. She waited with Impatience for the happy
 Moment, when those of _Zadig_ might dart their Fires upon her; but
 alas! the wounded Eye grew so inflam'd and swell'd, that she was
 terrified to the last Degree. She sent as far as _Memphis_ for
 _Hermes_, the celebrated Physician there, who instantly attended his
 new Patient with a numerous Retinue. Upon his first Visit, he
 peremptorily declared that _Zadig_ would lose his Eye; and foretold
 not only the Day, but the very Hour when that woful Disaster would
 befal him. Had it been, said that Great Man, his right Eye, I could
 have administred an infallible Specific; but as it is, his
 Misfortune is beyond the Art of Man to cure. Tho' all _Babylon_
 pitied the hard Case of _Zadig_, they equally stood astonish'd at
 the profound Penetration of _Hermes_. Two Days after the Imposthume
 broke, without any Application, and _Zadig_ soon after was perfectly
 recover'd. _Hermes_ thereupon wrote a very long and elaborate
 Treatise, to prove that his Wound ought not to have been heal'd.
 _Zadig_, however, never thought it worth his while to peruse his
 learned Lucubrations; but, as soon as ever he could get abroad,
 determin'd to pay the Lady a Visit, who had testified such uncommon
 Concern for his Welfare, and for whose Sake alone he wish'd for the
 Restoration of his Sight. _Semira_ he found had been out of Town for
 three Days; but was inform'd, by the bye, that his intended Spouse,
 having conceived an implacable Aversion to a one-ey'd Man, was that
 very Night to be married to _Orcan_. At this unexpected ill News,
 poor _Zadig_ was perfectly thunder-struck: He laid his Disappointment
 so far to Heart, that in a short Time he was become a mere Skeleton,
 and was sick almost to death for some Months afterwards. At last,
 however, by Dint of Reflection, he got the better of his Distemper;
 and the Acuteness of the Pain he underwent, in some Measure,
 contributed towards his Consolation.
 
 Since I have met with such an unexpected Repulse, said he, from a
 capricious Court-Lady, I am determin'd to marry some substantial
 Citizen's Daughter. He pitch'd accordingly upon _Azora_, a young
 Gentlewoman extremely well-bred, an excellent Oeconomist, and one,
 whose Parents were very rich.
 
 Their Nuptials accordingly were soon after solemniz'd, and for a
 whole Month successively, no two Turtles were ever more fond of each
 other. In Process of Time, however, he perceiv'd she was a little
 Coquettish, and too much inclin'd to think, that the handsomest
 young Fellows were always the most virtuous and the greatest Wits.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. II.
 
 _The_ NOSE.
 
 
 One Day _Azora_, as she was just return'd home from taking a short
 Country airing, threw herself into a violent Passion, and swell'd
 with Invectives. What, in God's Name, my Dear, said _Zadig_, has
 thus ruffled your Temper? What can be the Meaning of all these warm
 Exclamations? Alas! said she, you would have been disgusted as much
 as I am, had you been an Eye-witness of that Scene of Female
 Falshood, as I was Yesterday. I went, you must know, to visit the
 disconsolate Widow _Cosrou_, who has been these two Days erecting a
 Monument to the Memory of her young deceased Husband, near the Brook
 that runs on one side of her Meadow. She made the most solemn Vow,
 in the Height of her Affliction, never to stir from that Tomb, as
 long as ever that Rivulet took its usual Course.--Well! and wherein,
 pray, said _Zadig_, is the good Woman so much to blame? Is it not an
 incontestable Mark of her superior Merit and Conjugal-Affection?
 But, _Zadig_, said _Azora_, was you to know how her Thoughts were
 employ'd when I made my Visit, you'd never forget or forgive her.
 Pray, my dearest _Azora_, what then was she about? Why, the
 Creature, said _Azora_, was studying, to be sure, to find out Ways
 and Means to turn the Current of the River.
 
 _Azora_, in short, harangu'd so long, and, was so big with her
 Invectives against the young Widow, that her too affected, vain Shew
 of Virtue, gave _Zadig_ a secret Disgust.
 
 _Zadig_ had an intimate Friend, one _Cador_ by Name, whose Spouse
 was perfectly honest, and had in reality a greater Regard for him,
 than all Mankind besides: This Friend _Zadig_ made his Confident,
 and bound him to keep a Project of his entirely a Secret, by a
 Promise of some valuable Token of his Respect. _Azora_ had been
 visiting a Female Companion for two Days together in the Country,
 and on the third was returning home: No sooner, however, was she in
 Sight of the House, but the Servants ran to meet her with Tears in
 their Eyes, and told her, that their Master dy'd suddenly the Night
 before; that they durstn't carry her the doleful Tidings, but were
 going to bury _Zadig_ in the Sepulchre of his Ancestors, at the
 Bottom of the Garden. She burst into a Flood of Tears; tore her
 Hair; and vow'd to die by his Side. As soon as it was dark, young
 _Cador_ came, and begg'd the Favour of being introduc'd to the
 Widow. He was so, and they wept together very cordially. Next Day
 the Storm was somewhat abated, and they din'd together; _Cador_
 inform'd her, that his Friend had left him the much greater Part of
 his Effects, and gave her to understand, that he should think
 himself the happiest Creature in the World, if she would condescend
 to be his Partner in that Demise. The Widow wept, sobb'd, and began
 to melt. More Time was spent in Supper than at Dinner. They
 discoursed together with a little more Freedom. _Azora_ was lavish
 of her Encomiums on _Zadig_; but then, 'twas true, she said, he had
 some secret Infirmities to which _Cador_ was a Stranger. In the
 Midst of their Midnight Entertainment, _Cador_ all on a sudden
 complain'd that he was taken with a most violent pleuretic Fit, and
 was ready to swoon away. Our Lady being extremely concern'd, and
 over-officious, flew to her Closet of Cordials, and brought down
 every Thing she could think of that might be of Service on this
 emergent Occasion. She was extremely sorry that the famous _Hermes_
 was gone from _Babylon_, and condescended to lay her warm Hand upon
 the Part affected, in which he felt such an agonizing Pain. Pray
 Sir, said she, in a soft, languishing Tone, are you subject to this
 tormenting Malady? Sometimes, Madam, said _Cador_, so strong, that
 they bring me almost to Death's Door; and there is but one Thing can
 infallibly cure me; and that is, the Application of a dead Man's
 Nose to the part affected. An odd Remedy truly, said _Azora_. Not
 stranger, Madam, said he, than the Great *_Arnon's_ infallible
 Apoplectic Necklaces.
 
     * There was at this Time in _Babylon_, a famous Doctor,
       nam'd _Arnon_, who both cur'd Apoplectic Fits, and
       prevented them from affecting his Patients, as was
       frequently advertiz'd in the Gazettes, by a little
       never-failing Purse that he hung round their Necks.
 
 This Assurance of Success, together with _Cador's_ personal Merit,
 determin'd _Azora_ in his Favour. After all, said she, when my
 Husband shall be about to cross the Bridge _Tchimavar_, from this
 World of Yesterday, to the other, of To-morrow, will the Angel
 _Asrael_, think you, make any Scruple about his Passage, should his
 Nose prove something shorter in the next Life than 'twas in this?
 She would venture, however, and taking up a sharp Razor, repair'd to
 her Husband's Tomb; water'd it first with her Tears, and then
 intended to perform the innocent Operation, as he lay extended
 breathless, as she thought, in his Coffin. _Zadig_ mounted in a
 Moment; secur'd his Nose with one Hand, and the Incision-Knife with
 the other. Madam, said he, never more exclaim against the Widow
 _Cosrou_. The Scheme for cutting my Nose off was much closer laid
 than hers of throwing the River into a new Channel.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. III.
 
 _The_ DOG _and the_ HORSE.
 
 
 _Zadig_ found, by Experience, that the first thirty Days of
 Matrimony (as 'tis written in the Book of _Zend_) is Honey-Moon; but
 the second is all Wormwood. He was oblig'd, in short, as _Azora_
 grew such a Termagant, to sue out a Bill of Divorce, and to seek his
 Consolation for the future, in the Study of Nature. Who is happier,
 said he, than the Philosopher, who peruses with Understanding that
 spacious Book, which the supreme Being has laid open before his
 Eyes? The Truths he discovers there, are of infinite Service to him.
 He thereby cultivates and improves his Mind. He lives in Peace and
 Tranquility all his Days; he is afraid of Nobody, and he has no
 tender, indulgent Wife to shorten his Nose for him.
 
 Wrapped up in these Contemplations, he retir'd to a little Country
 House on the Banks of the _Euphrates_; there he never spent his Time
 in calculating how many Inches of Water run thro' the Arch of a
 Bridge in a second of Time, or in enquiring if a Cube Line of Rain
 falls more in the _Mouse-Month_, than in that of the _Ram_. He
 form'd no Projects for making Silk Gloves and Stockings out of
 Spiders Webbs, nor of China-Ware out of broken Glass-Bottles; but he
 pry'd into the Nature and Properties of Animals and Plants, and
 soon, by his strict and repeated Enquiries, he was capable of
 discerning a Thousand Variations in visible Objects, that others,
 less curious, imagin'd were all alike.
 
 One Day, as he was taking a solitary Walk by the Side of a Thicket,
 he espy'd one of the Queen's Eunuchs, with several of his
 Attendants, coming towards him, hunting about, in deep Concern, both
 here and there, like Persons almost in Despair, and seeking, with
 Impatience, for something lost of the utmost Importance. Young Man,
 said the Queen's chief Eunuch, have not you seen, pray, her
 Majesty's Dog? _Zadig_ very cooly replied, you mean her Bitch, I
 presume. You say very right Sir, said the Eunuch, 'tis a
 Spaniel-Bitch indeed.--And very small said _Zadig_: She has had
 Puppies too lately; she's a little lame with her left Fore-foot, and
 has long Ears. By your exact Description, Sir, you must doubtless
 have seen her, said the Eunuch, almost out of Breath. But I have not
 Sir, notwithstanding, neither did I know, but by you, that the Queen
 ever had such a favourite Bitch.
 
 Just at this critical Juncture, so various are the Turns of
 Fortune's Wheel! the best Palfrey in all the King's Stable had broke
 loose from the Groom, and got upon the Plains of _Babylon_. The Head
 Huntsman with all his inferior Officers, were in Pursuit after him,
 with as much Concern, as the Eunuch about the Bitch. The Head
 Huntsman address'd himself to _Zadig_, and ask'd him, whether he
 hadn't seen the King's Palfrey run by him. No Horse, said _Zadig_,
 ever gallop'd smoother; he is about five Foot high, his Hoofs are
 very small; his Tail is about three Foot six Inches long; the studs
 of his Bit are of pure Gold, about 23 Carats; and his Shoes are of
 Silver, about Eleven penny Weight a-piece. What Course did he take,
 pray, Sir? Whereabouts is he, said the Huntsman? I never sat Eyes on
 him, reply'd _Zadig_, not I, neither did I ever hear before now,
 that his Majesty had such a Palfrey.
 
 The Head Huntsman, as well as the Head Eunuch, upon his answering
 their Interrogatories so very exactly, not doubting in the least,
 but that _Zadig_ had clandestinely convey'd both the Bitch and the
 Horse away, secur'd him, and carried him before the grand Desterham,
 who condemn'd him to the _Knout_, and to be confin'd for Life in
 some remote and lonely Part of _Siberia_. No sooner had the Sentence
 been pronounc'd, but the Horse and Bitch were both found. The Judges
 were in some Perplexity in this odd Affair, and yet thought it
 absolutely necessary, as the Man was innocent, to recal their
 Decree. However, they laid a Fine upon him of Four Hundred Ounces of
 Gold, for his false Declaration of his not having seen, what
 doubtless he did: And the Fine was order'd to be deposited in Court
 accordingly: On the Payment whereof, he was permitted to bring his
 Cause on to a Hearing before the grand Desterham.
 
 On the Day appointed for that Purpose he open'd the Cause himself,
 in Terms to this or the like Effect.
 
 Ye bright Stars of Justice, ye profound Abyss of universal
 Knowledge, ye Mirrors of Equity, who have in you the Solidity of
 Lead, the Hardness of Steel, the Lustre of a Diamond, and the
 Resemblance of the purest Gold! Since ye have condescended so far,
 as to admit of my Address to this August Assembly, I here, in the
 most solemn Manner, swear to you by _Orosmades_, that I never saw
 the Queen's illustrious Bitch, nor the sacred Palfrey of the King of
 Kings. I'll be ingenuous, however, and declare the Truth, and
 nothing but the Truth. As I was walking by the Thicket's Side, where
 I met with her Majesty's most venerable chief Eunuch, and the King's
 most illustrious chief Huntsman, I perceiv'd upon the Sand the
 Footsteps of an Animal, and I easily inferr'd that it must be a
 little one. The several small, tho' long Ridges of Land between the
 Footsteps of the Creature, gave me just Grounds to imagine it was a
 Bitch whose Teats hung down; and for that Reason, I concluded she
 had but lately pupp'd. As I observ'd likewise some other Traces, in
 some Degree different, which seem'd to have graz'd all the Way upon
 the Surface of the Sand, on the Side of the fore-Feet, I knew well
 enough she must have had long Ears. And forasmuch as I discern'd;
 with some Degree of Curiosity, that the Sand was every where less
 hollow'd by one Foot in particular, than by the other three, I
 conceiv'd that the Bitch of our most august Queen was somewhat
 lamish, if I may presume to say so.
 
 As to the Palfrey of the King of Kings, give me leave to inform you,
 that as I was walking down the Lane by the Thicket-side, I took
 particular Notice of the Prints made upon the Sand by a Horse's
 Shoes; and found that their Distances were in exact Proportion; from
 that Observation, I concluded the Palfrey gallop'd well. In the next
 Place, the Dust of some Trees in a narrow Lane, which was but seven
 Foot broad, was here and there swept off, both on the Right and on
 the Left, about three Feet and six Inches from the Middle of the
 Road. For which Reason I pronounc'd the Tail of the Palfrey to be
 three Foot and a half long, with which he had whisk'd off the Dust
 on both Sides as he ran along. Again, I perceiv'd under the Trees,
 which form'd a Kind of Bower of five Feet high, some Leaves that had
 been lately fallen on the Ground, and I was sensible the Horse must
 have shook them off; from whence I conjectur'd he was five Foot
 high. As to the Bits of his Bridle, I knew they must be of Gold, and
 of the Value I mention'd; for he had rubb'd the Studs upon a certain
 Stone, which I knew to be a Touch-stone, by an Experiment that I had
 made of it. To conclude, by the Prints which his Shoes had left of
 some Flint-Stones of another Nature, I concluded his Shoes were
 Silver, and of eleven penny Weight Fineness, as I before mention'd.
 
 The whole Bench of Judges stood astonish'd at the Profundity of
 _Zadig's_ nice Discernment. The News was soon carried to the King
 and the Queen. _Zadig_ was not only the whole Subject of the Court's
 Conversation; but his Name was mention'd with the utmost Veneration
 in the King's Chambers, and his Privy-Council. And notwithstanding
 several of their Magi declar'd he ought to be burnt for a Sorcerer;
 yet the King thought proper, that the Fine he had deposited in
 Court, should be peremptorily restor'd. The Clerk of the Court, the
 Tipstaffs, and other petty Officers, waited on him in their proper
 Habit, in order to refund the four Hundred Ounces of Gold, pursuant
 to the King's express Order; modestly reserving only three Hundred
 and ninety Ounces, part thereof, to defray the Fees of the Court.
 And the Domesticks swarm'd about him likewise, in Hopes of some
 small Consideration.
 
 _Zadig_, upon winding up of the Bottom, was fully convinc'd, that it
 was very dangerous to be over-wise; and was determin'd to set a
 Watch before the Door of his Lips for the future.
 
 An Opportunity soon offer'd for the Trial of his Resolution. A
 Prisoner of State had just made his Escape, and pass'd under the
 Window of _Zadig's_ House. _Zadig_ was examin'd thereupon, but was
 absolutely dumb. However, as it was plainly prov'd upon him, that he
 did look out of the Window at the same Time, he was sentenc'd to pay
 five Hundred Ounces of Gold for that Misdemeanor; and moreover, was
 oblig'd to thank the Court for their Indulgence; a Compliment which
 the Magistrates of _Babylon_ expect to be paid them. Good God! said
 he, to himself, have I not substantial Reason to complain, that my
 impropitious Stars should direct me to walk by a Wood's-Side, where
 the Queen's Bitch and the King's Palfrey should happen to pass by?
 How dangerous is it to pop one's Head out of one's Window? And, in a
 Word, how difficult is it for a Man to be happy on this Side the
 Grave?
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. IV.
 
 _The_ ENVIOUS MAN.
 
 
 As _Zadig_ had met with such a Series of Misfortunes, he was
 determin'd to ease the Weight of them by the Study of Philosophy,
 and the Conversation of select Friends. He was still possess'd of a
 little pretty Box in the Out-parts of _Babylon_, which was furnish'd
 in a good Taste; where every Artist was welcome, and wherein he
 enjoy'd all the rational Pleasures that a virtuous Man could well
 wish for. In the Morning, his Library was always open for the Use of
 the Learned; at Night his Table was fill'd with the most agreeable
 Companions; but he was soon sensible, by Experience, how dangerous
 it was to keep learned Men Company. A warm Dispute arose about a
 certain Law of _Zoroaster_; which prohibited the Eating of Griffins:
 But to what Purpose said some of the Company, was that Prohibition,
 since there is no such Animal in Nature? Some again insisted that
 there must; for otherwise _Zoroaster_ could never have been so weak
 as to give his Pupils such a Caution. _Zadig_, in order to
 compromize the Matter, said; Gentlemen, If there are such Creatures
 in Being, let us never touch them; and if there are not, we are well
 assur'd we can't touch them; so in either Case we shall comply with
 the Commandment.
 
 A learned Man at the upper End of the Table, who had compos'd
 thirteen Volumes, expatiating on every Property of the Griffin, took
 this Affair in a very serious Light, which would greatly have
 embarrass'd _Zadig_, but for the Credit of a Magus, who was Brother
 to his Friend _Cador_. From that Day forward, _Zadig_ ever
 distinguish'd and preferr'd good, before learned Company: He
 associated with the most conversible Men, and the most amiable
 Ladies in all _Babylon_; he made elegant Entertainments, which were
 frequently preceded by a Concert of Musick, and enliven'd by the
 most facetious Conversation, in which, as he had felt the Smart of
 it, he had laid aside all Thoughts of shewing his Wit, which is not
 only the surest Proof that a Man has none, but the most infallible
 Means to spoil all good Company.
 
 Neither the Choice of his Friends, nor that of his Dishes, was the
 Result of Pride or Ostentation. He took Delight in appearing to be,
 what he actually was, and not in seeming to be what he was not; and
 by that Means, got a greater real Character than he actually aim'd
 at.
 
 Directly opposite to his House liv'd _Arimazes_, one puff'd up with
 Pride, who not meeting with Success in the World, sought his Revenge
 in railing against all Mankind. Rich as he was, it was almost more
 than he could accomplish, to procure ev'n any Parasites about him.
 Tho' the rattling of the Chariots which stopp'd at _Zadig's_ Door
 was a perfect Nuisance to him; yet the good Character which every
 Body gave him was still a higher Provocation. He would sometimes
 intrude himself upon _Zadig_, and set down at his Table without any
 Invitation; when there, he would most certainly interrupt the Mirth
 of the Company, as Harpies, they say, infect the very Carrion that
 they eat.
 
 _Arimazes_ took it in his Head one Day to invite a young Lady to an
 Entertainment; but she, instead of accepting of his Offer, spent the
 Evening at _Zadig's_. Another Time, as _Zadig_ and he were chatting
 together at Court, a Minister of State came up to them, and invited
 _Zadig_ to Supper, but took no Notice of _Arimazes_. The most
 implacable Aversions have frequently no better Foundations. This
 Gentleman, who was call'd the _envious Man_, would have taken away
 the Life of _Zadig_ if he could because most People distinguish'd
 him by the Title of the _Happy Man_. "An Opportunity of doing
 Mischief, says _Zoroaster_, offers itself a hundred Times a Day; but
 that of doing a Friend a good Office but once a Year."
 
 _Arimazes_ went one Day to _Zadig's_ House, when he was walking in
 his Garden with two Friends, and a young Lady, to whom he said
 Abundance of fine Things, with no other Design but the innocent
 Pleasure of saying them. Their Conversation turn'd on a War that the
 King had happily put an End to, between him and his Vassal, the
 Prince of _Hyrcania_. _Zadig_ having signaliz'd himself in that
 short War, commended his Majesty very highly, but was more lavish of
 his Compliments on the Lady. He took out his Pocket Book, and wrote
 four extempore Verses on that Occasion, and gave them the Lady to
 read. The Gentlemen then present begg'd to be oblig'd with a Sight
 of them, as well as the Lady, But either thro' Modesty, or rather a
 self-Consciousness that he hadn't happily succeeded, he gave them a
 flat Denial. He was sensible, that a sudden poetic Flight must prove
 insipid to every one but the Person in whose Favour it is written,
 whereupon he snapt the Table in two whereon the Lines were wrote,
 and threw both Pieces into a Rose-bush, where they were hunted for,
 but to no Purpose. Soon after it happened to rain, and all the
 Company flew into the House, but _Arimazes_. Notwithstanding the
 Shower, he continued in the Garden, and never quitted it, till he
 had found one Moiety of the Tablet, which was unfortunately broke in
 such a Manner, that even the half Lines were good sense, and good
 Metre, tho' very short. But what was still more remarkably
 unfortunate, they appear'd at first View, to be a severe satyr upon
 the King: The Words were these:
 
                                         _To flagrant Crimes
                                              His Crown he owes;
                                          To peaceful Times
                                              The worst of Foes._
 
 This was the first Moment that ever _Arimazes_ was happy. He had it
 now in his Power to ruin the most virtuous and innocent of Men. Big
 with his execrable Joy, he flew to his Majesty with this virulent
 Satyr of _Zadig's_ under his own Hand. Not only _Zadig_, but his two
 Friends and the Lady were immediately close confin'd. His Cause was
 soon over; for the Judges turn'd a deaf Ear to what he had to say.
 When Sentence of Condemnation was pass'd upon him, _Arimazes_, still
 spiteful, was heard to say, as he went out of Court, with an Air of
 Contempt, that _Zadig's_ Lines were Treason indeed, but nothing
 more. Tho' _Zadig_ didn't value himself on Account of his Genius for
 Poetry; yet he was almost distracted to find himself condemn'd for
 the worst of Traitors, and his two Friends and the Lady lock'd up in
 a Dungeon for a Crime, of which he was no ways guilty. He wasn't
 permitted to speak one Word for himself. His Pocket-Book was
 sufficient Evidence against him. So strict were the Laws of
 _Babylon_! He was carried to the Place of Execution, through a Croud
 of Spectators, who durstn't condole with him, and who flock'd about
 him, to observe whether his Countenance chang'd, or whether he died
 with a good Grace. His Relations were the only real Mourners; for
 there was no Estate in Reversion for them; three Parts of his
 Effects were confiscated for the King's Use, and the fourth was
 devoted, as a Reward, to the use of the Informer.
 
 Just at the Time that he was preparing himself for Death, the King's
 Parrot flew from her Balcony, into _Zadig's_ Garden, and alighted on
 a Rose-bush. A Peach, that had been blown down, and drove by the
 Wind from an adjacent Tree, just under the Bush, was glew'd, as it
 were, to the other Moiety of the Tablet. Away flew the Parrot with
 her Booty, and return'd to the King's Lap. The Monarch, being
 somewhat curious, read the Words on the broken Tablet, which had no
 Meaning in them as he could perceive, but seem'd to be the broken
 Parts of a Tetrastick. He was a great Admirer of Poetry; and the odd
 Adventure of his Parrot, put him upon Reflection. The Queen who
 recollected full well the Lines that were wrote on the Fragment of
 _Zadig's_ Tablet, order'd that Part of it to be produc'd: Both the
 broken Pieces being put together, they answered exactly the
 Indentures; and then the Verses which _Zadig_ had written, in a
 Flight of Loyalty, ran thus,
 
     _Tyrants are prone to flagrant Crimes;
        To Clemency his Crown he owes;
      To Concord and to peaceful Times,
        Love only is the worst of Foes._
 
 Upon this the King order'd _Zadig_ to be instantly brought before
 him; and his two Friends and the Lady to be that Moment discharg'd.
 _Zadig_, as he stood before the King and Queen, fix'd his Eyes upon
 the Ground, and begg'd their Majesty's Pardon for his little
 worthless, poetical Attempt. He spoke, however, with such a becoming
 Grace, and with so much Modesty and good Sense, that the King and
 the Queen, ordered him to be brought before them once again. He was
 brought accordingly, and he pleas'd them still more and more. In
 short, they gave him all the immense Estate of _Arimazes_, who had
 so unjustly accus'd him; but _Zadig_ generously return'd the wicked
 Informer the Whole to a Farthing. The envious Man, however, was no
 ways affected, but with the Restoration of his Effects. _Zadig_
 every Day grew more and more in Favour at Court. He was made a Party
 in all the King's Pleasures, and nothing was done in the
 Privy-Council without him. The Queen, from that very Hour, shew'd
 him so much Respect, and spoke to him in such soft and endearing
 Terms, that in Process of Time, it prov'd of fatal Consequence to
 herself, her Royal Consort, to _Zadig_, and the whole Kingdom.
 _Zadig_ now began to think it was not so difficult a Thing to be
 happy as at first he imagin'd.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. V.
 
 _The_ Force _of_ Generosity.
 
 
 The Time now drew near for the Celebration of a grand Festival,
 which was kept but once in five Years. 'Twas a constant Custom in
 _Babylon_ at the Expiration of the Term above-mention'd, to
 distinguish that Citizen from all the Rest, in the most solemn
 Manner, who had done the most generous Action; and the Grandees and
 Magi always sat as Judges. The _Satrap_ inform'd them of every
 praise-worthy Deed that occurr'd within his District. All were put
 to the Vote, and the King himself pronounc'd the Definitive
 Sentence. People of all Ranks and Degrees came from the remotest
 Part of the Kingdom to be present at this Solemnity. The Victor,
 whoever he was, receiv'd from the King's own Hand a golden Cup,
 enrich'd with precious Stones, and upon the Delivery, the King made
 use of the following Salutation. _Receive this Reward of your
 Generosity, and may the Gods grant me Thousands of such valuable
 Subjects!_
 
 Upon this memorable Day, the King appear'd in all the Pomp
 imaginable on his Throne of State, surrounded by his Grandees, the
 Magi, and the Deputies, from all the surrounding Nations, of every
 Province that attended these public Sports, where Honour was to be
 acquir'd, not by the Velocity of the best Race-Horse, or by bodily
 Strength, but by intrinsic Merit. The principal _Satrap_ proclaim'd,
 with an audible Voice, such Actions as would entitle the Victor to
 the inestimable Prize; but never mention'd one Word of _Zadig's_
 Greatness of Soul, in returning his invidious Neighbour all his
 Estate, notwithstanding he would have taken away his Life: That was
 but a Trifle, and not worth speaking of.
 
 The first that was set up for the Prize, was a Judge, that had
 occasion'd a Citizen to lose a very considerable Cause, through some
 Mistake, for which he was no ways responsible, and made him
 Restitution out of his private Purse.
 
 The next Candidate was a Youth, that tho' violently in Love with one
 that he intended shortly to make his Spouse, yet resign'd her to his
 Friend, who was just expiring at her Feet; and moreover, gave her a
 Portion at the same Time.
 
 After this appear'd a Soldier, who, in the _Hyrcanian_ War, had done
 a much more glorious Action than the Lover. A Gang of _Hyrcanians_
 having taken his Mistress from him, he fought them bravely, and
 rescued her out of their Hands: Soon after, he was inform'd, that
 another Band of the same Party had hurried away his Mother to a
 Place not far distant; he left his Mistress, all drown'd in Tears,
 and ran to his Mother's Assistance: After that Skirmish was over, he
 returned to his Sweet-heart, and found her just expiring. He would
 fain have plung'd a Dagger into his Heart that Moment; but his
 Mother remonstrated to him, that, should he die, she should be
 entirely helpless, and upon that Account only he had Courage to live
 a little longer.
 
 The Judges seem'd very much inclin'd to give their Votes for the
 Soldier; but the King prevented them, by saying, that the Soldier's
 Action was praise-worthy enough, and so were those of the rest, but
 none of them give me any Surprize. What _Zadig_ did Yesterday
 perfectly struck me with Astonishment. I'll mention another
 Instance. I had some few Days ago, as a Testimony of my Resentment,
 banish'd my Prime-Minister, and Favourite _Coreb_ from the Court. I
 complain'd of his Conduct in the warmest Terms; and all my
 Sycophants about me, told me that I was too merciful; and loaded him
 with the sharpest Invectives. I ask'd _Zadig_ what his Opinion was
 of _Coreb_; and he dar'd to give him the best of Characters. I must
 confess, I have read in our publick Records, indeed, of Instances
 where Restitution have been generally made, for Injuries committed
 by Mistake; where a Mistress has been resign'd; and where a Mother
 has been preferr'd to a Mistress; but I never read of a Courtier,
 that would speak to the Advantage of a Minister in Disgrace, and
 against whom the Sovereign was highly incens'd. I'll give 20,000
 Pieces of Gold to every Candidate that has been this Day proclaim'd,
 but I'll give the Cup to no one but _Zadig_.
 
 Sire, said _Zadig_, 'tis your Majesty alone, that deserves the Cup;
 'tis you alone who have done an Action of Generosity, never heard of
 before; since you, who are King of Kings, wasn't exasperated against
 your Slave, when he contradicted you in the Heat of your Passion.
 Every Body gaz'd with Eyes of Admiration on the King and _Zadig_.
 The Judge, who had generously made Restitution for his Error; the
 Lover, who had married his Mistress to his Friend; the Soldier, who
 had preferr'd the Welfare of his Mother to that of his Mistress;
 received the promis'd Donation from the Monarch, and saw their Names
 register'd in the Book of _Fame_: But _Zadig_ had the Cup. The King
 got the universal Character of a good Prince, which he did not long
 preserve. This joyful Day was solemniz'd with Festivals beyond the
 Time by Law establish'd. Tragedies were acted there that drew Tears
 from the Spectators; and Comedies that made them laugh; Entertainments,
 that the _Babylonians_ were perfect Strangers to: The Commemoration
 of it is still preserv'd in _Asia_. Now, said _Zadig_, I am happy at
 last; but he was grosly mistaken.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP VI.
 
 _The_ JUDGMENTS.
 
 
 Young as _Zadig_ was, he was constituted chief Judge of all the
 Tribunals throughout the Empire. He fill'd the Place, like one, whom
 the Gods had endow'd with the strictest Justice, and the most solid
 Wisdom. It was to him, the Nations round about were indebted for
 that generous Maxim; _that 'tis much more Prudence to acquit two
 Persons, tho' actually guilty, than to pass Sentence of Condemnation
 in one that is virtuous and innocent_. It was his firm Opinion, that
 the Laws were intended to be a Praise to those who did well, as much
 as to be a Terror to Evildoers. It was his peculiar Talent to render
 Truth as obvious as possible: Whereas most Men study to render it
 intricate and obscure. On the very first Day of his Entrance into
 his High Office, he exerted this peculiar Talent. A rich Merchant,
 and a Native of _Babylon_, died in the _Indies_. He had made his
 Will, and appointed his two Sons Joint-Heirs of his Estate, as soon
 as they had settled their Sister, and married her with their mutual
 Approbation. Moreover, he left a specific Legacy of 30,000 Pieces of
 Gold to that Son, who should, after his Decease, be prov'd to love
 him best. The Eldest erected to his Memory a very costly Monument:
 The Youngest appropriated a considerable Part of his Bequest to the
 Augmentation of his Sister's Fortune: Every one, without Hesitation,
 gave the Preference to the Elder, allowing the Younger to have the
 greatest Affection for his Sister. The Legacy therefore was
 doubtless due to the Eldest.
 
 Their Cause came before _Zadig_, and he examin'd them apart. To the
 former, said _Zadig_, Your Father, Sir, is not dead, as is reported,
 but being happily recover'd, is on his Return to _Babylon_. God be
 praised, said the young Man! but I hope the Expence I have been at
 in raising this superb Monument will be consider'd. After this,
 _Zadig_ repeated the same Story to the Younger. God be praised, said
 he! I will immediately restore all that he has left me; but I hope
 my Father will not recal the little Present I have made my Sister.
 You have nothing to restore, Sir; you shall have the Legacy of the
 thirty thousand Pieces; for 'tis you that have the greatest
 Veneration for your deceased Father.
 
 A young Lady that was very rich, had entred into a Marriage-Contract
 with two _Magis_; and having receiv'd Instructions from both Parties
 for some Months, she prov'd with Child. They were both ready and
 willing to marry her. But, said she, he shall be my Husband, that
 has put me into a Capacity of serving my Country, by adding one to
 it. 'Tis I, Madam, that have answered that valuable End, said one;
 but the other insisted 'twas his Operation. Well! said she, since
 this is a Moot-point, I'll acknowledge him for the Father of the
 Child, that will give him the most liberal Education. In a short
 Time after, my Lady was brought to Bed of a hopeful Boy. Each of
 them insisted on being Tutor, and the Cause was brought before
 _Zadig_. The two Magi were order'd to appear in Court. Pray Sir,
 said _Zadig_ to the first, what Method of Instruction do you propose
 to pursue for the Improvement of your young Pupil? He shall first be
 grounded, said this learned Pedagogue, in the Eight Parts of Speech;
 then I'll teach him Logic, Astrology, Magick, the wide Difference
 between the Terms Substance and Accident, Abstract and Concrete,
 _&c. &c._ As for my Part, Sir, I shall take another Course, said the
 second; I'll do my utmost to make him an honest Man, and acceptable
 to his Friends. Upon this, _Zadig_ said, you, Sir, shall marry the
 Mother, let who will be the Father.
 
 There came daily Complaints to Court against the _Itimadoulet_ of
 _Media_, whose Name was _Irax_. He was a Person of Quality, who was
 possess'd of a very considerable Estate, notwithstanding he had
 squander'd away a great Part of it, by indulging himself in all
 Manner of expensive Pleasures. It was but seldom that an Inferior
 was suffer'd to speak to him; but not a Soul durst contradict him:
 No Peacock was more gay; no Turtle more amorous; and no Tortoise
 more indolent and inactive. He made false Glory and false Pleasures
 his sole Pursuit.
 
 _Zadig_, undertaking to cure him, sent him forthwith, as by express
 Order from the King, a Musick-Master with twelve Voices, and 24
 Violins, as his Attendants; a Head Steward, with six Men Cooks, and
 4 Chamberlains, who were never to be out of his Sight. The King
 issued out his Writ for the punctual Observance of his Royal Will;
 and thus the Affair proceeded.
 
 The first Morning, as soon as the voluptuous _Irax_ had open'd his
 Eyes, his Musick-Master, with the Voices and Violins, entred his
 Apartment. They sang a Cantata, that lasted two Hours and three
 Minutes. Every three Minutes the Chorus, or Burthen of the Song, was
 to this Effect.
 
     _Tisn't in Words to speak your Praise;
       What mighty Honours are your Due!
      To worth like yours we Altars raise,
       No Monarch's happier, Sir, than you._
 
 After the Cantata was over, the Chamberlain address'd him in a
 formal Harangue for three Quarters of an Hour without ceasing;
 wherein he took Occasion to extol every Virtue to which he was a
 perfect Stranger; when the Oration was over, he was conducted to
 Dinner, where the Musicians were all in waiting, and play'd, as soon
 as he was seated at his Table. Dinner lasted three Hours before he
 condescended to speak a Word. When he did; you say Right, Sir, said
 the chief Chamberlain; scarce had he utter'd four Words more, but
 Right, Sir, said the second. The other two Chamberlain's Time was
 taken up in laughing with Admiration at _Irax's_ Smart Repartees, or
 at least such as he ought to have made. After the Cloth was taken
 away, the adulating Chorus was repeated.
 
 This first Day _Irax_ was all in Raptures; he imagin'd, that this
 Honour done him by the King of Kings, was the sole Result of his
 exalted Merit. The second wasn't altogether so agreeable; The third
 prov'd somewhat troublesome; the fourth insupportable; the fifth was
 tormenting; and at last, he was perfectly outrageous at the
 continual Peal in his Ears of No Monarch's happier Sir, than you,
 You say right, _&c._ and at being daily harangu'd at the same Hour.
 Whereupon he wrote to Court, and begg'd of his Majesty to recal his
 Chamberlain, his Musick-Master, and all his Retinue, his Head
 Steward and his Cooks, and promis'd, in the most submissive Manner,
 to be less vain, and more industrious for the future. Tho' he didn't
 require so much Adulations, nor such grand Entertainments, he was
 much more happy; for, as _Sadder_ has it, _One continued Scene of
 Pleasure, is no Pleasure at all_.
 
 _Zadig_ every Day gave incontestable Proofs of his wondrous
 Penetration, and the Goodness of his Heart; he was ador'd by the
 People, and was the Darling of the King. The little Difficulties
 that he met with in the first Stage of his Life, serv'd only to
 augment his present Felicity. Every Night, however, he had some
 unlucky Dream or another, that gave him some Disturbance. One while,
 he imagin'd himself extended on a Bed of wither'd Plants, amongst
 which there were some that were sharp pointed, and made him very
 restless and uneasy; another Time, he fancied himself repos'd on a
 Bed of Roses, out of which rush'd a Serpent, that stung him to the
 Heart with his envenom'd Tongue. Alas! said he, waking, I was one
 while upon a Bed of hard and nauseous Plants, and just this Moment
 repos'd on a Bed of Roses. But then the Serpent.--
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. VII.
 
 _The Force of_ JEALOUSY.
 
 
 The Misfortunes that attended _Zadig_ proceeded, in a great Measure,
 from his Preferment; but more from his intrinsic Merit. Every Day he
 had familiar Converse with the King, his Royal Master, and his
 august Consort, _Astarte_. And the Pleasure arising from thence was
 greatly enhanc'd from an innate Ambition of pleasing, which, in
 regard to Wit, is the same, as Dress is to Beauty. His Youth, and
 graceful Deportment, had a greater Influence on _Astarte_, than she
 was at first aware of. Tho' her Affection for him daily encreas'd;
 yet she was perfectly innocent. _Astarte_ would say, without the
 least Reserve or Apprehension of Fear, that she was extreamly
 pleas'd with the Company of one, who was, not only a Favourite of
 her Husband, but the Darling of the whole Empire. She was
 continually speaking in his Commendation before the King: He was the
 Subject of her whole Discourse amongst her Ladies of Honour, who
 were as lavish of their Praises as herself. Such repeated
 Discourses, however innocent, made a deeper Impression on her Heart,
 than she at that Time apprehended. She would every now and then send
 _Zadig_ some little Present or another; which he construed as the
 Result of a greater Value for him than she intended. She said no
 more of him, as she thought, than a Queen might innocently do, who
 was perfectly assur'd of his Attachment to her Husband; sometimes,
 indeed, she would express her self with an Air of Tenderness and
 Affection.
 
 _Astarte_ was much handsomer than either his Mistress _Semira_, who
 had such a natural Antipathy to a one-eyed Lord, or _Azora_, his
 late loving Spouse, that would innocently have cut his Nose off. The
 Freedoms which _Astarte_ took, her tender Expressions, at which she
 began to blush, the Glances of her Eye, which she would turn away,
 if perceiv'd, and which she fix'd upon his, kindled in the Heart of
 _Zadig_ a Fire, which struck him with Amazement. He did all he could
 to smother it; he call'd up all the Philosophy he was Master of to
 his Aid; but all in vain, for no Consolation arose from those
 Reflections.
 
 Duty, Gratitude, and an injur'd Monarch, presented themselves before
 his Eyes, as avenging Deities: He bravely struggled; he triumph'd
 indeed; but this Conquest over his Passions, which he was oblig'd to
 check every Moment, cost him many a deep Sigh and Tear. He durst not
 talk with the Queen any more, with that Freedom which was too
 engaging on both Sides; his Eyes were obnubilated; his Discourse was
 forc'd and unconnected; he turn'd his Eyes another Way; and when,
 against his Inclination, they met with those of the Queen, he found,
 that tho' drown'd in Tears, they darted Flames of Fire: They seem'd
 in Silence to intimate, that they were afraid of being in love with
 each other; and that both burn'd with a Fire which both condemn'd.
 
 _Zadig_ flew from her Presence, like one beside himself, and in
 Despair; his Heart was over-charg'd with a Burthen, too great for
 him to bear: In the Heat of his Conflicts, he disclos'd the Secrets
 of his Heart to his trusty Friend _Cador_, as one, who, having long
 groan'd under the Weight of an inexpressible Anguish of Mind, at
 once makes known the Cause of his Torments by the Groans, as it
 were, extorted from him, and by the Drops of a cold Sweat, that
 trickled down his Cheeks.
 
 _Cador_ said to him; 'tis now some considerable Time since, I have
 discover'd that secret Passion which you have foster'd in your
 Bosom, and yet endeavour'd to conceal even from your self. The
 Passions carry along with them such strong Impressions, that they
 cannot be conceal'd. Tell me ingenuously _Zadig_; and be your own
 Accuser, whether or no, since I have made this Discovery, the King
 has not shewn some visible Marks of his Resentment. He has no other
 Foible, but that of being the most jealous Mortal breathing. You
 take more Pains to check the Violence of your Passion, than the
 Queen herself does; because you are a Philosopher; because, in
 short, you are _Zadig_; _Astarte_ is but a weak Woman; and tho' her
 Eyes speak too visibly, and with too much Imprudence; yet she does
 not think her self blame-worthy. Being conscious of her Innocence,
 to her own Misfortune, as well as yours, she is too unguarded. I
 tremble for her; because I am sensible her Conscience acquits her.
 Were you both agreed, you might conceal your Regard for each other
 from all the World: A rising Passion, that is smother'd, breaks out
 into a Flame; Love, when once gratified, knows how to conceal itself
 with Art. _Zadig_ shudder'd at the Proposition of ungratefully
 violating the Bed of his Royal Benefactor; and never was there a
 more loyal Subject to a Prince, tho' guilty of an involuntary Crime.
 The Queen, however, repeated the Name of _Zadig_ so often, and her
 Cheeks glow'd with such a red, when ever she utter'd it; she was one
 while so transported, and at another, so dejected, when the
 Discourse turn'd upon him in the King's Presence; she was in such a
 Reverie, so confus'd and stupid, when he went out of the Presence,
 that her Deportment made the King extremely uneasy. He was convinc'd
 of every Thing he saw, and form'd in his Mind an Idea of a thousand
 Things he did not see. He observ'd, particularly, that _Astarte's_
 Sandals were blue; so _Zadig's_ were blue likewise; that as the
 Queen wore yellow Ribbands, _Zadig's_ Turbet was of the same Colour:
 These were shocking Circumstances for a Monarch of his Cast of Mind
 to reflect on! To a Mind, in short, so distemper'd as his was,
 Suspicions were converted into real Facts.
 
 All Court Slaves, and Sycophants, are so many Spies on Kings and
 Queens: They soon discover'd that _Astarte_ was fond, and _Moabdar_
 jealous. _Arimazius_, his envious Foe, who was as incorrigible as
 ever; for Flints will never soften; and Creatures, that are by
 Nature venemous, forever retain their Poison. _Arimazius_, I say,
 wrote an anonymous Letter to _Moabdar_, the infamous Recourse of
 sordid Spirits, who are the Objects of universal Contempt; but in
 this Case, an Affair of the last Importance; because this Letter
 tallied with the baneful Suggestions that Monarch had conceiv'd. In
 short, his Thoughts were now wholly bent upon Revenge. He determin'd
 to poison _Astarte_ on a certain Night, and to have _Zadig_
 strangled by Break of Day. Orders for that Purpose were expressly
 given to a merciless, inhuman Eunuch, the ready Executioner of his
 Vengeance. At that critical Conjuncture, there happen'd to be a
 Dwarf, who was dumb, but not deaf, in the King's Apartment. Nobody
 regarded him: He was an Eye and Ear-witness of all that pass'd, and
 yet no more suspected than any irrational Domestic Animal. This
 little Dwarf had conceiv'd a peculiar Regard for _Astarte_ and
 _Zadig_: He heard, with equal Horror and Surprize, the King's Orders
 to destroy them both. But how to prevent those Orders from being put
 into Execution, as the Time was so short, was all his Concern. He
 could not write, 'tis true, but he had luckily learnt to draw, and
 take a Likeness. He spent a good Part of the Night in delineating
 with Crayons, on a Piece of Paper, the imminent Danger that thus
 attended the Queen. In one Corner, he represented the King highly
 incens'd, and giving his cruel Eunuch the fatal Orders; in another,
 a Bowl and a Cord upon a Table; in the Center was the Queen,
 expiring in the Arms of her Maids of Honour, with _Zadig_ strangled,
 and laid dead at her Feet. In the Horizon was the rising Sun, to
 denote, that this execrable Scene was to be exhibited by Break of
 Day. No sooner was his Design finish'd, but he ran with it to one of
 _Astarte's_ Female Favourites, then in waiting, call'd her up, and
 gave her to understand, that she must carry the Draught to _Astarte_
 that very Moment.
 
 In the mean Time, the Queen's Attendants, tho' it was Dead of Night,
 knock'd at the Door of _Zadig's_ Apartment, wak'd him, and deliver'd
 into his Hands a Billet from the Queen. At first he could not well
 tell whether he was only in a Dream or not, but soon read the
 Letter, with a trembling Hand, and a heavy Heart: Words can't
 express his Surprise, and the Agonies of Despair which he was in
 upon his perusal of the Contents. _Fly_, said she, _Dear_ Zadig,
 _this very Moment; for your Life's in the utmost Danger: Fly, Dear_
 Zadig, _I conjure you, in the Name of that fatal Passion, with which
 I have long struggled, and which I now venture to discover, as I
 am to make Atonement for it, in a few Moments, by the Loss of my
 Life. Tho' I am conscious to myself of my Innocence, I find I am to
 feel the Weight of my Husband's Resentment, and die the Death of a
 Traitor._
 
 _Zadig_ was scarce able to speak. He order'd his Friend _Cador_ to
 be instantly call'd, and gave him the Letter the Moment he came,
 without opening his Lips. _Cador_ press'd him to regard the
 Contents, and to make the best of his Way to _Memphis_. If you
 presume, said he, to have an Interview with her Majesty first, you
 inevitably hasten her Execution; or if you wait upon the King, the
 fatal Consequence will be the same: I'll prevent her unhappy Fate,
 if possible; you follow but your own: I'll give it out, that you are
 gone to the _Indies_: I'll wait on you as soon as the Hurricane is
 blown over, and I'll let you know all that occurs material in
 _Babylon_.
 
 _Cador_, that Instant, order'd two of the fleetest Dromedaries that
 could be got, to be in readiness at a private Back-Door belonging to
 the Court; he help'd _Zadig_ to mount his Beast, tho' ready to drop
 into the Earth. He had but one trusty Servant to attend him, and
 _Cador_, overwhelm'd with Grief, soon lost Sight of his dearly
 beloved Friend.
 
 This illustrious Fugitive soon reach'd the Summit of a little Hill,
 that afforded him a fair Prospect of the whole City of _Babylon_:
 But turning his Eyes back towards the Queen's Palace, he fainted
 away; and when he had recover'd his Senses, he drown'd his Eyes in a
 Flood of Tears, and with Impatience wish'd for Death. To conclude,
 after he had reflected, with Horror, on the deplorable Fate of the
 most amiable Creature in the Universe, and of the most meritorious
 Queen that ever liv'd; he for a Moment commanded his Passion, and
 with a Sigh, made the following Exclamations: What is this mortal
 Life! O Virtue, Virtue, of what Service hast thou been to me! Two
 young Ladies, a Mistress, and a Wife, have prov'd false to me; a
 third, who is perfectly innocent, and ten thousand Times handsomer
 than either of them, has suffer'd Death, 'tis probable, before this,
 on my Account! All the Acts of Benevolence which I have shewn, have
 been the Foundation of my Sorrows, and I have been only rais'd to
 the highest Spoke of Fortune's Wheel, for no other Purpose than to
 be tumbled down with the greater Force. Had I been as abandon'd as
 some Miscreants are, I had like them been happy. His Head thus
 overwhelm'd with these melancholy Reflections, his Eyes thus sunk in
 his Head, and his meagre Cheeks all pale and languid; and, in a
 Word, his very Soul thus plung'd in the Abyss of deep Despair, he
 pursu'd his Journey towards _Egypt_.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. VIII.
 
 _The Thrash'd_ WIFE.
 
 
 _Zadig_ steer'd his Course by the Stars that shone over his Head.
 The Constellation of Orion, and the radiant Dog-star directed him
 towards the Pole of Canope. He reflected with Admiration on those
 immense Globes of Light, which appear'd to the naked Eye no more
 than little twinkling Lights; whereas the Earth he was then
 traversing, which, in Reality, is no more than an imperceptible
 Point in Nature, seem'd, according to the selfish Idea we generally
 entertain of it, something very immense, and very magnificent. He
 then reflected on the whole Race of Mankind, and look'd upon them,
 as they are in Fact, a Parcel of Insects, or Reptiles, devouring one
 another on a small Atom of Clay. This just Idea of them greatly
 alleviated his Misfortunes, recollecting the Nothingness, if we may
 be allow'd the Expression, of his own Being, and even of _Babylon_
 itself. His capacious Soul now soar'd into Infinity, and he
 contemplated, with the same Freedom, as if she was disencumber'd
 from her earthly Partner, on the immutable Order of the Universe.
 But as soon as she cower'd her Wings, and resumed her native Seat,
 he began to consider that _Astarte_ might possibly have lost her
 Life for his Sake; upon which, his Thoughts of the Universe vanish'd
 all at once, and no other Objects appear'd before his distemper'd
 Eyes, but his _Astarte_ giving up the Ghost, and himself overwhelm'd
 with a Sea of Troubles: As he gave himself up to this Flux and
 Reflux of sublime Philosophy and Anxiety of Mind, he was insensibly
 arriv'd on the Frontiers of _Egypt_: And his trusty Attendant had,
 unknown to him, stept into the first Village, and sought out for a
 proper Apartment for his Master and himself. _Zadig_ in the mean
 Time made the best of his Way to the adjacent Gardens; where he saw,
 not far distant from the High-way, a young Lady, all drown'd in
 Tears, calling upon Heaven and Earth for Succour in her Distress,
 and a Man, fir'd with Rage and Resentment, in pursuit after her. He
 had now just overtaken her, and she fell prostrate at his Feet
 imploring his Forgiveness. He loaded her with a thousand Reproaches;
 nor did he spare to chastise her in the most outrageous Manner. By
 the _Egyptian's_ cruel Deportment towards her, he concluded that the
 Man was a jealous Husband, and that the Lady was an Inconstant, and
 had defil'd his Bed: But when he reflected, that the Woman was a
 perfect Beauty, and to his thinking something like the unfortunate
 _Astarte_, he perceiv'd his Heart yearn with Compassion towards the
 Lady, and swell with Indignation against her Tyrant. For Heaven's
 sake, Sir, assist me, said she, to _Zadig_, sobbing as if her Heart
 would break, Oh! deliver me out of the Hands of this _Barbarian_:
 Save, Sir, O save my Life. Upon these her shocking Outcries, _Zadig_
 threw himself between the injur'd Lady and the inexorable Brute. And
 as he had some smattering of the _Egyptian_ Tongue, he expostulated
 with him in his own Dialect, and said: Dear Sir, if you are endow'd
 with the least Spark of Humanity, let me conjure you to have some
 Pity and Remorse for so beautiful a Creature; have some Regard, Sir,
 to the Weakness of her Sex. How can you treat a Lady, who is one of
 Nature's Master-pieces, in such a rude and outrageous Manner, one
 who lies weeping at your Feet for Forgiveness, and one who has no
 other Recourse than her Tears for her Defence? Oh! Oh! said the
 jealous-pated Fellow in a Fury to _Zadig_, What! You are one of her
 Gallants, I suppose. I'll be reveng'd of thee, thou Villain, this
 Moment. No sooner were the Words out of his Mouth, but he quits hold
 of the Lady, in whose Hair he had twisted his Fingers before, takes
 up his Lance in a Fury, and endeavours to the utmost of his Pow'r to
 plunge it in the Stranger's Heart: _Zadig_, however, being cool,
 warded the intended Blow with Ease. He laid fast hold of his Lance
 towards the Point. One strove to recover it, and the other to snatch
 it away by Force. They broke it between them. Whereupon the
 _Egyptian_ drew his Sword. _Zadig_ drew his: They fought: The former
 made a hundred rash Passes one after another, which the latter
 parried with the utmost Dexterity. The Lady sat herself upon a
 Grass-plat, adjusting her Head-dress, and looking on the Combatants.
 The _Egyptian_ was too strong for _Zadig_, but _Zadig_ was more
 nimble and active. The latter fought as a Man whose Hand was guided
 by his Head; the former as a Mad-man who dealt about his Blows at
 random. _Zadig_ took the Advantage, made a Plunge at him, and
 disarm'd him. And forasmuch as he found that the _Egyptian_ was
 hotter than ever, and endeavour'd all he could to throw him down by
 Dint of Strength, _Zadig_ laid fast hold of him, flew upon him, and
 tripp'd up his Heels: After that, holding the Point of his Sword to
 his Breast, like a Man of Honour, gave him his Life. The _Egyptian_,
 fir'd with Rage, and having no Command of his Passion, drew his
 Dagger, and wounded _Zadig_ like a Coward, whilst the Victor
 generously forgave him. Upon that unexpected Action, _Zadig_, being
 incens'd to the last Degree, plung'd his Sword deep into his Bosom.
 The _Egyptian_ fetch'd a hideous Groan, and died upon the Spot.
 _Zadig_ then approach'd the Lady, and with a kind of Concern, in the
 softest Terms told her, that he was oblig'd to kill her Insulter,
 tho' against his Inclinations. I have aveng'd your Cause, and
 deliver'd you out of the merciless Hands of the most outrageous Man
 I ever saw. Now, Madam, let me know your farther Will and Pleasure
 with me. You shall die, you Villain! You have murder'd my Love. Oh!
 I could tear your Heart out. Indeed, Madam, said _Zadig_, you had
 one of the most hot-headed, oddest Lovers I ever saw. He beat you
 most unmercifully, and would have taken away my Life because you
 call'd me in to your Assistance. Would to God he was but alive to
 beat me again, said she, blubbering and roaring; I deserv'd to be
 beat. I gave him too just Occasion to be jealous of me. Would to God
 that he had beat me, and you had died in his Stead! _Zadig_ more
 astonish'd, and more exasperated than ever he was in all his Life,
 said to her: Really, Madam, you put on such extravagant Airs, that
 you tempt me, pretty as you are, to thresh you most cordially in my
 Turn; but I scorn to concern my self any more about you. Upon this,
 he remounted his Dromedary, and made the best of his Way towards the
 Village: But before he had got near a hundred Yards, he return'd
 upon an Out-cry that was made by four Couriers from _Babylon_. They
 rode full Speed. One of them, spying the young Widow, cried out.
 There she is, That's she. She answers in every Respect to the
 Description we had of her. They never took the least Notice of her
 dead Gallant, but secur'd her directly. Oh! Sir, cried she to
 _Zadig_, again and again, dear Sir, most generous Stranger, once
 more deliver me from a Pack of Villains. I most humbly beg your
 Pardon for my late Conduct and unjust Complaint of you. Do but stand
 my Friend, at this critical Conjuncture, and I'll be your most
 obedient Vassal till Death. _Zadig_ had now no Inclination to fight
 for one so undeserving any more. Find some other to be your Fool
 now, Madam; you shan't impose upon me a second Time. I'll assure
 you, Madam, I know better Things. Besides he was wounded; and bled
 so fast that he wanted Assistance himself: And 'tis very probable,
 that the Sight of the _Babylonian_ Couriers, who were dispatch'd
 from King _Moabdar_, might discompose him very much. He made all the
 Haste he could towards the Village, not being able to conceive what
 should be the real Cause of the young Lady's being secur'd by those
 _Babylonish_ Officers, and as much at a Loss, at the same Time, what
 to think of such a Termagant and a Coquet.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. IX.
 
 _The_ CAPTIVE.
 
 
 No sooner was _Zadig_ arriv'd at the _Egyptian_ Village
 before-mention'd, but he found himself surrounded by a Croud. The
 People one and all cried out! See! See! there's the Man that ran
 away with the beauteous Lady _Missouf_, and murder'd _Cletofis_.
 Gentlemen, said he, God forbid that I should ever entertain a
 Thought of running away with the Lady you speak of: She is too much
 of a Coquet: And as to _Cletofis_, I did not murder him, but kill'd
 him in my own Defence. He endeavour'd all he could to take my Life
 away, because I entreated him to take some Pity and Compassion on
 the beauteous _Missouf_, whom he beat most unmercifully. I am a
 Stranger, who am fled hither for Shelter, and 'tis highly
 improbable, that upon my first Entrance into a Country, where I came
 for Safety and Protection, I should be guilty of two such enormous
 Crimes, as that of running away with another Man's Partner, and that
 of clandestinely murdering him on her Account.
 
 The _Egyptians_ at that Time were just and humane. The Populace, tis
 true, hurried _Zadig_ to the Town-Goal; but they took care in the
 first Place to stop the Bleeding of his Wounds, and afterwards
 examin'd the suppos'd Delinquents apart, in order to discover, if
 possible, the real Truth. They acquitted _Zadig_ of the Charge of
 wilful and premeditated Murder; but as he had taken a Subject's Life
 away, tho' in his own Defence, he was sentenc'd to be a Slave, as
 the Law directed. His two Beasts were sold in open Market, for the
 Service of the Hamlet; What Money he had was distributed amongst the
 Inhabitants; and he and his Attendant were expos'd in the
 Market-place to public Sale. An _Arabian_ Merchant, _Setoc_ by Name,
 purchas'd them both; but as the Valet, or Attendant, was a robust
 Man, and better cut out for hard Labour than the Master, he fetch'd
 the most Money. There was no Comparison to be made between them.
 _Zadig_ therefore was a Slave subordinate to his Valet; they secur'd
 them both, however, by a Chain upon their Legs; and so link'd they
 accompanied their Master home. _Zadig_, as they were on the Road,
 comforted his Fellow-Slave, and exhorted him to bear his Misfortunes
 with Patience: But, according to Custom, he made several Reflections
 on the Vicissitudes of human Life. I am now sensible, said he, that
 my impropitious Fortune has some malignant Influence over thine;
 every Occurrence of my Life hitherto has prov'd strangely odd and
 unaccountable. In the first Place, I was sentenc'd to die at
 _Babylon_, for writing a short Panegyrick on the King, my Master. In
 the next, I narrowly escap'd being strangled, for the Queen his
 Royal Consort's speaking a little too much in my Favour; and here I
 am a joint-Slave with thy self; because a turbulent Fellow of a
 Gallant would beat his Lady. However, Comrade, let us march on
 boldly; let not our Courage be cast down; all this may possibly have
 a happier Issue than we expect. 'Tis absolutely necessary that these
 _Arabian_ Merchants should have Slaves, and why should not you and
 I, as we are but Men, be Slaves as Thousands of others are? This
 Master of ours may not prove inexorable. He must treat his Slaves
 with some Thought and Consideration, if he expects them to do his
 Work. This was his Discourse to his Comrade; but his Mind was more
 attentive to the Misfortunes of the Queen of _Babylon_.
 
 Two Days afterwards _Setoc_ set out with his two Slaves and his
 Camels, for _Arabia Deserta_. His Tribe liv'd near the Desert of
 _Horeb_. The Way was long and tedious. _Setoc_, during the Journey,
 paid a much greater Regard to _Zadig's_ Valet, than to himself;
 because the former was the most able to load the Camels; and
 therefore what little Distinctions were made, they were in his
 Favour. It so happen'd that one of the Camels died upon the Road:
 The Load which the Beast carried was immediately divided, and thrown
 upon the Shoulders of the two Slaves; _Zadig_ had his Share.
 _Setoc_, couldn't forbear laughing to see his two Slaves crouching
 under their Burthen. _Zadig_ took the Liberty to explain the Reason
 thereof; and convinc'd him of the Laws of the Equilibrium. The
 Merchant was a little startled at his philosophical Discourse, and
 look'd upon him with a more favourable Eye than at first. _Zadig_,
 perceiving he had rais'd his Curiosity, redoubled it, by instructing
 him in several material Points, which were in some Measure,
 advantageous to him in his Way of Business: Such as, the specific
 Weight of Metals, and other Commodities of various Kinds, of an
 equal Bulk; the Properties of several useful Animals, and the best
 Ways and Means to make Such as were wild, tame by Degrees, and fit
 for Service: In short, _Zadig_ was look'd upon by his Master, as a
 perfect Oracle. _Setoc_ now thought the Master the much better Man
 of the two. He us'd him courteously, and had no Room to repent of
 his Indulgence towards him.
 
 Being got to their Journey's End, the first Step that _Setoc_ took
 was to claim a Debt of five hundred Ounces of Silver of a _Jew_, who
 had borrow'd it in the Presence of two Witnesses; but both of them
 were dead; and as the _Jew_ was conscious he couldn't be cast for
 Want of Evidence, appropriated the Merchant's Money to his own Use,
 and thank'd God that it lay in his Power for once to bite an
 _Arabian_ with Impunity. _Setoc_ discover'd to _Zadig_ the unhappy
 Situation of his Case, as he was now become his Confident. Where was
 it, pray, said _Zadig_, that you lent this large Sum to that
 ungrateful Infidel? Upon a large Stone, said the Merchant, at the
 Foot of Mount _Horeb_. What sort of a Man is your Debtor, said
 _Zadig_? Oh! he is as errand a Rogue as ever breath'd, reply'd
 _Setoc_. That I take for granted; but, says _Zadig_, is he a lively,
 active Man, or is he a dull heavy-headed Fellow? He is one of the
 worst of Pay-masters in the World, but the merriest, most sprightly
 Fellow I ever met with. Very well! said _Zadig_, let me be one of
 your Council when your Cause comes to be heard. In short, he
 summon'd the _Jew_ to attend the Court; where, when the Judge was
 sat, _Zadig_ open'd the Cause: Thou impartial Judge of this Court of
 Equity, I am come here, in behalf of my Master, to demand of the
 Defendant five hundred Ounces of Silver, which he refuses to pay,
 and would fain traverse the Debt. Have you, Friend, your Witnesses
 ready to prove the Loan, said the Judge? No, they are dead; but
 there is a large Stone still subsisting, on which the Money was
 deposited; and if your Excellence, will be pleas'd to order the
 Stone to be brought in Court, I don't doubt but the Evidence it will
 give, will be Proof sufficient of the Fact. I hope your Excellence
 will order, that the _Jew_ and myself shall be oblig'd to attend the
 Court, till the Stone comes, and I'll dispatch a special Messenger
 to fetch it, at my Master's Expence. Your Request is very
 reasonable, said the Judge. Do as you propose; and so call'd another
 Cause.
 
 When the Court was ready to break up, Well! said the Judge to
 _Zadig_, is your Stone come yet? The _Jew_, with a Sneer, replied,
 your Excellence may wait here till this Time To-morrow, before the
 Stone will appear in Court; for 'tis above six Mile off, and it will
 require fifteen Men to remove it from its Place. 'Tis well! replied
 _Zadig_. I told your Excellence that the Stone would be a very
 material Evidence. Since the Defendant can point out the Place where
 the Stone lies, he tacitly confesses, that it was upon that Stone
 the Money was deposited. The _Jew_ thus unexpectedly confuted, was
 soon oblig'd to acknowledge the Debt. The Judge order'd that the
 _Jew_ should be tied fast to the Stone, without Victuals or Drink,
 till he should advance the five hundred Ounces of Silver, which were
 soon paid accordingly, and the _Jew_ releas'd. The Slave _Zadig_,
 and this remarkable Stone-Witness, were in great Repute all over
 _Arabia_.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. X.
 
 _The_ FUNERAL PILE.
 
 
 _Setoc_, transported with his good Success, of a Slave made _Zadig_
 his Favourite Companion and Confident; he found him as necessary in
 the Conduct of his Affairs, as the King of _Babylon_ had before done
 in the Administration of his Government; and lucky it was for
 _Zadig_ that _Setoc_ had no Wife.
 
 He discover'd, that his Master was in his Temper benevolent,
 strictly honest, and a Man of good natural Parts. _Zadig_ was very
 much concern'd, that One of so much Sense should pay divine
 Adoration to a whole Host of created, tho' Celestial Beings, that is
 to say, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, according to the antient Custom of
 the _Arabians_. He talk'd, at first, to his Master, with great
 Precaution on so important a Topick. But at last told him, in direct
 Terms, that they were created Bodies, as others, tho' of less
 Lustre, and that there was no more Adoration due to them, than to a
 Stock or a Stone. But, said _Setoc_, they are eternal Beings to whom
 we are indebted for all the Blessings we enjoy; they animate Nature;
 they regulate the Seasons; they are, in a Word, at such an infinite
 Distance from us, that it would be downright impious not to adore
 them. You are more indebted, said _Zadig_, to the Waters of the Red
 Sea, which transport so many valuable Commodities into the _Indies_.
 Why, pray, may not they be deem'd as antient as the Stars? And if
 you are so fond of paying your Adoration on Account of their vast
 Distance; why don't you adore the Land of the _Gangarides_, which
 lies in the utmost Extremities of the Earth. No, said _Setoc_, there
 is something so surprisingly more brilliant in the Stars than what
 you speak of; that a Man must adore them whether he will or not.
 
 At the Close of the Evening, _Zadig_ planted a long Range of Candles
 in the Front of his Tent, where _Setoc_ and he were to sup that
 Night: And as soon as he perceiv'd his Patron to be at the Door, he
 fell prostrate on his Knees before the Wax-Lights. O ye everlasting,
 ever-shining Luminaries, be always propitious to your Votary, said
 _Zadig_. Having repeated these Words so loud as _Setoc_ might hear
 them, he sat down to Table, without taking the least Notice of
 _Setoc_. What! said _Setoc_, somewhat startled at his Conduct, art
 thou at thy Prayers before Supper? I act just as inconsistently,
 Sir, as you do; I worship these Candles; without reflecting on their
 Makers, or yourself, who are my most beneficent Patron.
 
 _Setoc_ took the Hint, and was conscious of the Reproof that was
 conceal'd so genteely under a Vail. The superior Wisdom of his Slave
 enlightned his Mind; and from that Hour he was less lavish than ever
 he had been, of his Incense to those created Beings, and for the
 future, paid his Adoration to the eternal God who made them.
 
 At that Time there was a most hideous Custom in high Repute all over
 _Arabia_, which came originally from _Scythia_; but having met with
 the Sanction of the bigotted Brachmans, threatn'd to spread its
 Infection all over the _East_. When a married Man happen'd to die,
 if his dearly beloved Widow ever expected to be esteem'd a Saint,
 she must throw herself headlong upon her Husband's Funeral-Pile.
 This was look'd upon as a solemn Festival, and was call'd the
 Widow's Sacrifice. That Tribe which could boast of the greatest
 Number of burnt-Widows, was look'd upon as the most meritorious. An
 _Arabian_, who was of the Tribe of _Setoc_, happen'd just at that
 Juncture, to be dead, and his Widow (_Almona_ by Name) who was a
 noted Devotee, publish'd the Day, nay, the Hour, that she propos'd
 to throw herself (according to Custom) on her deceased Husband's
 Funeral Pile, and be attended by a Concert of Drums and Trumpets.
 _Zadig_ remonstrated to _Setoc_, what a shocking Custom this was,
 and how directly repugnant to human Nature; by permitting young
 Widows, almost every Day, to become wilful Self-Murderers; when they
 might be of Service to their Country, either by the Addition of new
 Subjects, or by the Education of such as demanded their Maternal
 Indulgence. And, by arguing seriously with _Setoc_ for some Time, he
 forc'd from him at last, an ingenuous Confession, that the barbarous
 Custom then subsisting, ought, if possible, to be abolish'd. 'Tis
 now, replied _Setoc_, above a thousand Years since the Widows of
 _Arabia_ have been indulg'd with this Privilege of dying with their
 Husbands; and how shall any one dare to abrogate a Law that has been
 establish'd Time out of Mind? Is there any Thing more inviolable
 than even an antient Error? But, replied _Zadig_, Reason is of more
 antient Date than the Custom you plead for. Do you communicate these
 Sentiments to the Sovereigns of your Tribes, and in the mean while
 I'll go, and sound the Widow's Inclinations.
 
 Accordingly he paid her a Visit, and having insinuated himself into
 her Favour, by a few Compliments on her Beauty, after urging what a
 pity it was, that a young Widow, Mistress of so many Charms, should
 make away with herself for no other reason but to mingle her Ashes
 with a Husband that was dead; he, notwithstanding, applauded her for
 her heroic Constancy and Courage. I perceive, Madam, said he, you
 was excessively fond of your deceased Spouse. Not I truly, reply'd
 the young _Arabian_ Devotee. He was a Brute, infected with a
 groundless Jealousy of my Virtue; and, in short, a perfect Tyrant.
 But, notwithstanding all this, I am determin'd to comply with our
 Custom. Surely then, Madam, there's a Sort of secret Pleasure in
 being burnt alive. Alas! with a Sigh, cried _Almona_, 'tis a Shock
 indeed to Nature; but must be complied with for all that. I am a
 profess'd Devotee, and should I shew the least Reluctance, my
 Reputation would be lost for ever; all the World would laugh at me,
 should I not burn myself on this Occasion: _Zadig_ having forc'd her
 ingenuously to confess, that she parted with her Life more out of
 Regard to what the World would say of her, and out of Pride and
 Ostentation, than any real Love for the deceas'd, he talk'd to her
 for some considerable Time so rationally, and us'd so many
 prevailing Arguments with her to justify her due Regard for the Life
 which she was going to throw away, that she began to wave the
 Thought, and entertain a secret Affection for her friendly Monitor.
 Pray, Madam, tell me, said _Zadig_, how would you dispose of
 yourself, upon the Supposition, that you could shake off this vain
 and barbarous Notion? Why, said Dame, with an amorous Glance, I
 think verily I should accept of yourself for a second Bed-fellow.
 
 The Memory of _Astarte_ had made too strong an Impression on his
 Mind, to close with this warm Declaration: He took his leave,
 however, that Moment, and waited on the Chiefs. He communicated to
 them the Substance of their private Conversation, and prevailed with
 them to make it a Law for the future, that no Widow should be
 allow'd to fall a Victim to a deceased Husband, till after she had
 admitted some young Man to converse with her in private for a whole
 Hour together. The Law was pass'd accordingly, and not one Widow in
 all _Arabia_, from that Day to this, ever observ'd the Custom. 'Twas
 to _Zadig_ alone that the _Arabian_ Dames were indebted for the
 Abolition, in one Hour, of a Custom so very inhuman, that had been
 practis'd for such a Number of Ages. _Zadig_, therefore, with the
 strictest Justice, was look'd upon by all the Fair Sex in _Arabia_,
 as their most bountiful Benefactor.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XI.
 
 _The Evening's Entertainment._
 
 
 _Setoc_, who would never stir out without his Bosom-Friend (in whom
 alone, as he thought, all Wisdom center'd) resolv'd to take him with
 him to _Balzora_ Fair, whither the richest Merchants round the whole
 habitable Globe, us'd annually to resort. _Zadig_ was delighted to
 see such a Concourse of substantial Tradesmen from all Countries,
 assembled together in one Place. It appear'd to him, as if the whole
 Universe was but one large Family, and all happily met together at
 _Balzora_. On the second Day of the Fair, he sat down to Table with
 an _Egyptian_, an _Indian_, that liv'd on the Banks of the River
 _Ganges_, an Inhabitant of _Cathay_, a _Grecian_, a _Celt_, and
 several other Foreigners, who by their frequent Voyages towards the
 _Arabian_ Gulf, were so far conversant with the _Arabic_ Language,
 as to be able to discourse freely, and be mutually understood. The
 _Egyptian_ began to fly into a Passion; what a scandalous Place is
 this _Balzora_, said he, where they refuse to lend me a thousand
 Ounces of Gold, upon the best Security that can possibly be offer'd.
 Pray, said _Setoc_, what may the Commodity be that you would deposit
 as a Pledge for the Sum you mention. Why, the Corpse of my deceased
 Aunt, said he, who was one of the finest Women in all _Egypt_. She
 was my constant Companion; but unhappily died upon the Road. I have
 taken so much Care, that no Mummy whatever can equal it: And was I
 in my own Country, I could be furnish'd with what Sum soever I
 pleas'd, were I dispos'd to mortgage it. 'Tis a strange Thing that
 Nobody here will advance so small a Sum upon so valuable a
 Commodity. No sooner had he express'd his Resentment, but he was
 going to cut up a fine boil'd Pullet, in order to make a Meal on't,
 when an _Indian_ laid hold of his Hand, and with deep Concern, cried
 out, For God's Sake what are you about? Why, said the _Egyptian_, I
 design to make a Wing of this Fowl one Part of my Supper. Pray, good
 Sir, consider what you are doing, said the _Indian_. 'Tis very
 possible, that the Soul of the deceas'd Lady may have taken its
 Residence in that Fowl. And you wouldn't surely run the Risque of
 eating up your Aunt? To boil a Fowl is, doubtless, a most shameful
 Outrage  done  to Nature. Pshaw! What a Pother you make about the
 boiling of a Fowl, and flying in the Face of Nature, replied the
 _Egyptian_ in a Pet; tho' we _Egyptians_ pay divine Adoration to the
 Ox; yet we can make a hearty Meal of a Piece of roast Beef for all
 that. Is it possible, Sir, that your Country-men should act so
 absurdly, as to pay an Ox the Tribute of divine Worship, said the
 _Indian_? Absurd as you think it, said the other, the Ox has been
 the principal Object of Adoration all over _Egypt_, for these
 hundred and thirty five thousand Years, and the most abandon'd
 _Egyptian_ has never been as yet so impious as to gain-say it. Ay,
 Sir, an hundred thirty five thousand Years, say you, surely you must
 be out a little in your Calculation. 'Tis but about fourscore
 thousand Years, since _India_ was first inhabited. Sure I am, we are
 a more antient People than you are, and our _Brama_ prohibited the
 eating of Beef long before your Nation ever erected an Altar in
 Honour of the Ox, or ever put one upon a Spit. What a Racket you
 make about your _Brama_! Is he able to stand the least in
 Competition with our _Apis_, said the _Egyptian_? Let us hear, pray,
 what mighty Feats have been done by your boasted _Brama_? Why,
 replied the _Bramin_, he first taught his Votaries to write and
 read; and 'tis to him alone, all the World is indebted for the
 Invention of the noble Game of Chess. You are quite out, Sir, in
 your Notion, said a _Chaldean_, who sat within Hearing: All these
 invaluable Blessings were deriv'd from the Fish _Oannes_; and 'tis
 that alone to which the Tribute of divine Adoration is justly due.
 All the World will tell you, that 'twas a divine Being whose Tail
 was pure Gold, whose Head resembled that of a Man, tho' indeed the
 Features were much more beautiful; and that he condescended to visit
 the Earth three Hours every Day, for the Instruction of Mankind. He
 had a numerous Issue, as is very well known, and all of them were
 powerful Monarchs. I have a Picture of it at Home, to which, as in
 Duty I ought, I Say my Prayers at Night before I go to Bed, and
 every Morning that I rise. There is no Harm, Sir, as I can conceive,
 in partaking of a Piece of roast Beef; but, doubtless, 'tis a mortal
 Sin, a Crime of the blackest Dye, to touch a Piece of Fish. Besides,
 you cannot justly boast of so illustrious an Origin, and you are
 both of you mere Moderns, in Comparison to us _Chaldeans_, You
 _Egyptians_ lay claim to no more than 135,000 Years, and you
 _Indians_, but of 80,000. Whereas we have Almanacks that are dated
 4000 Centuries backwards. Take my Word for it; I speak nothing but
 Truth; renounce your Errors, and I'll make each of you a Present of
 a fine Portrait of our _Oannes_.
 
 A Native of _Cambalu_, entring into the Debate, said, I have a very
 great Veneration, not only for the _Egyptians_, _Chaldeans_,
 _Greeks_, and _Celtae_; but for _Brama_, _Apis_, and the _Oannes_,
 but in my humble Opinion, the *_Li_, or as 'tis by some call'd,
 the *_Tien_, is an Object more deserving of divine Adoration than
 any Ox, or Fish, how much soever you may boast of their respective
 Perfections. All I shall say, in regard to my native Country, 'tis
 of much greater Extent, than all _Egypt_, _Chaldea_, and the
 _Indies_ put together. I shall lay no Stress on the Antiquity of my
 Country; for I imagine 'tis of much greater Importance to be the
 happiest People, than the most antient under the Sun. However, since
 you were talking of the Almanacks, I must beg the Liberty to tell
 you, that ours are look'd upon to be the best all over _Asia_; and
 that we had several very correct ones before the Art of Arithmetick
 was ever heard of in _Chaldea_.
 
     * _The_ Chinese _Term_, Li, _signifies, properly
       speaking, natural Light, or Reason; and_ Tien, _the
       Heavens, or the supreme Being._
 
 You are all of you a Parcel of illiterate, ignorant Bigots, cry'd a
 _Grecian_: 'Tis plain, you know nothing of the Chaos, and that the
 World, as it now stands, is owing wholly to _Matter_ and _Form_. The
 _Greek_ ran on for a considerable Time; but was at last interrupted
 by a _Celt_, who having drank deep, during the whole Time of this
 Debate, thought himself ten Times wiser than any of his Antagonists;
 and wrapping out a great Oath, insisted, that all their Gods were
 nothing, if set in Competition with the _Teutath_ or the Misletoe on
 the Oak. As for my part, said he, I carry some of it always in my
 Pocket: As to my Ancestors, they were _Scythians_, and the only Men
 worth talking of in the whole World: 'Tis true, indeed, they would
 now and then make a Meal of their Country-men, but that ought not to
 be urg'd as any Objection to his Country; and, in short, if any one
 of you, or all of you, shall dare to say any thing disrespectful of
 _Teutath_, I'll defend its Cause to the last Drop of my Blood. The
 Quarrel grew warmer and warmer, and _Setoc_ expected that the Table
 would be overset, and that Blood-shed would ensue. _Zadig_, who
 hadn't once open'd his Lips during the whole Controversy, at last
 rose up, and address'd himself to the _Celt_, in the first Place, as
 being the most noisy and outrageous. Sir, said he, Your Notions in
 this Affair are very just: Good Sir, oblige me with a Bit of your
 Misletoe. Then turning about, he expatiated on the Eloquence of the
 _Grecian_, and in a Word, soften'd in the most artful Manner all the
 contending Parties. He said but little indeed to the _Cathayian_;
 because he was more cool, and sedate than any of the others. To
 conclude, he address'd them all in general Terms, to this or the
 like Effect: My dear Friends, You have been contesting all this
 while about an important Topick, in which 'tis evident, you are all
 unanimously agreed. Agreed, quotha! they all cried, in an angry
 Tone, How so, pray? Why said he to the hot, testy _Celt_, is it not
 true, that you do not in effect adore this Misletoe, but that Being
 who created that Misletoe and the Oak, to which it is so closely
 united? Doubtless, Sir, reply'd the _Celt_. And you, Sir, said he,
 to the _Egyptian_, You revere, thro' your venerable _Apis_, the
 great Author of every Ox's Being. We do so, said the _Egyptian_. The
 mighty _Oannes_, tho' the Sovereign of the Sea, continued he, must
 give Precedence to that Power, who made both the Sea, and every Fish
 that dwells therein. We allow it, said the _Chaldean_. The _Indian_,
 adds he, and the _Cathayan_, acknowledge one supreme Being, or first
 Cause, as well as you. As to what that profound worthy Gentleman the
 _Grecian_ has advanc'd, is, I must own, a little above my weak
 Comprehension, but I am fully persuaded, that he will allow there is
 a supreme Being on whom his favourite Matter and Form are entirely
 dependent. The _Grecian_, who was look'd upon as a Sage amongst
 them, said, with Abundance of Gravity, that _Zadig_, had made a very
 just Construction of his Meaning. Now, Gentlemen, I appeal to you
 all, said _Zadig_, whether you are not unanimous to a Man, in the
 Debate upon the Carpet, and whether there are any just Grounds for
 the least Divisions or Animosities amongst you. The whole Company,
 cool at once, caress'd him; and _Setoc_, after he had sold off all
 his Goods and Merchandize at a round Price, took his Friend _Zadig_
 Home with him to the Land of _Horeb_. _Zadig_, upon his first
 Arrival was inform'd, that a Prosecution had been carried on against
 him during his Absence, and that the Sentence pronounc'd against him
 was, that he should be burnt alive before a slow Fire.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XII.
 
 _The_ RENDEZVOUS.
 
 
 Whilst _Zadig_ attended his Friend _Setoc_ to _Balzora_, the Priests
 of the Stars were determin'd to punish him. As all the costly
 Jewels, and other valuable Decorations, in which every young Widow
 that sacrificed her self on her Husband's Funeral-pile, were their
 customary Fees, 'tis no great Wonder, indeed, that they were
 inclin'd to burn poor _Zadig_, for playing them such a scurvy Trick.
 _Zadig_ therefore, was accus'd of holding heretical and damnable
 Tenets, in regard to the Celestial Host: They depos'd, and swore
 point-blank, that he had been heard to aver, that the Stars never
 sat in the Sea. This horrid blasphemous Declaration thunder-struck
 all the Judges, and they were ready to rend their Mantles at the
 Sound of such an impious Assertion; and they would have made
 _Zadig_, had he been a Man of Substance, paid very severely for his
 heretical Notions. But in the Height of their Pity and Compassion
 for even such an Infidel, they would lay no Fine upon him; but
 content themselves with seeing him roasted alive before a slow Fire.
 _Setoc_, tho' without Hopes of Success, us'd all the Interest he had
 to save his bosom Friend from so shocking a Death; but they turn'd a
 deaf Ear to all his Remonstrances, and oblig'd him to hold his
 Tongue. The young Widow _Almona_, who by this Time was not only
 reconcil'd to living a little longer, but had some Taste for the
 Pleasures of Life, and knew that she was entirely indebted to
 _Zadig_ for it, resolv'd, if possible, to free her Benefactor from
 being burnt, as he had before convinc'd her of the Folly of it in
 her Case. She ponder'd upon this weighty Affair very seriously; but
 said nothing to any one whomsoever. _Zadig_ was to be executed the
 next Day; and she had only a few Hours left to carry her Project
 into Execution. Now the Reader shall hear with how much Benevolence
 and Discretion this amiable Widow behav'd on this emergent Occasion.
 
 In the first Place, she made use of the most costly Perfumes; and
 drest herself to the utmost Advantage to render her Charms as
 conspicuous as possible; And thus gaily attir'd, demanded a private
 Audience of the High Priest of the Stars. Upon her first Admittance
 into his august and venerable Presence, she address'd herself in the
 following Terms. O thou first-born and well-beloved Son of the Great
 Bear, Brother of the Bull, and first Cousin to the Dog, (these you
 must know were the Pontiff's high Titles) I come to confess myself
 before you: My Conscience is my Accuser, and I am terribly afraid I
 have been guilty of a mortal Sin, by declining the stated Custom of
 burning my self on my Husband's Funeral-pile? What could tempt me,
 in short, to a Prolongation of my Life, I can't imagine, I, who am
 grown a perfect Skeleton, all wrinkled and deform'd. She paus'd, and
 pulling off, with a negligent but artful Air, her long silk Gloves;
 She display'd a soft, plump, naked Arm, and white as Snow: You see,
 Sir, said she, that all my Charms are blasted. Blasted, Madam, said
 the luscious Pontiff; No! Your Charms are still resistless: His
 Eyes, and his Mouth, with which he kiss'd her Hand, confirm'd their
 Power: Such an Arm, Madam, by the Great _Orasmades_, I never saw
 before. Alas! said the Widow, with a modest Blush; my Arm Sir, 'tis
 probable, may have the Advantage of any hidden Part; but see, good
 Father, what a Neck is here; as yellow as Saffron, an Object not
 worth regarding. Then she display'd such a snowy, panting Bosom,
 that Nature could not mend it. A Rose-Bud on an Ivory Apple, would,
 if set in Competition with her spotless Whiteness, make no better
 Appearance than common Madder upon a Shrub; and the whitest Wool,
 just out of the Laver, were she but by, would seem but of a
 light-brown Hue.
 
 Her Neck, her large black, sparkling Eyes, that languishingly
 roll'd, and seem'd as 'twere, on Fire; her lovely Cheeks, glowing
 with White and Red, her Nose, that was not unlike the Tower of Mount
 _Lebanon_, her Lips, which were like two Borders of Coral, inclosing
 two Rows of the best Pearls in the _Arabian_ Sea; such a
 Combination, I say, of Charms, made the old Pontiff judge she was
 scarce twenty Years of Age; and in a kind of Flutter, to make her a
 Declaration of his tender Regard for her. _Almona_, perceiving him
 enamour'd, begg'd his Interest in Favour of _Zadig_. Alas! my dear
 Charmer, my Interest alone, when you request the Favour, would be
 but a poor Compliment; I'll take care his Acquittance shall be
 signed by three more of my Brother Priests. Do you sign first,
 however, said _Almona_. With all my Soul, said the amorous Pontiff,
 provided----you'll be kind, my dearest. You do me too much Honour,
 said _Almona_; but should you give your self the Trouble to pay me a
 Visit after Sunset, and as soon as the Star _Sheat_ twinkles on the
 Horizon, you shall find me, most venerable Father, repos'd upon a
 rosy-colour'd silver Sopha, where you shall use your Pleasure with
 your humble Servant. With that she made him a low Courtesy; took up
 _Zadig's_ general Release as soon as duely sign'd, and left the old
 Doatard all over Love, tho' somewhat diffident of his own Abilities.
 The Residue of the Day he spent in his Bagnio; he drank large
 enlivening Draughts of a Water distill'd from the Cinnamon of
 _Ceilan_, and the costly Spices of _Tidor_ and _Ternate_, and waited
 with the utmost Impatience for the up-rising of the brilliant
 _Sheat_.
 
 In the mean time _Almona_ went to the second Pontiff. He assur'd her
 that the Sun, Moon, and all the starry Host of Heav'n, were but
 languid Fires to her bright Eyes. He put the Question to her, in
 short, at once, and agreed to sign upon her Compliance. She suffer'd
 herself to be over-persuaded, and made an Assignation to meet him at
 a certain Place, as soon as the Star _Algenib_ should make its
 Appearance. From him she repair'd to the third and fourth Pontiff,
 taking care, wherever she went, to see _Zadig's_ Acquittance duely
 sign'd, and made fresh Appointments at the Rising of Star after
 Star.
 
 When she had carried her Point thus far, she sent a proper Message
 to the Judges of the Court, who had condemn'd _Zadig_, requesting
 that they would come to her House, that she might advise with them
 upon an Affair of the last Importance. They waited on her
 accordingly; she produc'd _Zadig's_ Discharge duly sign'd by four
 several Hands, and told them the Definitive Treaty between all the
 contracting Parties. Each of the pontifical Gallants observ'd their
 Summons to a Moment. Each was startled at the Sight of his Rival;
 but perfectly thunderstruck to see the Judges, before whom the Widow
 had laid open her Case. _Zadig_ procur'd an absolute Pardon, and
 _Setoc_ was so charm'd with the artful Address of _Almona_, that he
 married her the next Day. _Zadig_ went afterwards to throw himself
 at the Feet of his fair Benefactress. _Setoc_ and he took their
 Leave of each other with Tears in their Eyes, and vowing that an
 eternal mutual Friendship should be preserv'd between them; and, in
 short, should Fortune at any Time afterwards prove more propitious
 than could well be expected to either Party; the other should
 partake of an equal Share of his Success.
 
 _Zadig_ steer'd his Course towards _Syria_; forever pondering on the
 hard Fate of the justly-admir'd _Astarte_, and reflecting on his own
 Stars that so obstinately darted down their malignant Rays, and
 continu'd daily to torment him. What, said he! to pay four hundred
 Ounces of Gold for only seeing a Bitch pass by me; to be condemn'd
 to be beheaded for four witless Verses in Praise of the King; to be
 strangled to Death, because a Queen was pleas'd to look upon me; to
 be made a Prisoner, and sold as a Slave for saving a young Lady from
 being sorely abus'd by a Brute rather than a Man; and to be upon the
 Brink of being roasted alive, for no other Offence than saving for
 the future all the Widows in _Arabia_ from becoming idle
 Burnt-Offerings, and mingling their Ashes with those of their
 deceased worthless Husbands.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XIII.
 
 _The_ FREE-BOOTER.
 
 
 _Zadig_, arriving at the Frontiers which separate _Arabia Petraea_
 from _Syria_, and passing by a very strong Castle, several arm'd
 _Arabians_ rush'd out upon him, and surrounding him, cried out:
 Whatever you have belonging to you is our Property, but as for your
 Person, that is entirely at our Sovereign's Disposal. _Zadig_,
 instead of making any Reply, drew his Sword, and as his Attendant
 was a very couragious Fellow, he drew likewise. Those who laid hold
 on them, first fell a Sacrifice to their Fury: Their Numbers
 redoubled: Yet still, Both dauntless, determin'd to conquer or to
 die. When two Men defend themselves against a whole Gang, the
 Contest, doubtless, cannot last long. The Master of the Castle, one
 _Arbogad_ by Name, having been an Eye-Witness from his Window, of
 the Intrepidity and surprising Exploits of _Zadig_, took a Fancy to
 him. He ran down therefore in Haste, and giving Orders himself to
 his Vassals to desist, deliver'd the two Travellers out of their
 Hands. Whatever Goods or Chattels, said he, come upon my
 Territories, are my Effects; and whatever I find likewise that is
 valuable upon the Premises of others, is my free Booty; but, as you
 appear, Sir, to me to be a Gentleman of uncommon Courage, you shall
 prove an Exception to my general Rule. Upon this, he invited _Zadig_
 into his magnificent Mansion, giving his inferior Officers strict
 Orders to use him with all due Respect; and at Night _Arbogad_ was
 desirous of supping with _Zadig_. The Lord of the Mansion was one of
 those _Arabians_, that are call'd _Free-booters_; but a Man who now
 and then did good Actions amongst a Thousand bad ones. He plunder'd
 without Mercy; but was liberal in his Benefactions. When in Action,
 intrepid; but in Traffick, easy enough; a perfect _Epicure_ in his
 Eating and Drinking, an absolute _Debauchee_, but very frank and
 open. _Zadig_ pleas'd him extremely; his Conversation being very
 lively, prolong'd their Repast: At last, _Arbogad_ said to him; I
 would advise you, Sir, to enlist yourself in my Troop; you cannot
 possibly do a better Thing: My Profession is none of the worst; and
 in Time, you may become perhaps as great a Man as myself. May I
 presume, Sir, to ask you one Question; how long may you have
 follow'd this honourable Calling? From my Youth upwards, replied his
 Host, I was only a _Valet_ at first to an _Arabian_, who indeed was
 courteous enough; but Servitude was a State of Life I could not
 brook. It made me stark-mad to see, in a wide World, which ought to
 be divided fairly between Mankind, that Fate had reserv'd for me so
 scanty a Portion. I communicated my Grievance to an old Sage
 _Arabian_. Son, said he, never despair; once upon a Time, there was
 a Grain of Sand, that bemoan'd itself, as being nothing more than a
 worthless _Atom_ of the Deserts. At the Expiration, however, of a
 few Years, it became that inestimable Diamond, which at this very
 Hour, is the richest, and most admir'd Ornament of the _Indian_
 Crown. The old Man's Discourse fir'd me with some Ambition; I was
 conscious to myself that I was at that Time the _Atom_ he mention'd,
 but was determin'd, if possible, to become the _Diamond_. At my
 first setting out, I stole two Horses; then I got into a Gang; where
 we play'd at small Game, and stopp'd the small Caravans; thus I
 gradually lessen'd the wide Disproportion, which there was at first
 between me and the rest of Mankind: I enjoy'd not only my full Share
 of the good Things of this Life, but enjoy'd them with Usury. I was
 look'd upon as a Man of Consequence, and I procur'd this Castle by
 my military Atchievements. The _Satrap_ of _Syria_ had Thoughts of
 dispossessing me; but I was then too rich to be any Ways afraid of
 him; I gave the _Satrap_ a certain Sum of Money, upon Condition that
 I kept quiet Possession of my Castle. And, moreover, I aggrandiz'd
 my Domains; for he constituted me, at the same Time, Treasurer of
 the Imports that _Arabia Petraea_ paid to the King of Kings. I
 executed my Trust, in every Respect, as I ought, in the Capacity of
 a Collector; but I never did, nor never intended to balance my
 Accounts.
 
 The grand _Desterham_ of _Babylon_ sent hither, in the Name of the
 King _Moabdar_, a petty _Satrap_, with a Commission to strangle me.
 He and his Attendants arriv'd here with his Royal Warrant. I was
 appriz'd of the whole Affair, and, accordingly, order'd his whole
 Retinue, consisting of four inferior Officers, to be strangled
 before his Face, after the same Manner as was intended for my
 Execution. After this, I ask'd him what he thought the Commission
 with which he was entrusted, might reasonably be valued at; he
 answer'd, that he presum'd his Premium (had he succeeded) might have
 amounted to about three Hundred Pieces of Gold. I made him sensible,
 that it would be for his Interest to be a commission'd Officer under
 me; I made him accordingly Deputy _Free-booter_. He is at this very
 Day not only the best Officer, but the richest I have in all my
 Court. If my Word may be credited, I'll raise your Fortune as I have
 done his. Never was Trade brisker in our Way; for _Moabdar_, is
 knock'd on the Head, and all _Babylon_ in the utmost Confusion.
 _Moabdar_ kill'd, said you! cry'd _Zadig_, and pray, Sir, what is
 become of his Royal Consort, _Astarte_? I know nothing at all of
 that Affair, replied _Arbogad_, all that I have to say, is, that
 _Moabdar_ became a perfect Madman, and had his Brains beat out; that
 all the People in _Babylon_ are cutting one another's Throats, and
 that the whole Empire is laid waste; that there is still an
 Opportunity for making several bold Pushes; and let me tell you,
 Sir, I have done my Part, and made the most on't. But the Queen,
 Sir, said _Zadig_; pray favour me so far, as to inform me, if you
 know any Thing of the Queen. I have heard great Talk, said he, of a
 certain Prince of _Hyrcania_; 'tis very possible, she may have
 listed herself amongst his Concubines, if she had the good Fortune
 to escape the Resentment of those popular Tumults; but my Head, Sir,
 is better turn'd for the Highway than for News; I have taken several
 Ladies Prisoners in the Course of my Excursions; I keep none of them
 for my Part; and as to such as are handsomer than ordinary, I make
 the best Market I can of them, without enquiring who they are. Their
 Quality or Titles will fetch no Price at all; a Queen, if she be
 homely, is worth nothing. 'Tis probable, Sir, I have dispos'd of the
 Lady myself; and 'tis possible, likewise, she may be dead; 'tis no
 Concern of mine; and to my thinking, it should be an Affair of no
 Manner of Importance to you. After this Declaration, he drank so
 hard, and confounded his Ideas in such a Manner, that _Zadig_ was
 not one whit the wiser. Upon which he was struck dumb, confounded,
 and stood as motionless as a Statue. _Arbogad_, in the mean while,
 swill'd down whole Bumpers, told a Hundred merry Tales, and swore a
 thousand Times over, that he was the happiest Creature upon God's
 Earth; persuading _Zadig_ to be as merry, and thoughtless as
 himself. At last, being gradually overcome by the Fumes of his
 Liquor, he fell fast asleep. _Zadig_ spent the Remainder of the
 Night in deep Contemplation, and in all the Uneasiness of Mind
 imaginable. What, said he, the King first became crazy, and then was
 murder'd. I think I have just Grounds for Complaint. The whole
 Empire is in Confusion, and torn to Pieces, and this Free-booter is
 as happy as a King. O Fortune! O Fate! a Highwayman as happy as a
 Monarch! and the most amiable Creature that Nature ever fram'd has
 suffer'd perhaps, an ignominious Death, or perhaps, is in a State of
 Life a thousand Times worse than Death itself! O _Astarte! Astarte!_
 What art thou become?
 
 As soon as it was Break of Day he went out, and ask'd every one he
 saw if they knew any Thing of her: But the whole Gang were too
 intent upon other Matters, to return him any Answer. By Virtue of
 their Night's Excursions, they had brought in some fresh Booty, and
 were busy in dividing the Spoil. All the Favour he could procure, in
 their Hurry and Tumult, was, to go away without the least
 Examination. He took the Advantage of their Remissness, and mov'd
 off the Premises, but more overwhelm'd with Grief and deep
 Reflection than ever.
 
 _Zadig_, in his March, was very restless and uneasy. His Thoughts
 were forever rolling on the unfortunate _Astarte_, the King of
 _Babylon_, his Bosom-Friend _Cador_, the happy _Free-booter_,
 _Arbogad_, the fair _Coquet_, that was taken Prisoner on the
 Confines of _Egypt_, by the _Babylonish_ Courier; in a Word, on the
 various Scenes of Misfortunes and Disappointments, which he had
 successively met with.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XIV.
 
 _The_ FISHERMAN.
 
 
 When _Zadig_ had travelled some few Leagues from _Arbogad's_ Castle,
 he found himself arriv'd at the Banks of a little River; incessantly
 deploring, as he went along, his unhappy Fate, and looking upon
 himself as the very Picture of ill Luck. He perceiv'd at a little
 Distance a Fisherman, reclin'd on a verdant Bank by the River-side,
 trembling, scarce able to hold his Net in his Hand, (which he seem'd
 but little to regard) and with uplift Eyes, imploring Heaven's
 Assistance. I am, doubtless, said the poor Fisherman, the most
 unhappy Wretch that ever liv'd! No Merchant in all _Babylon_, it is
 very well known, was ever so noted for selling Cream-Cheeses as
 myself; and yet I am ruin'd to all Intents and Purposes. No Man of
 my Profession ever had a handsomer, more compleat Housewife, than my
 Dame was; but I have been treacherously depriv'd of her. I had still
 left a poor, pitiful Cottage, but that I saw plunder'd and
 destroy'd. I am cubb'd up here in a Cell; I have nothing to depend
 upon but my Fishery, and not one single Fish have I caught. Thou
 unfortunate Net! I'll never throw thee into the Water more: Much
 sooner will I throw myself in. No sooner were the Words out of his
 Mouth, but he started up, and ran to the River-side, like one that
 was resolutely bent to plunge in, and get rid of a miserable Life at
 once. Is it possible, said _Zadig_? Is there then the Man in Being
 more wretched than myself? His Benevolence, and good Will to save
 the poor Man's Life, was as quick as the Reflection he had just
 made! He ran to his Assistance; he laid hold of him; and ask'd him,
 with an Air of Pity and Concern, the Cause of his rash Intention.
 'Tis an old saying, that a Person is less unhappy when he sees
 himself not singular in Misfortune. But if we will credit
 _Zoroaster_, this is not from a Principle of Malignity, but the
 Effect of a fatal Necessity. He was attracted, as it were, to any
 Person in Distress, as being One in the same unhappy Circumstances.
 The Transport of a happy Man, would be a Kind of Insult; but two
 Persons in bad Circumstances, are like two weak Shrubs, which, by
 propping up each other, are fenc'd against a Storm. Why are you thus
 cast down, said _Zadig_ to the Fisherman? Never sink Man, under the
 Weight of your Burden. I can't help it, said the poor Fisherman; I
 have not the least Prospect of Redress. I was once, Sir, the tip-top
 Man of the whole Village of _Derlbach_, near _Babylon_, where I
 liv'd, and with the Help of my Wife, made the best Cream-Cheeses
 that were ever eaten in the _Persian_ Empire. Her Majesty, the Queen
 _Astarte_, and the famous Prime-Minister _Zadig_ were very fond of
 them. I serv'd the Court with about six Hundred of them, I went the
 other Day in Hopes of being paid; but before I had well got into the
 Suburbs of _Babylon_, I was inform'd, that not only the Queen, but
 _Zadig_ too had privately left the Court: Whereupon I ran directly
 to _Zadig's_ House, tho' I never sat Eye on the Man in all my Life.
 There I found the Court-Marshals of the grand _Desterham_,
 plundering, by Virtue of his Majesty's Mandate, all his Effects, in
 the most loyal Manner. From thence I made the best of my Way to the
 Queen's Kitchin; where, applying my self to the Steward of her
 Household, and his inferior Officers; one of them told me she was
 dead; another, that she was confin'd in Prison; a third, indeed,
 said that she had made her Escape by Flight; all in general,
 however, assur'd me for my Comfort, that my Cheeses would never be
 paid for. From thence I went, with my Wife in my Hand, to Lord
 _Orcan's_; who was another of my Court-Customers; of whom we begg'd
 for Shelter and Protection: The Favour, I confess, was readily
 granted to my Wife; but as for my own Part, I was absolutely
 rejected. She was fairer, Sir, than the fairest Cheese I ever sold;
 from whence I date all my Misfortunes; and the red that adorn'd her
 blushing Cheeks was ten Times more lively than any _Tyrian_ Scarlet.
 And between you and I, Sir, that was the main Cause of my Wife's
 Reception, and my Disgrace. Whereupon I wrote a doleful Letter to my
 Wife, in all the Agonies of one in the deepest Despair: 'Tis very
 well, said she, to the Messenger; I have some little Knowledge of
 the Man; I have heard say no one sells better Cream-Cheeses than he
 does; desire him, next Time he comes, to bring a small Parcel with
 him, and let him know, I'll take care he shall be punctually paid.
 
 In the Height of my Misfortunes, I determin'd to seek Redress in a
 Court of Equity: I had but six Ounces of Gold left: Two whereof went
 for a Fee to my Counsellor; two to my Lawyer, who took my Cause in
 Hand, and the other two to the Judge's Clerk. Notwithstanding what I
 had done, my Cause was not so much as commenc'd; and I had already
 disburs'd more Money than all my Cheeses and my Wife with them were
 worth. I return'd therefore to my Native Habitation, with a full
 Resolution to sell it for the Ransom of my Wife.
 
 My little Cot, with the Appurtenances, were worth about threescore
 Ounces of Gold: But as the Purchasers found I was necessitous, and
 drove to my last Shifts; the first whom I apply'd to, offer'd me
 thirty Ounces; the second, twenty; and the third, but ten: Just as I
 had come to Terms of Accommodation with one of them, the Prince of
 _Hyrcania_ came to _Babylon_, and swept all before him. My little
 Cottage, with all its Furniture, was first plunder'd of all that was
 valuable, and at last reduc'd to Ashes.
 
 Having thus lost my Money, my Wife, and my House, I withdrew to this
 Desart, where you see me. I have since endeavour'd to get my Bread
 by Fishing; but the Fish, as well as all Mankind, desert me. I
 scarce catch one in a Day; I am half starv'd; and had it not been
 for your unexpected Benevolence and Generosity, I had been at the
 Bottom of the River before this.
 
 This long Detail of Particulars, however, was not deliver'd without
 several Interruptions; for, said _Zadig_, with Abundance of Warmth
 and Confusion, Have you never heard, Sir, of what is become of the
 Queen _Astarte_? No Sir, not I, said the disconsolate Fisherman; but
 this I know, to my Sorrow, that neither the Queen, nor _Zadig_, ever
 paid me the least Consideration in the World for my Cream Cheeses;
 that my dear Spouse is taken from me; and that I am drove to the
 very Brink of Despair. I am verily persuaded, said _Zadig_, that you
 will not lose all your Money. I have heard much talk of that same
 _Zadig_; they say he is very honest, and that if ever he returns to
 _Babylon_, as 'tis to be hop'd he will, he'll discharge his Debts
 with Interest, like a Man of Honour. But, as for your Wife, who
 appears to me, to be no better than a Wag-tail, never take the
 Trouble, if you'll take my Advice, to hunt after her any more. Be
 rul'd, and make the best of your Way to _Babylon_. I shall be there
 before you, as I shall ride, and you will be on Foot. Make your
 Applications to the illustrious _Cador_; tell him you met his Friend
 upon the Road; and stay there still I come. Observe my Orders, and
 'tis very probable it may turn out to your Advantage.
 
 O puissant _Orosmades_, continu'd he, you have made me, 'tis true,
 an Instrument of Comfort to this poor Man; but what Friend will you
 raise for me, to alleviate my Sorrows? Having utter'd this short
 Expostulation, he gave the distrest Fisherman one full Moiety of all
 the Money he brought with him out of _Arabia_. The Fisherman,
 thunder-struck, and transported with Joy at so unexpected a
 Benefaction, kiss'd the Feet of _Cador's_ Friend, and cried out,
 sure you are a Messenger of Heaven, sent down to be my Saviour!
 
 In the mean Time, _Zadig_ every now and then ask'd him Questions,
 and wept as he ask'd them. What! Sir, said the Fisherman, can you,
 who are so bountiful a Benefactor, be in Distress yourself? Alas!
 said he, Friend, I am a hundred Times more unhappy than thou art.
 But pray, Sir, said the good Man, how can it possibly be, that he,
 who is so lavish of his Favours, should be overwhelm'd with greater
 Misfortunes than the Man he so generously relieves? Your greatest
 Uneasiness, said he, arose from the Narrowness of your Circumstances;
 but mine proceeds from an internal, and much deeper Cause. Pray, Sir,
 said the Fisherman, has _Orcan_ robb'd you of your Wife? This
 Interrogatory put _Zadig_ in a Moment upon a Retrospection of all his
 past Adventures. He recollected the whole Series of his Misfortunes;
 commencing from that of the Eunuch and the Huntsman, to his Arrival
 at the Free-booter's Castle. Alas! said he, to the Fisherman,
 _Orcan_, 'tis true, deserves severely to be punish'd: But for the
 Generality, we find, such worthless Barbarians are the Favourites of
 Fortune. Be that, however, as it will, go as I bade you, to my Friend
 _Cador_, and wait there till I come. They took their Leave; the
 Fisherman blessing his propitious Stars, and _Zadig_ cursing, every
 Step he went, the Hour he was born.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XV.
 
 _The_ BASILISK.
 
 
 As _Zadig_ was traversing a verdant Meadow, he perceiv'd several
 young Female _Syrians_, intent on searching for something very
 curious, that lay conceal'd, as they imagin'd, in the Grass. He took
 the Freedom to approach one of them, and ask her, in the most
 courteous Manner, if he might have the Honour to assist her in her
 Researches. Have a care, said she. What we are hunting after, Sir,
 is an Animal, that will not suffer itself to be touch'd by a Man.
 'Tis somewhat surprizing, said _Zadig_. May I be so bold, pray, as
 to ask you what you are in Pursuit after, that shuns the Touch of
 any Thing but the Hands of the Fair Sex. 'Tis, Sir, said she, the
 _Basilisk_: A _Basilisk_, Madam, said he! And pray, if you will be
 so good as to inform me, with what View, are you searching after a
 Creature so very difficult to be met with? 'Tis, Sir, said she, for
 our Lord and Master _Ogul_, whose Castle, you see, situate on the
 River-side, at the Bottom of the Meadow. We are all his Vassals.
 _Ogul_, you must know, is in a very bad State of Health, and his
 first Physician has order'd him, as a Specific, to eat a _Basilisk_,
 boil'd in Rose water: And as that Animal is very hard to be catch'd,
 and will suffer nothing to approach it, but one of our Sex, our
 dying Sovereign _Ogul_ has promis'd to honour her, that shall be so
 happy as to catch it for him, so far as to make her his Consort. The
 Case, being thus circumstantiated, Sir, I hope you will not
 interrupt me any longer, lest my Rivals here in the Field should
 happen to circumvent me.
 
 _Zadig_ withdrew, and left the _Syrian_ Ladies in Quest of their
 imaginary Booty, in order to pursue his intended Journey. But as he
 came to the Banks of a Rivulet, at the remotest part of the Meadow,
 he perceiv'd another young Lady, reclin'd on the Grass, and entirely
 disengag'd. Her Stature seem'd majestic, but her Face was cover'd
 with a Vail; and her Eyes were fixt, as one at her Looking-glass, on
 the River. Every now and then a Sigh burst out, as if her Heart were
 breaking. In her Hand she held a little Wand or Rod, with which she
 was tracing out some Characters on the dry Sand, that lay between
 the flow'ry Bank she sat on, and the purling Current. _Zadig's_
 Curiosity induc'd him, unperceiv'd, to observe her Operations at
 some Distance. But approaching nearer, and perceiving very
 distinctly the first Character to be an _Z_. the next an _A_. and
 the third a _D_. he started; but when he saw the additional Capitals
 of _I_ and _G_. his Astonishment was too great for Words to express.
 He stood for some Time perfectly thunder-struck, and as motionless
 as a Statue; At last, in a soft, faultring Tone, he broke Silence: O
 generous Lady, said he, forgive a Stranger, one overwhelm'd with
 Sorrows like yourself, if he asks you, by what amazing Accident he
 finds the Name of _Zadig_ delineated by so angelick a Hand. Thus
 unexpectedly interrupted, and at the Sound of those Words, she
 turn'd her Head; and with a trembling Hand, lifting up her Vail, she
 espy'd _Zadig_ himself. Upon which, she shriek'd; and as her Heart
 was flutter'd between the two Extreams of Transport and Surprize,
 she fainted away, and gently dropp'd into his Arms. 'Twas, it seems
 _Astarte_ her self; 'twas the Queen of _Babylon_; 'twas the very
 _Goddess_ whom _Zadig_ ador'd; 'twas, in short, the very identical
 Lady, whose hard Fate he had so long deplor'd; and for whose sake he
 had felt so many agonizing Pains. For a few Minutes he stood
 speechless, and depriv'd, as it were, of all his senses, whilst his
 Eyes were fixt on his _Astarte_, who began to revive; and cast a
 wishful Glance at him, attended with some Confusion. O ye immortal
 Powers, cried he, who preside over the Destiny of us frail Mortals!
 Ye have restor'd me my _Astarte_; but alas! at what a Conjuncture,
 in what a Place, and in what a State and Condition do I view her? He
 threw himself prostrate on the Ground, and kiss'd the Dust of her
 Feet. The Queen of _Babylon_ rais'd him up, and oblig'd him to sit
 by her on the flow'ry Bank whereon she was repos'd. Every now and
 then she wip'd her Eyes, as the Tears trickl'd down afresh her
 lovely Cheeks. Twenty times she endeavour'd to renew her Discourse;
 but was interrupted by her Sighs; she ask'd him over and over to
 relate to her the Hardships he had ran thro' since their parting,
 and by what Chance he came to traverse that solitary Meadow; but
 prevented him at the same Time from returning any Answer, by
 repeating Question upon Question. At last, she gave him a particular
 Detail of her own Misfortunes, and again requested to know his. Both
 of them, in short, having, in some Measure, appeas'd the Tumult of
 their Souls; _Zadig_, in a few Words, inform'd her of the Motives
 that brought him thither.
 
 But tell me, O unfortunate, tho' ever-venerable Queen, how I came to
 find you out, reclining on this verdant Bank, dress'd in this
 servile Habit, accompanied by other Female Slaves, who, I find, have
 been all Day long in Quest after a _Basilisk_, which, as I
 understand, is by Order of a celebrated Physician, to be dissolv'd
 in Rose-water, as a specific Medicine for his dying Patient.
 
 Whilst they busy in their fruitless Search, said the beauteous
 _Astarte_, I'll tell you the whole Series of Sorrows which I have
 undergone since last we parted; and since Heav'n has thus
 unexpectedly blest my Eyes once more with the Sight of my dear
 _Zadig_, I'll no longer exclaim against my impropitious Stars.
 
 You are not insensible, that the jealous King my Spouse, was
 disgusted to find you the most amiable of all Mortals, and that for
 no other Reason he determin'd to strangle you, and poison me. You
 know very well too, that indulgent Heav'n inspir'd, as it were, my
 little Dwarf, with artful Means to give me timely Notice of the rash
 Resolutions of the King, my cruel Husband.
 
 No sooner had the faithful _Cador_ oblig'd you to obey my Orders, and
 to fly the Court, but he ventur'd to enter my Apartment in the Dead
 of Night thro' a private Door. He snatch'd me up, and convey'd me
 directly into the Temple of _Orosmades_, where the holy _Magus_, who
 was his Brother, lock'd me up in that august and awful Statue, that
 stands erect upon the Pavement of the Temple, and _Colossus_-like,
 touches the lofty Ceiling with his Head. There I lay conceal'd, or
 rather buried for some Time; tho' taken all imaginable Care of, and
 furnish'd with all the Necessaries of Life by that venerable, and
 loyal Priest. In the mean Time, his Apothecary enter'd at Break of
 Day into my Apartment, with a Potion in his Hand, compos'd of Opium,
 black Hellebore, Aconite, and other Ingredients still more baneful.
 Whilst this mercenary Officer of the King's Vengeance was thus
 employ'd, another as inhuman as himself, went to your Lodgings with
 the silken Cord. Both, however, were disappointed, as both of us
 were fled. _Cador_, very officious, flew to the King, in order the
 more artfully to blind him; and in a feign'd Passion, rail'd at us
 both, and charg'd us both as perfidious Traitors. As for that
 Villain _Zadig_, said he, he has taken his Flight towards _India_;
 and your false, ungrateful Consort, Sire, said he, is fled to
 _Memphis_. The Guards were order'd that Moment to pursue us both.
 
 The Couriers, who flew after me, knew nothing of me. I had never
 expos'd my Face unveil'd to any one but your self, and that too in
 the Presence, and by the express Order of my Royal Master. As they
 had no other Marks to distinguish me from others but my Stature, as
 it had been describ'd, a young Lady, just of my Size, but in all
 Probability much more handsome, presented herself to their View, on
 the Frontiers of _Egypt_. She was found alone, and in a very
 disconsolate Condition. This Lady must, doubtless, said they to
 themselves, be the Queen of _Babylon_: And without listning to her
 Complaints, convey'd her instantly to my Husband _Moabdar_. Their
 gross Blunder at first incens'd his Majesty to the last Degree; but
 after he had view'd the Lady with an attentive Eye, he found she was
 extremely pretty, and was soon pacify'd. Her Name was _Missouf_. I
 have been since inform'd, that her Name in the _Egyptian_ Language
 signifies the _Fair Coquet_. And in Effect, she was so: She had as
 much Art, however, as Caprice. For she pleas'd the King of Kings: In
 short, she had such an Ascendancy over him, that he didn't scruple
 in publick to own her as his Wife. When she had secur'd him thus far
 in her Toils, she never conceal'd her Power, but play'd the Part of
 a perfect Humourist. She indulg'd herself in every Whim that came in
 her Head, without Fear of being brow-beat. In the first Place, She
 insisted that the Chief Magus, who was old and gouty, should dance a
 Saraband before her; and upon his modest Refusal to comply with so
 preposterous a Request, she persecuted him without Mercy: Nothing
 would serve her Turn, in the next Place, but his Majesty's grand
 Master of the Horse must make her a Minc'd-pye. The Gentleman took
 the Liberty to let her know, that he was no profess'd Cook; a Tart,
 however, he must make for her, and she got him turn'd out of his
 Place for being so monstrously careless, as to burn one _Corner_ of
 the Crust. Whereupon she gave his Post to her favourite Dwarf, and
 made her Fop of a Page the Keeper of his Majesty's great Seal, and
 Confidence. Thus she reign'd arbitrary, and was the Female Tyrant of
 _Babylon_. All the World deplor'd the Loss of me their former Queen.
 The King, who never acted the Part of a Tyrant, till the Moment he
 would have imprison'd me, and strangled you, seem'd to have drown'd
 all his good Qualities in his Dotage on that capricious Enchantress.
 He came to the Temple on the solemn Festival of the sacred Fire. I
 saw him prostrate on the Pavement before the Statue, wherein I was
 enclos'd, imploring the Gods to show'r down their choicest Blessings
 on his beauteous _Missouf_. I, with an audible and distinct, but
 hollow Tone, address'd my self thus, like an Oracle, to the King of
 Kings. _The Gods reject the Vows of a Monarch, that acts the Tyrant
 o'er his Subjects; One, who could think of murdering an innocent
 Wife; and admit of a worthless Beauty to supply her Place._
 _Moabdar_ was so startled at this unexpected Answer from the God he
 ador'd, that he was just at the Point of Distraction. The Oracle
 that I had deliver'd, and the tyrannical Proceedings of his new
 Spouse _Missouf_, were enough to deprive him of his Senses. In
 short, in a few Days he became a perfect Mad-man. Her Caprice, which
 seem'd a Judgement from above, portended a sudden Revolution. His
 Subjects accordingly revolted, and were instantly up in Arms.
 _Babylon_, that had so long indulg'd herself in Indolence and Ease,
 became the Seat, or Theatre of a bloody Civil War. Whereupon I was
 taken from my magnificent Prison, the Bowels of his God, and set up
 at the Head of a very powerful Party. Your Friend _Cador_ flew to
 _Memphis_ in hopes to find you there, and bring you back to
 _Babylon_. The Prince of _Hyrcania_, hearing of these intestine
 Broils, return'd with a powerful Army, in order to form a third
 Party, among the _Babylonians_. He attack'd the King, who fled with
 his fair, but fickle _Egyptian_ before him. _Moabdar_, however, was
 so closely pursu'd, that he dy'd of the Wounds he receiv'd in his
 Retreat. _Missouf_ became the fair Victim of the Conqueror. As for
 my own Part, I had the Misfortune to be over-power'd likewise, and
 taken Prisoner by an _Hyrcanian Party_, who brought me into the
 Presence of the young Prince, at the very Juncture when _Missouf_
 stood before him. You'll smile, doubtless, when I tell you the
 Prince look'd upon me as the most amiable Captive of the two; but
 then, I presume you will be sorry to hear, that my hard Fate doom'd
 me to be a Vassal in his Seraglio. He told me, in direct Terms, that
 as soon as he had put an happy Issue to one Military Expedition,
 which would not, he flatter'd himself, be long unexecuted, he would
 honour me with a Visit. Judge the dreadful Apprehensions I was
 under, upon his making such a peremptory Declaration. My Obligations
 to _Moabdar_ were all cancell'd, and I was free to be the Bride of
 _Zadig_; but instead of that, I fell into the Toils of a
 _Barbarian_. I answer'd him with all the Resentment becoming one of
 my high Character and unspotted Virtue. I had always heard say, that
 Heav'n bestow'd on Persons of my Rank, such a peculiar Mark of
 Majesty and Grandeur, that with a bare Word, or the Glance of an
 angry Eye, they could bring down, and abase the Pride of those
 audacious Creatures that durst to thwart their Inclinations. I
 talk'd as big as a Queen; but I was treated like the most servile
 Domestic. The saucy _Hyrcanian_, without so much as vouchsafing me
 one Single Word, turn'd to his black Eunuch, and told him that I was
 very impertinent; but yet he could not help thinking I was very
 pretty. He gave him therefore particular Orders to take care of me,
 and put me under the same Regimen, with respect to my Diet, as one
 of his Favourites, in order that I might recover my Colour, which
 was somewhat too languid; in a Word, that I might become worthy in a
 little Time of his Royal Favours, and be duely qualified to receive
 him, when he should honour me so far as to fix the Day. I told him,
 I would die first: He replied, with a Sneer, that young Ladies, like
 me, seldom kill'd themselves, and that they were made for Enjoyment;
 and then turn'd upon his Heel, with as careless an Air, as a Man
 would part with his Paroquet, when he had shut her up close in her
 gilded Cage. What a shocking State was I in for the first Queen of
 the Universe! Nay, I'll say more, for a Heart that was wholly
 devoted to her _Zadig_!
 
 At these endearing Words, _Zadig_ threw himself at her Feet, and
 bath'd them with his Tears. _Astarte_ immediately rais'd him in the
 most courteous and engaging Manner, and thus continu'd her
 Narration.--I too plainly perceiv'd, that I was subject to the
 Tyranny of a _Barbarian_, and the Rival of a Coquet, that was a
 Slave like myself. She related to me all her past Adventures in
 _Egypt_. From the Description she gave of her Gallant, the Time and
 Place, the Dromedary he was mounted on, and from every other minute
 Circumstance, I imagin'd it was your self that play'd the Hero in
 her Favour. As I made no Doubt but that you resided somewhere in
 _Memphis_, I determin'd to go thither my self, but in Disguise.
 Beauteous _Missouf_, said I, you are of a much sprightlier
 Disposition than I am; you will be able to amuse the gay young
 Prince of _Hyrcania_ a thousand Times better than I shall. Find out
 some Way therefore for my Escape; by which you will be sole Lady
 Regent. You will oblige me to the last Degree, by your friendly
 Assistance, and at the same Time get rid of a Rival. _Missouf_,
 (cajol'd with the Hint) came into my Measures directly. She took
 care to send me packing forthwith, with no other Attendant than an
 old _Egyptian_ Slave.
 
 No sooner had I reach'd the Borders of _Arabia_, but a notorious
 Free-booter, (one _Arbogad_ by Name) pick'd me up, as I was
 strolling along, and sold me to some Merchants, who convey'd me to
 yonder Castle, the magnificent Residence of the Emir _Ogul_. He
 purchas'd me at all Adventures, without enquiring what, or who I
 was. He is a perfect Debauchee; his sole Delight lies in good
 Eating, Wine, and Women; and is one, who imagines, that the Almighty
 sent him into the World for no other Purpose but to gratify his
 unruly Appetites. He is excessively fat, and puffs and blows every
 Moment, like one half choak'd. When he has gorg'd himself so
 unmercifully that he is ready to burst, his chief Physician can
 persuade him to take any Thing for his Relief; tho' he laughs at
 him, and despises his Advice when he's well and sober. He has
 intimated to him, that at present his Life's in Danger, and nothing
 will restore him but a _Basilisk_, boil'd in Rose-Water. Whereupon
 the grand _Ogul_ has promis'd his last Favours to that Slave,
 whoever she be, that shall be so fortunate as to catch a _Basilisk_,
 for him, since it seems they are so seldom to be met with. You see I
 have others to struggle for the Honour propos'd, and I never had a
 less Inclination to find out this _Basilisk_ than at present, since
 I have once more met with my dearest _Zadig_.
 
 After this Declaration, _Astarte_ and _Zadig_ renew'd with Warmth
 the virtuous Affection which they had long conceiv'd for each other;
 and reciprocally utter'd all the tenderest Expressions that Love in
 Distress could possibly devise. And the _Genii_, who preside over
 all the soft Passions, wafted their mutual Vows of eternal Constancy
 and Truth to the Sphere of _Venus_.
 
 The whole Train of Slaves, after a long fruitless Search, attended
 on _Ogul_, to inform him that all their strictest Search was
 fruitless. _Zadig_ desired that he might have the Honour to be
 introduc'd into his Presence. Accordingly he was, and his Address
 was to this or the like Effect. May immortal Health descend from
 Heaven to preserve a Life, Sir, so precious as yours is. I am a
 Physician by Profession. I flew to your Palace, on the first News of
 the dangerous Situation you were in, and have brought a _Basilisk_
 with me, distill'd in Rose-Water. I can have no Hopes of the Honour
 of your Bed, in Case I succeed in my Application: All the Favour I
 request, is, the Release of one of your _Babylonish_ Slaves, who has
 been in your Highness's Retinue for some Time. And I am willing to
 be your Bond-slave in her Stead, if I fail of restoring the most
 illustrious and magnificent _Ogul_ to his pristine State of Health.
 
 The Proposition was readily embrac'd. _Astarte_ was instantly
 discharg'd, and set out for _Babylon_, with a proper Attendant,
 according to _Zadig's_ Direction; assuring her that she should hear
 every Day, by a special Courier, of his Proceedings with his new
 Patient. The Farewel which they took of each other, was very
 affectionate and tender, expressive of the strongest Obligations to
 each other. The Moments of Meeting, and those of Parting, are (as it
 is written in the sacred Book of _Zend_) the two most remarkable
 _Epochas_ of a Lover's Life. _Zadig's_ repeated Protestations of
 Affection for the Queen were perfectly sincere, and the pure
 Dictates of his Heart; and the Queen's Love for _Zadig_ had made a
 deeper Impression on hers, than she thought proper to discover.
 
 In the mean Time, _Zadig_, again addressing himself to _Ogul_, said;
 my _Basilisk_, Sir, as others are, is not to be drest or eaten; but
 all its Virtues must penetrate your whole Fabrick, thro' your Pores;
 I have inclos'd my never-failing _Sudorific_ in a Bladder,
 full-blown and carefully cover'd with the softest Leather. You must
 kick this Bladder, Sir, once a Day about your Hall for a whole Hour
 together, with all the Vigour and Activity you possibly can. This
 Medicine must be repeated every Morning, and I'll attend the
 Operation: Upon your due Observance of the Regimen I shall put you
 under, I doubt not, but with the Blessing of Heav'n on my honest
 Endeavours, I shall give you ample Demonstration of my being an
 Adept in Physick. _Ogul_, upon making the first Experiment, was
 ready to expire for want of Breath, and thought he should die with
 the Fatigue. The second Day did not prove altogether so irksome, and
 he slept much better at Night than he had done before. In short, our
 Doctor in about eight Days Time, perform'd an absolute Cure. His
 Patient was as brisk, active and gay, as One in the Bloom of his
 Youth.
 
 Now, Sir, said _Zadig_, I'll be ingenuous with you, and disclose to
 you the important Secret. You have play'd at Foot-ball these eight
 Days successively; and you have liv'd all that Time, within the
 Bounds of Sobriety and Moderation. Know, Sir, that there is no such
 Animal in Nature as a _Basilisk_; that Health is to be secur'd by
 Temperance and Exercise; and that the Art of making Health
 consistent with Luxury, is altogether as impracticable, and an Art,
 in all Respects, as idle and chimerical, as those of the
 Philosopher's Stone, judicial Astrology, or any other Reveries of
 the like airy and fantastic Nature.
 
 _Ogul's_ Head-Physician, apprehensive that this unexpected Cure,
 thus wrought by a Stranger, through such an Anti-medicinal
 Preparation, might possibly not only render himself the Object of
 Contempt in the Eye of his great Master, but cast a Kind of Slur in
 general on his whole Fraternity, conven'd a Set of petty Doctors and
 Apothecaries, who were his Vassals, and entirely devoted to his
 Interest, to find out some sure Ways and Means to cut off in private
 his dreadful Rival; but whilst their wicked Plot was hatching,
 _Zadig_ receiv'd a Courier from the Queen _Astarte_.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XVI.
 
 _The_ TOURNAMENTS.
 
 
 The Queen was receiv'd at _Babylon_ with all the Transports of Joy
 that could possibly be express'd for the safe Return of so
 illustrious and so beautiful a Personage, that had run thro' such a
 long Series of Misfortunes. _Babylon_ at that Time seem'd to be
 perfectly serene and quiet. As for the young Prince of _Hyrcania_,
 he was slain in Battle. The _Babylonians_, who were the Victors,
 declar'd that _Astarte_ should marry that Candidate for the Crown,
 who should gain it by a fair and impartial Election. They were
 determin'd, that the most valuable Post of Honour in the World,
 namely, that of being the Royal Consort of _Astarte_, and the
 Sovereign of _Babylon_, should be the Result of Merit only; and not
 be procur'd by any Party-Factions or Court-Intrigues. A solemn Oath
 was voluntarily taken by all Parties, that he who should distinguish
 himself by his superior Valour and Wisdom, should unanimously be
 acknowledg'd the Sovereign-Elect.
 
 A spacious _List_, or _Circus_, was pitched upon, surrounded with
 commodious Seats, erected in an Amphitheatrical Manner, and richly
 embellish'd some few Leagues from the City. Thither the Combatants,
 or Champions were to repair, compleatly accoutred. Each of them had
 a distinct Apartment to himself behind the _Lists_, where no Soul
 could either see them, or know who they were. They were to enter the
 _Lists_ four several Times. Those who were so happy as to conquer
 four Competitors, were afterwards to engage each other in single
 Combat; in order that he who should remain Master of the Field
 should be proclaim'd the happy Victor.
 
 Four Days afterwards, they were to meet again, accoutred as before,
 and to explain all such _AEnigmas_, or _Riddles_, as the _Magi_
 should think proper to propose. If their Queries should prove too
 intricate and perplext for them to resolve, they were to have
 Recourse to the _Lists_ again, and after that, to fresh _AEnigmas_,
 before they could be entitled to the Election: So that the
 _Tournaments_ were to be continu'd till One of the Candidates should
 be twice a Victor, and shine as conspicuous, with respect to his
 internal Qualities, as to his Dexterity and Address in heroic
 Atchievements. The Queen, in the mean Time, was to be narrowly
 watch'd, and allow'd only to be a Spectator of both their
 Amusements, at some considerable Distance; and moreover, to be
 cover'd with a Vail: Nor was she indulg'd so far as to speak one
 single Word to any Candidate whomsoever, in order to prevent the
 least Jealousy or Suspicion either of Partiality or Injustice.
 
 _Astarte_ took care, by the Courier, to inform her Lover of all the
 Preliminary Articles abovemention'd, not doubting but that he would
 exert both his Courage and Understanding for her Sake, beyond any of
 the other Competitors.
 
 _Zadig_ accordingly set out for _Babylon_, and besought the Goddess
 _Venus_, not only to fortify his Courage, but to illuminate his Mind
 with Wisdom on this important Occasion.
 
 The Night before these martial Atchievements were to commence,
 _Zadig_ arrived upon the Banks of the _Euphrates_. He inscrib'd his
 Device amongst the List of Combatants; concealing, at the same Time,
 both his Person and Name, as the Laws of the Election required; and
 accordingly, withdrew to the Apartment that was provided for him,
 according to his Lot.
 
 _Cador_, who was just return'd to _Babylon_, having hunted all
 _Egypt_ over to no Purpose, in Hopes to find his Friend _Zadig_,
 brought a compleat set of Armour into his Lodge, by express Orders
 from the Queen: She sent him likewise One of the finest Horses in
 all _Persia_. _Zadig_ knew that these Presents could come from
 No-body but his dear _Astarte_, which redoubled his Vigour and his
 Hopes.
 
 The next Morning the Queen being seated under a Canopy of State,
 enrich'd with precious Stones; and the Amphitheatres being crowded
 with Gentlemen and Ladies of all Ranks and Conditions from
 _Babylon_; the Competitors made their personal Appearance in the
 _Circus_: Each of them went up to the grand _Magus_, and laid down
 his particular _Device_ at his Feet. The _Devices_ were drawn by
 Lot: That of _Zadig_ was the last. The first that advanc'd was a
 Grandee, one _Itabod_ by Name, immensely rich, indeed, and very
 haughty; but no ways couragious; exceedingly awkward, and a Man of
 no acquir'd Parts. The Sycophants that hover'd round about him
 flatter'd him, that a Man of his Merit couldn't fail of being King:
 He imperiously replied, One of my Merit must be King: Whereupon he
 was arm'd _Cap-a-pee_. His Armour was made of pure Gold, enamell'd
 with Green. The Housings of his Saddle were green, and his Lance
 embellish'd with green Ribbands. Every One was sensible, at first
 Sight, by _Itobad's_ Manner of managing his Horse, that he was not
 the Man whom Heav'n had pitch'd upon to sway the _Babylonish_
 Scepter. The first Combatant that tilted with him, threw him out of
 the Saddle; the second flung him quite over the Crupper, and laid
 him sprawling on the Ground, with his Heels quiv'ring in the Air.
 _Itobad_, 'tis true, remounted, but with so ill a Grace, that an
 universal Laugh went round the Amphitheatre. The third, disdaining
 to use his Lance, made only a Feint at him: Then catch'd hold of his
 Right Leg, and whirling him round, threw him flat upon the Sand. The
 Esquires, who were the Attendants, ran to his Assistance, and with a
 Sneer remounted him. The fourth Combatant catch'd hold of his Left
 Leg, and unhors'd him again. He was convey'd thro' the hissing
 Multitude to his Lodge, where, according to the Law in that Case
 provided, he was to pass the Night. And as he hobbled along, said
 he, to the Esquires, what a sad Misfortune is this to One of my
 Birth and Character!
 
 The other Champions play'd their Parts much better; and all came off
 with Credit. Some conquer'd two of their Antagonists, and others
 were so far successful as to get the better of three. None of them,
 however, except Prince _Hottam_, vanquish'd four. _Zadig_, at last,
 enter'd the Lists, and dismounted all his four Opponents, one after
 the other, with the utmost Ease, and with such an Air and Grace, as
 gain'd him universal Applause. As the Case stood thus, _Zadig_ and
 _Hottam_ were to close the Day's Entertainment in a single Combat.
 The Armour of the latter was of a blue Colour mixt with Gold, and
 the Housings of his Saddle were of the same. Those of the former
 white as Snow. The Multitude were divided in their Wishes. The
 Knight in blue was the Favourite of some of the Ladies; and others
 again were Admirers of the Cavalier in white. The Queen, whose Heart
 was in a perfect Palpitation, put up her secret Prayers to _Venus_
 to assist her darling Hero.
 
 The two Champions making their Passes and their Volta's, with the
 utmost Dexterity and Address, and keeping firm in their Saddles,
 gave each other such Rebuffs with their Lances, that all the
 Spectators (the Queen only excepted) wish'd for two Kings of
 _Babylon_. At last, their Horses being tired, and both their Lances
 broke, _Zadig_ made use of the following Stratagem, which his
 Antagonist wasn't any ways appriz'd of. He got artfully behind him,
 and shooting with a Spring on his Horses Buttocks, grasp'd him
 close, threw him headlong on the Sand, then jump'd into his Seat,
 and wheel'd round Prince _Hottam_, while he lay sprawling on the
 Ground. All the Spectators in general, with loud Acclamations, cried
 out, Victory! Victory! in favour of the Champion in white. _Hottam_,
 incens'd to the last Degree, got up, and drew his Sword. _Zadig_
 sprang from his Horse with his Sabre in his Hand. Now, behold the
 two Chieftains upon their Legs, commencing a new Trial of Skill!
 where they seem'd to get the better of each other alternately; for
 both were strong, and both were active. The Feathers of their
 Helmets, the Studs of their Bracelets, their Coats of Mail, flew
 about in Pieces, thro' the dry Blows which they a thousand Times
 repeated. They struck at each other sometimes with the Edge of their
 Swords, at other Times they push'd, as Occasion offer'd: Now on the
 Right, then on the Left; now on the Head, then at the Breast; they
 retreated; they advanc'd; they kept at a Distance; they clos'd
 again; they grasp'd each other, turning and twisting like two
 Serpents, and engag'd each other as fiercely as two _Libyan_ Lions
 fighting for their Prey: Their Swords struck Fire almost at every
 Blow. At last, _Zadig_, in order to recover his Breath, for a Moment
 or two stood still, and afterwards, making a Feint at the Prince,
 threw him on his Back, and disarm'd him. _Hottam_, thereupon, cried
 out, O thou Knight of the white Armour! 'Tis you only are destin'd
 to be the King of _Babylon_. The Queen was perfectly transported.
 The two Champions were reconducted to their separate Lodges, as the
 others had been before them, in Conformity to the Laws prescrib'd.
 Several Mutes were order'd to wait on the Champions, and carry them
 some proper Refreshment. We'll leave the Reader to judge whether the
 Queen's Dwarf was not appointed to wait on _Zadig_ on this happy
 Occasion. After Supper the Mutes withdrew, and left the Combatants
 to rest their wearied Limbs till the next Morning; at which Time the
 Victor was to produce his _Device_, before the _Grand Magus_, in
 order to confer Notes, and discover the Hero whoever he might be.
 
 _Zadig_ slept very sound, notwithstanding his amorous Regard for the
 Queen, being perfectly fatigu'd. _Itabod_, who lay in the Lodge
 contiguous to his, could not once close his Eyes for Vexation. He
 got up therefore in the Dead of the Night, stole imperceptibly into
 _Zadig's_ Apartment, took his white Armour and Device away with him,
 and substituted his green One in its Place.
 
 As soon as the Day began to dawn, he repair'd, with a seemingly
 undaunted Courage, to the _Grand Magus_, to inform him, that he was
 the mighty Hero, the happy Victor. Without the least Hesitation, he
 gain'd his Point, and was proclaim'd Victor before _Zadig_ was
 awake. _Astarte_, astonish'd at this unexpected Disappointment,
 return'd with a Heart overwhelm'd with Despair, to the Court of
 _Babylon_. Almost all the Spectators were mov'd off from the
 Amphitheatre before _Zadig_ wak'd: He hunted for his Arms; but could
 find nothing but those in green. He was oblig'd, tho' sorely against
 his Will, to put it on, having nothing else in his Lodge to appear
 in: Confounded, and big with Resentment, he drest himself, and made
 his personal Appearance in that despicable Equipage. The Populace
 that were left behind in the _Circus_, hiss'd him every Step he
 took, they made a Ring about him, and treated him with all the Marks
 of Ignominy and Contempt. The most cowardly Wretch breathing was
 never sure so sweated, or hunted down as poor _Zadig_! He grew quite
 out of Patience at last, and cut his Way thro' the insulting Mob,
 with his Rival's Sabre; but he did not know what Measures to pursue,
 or how to rectify so gross a Mistake. It was not in his Power to
 have a Sight of the Queen; he could never recover the white Armour
 again which She had sent him; That was the Compromise, or the
 Engagement, to which the Combatants had all unanimously agreed:
 Thus, as he was on the one Hand, plung'd in an Abyss of Sorrow; so
 on the other, he was almost drove distracted with Vexation and
 Resentment. He withdrew therefore, in a solitary Mood, to the Banks
 of the _Euphrates_, now fully persuaded, that his impropitious Star
 had shed its most baleful Influence on him, and that his Misfortunes
 were irretrievable, revolving in his Mind, all his Disappointments
 from his first Adventure with the Court-Coquet, who had entertain'd
 an utter Aversion to a blind Eye, down to his late Loss of his white
 Armour. See! said he, the fatal Consequence of being a Sluggard! Had
 I been more vigilant, I had been King of _Babylon_; but what is
 more, I had been happy in the Embraces of my dearest _Astarte_. All
 the Knowledge of Books or Mankind; all the personal Valour that I
 can boast of, has only prov'd an Aggravation of my Sorrows. He
 carried the Point so far at last, as to murmur at the unequal
 Dispensations of Divine Providence; and was tempted to believe, that
 all Occurrences were govern'd by a malignant Destiny, which never
 fail'd to oppress the Virtuous, and always crown'd the Actions of
 such Villains as the green Knight, with uncommon Success. In one of
 his frantick Fits, he put on the green Armour, that had created him
 such a World of Disgrace. A Merchant happening to pass by, he sold
 it to him for a Trifle, and took in Exchange nothing more than a
 Mantle, and a Cap. In this Disguise, he took a solitary Walk along
 the Banks of the _Euphrates_, every Minute reflecting in his Mind on
 the partial Proceedings of Providence, which never ceas'd to torment
 him.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XVII.
 
 _The_ HERMIT.
 
 
 As _Zadig_ was travelling along, he met with a Hermit, whose grey
 and venerable Beard descended to his Girdle. He had in his Hand a
 little Book, on which his Eyes were fix'd. _Zadig_ threw himself in
 his Way, and made him a profound Bow. The Hermit return'd the
 Compliment with such an Air of Majesty and Benevolence, that
 _Zadig's_ Curiosity prompted him to converse with so agreeable a
 Stranger. Pray, Sir, said he, what may be the Contents of the
 Treatise you are reading with such Attention. 'Tis call'd, said the
 Hermit, the _Book of Fate_; will you please to look at it. He put
 the Book into the Hands of _Zadig_, who, tho' he was a perfect
 Master of several Languages, couldn't decypher one single Character.
 This rais'd his Curiosity still higher. You seem dejected, said the
 good Father to him. Alas! I have Cause enough, said _Zadig_. If
 you'll permit me to accompany you, said the old Hermit, perhaps I
 may be of some Service to you. I have sometimes instill'd Sentiments
 of Consolation into the Minds of the Afflicted. _Zadig_ had a secret
 Regard for the Air of the old Man, for his Beard, and his Book. He
 found, by conversing with him, that he was the most learned Person
 he had ever met with. The Hermit harangu'd on Destiny, Justice,
 Morality, the sovereign Good, the Frailty of Nature; on Virtue and
 Vice, in such a lively Manner, and in such a Flow of Words, that
 _Zadig_ was attach'd to him by an invincible Charm. He begg'd
 earnestly that he would favour him with his Company to _Babylon_.
 That Favour I was going to ask my self, said the old Man. Swear to
 me by _Orosmades_, that you won't leave me, for some Days at least,
 let me do what I please. _Zadig_ took the Oath requir'd, and both
 pursu'd their Journey.
 
 The two Travellers arriv'd that Evening at a superb Castle. The
 Hermit begg'd for an hospitable Reception of himself and his young
 Comrade. The Porter, whom any One might have taken for some Grandee,
 let them in, but with a kind of Coldness and Contempt. However, he
 conducted them to the Head-Steward, who went with them thro' every
 rich Apartment of his Master's House. They were seated at Supper
 afterwards at the lower End, indeed, of the Table, and where they
 were taken little or no Notice of by the Host; but they were serv'd
 with as much Delicacy and Profusion, as any of the other Guests.
 When they arose from Table, they wash'd their Hands in a Golden
 Bason set with Emeralds, and other costly Stones. When 'twas Time to
 go to Rest, they were conducted into a Bed-chamber richly furnish'd;
 and the next Morning two Pieces of Gold were presented to him for
 their mutual Service, by a Valet in waiting; and then they were
 dismiss'd.
 
 The Proprietor of this Castle, said _Zadig_, as they were upon the
 Road, seems to me to be a very hospitable Gentleman; tho' somewhat
 too haughty indeed, and too imperious: The Words were no sooner out
 of his Mouth, but he perceiv'd that the Pocket of his Comrade's
 Garment, tho' very large, was swell'd, and greatly extended: He soon
 saw what was the Cause, and that he had clandestinely brought off
 the Golden Laver. He durst not immediately take Notice of the Fact;
 but was ready to sink at the very Thoughts on't. About Noon, the
 Hermit rapp'd at a petty Cottage with his Staff, the beggarly
 Residence of an old, rich Miser. He desir'd that he and his
 Companion might refresh themselves there for a few Hours. An old,
 shabby Domestick let them in indeed, but with visible Reluctance,
 and carried them into the Stable, where all their Fare was a few
 musty Olives, and a Draught or two of sower small Beer. The Hermit
 seem'd as content with his Repast, as he was the Night before. At
 last, rising off from his Seat, he paid his Compliments to the old
 Valet (who had as watchful an Eye over them all the Time, as if they
 had been a Brace of Thieves, and intimated every now and then that
 he fear'd they would be benighted) and gave him the two Pieces of
 Gold, he had but just receiv'd that Morning, as a Token of his
 Gratitude for his courteous Entertainment. He added moreover, I
 would willingly speak one Word with your Master before I go. The
 Valet, thunder-struck at his unexpected Gratuity, comply'd with his
 Request: Most hospitable Sir, said the Hermit, I couldn't go away
 without returning you my grateful Acknowledgments for the friendly
 Reception we have met with this Afternoon. Be pleas'd to accept this
 Golden Bason as a small Token of my Gratitude and Esteem. The Miser
 started, and was ready to fall down backwards at the Sight of so
 valuable a Present. The Hermit gave him no Time to recover out of
 his Surprise, but march'd off that Moment with his young Comrade.
 Father, said _Zadig_, What is all this that I have seen? You seem to
 me to act in a quite different Manner from the Generality of
 Mankind. You plunder One, who entertain'd you with all the Pomp and
 Profusion in the World, to enrich a covetous, sordid Wretch, who
 treated you in the most unworthy Manner. Son, said the old Man, that
 Grandee, who receives Visits of Strangers, with no other View than
 to gratify his Pride, and to raise their Astonishment at the
 Furniture of his Palace, will henceforward learn to be wiser; and
 the Miser to be more liberal for the Time to come. Don't be
 surpris'd, but follow me. _Zadig_ was at a stand at present; and
 couldn't well determine whether his Companion was a Man of greater
 Wisdom than ordinary, or a Mad-man. But the Hermit assum'd such an
 Ascendency over him, exclusive of the Oath he had taken, that he
 couldn't tell how to leave him. At Night they came to a House very
 commodiously built, but neat and plain; where nothing was wanting,
 and yet nothing profuse. The Master was a Philosopher, that had
 retir'd from the busy World, in order to live in Peace, and form his
 Mind to Virtue. He was pleas'd to build this little Box for the
 Reception of Strangers, in a handsome Manner, but without
 Ostentation. He came in Person to meet them at the Door, and for a
 Time, advis'd them to sit down and rest themselves in a commodious
 Apartment. After some Respite, he invited them to a frugal, yet
 elegant Repast; during which, he talk'd very intelligently about the
 late Revolutions in _Babylon_. He seem'd entirely to be in the
 Queen's Interest, and heartily wish'd that _Zadig_ had entred the
 Lists for the regal Prize: But _Babylon_, said he, don't deserve a
 King of so much Merit. A modest Blush appear'd in _Zadig's_ Face at
 this unexpected Compliment, which innocently aggravated his
 Misfortunes. It was agreed, on all Hands, that the Affairs of this
 World took sometimes a quite different Turn from what the wisest
 Patriots would wish them. The Hermit replied, the Ways of Providence
 are often very intricate and obscure, and Men were much to blame for
 casting Reflections on the Conduct of the Whole, upon the bare
 Inspection of the minutest Part.
 
 The next Topick they entred upon was the Passions. Alas! said
 _Zadig_, how fatal in their Consequences! However, said the Hermit,
 they are the Winds that swell the Sail of the Vessel. Sometimes,
 'tis true, they overset it; but there is no such Thing as sailing
 without them. Phlegm, indeed, makes Men peevish and sick; but then
 there is no living without it. Tho' every Thing here below is
 dangerous, yet All are necessary.
 
 In the next Place, their Discourse turn'd on sensual Pleasures; and
 the Hermit demonstrated, that they were the Gifts of Heaven; for,
 said he, Man cannot bestow either Sensations or Ideas on himself; he
 receives them all; his Pain and Pleasure, as well as his Being,
 proceed from a superior Cause.
 
 _Zadig_ stood astonish'd, to think how a Man that had committed such
 vile Actions, could argue so well on such Moral Topicks. At the
 proper Hour, after an Entertainment, not only instructive, but ev'ry
 way agreeable, their Host conducted them to their Bed-chamber,
 thanking Heaven for directing two such polite and virtuous Strangers
 to his House. He offer'd them at the same Time some Silver, to
 defray their Expences on the Road; but with such an Air of Respect
 and Benevolence, that 'twas impossible to give the least Disgust.
 The Hermit, however, refus'd it, and took his leave, as he propos'd
 to set forward for _Babylon_ by Break of Day. Their Parting was very
 affectionate and friendly; _Zadig_, in particular, express'd a more
 than common Regard for a Man of so amiable a Behaviour. When the
 Hermit and he were alone, and preparing for Bed, they talk'd long in
 Praise of their new Host. As soon as Day-light appear'd, the old
 Hermit wak'd his young Comrade. 'Tis Time to be gone, said he; but
 as all the House are fast asleep, I'll leave a Token behind me of my
 Respect and Affection for the Master of it. No sooner were the Words
 out of his Mouth, but he struck a Light, kindled a Torch, and set
 the Building in a Flame: _Zadig_, in the utmost Confusion, shriek'd
 out, and would, if possible, have prevented him from being guilty of
 such a monstrous Act of Ingratitude. The Hermit dragg'd him away, by
 a superior Force. The House was soon in a Blaze: When they had got
 at a convenient Distance, the Hermit, with an amazing Sedateness,
 turn'd back and survey'd the destructive Flames. Behold, said he,
 our fortunate Friend! In the Ruins, he will find an immense
 Treasure, that will enable him, from henceforth, to exert his
 Beneficence, and render his Virtues more and more conspicuous.
 _Zadig_, tho' astonish'd to the last Degree, attended him to their
 last Stage, which was to the Cottage of a very virtuous and
 well-dispos'd Widow, who had a Nephew of about fourteen Years of
 Age. He was a hopeful Youth, and the Darling of her Heart. She
 entertain'd her two Guests with the best Provisions her little House
 afforded. In the Morning she order'd her Nephew to attend them to an
 adjacent Bridge, which, having been broken down some few Days
 before, render'd the Passage dangerous to Strangers.
 
 The Lad, being very attentive to wait on them, went formost. When
 they were got upon the Bridge; come hither, my pretty Boy, said the
 Hermit, I must give your Aunt some small Token of my Respect for her
 last Night's Favours. Upon that, he twisted his Fingers in the Hair
 of his Head, and threw him, very calmly, into the River. Down went
 the little Lad; he came up once again to the Surface of the Water;
 but was soon lost in the rapid Stream. O thou Monster! thou worst of
 Villains, cry'd _Zadig_! Didn't you promise, said the Hermit, to
 view my Conduct with Patience? Know then, that had that Boy liv'd
 but one Year longer, he would have murder'd his Foster-Mother. Who
 told you so, you barbarous Wretch, said _Zadig_? And when did you
 read that inhuman Event in your _Black-Book_ of _Fate_? Who gave you
 Permission pray, to drown so innocent a Youth, that had never
 disoblig'd you?
 
 No sooner had our young _Babylonian_ ceas'd his severe Reflections,
 but he perceiv'd that the old Hermit's long Beard grew shorter and
 shorter; that the Furrows in his Face began to fill up, and that his
 Cheeks glow'd with a Rose-coloured Red, as if he had been in the
 Bloom of Fifteen. His Mantle was vanish'd at once; and on his
 Shoulders, which were before cover'd, appear'd four angelic Wings,
 each refulgent as the Sun. O thou Messenger of Heaven! O thou
 angelic Form! cry'd _Zadig_, and fell prostrate at his Feet; thou
 art descended from the Empireum, I find, to instruct such a poor
 frail Mortal as I am, how to submit to the Mysteries of Fate.
 Mankind in general, said the Angel _Jesrad_, judge of the Whole, by
 only viewing the hither Link of the Chain. Thou, of all the human
 Race, wast the only Man that deserv'd to have thy Mind enlighten'd.
 _Zadig_, begg'd Leave to speak. I am somewhat diffident of myself,
 'tis true; but may I presume, Sir, to beg the Solution of one
 Scruple? Would it not have been better to have chastiz'd the Lad,
 and by that Means reform'd him, than to have cut him off thus
 unprepar'd in a Moment. _Jesrad_, replied, had he been virtuous, and
 had he liv'd, 'twas his _Fate_ not only to be murder'd himself, but
 his Wife, whom he would afterwards have married, and the little
 Infant, that was to have been the Pledge of their mutual Affection.
 Is it necessary then, venerable Guide, that there should be
 Wickedness and Misfortunes in the World, and that those Misfortunes
 should fall with Weight on the Heads of the Righteous? The Wicked,
 replied _Jesrad_, are always unhappy. Misfortunes are intended only
 as a Touch-stone, to try a small Number of the Just, who are thinly
 scatter'd about this terrestrial Globe: Besides, there is no Evil
 under the Sun, but some Good proceeds from it: But, said _Zadig_,
 Suppose the World was all Goodness, and there was no such Thing in
 Nature as Evil. Then, that World of yours, said _Jesrad_, would be
 another World; the Chain of Events would be another Wisdom; and that
 other Order, which would be perfect, must of Necessity be the
 everlasting Residence of the supreme Being, whom no Evil can
 approach. That great and first Cause has created an infinite Number
 of Worlds, and no two of them alike. This vast Variety is an
 Attribute of his Omnipotence. There are not two Leaves on the Trees
 throughout the Universe, nor any two Globes of Light amongst the
 Myriad of Stars that deck the infinite Expanse of Heaven, which are
 perfectly alike. And whatever you see on that small Atom of Earth,
 whereof you are a Native, must exist in the Place, and at the Time
 appointed, according to the immutable Decrees of him who comprehends
 the Whole. Mankind imagine, that the Lad, whom I plung'd into the
 River, was drown'd by _Chance_; and that our generous Benefactor's
 House was reduc'd to Ashes by the same _Chance_; but know, there is
 no such Thing as _Chance_, all Misfortunes are intended, either as
 severe Trials, Judgments, or Rewards; and are the Result of
 Foreknowledge. You remember, Sir, the poor Fisherman in Despair,
 that thought himself the most unhappy Mortal breathing. The great
 _Orasmades_, sent you to amend his Situation. Frail Mortal! Cease to
 contend with what you ought to adore. But, said _Zadig_--whilst the
 Sound of the Word But dwelt upon his Tongue, the Angel took his
 Flight towards the tenth Sphere. _Zadig_ sunk down upon his Knees,
 and acknowledg'd an over-ruling Providence with all the Marks of the
 profoundest Submission. The Angel, as he was soaring towards the
 Clouds, cried out in distinct Accents; Make thy Way towards
 _Babylon_.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XVIII.
 
 _The_ AENIGMAS, or RIDDLES.
 
 
 _Zadig_, as one beside himself, and perfectly thunder-struck, beat
 his March at random. He entred, however, into the City of _Babylon_,
 on that very Day, when those Combatants who had been before engag'd
 in the List or Circus, were already assembled in the spacious
 Outer-Court of the Palace, in order to solve the AEnigmas, and give
 the wisest Answers they could to such Questions, as the _Grand
 Magus_ should propose. All the Parties concern'd were present,
 except the Knight of the Green Armour. No sooner had _Zadig_ made
 his Appearance in the City, but the Populace flock'd round about
 him: No Eye was satisfied with gazing at him: All in general were
 lavish of their Praises, and in their Hearts wish'd him their
 Sovereign, except the envious Man, who as he pass'd by, fetch'd a
 deep Sigh, and turn'd his Head aside. The Populace with loud
 Acclamations attended him to the Palace-Gate. The Queen, who had
 heard of his Arrival, was in the utmost Agony, between Hope and
 Despair. Her Vexation had almost brought her to Death's Door; she
 couldn't conceive why _Zadig_ should appear without his
 Accoutrements, nor imagine which Way _Itobad_ could procure the
 snow-white Armour. At the Sight of _Zadig_ a confus'd Murmur ran
 thro' the whole Place. Every Eye was surpriz'd, tho' charm'd at the
 same Time to see him again: But then none were to be admitted into
 the Assembly-Room except the Knights.
 
 I have fought as successfully as any one of them all, said _Zadig_,
 tho' another appears clad in my Armour; but in the mean Time, before
 I can possibly prove my Assertion, I insist upon being admitted into
 Court, in order to give my Solutions to such AEnigmas as shall be
 propos'd. 'Twas put to the Vote. As the Reputation of his being a
 Man of the strictest Honour and Veracity was so strongly imprinted
 on their Minds, the Motion of his Admittance was carried in the
 Affirmative, without the least Opposition.
 
 The first Question the _Grand Magus_ propos'd was this: What is the
 longest and yet the shortest Thing in the World; the most swift and
 the most slow; the most divisible, and the most extended; the least
 valu'd, and the most regretted; And without which nothing can
 possibly be done: Which, in a Word, devours every Thing how minute
 soever, and yet gives Life and Spirit to every Object or Being,
 however Great?
 
 _Itobad_ had the Honour to answer first. His reply was, that a Man
 of his Merit had something else to think on, than idle Riddles;
 'twas enough for him, that he was acknowledg'd the Hero of the
 Circus. One said, the Solution of the AEnigma propos'd was _Fortune_;
 others said the _Earth_; and others again the _Light_: But _Zadig_
 pronounced it to be _Time_. Nothing, said he, can be longer, since
 'tis the Measure of Eternity; Nothing is shorter, since there is
 Time always wanting to accomplish what we aim at. Nothing passes so
 slowly as Time to him who is in Expectation; and nothing so swift as
 Time to him who is in the perfect Enjoyment of his Wishes. It's
 Extent is to Infinity, in the Whole; and divisible to Infinity in
 part. All Men neglect it in the Passage; and all regret the Loss of
 it when 'tis past. Nothing can possibly be done without it; it
 buries in Oblivion whatever is unworthy of being transmitted down to
 Posterity; and it renders all illustrious Actions immortal. The
 Assembly agreed unanimously that _Zadig_ was in the Right.
 
 The next Question that was started, was, What is the Thing we
 receive, without being ever thankful for it; which we enjoy, without
 knowing how we came by it; which we give away to others, without
 knowing where 'tis to be found; and which we lose, without being any
 ways conscious of our Misfortune?
 
 Each pass'd his Verdict. _Zadig_ was the only Person that concluded
 it was LIFE. He solv'd every AEnigma propos'd, with equal Facility.
 _Itobad_, when he heard the Explications, always said that nothing
 in the World was more easy, than to solve such obvious Questions;
 and that he could interpret a thousand of them without the least
 Hesitation, were he inclin'd to trouble his Head about such Trifles.
 Other Questions were propos'd in regard to Justice, the sovereign
 Good, and the Art of Government. _Zadig's_ Answers still carried the
 greatest Weight. What Pity 'tis, said some who were present, that
 one of so comprehensive a Genius, should make such a scurvy
 Cavalier?
 
 Most illustrious Grandees, said _Zadig_, I was the Person that had
 the Honour of being Victor at your Circus; the white Armour, most
 puissant Lords, was mine. That awkward Warrior there, Lord _Itobad_,
 dress'd himself in it whilst I was asleep. He imagin'd, it is plain,
 that it would do him more Honour than his own Green one. Unaccoutred
 as I am, I am ready, before this august Assembly, to give them
 incontestable Proof of my superior Skill; to engage with the Usurper
 of the White Armour with my Sword only in my Mantle and Bonnet; and
 to testify that I only was the happy Victor of the justly admired
 _Hottam_.
 
 _Itobad_ accepted of the Challenge with all the Assurance of Success
 imaginable. He did not doubt, but being properly accoutred with his
 Helmet, his Cuirass, and his Bracelets, he should be able to hue
 down an Antagonist, in his Mantle and Cap, and nothing to skreen him
 from his Resentment, but a single Sabre. _Zadig_ drew his Sword, and
 saluted the Queen with it, who view'd him with Transport mix'd with
 Fear. _Itobad_ drew his, but paid his Compliments to Nobody. He
 approach'd _Zadig_, as one, whom he imagin'd incapable of making any
 considerable Resistance. He concluded, 'twas in his Power to cut
 _Zadig_ into Atoms. _Zadig_, however, knew how to parry the Blow, by
 dexterously receiving it upon his _Fort_ (as the Swords-men call it)
 by which Means _Itobad's_ Sword was snapt in two. With that _Zadig_
 in an Instant clos'd his Adversary, and by his superior Strength, as
 well as Skill, laid him sprawling on his Back. Then holding the
 Point of his Sword to the opening of his Cuirass, Submit to be
 stripp'd of your borrow'd Plumes, or you are a dead Man this Moment.
 _Itobad_, always surpriz'd, that any Disappointment should attend a
 Man of such exalted Merit as himself, very tamely permitted _Zadig_
 to disrobe him by Degrees of his pompous Helmet, his superb Cuirass,
 his rich Bracelets, his brilliant Cuisses, or Armour for his Thighs,
 and other Martial Accoutrements. When _Zadig_ had equipp'd himself
 _Cap-a-pee_, in his now recover'd Armour, he flew to _Astarte_, and
 threw himself prostrate at her Feet. _Cador_ prov'd, without any
 great Difficulty, that the White Armour was _Zadig's_ Property. He
 was thereupon acknowledg'd King of _Babylon_, by the unanimous
 Content of the Whole Court; but more particularly with the
 Approbation of _Astarte_, who after such a long Series of
 Misfortunes, now tasted the Sweets of seeing her darling _Zadig_
 thought worthy, in the Opinion of the whole World, to be the Partner
 of her royal Bed. _Itobad_ withdrew, and contented himself with
 being call'd _my Lord_ within the narrow Compass of his own
 Domesticks. _Zadig_, in short, was elected King, and was as happy as
 any Mortal could be.
 
 Now he began to reflect on what the Angel _Jesrad_ had said to him:
 Nay, he reflected so far back as the Story of the _Arabian_ Atom of
 Dust metamorphosed into a Diamond. The Queen and He ador'd the
 Divine Providence. _Zadig_ permitted _Missouf_, the Fair Coquet, to
 make her Conquests where she could. He sent Couriers to bring the
 Free-booter _Arbogad_ to Court, and gave him an Honourable Military
 Post in his Army, with a farther Promise of Promotion to the highest
 Dignity; but upon this express Condition, that he would act for the
 future as a Soldier of Honour; but assur'd him at the same Time,
 that he'd make a publick Example of him, if he follow'd his
 Profession of Free-booting for the future.
 
 _Setoc_ was sent for from the lonely Desarts of _Arabia_, together
 with the fair _Almonza_, his new Bride, to preside over the
 commercial Affairs of _Babylon_. _Cador_ was advanc'd to a Post near
 himself, and was his Favourite Minister at Court, as the just Reward
 of his past Services. He was, in short, the King's real Friend; and
 _Zadig_ was the only Monarch in the Universe that could boast of
 such an Attendant. The Dwarf, tho' dumb, was not wholly forgotten.
 The Fisherman was put into the Possession of a very handsome House;
 and _Orcan_ was sentenc'd, not only to pay him a very considerable
 Sum for the Injustice done him in detaining his Wife; but to resign
 her likewise to the proper Owner: The Fisherman, however, grown wise
 by Experience, soften'd the Rigour of the Sentence, and took the
 Money only in full of all Accounts.
 
 He didn't leave so much as _Semira_ wholly disconsolate, tho' she
 had such an Aversion to a blind Eye; nor _Azora_ comfortless,
 notwithstanding her affectionate Intention to shorten his Nose; for
 he sooth'd their Sorrows by very munificent Presents. The envious
 Informer indeed, died with Shame and Vexation. The Empire was
 glorious abroad, and in the full Enjoyment of Tranquility, Peace and
 Plenty, at home: This, in short, was the true golden Age. The whole
 Country was sway'd by Love and Justice. Every one blest _Zadig_; and
 _Zadig_ blest Heav'n for his unexpected Success.
 
 
 _FINIS._
 
 
 
 
   Transcriber's Notes:
 
     Spelling and punctuation are as found (for example,
     _Itabod/Itobad_ was left as printed), with one exception:
     the original reads "purcha'd" in "An _Arabian_ Merchant,
     _Setoc_ by Name, purchas'd them both;"
 
     Hyphenated words are closed up if all other examples are
     closed, otherwise not. If there is a mix of broken and not,
     then it was left with a hyphen.
 
     Italic possessives were changed for clarity (for example,
     _Zadig's_ not _Zadig_'s).

 INTRODUCTION
 
 
 Ever since 1759, when Voltaire wrote "Candide" in ridicule of the notion
 that this is the best of all possible worlds, this world has been a
 gayer place for readers. Voltaire wrote it in three days, and five or
 six generations have found that its laughter does not grow old.
 
 "Candide" has not aged. Yet how different the book would have looked if
 Voltaire had written it a hundred and fifty years later than 1759. It
 would have been, among other things, a book of sights and sounds. A
 modern writer would have tried to catch and fix in words some of those
 Atlantic changes which broke the Atlantic monotony of that voyage from
 Cadiz to Buenos Ayres. When Martin and Candide were sailing the length
 of the Mediterranean we should have had a contrast between naked scarped
 Balearic cliffs and headlands of Calabria in their mists. We should have
 had quarter distances, far horizons, the altering silhouettes of an
 Ionian island. Colored birds would have filled Paraguay with their
 silver or acid cries.
 
 Dr. Pangloss, to prove the existence of design in the universe, says
 that noses were made to carry spectacles, and so we have spectacles. A
 modern satirist would not try to paint with Voltaire's quick brush the
 doctrine that he wanted to expose. And he would choose a more
 complicated doctrine than Dr. Pangloss's optimism, would study it more
 closely, feel his destructive way about it with a more learned and
 caressing malice. His attack, stealthier, more flexible and more patient
 than Voltaire's, would call upon us, especially when his learning got a
 little out of control, to be more than patient. Now and then he would
 bore us. "Candide" never bored anybody except William Wordsworth.
 
 Voltaire's men and women point his case against optimism by starting
 high and falling low. A modern could not go about it after this fashion.
 He would not plunge his people into an unfamiliar misery. He would just
 keep them in the misery they were born to.
 
 But such an account of Voltaire's procedure is as misleading as the
 plaster cast of a dance. Look at his procedure again. Mademoiselle
 Cunegonde, the illustrious Westphalian, sprung from a family that could
 prove seventy-one quarterings, descends and descends until we find her
 earning her keep by washing dishes in the Propontis. The aged faithful
 attendant, victim of a hundred acts of rape by negro pirates, remembers
 that she is the daughter of a pope, and that in honor of her
 approaching marriage with a Prince of Massa-Carrara all Italy wrote
 sonnets of which not one was passable. We do not need to know French
 literature before Voltaire in order to feel, although the lurking parody
 may escape us, that he is poking fun at us and at himself. His laughter
 at his own methods grows more unmistakable at the last, when he
 caricatures them by casually assembling six fallen monarchs in an inn at
 Venice.
 
 A modern assailant of optimism would arm himself with social pity. There
 is no social pity in "Candide." Voltaire, whose light touch on familiar
 institutions opens them and reveals their absurdity, likes to remind us
 that the slaughter and pillage and murder which Candide witnessed among
 the Bulgarians was perfectly regular, having been conducted according to
 the laws and usages of war. Had Voltaire lived to-day he would have done
 to poverty what he did to war. Pitying the poor, he would have shown us
 poverty as a ridiculous anachronism, and both the ridicule and the pity
 would have expressed his indignation.
 
 Almost any modern, essaying a philosophic tale, would make it long.
 "Candide" is only a "Hamlet" and a half long. It would hardly have been
 shorter if Voltaire had spent three months on it, instead of those three
 days. A conciseness to be matched in English by nobody except Pope, who
 can say a plagiarizing enemy "steals much, spends little, and has
 nothing left," a conciseness which Pope toiled and sweated for, came as
 easy as wit to Voltaire. He can afford to be witty, parenthetically, by
 the way, prodigally, without saving, because he knows there is more wit
 where that came from.
 
 One of Max Beerbohm's cartoons shows us the young Twentieth Century
 going at top speed, and watched by two of his predecessors. Underneath
 is this legend: "The Grave Misgivings of the Nineteenth Century, and the
 Wicked Amusement of the Eighteenth, in Watching the Progress (or
 whatever it is) of the Twentieth." This Eighteenth Century snuff-taking
 and malicious, is like Voltaire, who nevertheless must know, if he
 happens to think of it, that not yet in the Twentieth Century, not for
 all its speed mania, has any one come near to equalling the speed of a
 prose tale by Voltaire. "Candide" is a full book. It is filled with
 mockery, with inventiveness, with things as concrete as things to eat
 and coins, it has time for the neatest intellectual clickings, it is
 never hurried, and it moves with the most amazing rapidity. It has the
 rapidity of high spirits playing a game. The dry high spirits of this
 destroyer of optimism make most optimists look damp and depressed.
 Contemplation of the stupidity which deems happiness possible almost
 made Voltaire happy. His attack on optimism is one of the gayest books
 in the world. Gaiety has been scattered everywhere up and down its pages
 by Voltaire's lavish hand, by his thin fingers.
 
 Many propagandist satirical books have been written with "Candide" in
 mind, but not too many. To-day, especially, when new faiths are changing
 the structure of the world, faiths which are still plastic enough to be
 deformed by every disciple, each disciple for himself, and which have
 not yet received the final deformation known as universal acceptance,
 to-day "Candide" is an inspiration to every narrative satirist who hates
 one of these new faiths, or hates every interpretation of it but his
 own. Either hatred will serve as a motive to satire.
 
 That is why the present is one of the right moments to republish
 "Candide." I hope it will inspire younger men and women, the only ones
 who can be inspired, to have a try at Theodore, or Militarism; Jane, or
 Pacifism; at So-and-So, the Pragmatist or the Freudian. And I hope, too,
 that they will without trying hold their pens with an eighteenth century
 lightness, not inappropriate to a philosophic tale. In Voltaire's
 fingers, as Anatole France has said, the pen runs and laughs. PHILIP
 LITTELL.

 CANDIDE
 
 
 
 
 I
 
 HOW CANDIDE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A MAGNIFICENT CASTLE, AND HOW HE WAS
 EXPELLED THENCE.
 
 
 In a castle of Westphalia, belonging to the Baron of
 Thunder-ten-Tronckh, lived a youth, whom nature had endowed with the
 most gentle manners. His countenance was a true picture of his soul. He
 combined a true judgment with simplicity of spirit, which was the
 reason, I apprehend, of his being called Candide. The old servants of
 the family suspected him to have been the son of the Baron's sister, by
 a good, honest gentleman of the neighborhood, whom that young lady would
 never marry because he had been able to prove only seventy-one
 quarterings, the rest of his genealogical tree having been lost through
 the injuries of time.
 
 The Baron was one of the most powerful lords in Westphalia, for his
 castle had not only a gate, but windows. His great hall, even, was hung
 with tapestry. All the dogs of his farm-yards formed a pack of hounds at
 need; his grooms were his huntsmen; and the curate of the village was
 his grand almoner. They called him "My Lord," and laughed at all his
 stories.
 
 The Baron's lady weighed about three hundred and fifty pounds, and was
 therefore a person of great consideration, and she did the honours of
 the house with a dignity that commanded still greater respect. Her
 daughter Cunegonde was seventeen years of age, fresh-coloured, comely,
 plump, and desirable. The Baron's son seemed to be in every respect
 worthy of his father. The Preceptor Pangloss[1] was the oracle of the
 family, and little Candide heard his lessons with all the good faith of
 his age and character.
 
 Pangloss was professor of metaphysico-theologico-cosmolo-nigology. He
 proved admirably that there is no effect without a cause, and that, in
 this best of all possible worlds, the Baron's castle was the most
 magnificent of castles, and his lady the best of all possible
 Baronesses.
 
 "It is demonstrable," said he, "that things cannot be otherwise than as
 they are; for all being created for an end, all is necessarily for the
 best end. Observe, that the nose has been formed to bear
 spectacles--thus we have spectacles. Legs are visibly designed for
 stockings--and we have stockings. Stones were made to be hewn, and to
 construct castles--therefore my lord has a magnificent castle; for the
 greatest baron in the province ought to be the best lodged. Pigs were
 made to be eaten--therefore we eat pork all the year round. Consequently
 they who assert that all is well have said a foolish thing, they should
 have said all is for the best."
 
 Candide listened attentively and believed innocently; for he thought
 Miss Cunegonde extremely beautiful, though he never had the courage to
 tell her so. He concluded that after the happiness of being born of
 Baron of Thunder-ten-Tronckh, the second degree of happiness was to be
 Miss Cunegonde, the third that of seeing her every day, and the fourth
 that of hearing Master Pangloss, the greatest philosopher of the whole
 province, and consequently of the whole world.
 
 One day Cunegonde, while walking near the castle, in a little wood which
 they called a park, saw between the bushes, Dr. Pangloss giving a lesson
 in experimental natural philosophy to her mother's chamber-maid, a
 little brown wench, very pretty and very docile. As Miss Cunegonde had a
 great disposition for the sciences, she breathlessly observed the
 repeated experiments of which she was a witness; she clearly perceived
 the force of the Doctor's reasons, the effects, and the causes; she
 turned back greatly flurried, quite pensive, and filled with the desire
 to be learned; dreaming that she might well be a _sufficient reason_ for
 young Candide, and he for her.
 
 She met Candide on reaching the castle and blushed; Candide blushed
 also; she wished him good morrow in a faltering tone, and Candide spoke
 to her without knowing what he said. The next day after dinner, as they
 went from table, Cunegonde and Candide found themselves behind a screen;
 Cunegonde let fall her handkerchief, Candide picked it up, she took him
 innocently by the hand, the youth as innocently kissed the young lady's
 hand with particular vivacity, sensibility, and grace; their lips met,
 their eyes sparkled, their knees trembled, their hands strayed. Baron
 Thunder-ten-Tronckh passed near the screen and beholding this cause and
 effect chased Candide from the castle with great kicks on the backside;
 Cunegonde fainted away; she was boxed on the ears by the Baroness, as
 soon as she came to herself; and all was consternation in this most
 magnificent and most agreeable of all possible castles.
 
 
 
 
 II
 
 WHAT BECAME OF CANDIDE AMONG THE BULGARIANS.
 
 
 Candide, driven from terrestrial paradise, walked a long while without
 knowing where, weeping, raising his eyes to heaven, turning them often
 towards the most magnificent of castles which imprisoned the purest of
 noble young ladies. He lay down to sleep without supper, in the middle
 of a field between two furrows. The snow fell in large flakes. Next day
 Candide, all benumbed, dragged himself towards the neighbouring town
 which was called Waldberghofftrarbk-dikdorff, having no money, dying of
 hunger and fatigue, he stopped sorrowfully at the door of an inn. Two
 men dressed in blue observed him.
 
 "Comrade," said one, "here is a well-built young fellow, and of proper
 height."
 
 They went up to Candide and very civilly invited him to dinner.
 
 "Gentlemen," replied Candide, with a most engaging modesty, "you do me
 great honour, but I have not wherewithal to pay my share."
 
 "Oh, sir," said one of the blues to him, "people of your appearance and
 of your merit never pay anything: are you not five feet five inches
 high?"
 
 "Yes, sir, that is my height," answered he, making a low bow.
 
 "Come, sir, seat yourself; not only will we pay your reckoning, but we
 will never suffer such a man as you to want money; men are only born to
 assist one another."
 
 "You are right," said Candide; "this is what I was always taught by Mr.
 Pangloss, and I see plainly that all is for the best."
 
 They begged of him to accept a few crowns. He took them, and wished to
 give them his note; they refused; they seated themselves at table.
 
 "Love you not deeply?"
 
 "Oh yes," answered he; "I deeply love Miss Cunegonde."
 
 "No," said one of the gentlemen, "we ask you if you do not deeply love
 the King of the Bulgarians?"
 
 "Not at all," said he; "for I have never seen him."
 
 "What! he is the best of kings, and we must drink his health."
 
 "Oh! very willingly, gentlemen," and he drank.
 
 "That is enough," they tell him. "Now you are the help, the support,
 the defender, the hero of the Bulgarians. Your fortune is made, and your
 glory is assured."
 
 Instantly they fettered him, and carried him away to the regiment. There
 he was made to wheel about to the right, and to the left, to draw his
 rammer, to return his rammer, to present, to fire, to march, and they
 gave him thirty blows with a cudgel. The next day he did his exercise a
 little less badly, and he received but twenty blows. The day following
 they gave him only ten, and he was regarded by his comrades as a
 prodigy.
 
 Candide, all stupefied, could not yet very well realise how he was a
 hero. He resolved one fine day in spring to go for a walk, marching
 straight before him, believing that it was a privilege of the human as
 well as of the animal species to make use of their legs as they pleased.
 He had advanced two leagues when he was overtaken by four others, heroes
 of six feet, who bound him and carried him to a dungeon. He was asked
 which he would like the best, to be whipped six-and-thirty times through
 all the regiment, or to receive at once twelve balls of lead in his
 brain. He vainly said that human will is free, and that he chose neither
 the one nor the other. He was forced to make a choice; he determined, in
 virtue of that gift of God called liberty, to run the gauntlet
 six-and-thirty times. He bore this twice. The regiment was composed of
 two thousand men; that composed for him four thousand strokes, which
 laid bare all his muscles and nerves, from the nape of his neck quite
 down to his rump. As they were going to proceed to a third whipping,
 Candide, able to bear no more, begged as a favour that they would be so
 good as to shoot him. He obtained this favour; they bandaged his eyes,
 and bade him kneel down. The King of the Bulgarians passed at this
 moment and ascertained the nature of the crime. As he had great talent,
 he understood from all that he learnt of Candide that he was a young
 metaphysician, extremely ignorant of the things of this world, and he
 accorded him his pardon with a clemency which will bring him praise in
 all the journals, and throughout all ages.
 
 An able surgeon cured Candide in three weeks by means of emollients
 taught by Dioscorides. He had already a little skin, and was able to
 march when the King of the Bulgarians gave battle to the King of the
 Abares.[2]
 
 
 
 
 III
 
 HOW CANDIDE MADE HIS ESCAPE FROM THE BULGARIANS, AND WHAT AFTERWARDS
 BECAME OF HIM.
 
 
 There was never anything so gallant, so spruce, so brilliant, and so
 well disposed as the two armies. Trumpets, fifes, hautboys, drums, and
 cannon made music such as Hell itself had never heard. The cannons first
 of all laid flat about six thousand men on each side; the muskets swept
 away from this best of worlds nine or ten thousand ruffians who infested
 its surface. The bayonet was also a _sufficient reason_ for the death of
 several thousands. The whole might amount to thirty thousand souls.
 Candide, who trembled like a philosopher, hid himself as well as he
 could during this heroic butchery.
 
 At length, while the two kings were causing Te Deum to be sung each in
 his own camp, Candide resolved to go and reason elsewhere on effects and
 causes. He passed over heaps of dead and dying, and first reached a
 neighbouring village; it was in cinders, it was an Abare village which
 the Bulgarians had burnt according to the laws of war. Here, old men
 covered with wounds, beheld their wives, hugging their children to their
 bloody breasts, massacred before their faces; there, their daughters,
 disembowelled and breathing their last after having satisfied the
 natural wants of Bulgarian heroes; while others, half burnt in the
 flames, begged to be despatched. The earth was strewed with brains,
 arms, and legs.
 
 Candide fled quickly to another village; it belonged to the Bulgarians;
 and the Abarian heroes had treated it in the same way. Candide, walking
 always over palpitating limbs or across ruins, arrived at last beyond
 the seat of war, with a few provisions in his knapsack, and Miss
 Cunegonde always in his heart. His provisions failed him when he arrived
 in Holland; but having heard that everybody was rich in that country,
 and that they were Christians, he did not doubt but he should meet with
 the same treatment from them as he had met with in the Baron's castle,
 before Miss Cunegonde's bright eyes were the cause of his expulsion
 thence.
 
 He asked alms of several grave-looking people, who all answered him,
 that if he continued to follow this trade they would confine him to the
 house of correction, where he should be taught to get a living.
 
 The next he addressed was a man who had been haranguing a large assembly
 for a whole hour on the subject of charity. But the orator, looking
 askew, said:
 
 "What are you doing here? Are you for the good cause?"
 
 "There can be no effect without a cause," modestly answered Candide;
 "the whole is necessarily concatenated and arranged for the best. It was
 necessary for me to have been banished from the presence of Miss
 Cunegonde, to have afterwards run the gauntlet, and now it is necessary
 I should beg my bread until I learn to earn it; all this cannot be
 otherwise."
 
 "My friend," said the orator to him, "do you believe the Pope to be
 Anti-Christ?"
 
 "I have not heard it," answered Candide; "but whether he be, or whether
 he be not, I want bread."
 
 "Thou dost not deserve to eat," said the other. "Begone, rogue; begone,
 wretch; do not come near me again."
 
 The orator's wife, putting her head out of the window, and spying a man
 that doubted whether the Pope was Anti-Christ, poured over him a
 full.... Oh, heavens! to what excess does religious zeal carry the
 ladies.
 
 A man who had never been christened, a good Anabaptist, named James,
 beheld the cruel and ignominious treatment shown to one of his
 brethren, an unfeathered biped with a rational soul, he took him home,
 cleaned him, gave him bread and beer, presented him with two florins,
 and even wished to teach him the manufacture of Persian stuffs which
 they make in Holland. Candide, almost prostrating himself before him,
 cried:
 
 "Master Pangloss has well said that all is for the best in this world,
 for I am infinitely more touched by your extreme generosity than with
 the inhumanity of that gentleman in the black coat and his lady."
 
 The next day, as he took a walk, he met a beggar all covered with scabs,
 his eyes diseased, the end of his nose eaten away, his mouth distorted,
 his teeth black, choking in his throat, tormented with a violent cough,
 and spitting out a tooth at each effort.
 
 
 
 
 IV
 
 HOW CANDIDE FOUND HIS OLD MASTER PANGLOSS, AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM.
 
 
 Candide, yet more moved with compassion than with horror, gave to this
 shocking beggar the two florins which he had received from the honest
 Anabaptist James. The spectre looked at him very earnestly, dropped a
 few tears, and fell upon his neck. Candide recoiled in disgust.
 
 "Alas!" said one wretch to the other, "do you no longer know your dear
 Pangloss?"
 
 "What do I hear? You, my dear master! you in this terrible plight! What
 misfortune has happened to you? Why are you no longer in the most
 magnificent of castles? What has become of Miss Cunegonde, the pearl of
 girls, and nature's masterpiece?"
 
 "I am so weak that I cannot stand," said Pangloss.
 
 Upon which Candide carried him to the Anabaptist's stable, and gave him
 a crust of bread. As soon as Pangloss had refreshed himself a little:
 
 "Well," said Candide, "Cunegonde?"
 
 "She is dead," replied the other.
 
 Candide fainted at this word; his friend recalled his senses with a
 little bad vinegar which he found by chance in the stable. Candide
 reopened his eyes.
 
 "Cunegonde is dead! Ah, best of worlds, where art thou? But of what
 illness did she die? Was it not for grief, upon seeing her father kick
 me out of his magnificent castle?"
 
 "No," said Pangloss, "she was ripped open by the Bulgarian soldiers,
 after having been violated by many; they broke the Baron's head for
 attempting to defend her; my lady, her mother, was cut in pieces; my
 poor pupil was served just in the same manner as his sister; and as for
 the castle, they have not left one stone upon another, not a barn, nor a
 sheep, nor a duck, nor a tree; but we have had our revenge, for the
 Abares have done the very same thing to a neighbouring barony, which
 belonged to a Bulgarian lord."
 
 At this discourse Candide fainted again; but coming to himself, and
 having said all that it became him to say, inquired into the cause and
 effect, as well as into the _sufficient reason_ that had reduced
 Pangloss to so miserable a plight.
 
 "Alas!" said the other, "it was love; love, the comfort of the human
 species, the preserver of the universe, the soul of all sensible beings,
 love, tender love."
 
 "Alas!" said Candide, "I know this love, that sovereign of hearts, that
 soul of our souls; yet it never cost me more than a kiss and twenty
 kicks on the backside. How could this beautiful cause produce in you an
 effect so abominable?"
 
 Pangloss made answer in these terms: "Oh, my dear Candide, you remember
 Paquette, that pretty wench who waited on our noble Baroness; in her
 arms I tasted the delights of paradise, which produced in me those hell
 torments with which you see me devoured; she was infected with them, she
 is perhaps dead of them. This present Paquette received of a learned
 Grey Friar, who had traced it to its source; he had had it of an old
 countess, who had received it from a cavalry captain, who owed it to a
 marchioness, who took it from a page, who had received it from a Jesuit,
 who when a novice had it in a direct line from one of the companions of
 Christopher Columbus.[3] For my part I shall give it to nobody, I am
 dying."
 
 "Oh, Pangloss!" cried Candide, "what a strange genealogy! Is not the
 Devil the original stock of it?"
 
 "Not at all," replied this great man, "it was a thing unavoidable, a
 necessary ingredient in the best of worlds; for if Columbus had not in
 an island of America caught this disease, which contaminates the source
 of life, frequently even hinders generation, and which is evidently
 opposed to the great end of nature, we should have neither chocolate nor
 cochineal. We are also to observe that upon our continent, this
 distemper is like religious controversy, confined to a particular spot.
 The Turks, the Indians, the Persians, the Chinese, the Siamese, the
 Japanese, know nothing of it; but there is a sufficient reason for
 believing that they will know it in their turn in a few centuries. In
 the meantime, it has made marvellous progress among us, especially in
 those great armies composed of honest well-disciplined hirelings, who
 decide the destiny of states; for we may safely affirm that when an army
 of thirty thousand men fights another of an equal number, there are
 about twenty thousand of them p-x-d on each side."
 
 "Well, this is wonderful!" said Candide, "but you must get cured."
 
 "Alas! how can I?" said Pangloss, "I have not a farthing, my friend, and
 all over the globe there is no letting of blood or taking a glister,
 without paying, or somebody paying for you."
 
 These last words determined Candide; he went and flung himself at the
 feet of the charitable Anabaptist James, and gave him so touching a
 picture of the state to which his friend was reduced, that the good man
 did not scruple to take Dr. Pangloss into his house, and had him cured
 at his expense. In the cure Pangloss lost only an eye and an ear. He
 wrote well, and knew arithmetic perfectly. The Anabaptist James made him
 his bookkeeper. At the end of two months, being obliged to go to Lisbon
 about some mercantile affairs, he took the two philosophers with him in
 his ship. Pangloss explained to him how everything was so constituted
 that it could not be better. James was not of this opinion.
 
 "It is more likely," said he, "mankind have a little corrupted nature,
 for they were not born wolves, and they have become wolves; God has
 given them neither cannon of four-and-twenty pounders, nor bayonets; and
 yet they have made cannon and bayonets to destroy one another. Into this
 account I might throw not only bankrupts, but Justice which seizes on
 the effects of bankrupts to cheat the creditors."
 
 "All this was indispensable," replied the one-eyed doctor, "for private
 misfortunes make the general good, so that the more private misfortunes
 there are the greater is the general good."
 
 While he reasoned, the sky darkened, the winds blew from the four
 quarters, and the ship was assailed by a most terrible tempest within
 sight of the port of Lisbon.
 
 
 
 
 V
 
 TEMPEST, SHIPWRECK, EARTHQUAKE, AND WHAT BECAME OF DOCTOR PANGLOSS,
 CANDIDE, AND JAMES THE ANABAPTIST.
 
 
 Half dead of that inconceivable anguish which the rolling of a ship
 produces, one-half of the passengers were not even sensible of the
 danger. The other half shrieked and prayed. The sheets were rent, the
 masts broken, the vessel gaped. Work who would, no one heard, no one
 commanded. The Anabaptist being upon deck bore a hand; when a brutish
 sailor struck him roughly and laid him sprawling; but with the violence
 of the blow he himself tumbled head foremost overboard, and stuck upon a
 piece of the broken mast. Honest James ran to his assistance, hauled him
 up, and from the effort he made was precipitated into the sea in sight
 of the sailor, who left him to perish, without deigning to look at him.
 Candide drew near and saw his benefactor, who rose above the water one
 moment and was then swallowed up for ever. He was just going to jump
 after him, but was prevented by the philosopher Pangloss, who
 demonstrated to him that the Bay of Lisbon had been made on purpose for
 the Anabaptist to be drowned. While he was proving this _a priori_, the
 ship foundered; all perished except Pangloss, Candide, and that brutal
 sailor who had drowned the good Anabaptist. The villain swam safely to
 the shore, while Pangloss and Candide were borne thither upon a plank.
 
 As soon as they recovered themselves a little they walked toward Lisbon.
 They had some money left, with which they hoped to save themselves from
 starving, after they had escaped drowning. Scarcely had they reached the
 city, lamenting the death of their benefactor, when they felt the earth
 tremble under their feet. The sea swelled and foamed in the harbour, and
 beat to pieces the vessels riding at anchor. Whirlwinds of fire and
 ashes covered the streets and public places; houses fell, roofs were
 flung upon the pavements, and the pavements were scattered. Thirty
 thousand inhabitants of all ages and sexes were crushed under the
 ruins.[4] The sailor, whistling and swearing, said there was booty to be
 gained here.
 
 "What can be the _sufficient reason_ of this phenomenon?" said Pangloss.
 
 "This is the Last Day!" cried Candide.
 
 The sailor ran among the ruins, facing death to find money; finding it,
 he took it, got drunk, and having slept himself sober, purchased the
 favours of the first good-natured wench whom he met on the ruins of the
 destroyed houses, and in the midst of the dying and the dead. Pangloss
 pulled him by the sleeve.
 
 "My friend," said he, "this is not right. You sin against the _universal
 reason_; you choose your time badly."
 
 "S'blood and fury!" answered the other; "I am a sailor and born at
 Batavia. Four times have I trampled upon the crucifix in four voyages to
 Japan[5]; a fig for thy universal reason."
 
 Some falling stones had wounded Candide. He lay stretched in the street
 covered with rubbish.
 
 "Alas!" said he to Pangloss, "get me a little wine and oil; I am dying."
 
 "This concussion of the earth is no new thing," answered Pangloss. "The
 city of Lima, in America, experienced the same convulsions last year;
 the same cause, the same effects; there is certainly a train of sulphur
 under ground from Lima to Lisbon."
 
 "Nothing more probable," said Candide; "but for the love of God a little
 oil and wine."
 
 "How, probable?" replied the philosopher. "I maintain that the point is
 capable of being demonstrated."
 
 Candide fainted away, and Pangloss fetched him some water from a
 neighbouring fountain. The following day they rummaged among the ruins
 and found provisions, with which they repaired their exhausted strength.
 After this they joined with others in relieving those inhabitants who
 had escaped death. Some, whom they had succoured, gave them as good a
 dinner as they could in such disastrous circumstances; true, the repast
 was mournful, and the company moistened their bread with tears; but
 Pangloss consoled them, assuring them that things could not be
 otherwise.
 
 "For," said he, "all that is is for the best. If there is a volcano at
 Lisbon it cannot be elsewhere. It is impossible that things should be
 other than they are; for everything is right."
 
 A little man dressed in black, Familiar of the Inquisition, who sat by
 him, politely took up his word and said:
 
 "Apparently, then, sir, you do not believe in original sin; for if all
 is for the best there has then been neither Fall nor punishment."
 
 "I humbly ask your Excellency's pardon," answered Pangloss, still more
 politely; "for the Fall and curse of man necessarily entered into the
 system of the best of worlds."
 
 "Sir," said the Familiar, "you do not then believe in liberty?"
 
 "Your Excellency will excuse me," said Pangloss; "liberty is consistent
 with absolute necessity, for it was necessary we should be free; for, in
 short, the determinate will----"
 
 Pangloss was in the middle of his sentence, when the Familiar beckoned
 to his footman, who gave him a glass of wine from Porto or Opporto.
 
 
 
 
 VI
 
 HOW THE PORTUGUESE MADE A BEAUTIFUL AUTO-DA-FE, TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER
 EARTHQUAKES; AND HOW CANDIDE WAS PUBLICLY WHIPPED.
 
 
 After the earthquake had destroyed three-fourths of Lisbon, the sages of
 that country could think of no means more effectual to prevent utter
 ruin than to give the people a beautiful _auto-da-fe_[6]; for it had
 been decided by the University of Coimbra, that the burning of a few
 people alive by a slow fire, and with great ceremony, is an infallible
 secret to hinder the earth from quaking.
 
 In consequence hereof, they had seized on a Biscayner, convicted of
 having married his godmother, and on two Portuguese, for rejecting the
 bacon which larded a chicken they were eating[7]; after dinner, they
 came and secured Dr. Pangloss, and his disciple Candide, the one for
 speaking his mind, the other for having listened with an air of
 approbation. They were conducted to separate apartments, extremely cold,
 as they were never incommoded by the sun. Eight days after they were
 dressed in _san-benitos_[8] and their heads ornamented with paper
 mitres. The mitre and _san-benito_ belonging to Candide were painted
 with reversed flames and with devils that had neither tails nor claws;
 but Pangloss's devils had claws and tails and the flames were upright.
 They marched in procession thus habited and heard a very pathetic
 sermon, followed by fine church music. Candide was whipped in cadence
 while they were singing; the Biscayner, and the two men who had refused
 to eat bacon, were burnt; and Pangloss was hanged, though that was not
 the custom. The same day the earth sustained a most violent concussion.
 
 Candide, terrified, amazed, desperate, all bloody, all palpitating, said
 to himself:
 
 "If this is the best of possible worlds, what then are the others? Well,
 if I had been only whipped I could put up with it, for I experienced
 that among the Bulgarians; but oh, my dear Pangloss! thou greatest of
 philosophers, that I should have seen you hanged, without knowing for
 what! Oh, my dear Anabaptist, thou best of men, that thou should'st have
 been drowned in the very harbour! Oh, Miss Cunegonde, thou pearl of
 girls! that thou should'st have had thy belly ripped open!"
 
 Thus he was musing, scarce able to stand, preached at, whipped,
 absolved, and blessed, when an old woman accosted him saying:
 
 "My son, take courage and follow me."
 
 
 
 
 VII
 
 HOW THE OLD WOMAN TOOK CARE OF CANDIDE, AND HOW HE FOUND THE OBJECT HE
 LOVED.
 
 
 Candide did not take courage, but followed the old woman to a decayed
 house, where she gave him a pot of pomatum to anoint his sores, showed
 him a very neat little bed, with a suit of clothes hanging up, and left
 him something to eat and drink.
 
 "Eat, drink, sleep," said she, "and may our lady of Atocha,[9] the great
 St. Anthony of Padua, and the great St. James of Compostella, receive
 you under their protection. I shall be back to-morrow."
 
 Candide, amazed at all he had suffered and still more with the charity
 of the old woman, wished to kiss her hand.
 
 "It is not my hand you must kiss," said the old woman; "I shall be back
 to-morrow. Anoint yourself with the pomatum, eat and sleep."
 
 Candide, notwithstanding so many disasters, ate and slept. The next
 morning the old woman brought him his breakfast, looked at his back, and
 rubbed it herself with another ointment: in like manner she brought him
 his dinner; and at night she returned with his supper. The day following
 she went through the very same ceremonies.
 
 "Who are you?" said Candide; "who has inspired you with so much
 goodness? What return can I make you?"
 
 The good woman made no answer; she returned in the evening, but brought
 no supper.
 
 "Come with me," she said, "and say nothing."
 
 She took him by the arm, and walked with him about a quarter of a mile
 into the country; they arrived at a lonely house, surrounded with
 gardens and canals. The old woman knocked at a little door, it opened,
 she led Candide up a private staircase into a small apartment richly
 furnished. She left him on a brocaded sofa, shut the door and went away.
 Candide thought himself in a dream; indeed, that he had been dreaming
 unluckily all his life, and that the present moment was the only
 agreeable part of it all.
 
 The old woman returned very soon, supporting with difficulty a trembling
 woman of a majestic figure, brilliant with jewels, and covered with a
 veil.
 
 "Take off that veil," said the old woman to Candide.
 
 The young man approaches, he raises the veil with a timid hand. Oh!
 what a moment! what surprise! he believes he beholds Miss Cunegonde? he
 really sees her! it is herself! His strength fails him, he cannot utter
 a word, but drops at her feet. Cunegonde falls upon the sofa. The old
 woman supplies a smelling bottle; they come to themselves and recover
 their speech. As they began with broken accents, with questions and
 answers interchangeably interrupted with sighs, with tears, and cries.
 The old woman desired they would make less noise and then she left them
 to themselves.
 
 "What, is it you?" said Candide, "you live? I find you again in
 Portugal? then you have not been ravished? then they did not rip open
 your belly as Doctor Pangloss informed me?"
 
 "Yes, they did," said the beautiful Cunegonde; "but those two accidents
 are not always mortal."
 
 "But were your father and mother killed?"
 
 "It is but too true," answered Cunegonde, in tears.
 
 "And your brother?"
 
 "My brother also was killed."
 
 "And why are you in Portugal? and how did you know of my being here? and
 by what strange adventure did you contrive to bring me to this house?"
 
 "I will tell you all that," replied the lady, "but first of all let me
 know your history, since the innocent kiss you gave me and the kicks
 which you received."
 
 Candide respectfully obeyed her, and though he was still in a surprise,
 though his voice was feeble and trembling, though his back still pained
 him, yet he gave her a most ingenuous account of everything that had
 befallen him since the moment of their separation. Cunegonde lifted up
 her eyes to heaven; shed tears upon hearing of the death of the good
 Anabaptist and of Pangloss; after which she spoke as follows to Candide,
 who did not lose a word and devoured her with his eyes.
 
 
 
 
 VIII
 
 THE HISTORY OF CUNEGONDE.
 
 
 "I was in bed and fast asleep when it pleased God to send the Bulgarians
 to our delightful castle of Thunder-ten-Tronckh; they slew my father and
 brother, and cut my mother in pieces. A tall Bulgarian, six feet high,
 perceiving that I had fainted away at this sight, began to ravish me;
 this made me recover; I regained my senses, I cried, I struggled, I bit,
 I scratched, I wanted to tear out the tall Bulgarian's eyes--not knowing
 that what happened at my father's house was the usual practice of war.
 The brute gave me a cut in the left side with his hanger, and the mark
 is still upon me."
 
 "Ah! I hope I shall see it," said honest Candide.
 
 "You shall," said Cunegonde, "but let us continue."
 
 "Do so," replied Candide.
 
 Thus she resumed the thread of her story:
 
 "A Bulgarian captain came in, saw me all bleeding, and the soldier not
 in the least disconcerted. The captain flew into a passion at the
 disrespectful behaviour of the brute, and slew him on my body. He
 ordered my wounds to be dressed, and took me to his quarters as a
 prisoner of war. I washed the few shirts that he had, I did his cooking;
 he thought me very pretty--he avowed it; on the other hand, I must own
 he had a good shape, and a soft and white skin; but he had little or no
 mind or philosophy, and you might see plainly that he had never been
 instructed by Doctor Pangloss. In three months time, having lost all his
 money, and being grown tired of my company, he sold me to a Jew, named
 Don Issachar, who traded to Holland and Portugal, and had a strong
 passion for women. This Jew was much attached to my person, but could
 not triumph over it; I resisted him better than the Bulgarian soldier. A
 modest woman may be ravished once, but her virtue is strengthened by it.
 In order to render me more tractable, he brought me to this country
 house. Hitherto I had imagined that nothing could equal the beauty of
 Thunder-ten-Tronckh Castle; but I found I was mistaken.
 
 "The Grand Inquisitor, seeing me one day at Mass, stared long at me, and
 sent to tell me that he wished to speak on private matters. I was
 conducted to his palace, where I acquainted him with the history of my
 family, and he represented to me how much it was beneath my rank to
 belong to an Israelite. A proposal was then made to Don Issachar that he
 should resign me to my lord. Don Issachar, being the court banker, and a
 man of credit, would hear nothing of it. The Inquisitor threatened him
 with an _auto-da-fe_. At last my Jew, intimidated, concluded a bargain,
 by which the house and myself should belong to both in common; the Jew
 should have for himself Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, and the
 Inquisitor should have the rest of the week. It is now six months since
 this agreement was made. Quarrels have not been wanting, for they could
 not decide whether the night from Saturday to Sunday belonged to the old
 law or to the new. For my part, I have so far held out against both, and
 I verily believe that this is the reason why I am still beloved.
 
 "At length, to avert the scourge of earthquakes, and to intimidate Don
 Issachar, my Lord Inquisitor was pleased to celebrate an _auto-da-fe_.
 He did me the honour to invite me to the ceremony. I had a very good
 seat, and the ladies were served with refreshments between Mass and the
 execution. I was in truth seized with horror at the burning of those two
 Jews, and of the honest Biscayner who had married his godmother; but
 what was my surprise, my fright, my trouble, when I saw in a
 _san-benito_ and mitre a figure which resembled that of Pangloss! I
 rubbed my eyes, I looked at him attentively, I saw him hung; I fainted.
 Scarcely had I recovered my senses than I saw you stripped, stark naked,
 and this was the height of my horror, consternation, grief, and despair.
 I tell you, truthfully, that your skin is yet whiter and of a more
 perfect colour than that of my Bulgarian captain. This spectacle
 redoubled all the feelings which overwhelmed and devoured me. I screamed
 out, and would have said, 'Stop, barbarians!' but my voice failed me,
 and my cries would have been useless after you had been severely
 whipped. How is it possible, said I, that the beloved Candide and the
 wise Pangloss should both be at Lisbon, the one to receive a hundred
 lashes, and the other to be hanged by the Grand Inquisitor, of whom I am
 the well-beloved? Pangloss most cruelly deceived me when he said that
 everything in the world is for the best.
 
 "Agitated, lost, sometimes beside myself, and sometimes ready to die of
 weakness, my mind was filled with the massacre of my father, mother, and
 brother, with the insolence of the ugly Bulgarian soldier, with the stab
 that he gave me, with my servitude under the Bulgarian captain, with my
 hideous Don Issachar, with my abominable Inquisitor, with the execution
 of Doctor Pangloss, with the grand Miserere to which they whipped you,
 and especially with the kiss I gave you behind the screen the day that I
 had last seen you. I praised God for bringing you back to me after so
 many trials, and I charged my old woman to take care of you, and to
 conduct you hither as soon as possible. She has executed her commission
 perfectly well; I have tasted the inexpressible pleasure of seeing you
 again, of hearing you, of speaking with you. But you must be hungry, for
 myself, I am famished; let us have supper."
 
 They both sat down to table, and, when supper was over, they placed
 themselves once more on the sofa; where they were when Signor Don
 Issachar arrived. It was the Jewish Sabbath, and Issachar had come to
 enjoy his rights, and to explain his tender love.
 
 
 
 
 IX
 
 WHAT BECAME OF CUNEGONDE, CANDIDE, THE GRAND INQUISITOR, AND THE JEW.
 
 
 This Issachar was the most choleric Hebrew that had ever been seen in
 Israel since the Captivity in Babylon.
 
 "What!" said he, "thou bitch of a Galilean, was not the Inquisitor
 enough for thee? Must this rascal also share with me?"
 
 In saying this he drew a long poniard which he always carried about him;
 and not imagining that his adversary had any arms he threw himself upon
 Candide: but our honest Westphalian had received a handsome sword from
 the old woman along with the suit of clothes. He drew his rapier,
 despite his gentleness, and laid the Israelite stone dead upon the
 cushions at Cunegonde's feet.
 
 "Holy Virgin!" cried she, "what will become of us? A man killed in my
 apartment! If the officers of justice come, we are lost!"
 
 "Had not Pangloss been hanged," said Candide, "he would give us good
 counsel in this emergency, for he was a profound philosopher. Failing
 him let us consult the old woman."
 
 She was very prudent and commenced to give her opinion when suddenly
 another little door opened. It was an hour after midnight, it was the
 beginning of Sunday. This day belonged to my lord the Inquisitor. He
 entered, and saw the whipped Candide, sword in hand, a dead man upon the
 floor, Cunegonde aghast, and the old woman giving counsel.
 
 At this moment, the following is what passed in the soul of Candide, and
 how he reasoned:
 
 If this holy man call in assistance, he will surely have me burnt; and
 Cunegonde will perhaps be served in the same manner; he was the cause of
 my being cruelly whipped; he is my rival; and, as I have now begun to
 kill, I will kill away, for there is no time to hesitate. This reasoning
 was clear and instantaneous; so that without giving time to the
 Inquisitor to recover from his surprise, he pierced him through and
 through, and cast him beside the Jew.
 
 "Yet again!" said Cunegonde, "now there is no mercy for us, we are
 excommunicated, our last hour has come. How could you do it? you,
 naturally so gentle, to slay a Jew and a prelate in two minutes!"
 
 "My beautiful young lady," responded Candide, "when one is a lover,
 jealous and whipped by the Inquisition, one stops at nothing."
 
 The old woman then put in her word, saying:
 
 "There are three Andalusian horses in the stable with bridles and
 saddles, let the brave Candide get them ready; madame has money, jewels;
 let us therefore mount quickly on horseback, though I can sit only on
 one buttock; let us set out for Cadiz, it is the finest weather in the
 world, and there is great pleasure in travelling in the cool of the
 night."
 
 Immediately Candide saddled the three horses, and Cunegonde, the old
 woman and he, travelled thirty miles at a stretch. While they were
 journeying, the Holy Brotherhood entered the house; my lord the
 Inquisitor was interred in a handsome church, and Issachar's body was
 thrown upon a dunghill.
 
 Candide, Cunegonde, and the old woman, had now reached the little town
 of Avacena in the midst of the mountains of the Sierra Morena, and were
 speaking as follows in a public inn.
 
 
 
 
 X
 
 IN WHAT DISTRESS CANDIDE, CUNEGONDE, AND THE OLD WOMAN ARRIVED AT CADIZ;
 AND OF THEIR EMBARKATION.
 
 
 "Who was it that robbed me of my money and jewels?" said Cunegonde, all
 bathed in tears. "How shall we live? What shall we do? Where find
 Inquisitors or Jews who will give me more?"
 
 "Alas!" said the old woman, "I have a shrewd suspicion of a reverend
 Grey Friar, who stayed last night in the same inn with us at Badajos.
 God preserve me from judging rashly, but he came into our room twice,
 and he set out upon his journey long before us."
 
 "Alas!" said Candide, "dear Pangloss has often demonstrated to me that
 the goods of this world are common to all men, and that each has an
 equal right to them. But according to these principles the Grey Friar
 ought to have left us enough to carry us through our journey. Have you
 nothing at all left, my dear Cunegonde?"
 
 "Not a farthing," said she.
 
 "What then must we do?" said Candide.
 
 "Sell one of the horses," replied the old woman. "I will ride behind
 Miss Cunegonde, though I can hold myself only on one buttock, and we
 shall reach Cadiz."
 
 In the same inn there was a Benedictine prior who bought the horse for a
 cheap price. Candide, Cunegonde, and the old woman, having passed
 through Lucena, Chillas, and Lebrixa, arrived at length at Cadiz. A
 fleet was there getting ready, and troops assembling to bring to reason
 the reverend Jesuit Fathers of Paraguay, accused of having made one of
 the native tribes in the neighborhood of San Sacrament revolt against
 the Kings of Spain and Portugal. Candide having been in the Bulgarian
 service, performed the military exercise before the general of this
 little army with so graceful an address, with so intrepid an air, and
 with such agility and expedition, that he was given the command of a
 company of foot. Now, he was a captain! He set sail with Miss Cunegonde,
 the old woman, two valets, and the two Andalusian horses, which had
 belonged to the grand Inquisitor of Portugal.
 
 During their voyage they reasoned a good deal on the philosophy of poor
 Pangloss.
 
 "We are going into another world," said Candide; "and surely it must be
 there that all is for the best. For I must confess there is reason to
 complain a little of what passeth in our world in regard to both
 natural and moral philosophy."
 
 "I love you with all my heart," said Cunegonde; "but my soul is still
 full of fright at that which I have seen and experienced."
 
 "All will be well," replied Candide; "the sea of this new world is
 already better than our European sea; it is calmer, the winds more
 regular. It is certainly the New World which is the best of all possible
 worlds."
 
 "God grant it," said Cunegonde; "but I have been so horribly unhappy
 there that my heart is almost closed to hope."
 
 "You complain," said the old woman; "alas! you have not known such
 misfortunes as mine."
 
 Cunegonde almost broke out laughing, finding the good woman very
 amusing, for pretending to have been as unfortunate as she.
 
 "Alas!" said Cunegonde, "my good mother, unless you have been ravished
 by two Bulgarians, have received two deep wounds in your belly, have had
 two castles demolished, have had two mothers cut to pieces before your
 eyes, and two of your lovers whipped at an _auto-da-fe_, I do not
 conceive how you could be more unfortunate than I. Add that I was born a
 baroness of seventy-two quarterings--and have been a cook!"
 
 "Miss," replied the old woman, "you do not know my birth; and were I to
 show you my backside, you would not talk in that manner, but would
 suspend your judgment."
 
 This speech having raised extreme curiosity in the minds of Cunegonde
 and Candide, the old woman spoke to them as follows.
 
 
 
 
 XI
 
 HISTORY OF THE OLD WOMAN.
 
 
 "I had not always bleared eyes and red eyelids; neither did my nose
 always touch my chin; nor was I always a servant. I am the daughter of
 Pope Urban X,[10] and of the Princess of Palestrina. Until the age of
 fourteen I was brought up in a palace, to which all the castles of your
 German barons would scarcely have served for stables; and one of my
 robes was worth more than all the magnificence of Westphalia. As I grew
 up I improved in beauty, wit, and every graceful accomplishment, in the
 midst of pleasures, hopes, and respectful homage. Already I inspired
 love. My throat was formed, and such a throat! white, firm, and shaped
 like that of the Venus of Medici; and what eyes! what eyelids! what
 black eyebrows! such flames darted from my dark pupils that they
 eclipsed the scintillation of the stars--as I was told by the poets in
 our part of the world. My waiting women, when dressing and undressing
 me, used to fall into an ecstasy, whether they viewed me before or
 behind; how glad would the gentlemen have been to perform that office
 for them!
 
 "I was affianced to the most excellent Prince of Massa Carara. Such a
 prince! as handsome as myself, sweet-tempered, agreeable, brilliantly
 witty, and sparkling with love. I loved him as one loves for the first
 time--with idolatry, with transport. The nuptials were prepared. There
 was surprising pomp and magnificence; there were _fetes_, carousals,
 continual _opera bouffe_; and all Italy composed sonnets in my praise,
 though not one of them was passable. I was just upon the point of
 reaching the summit of bliss, when an old marchioness who had been
 mistress to the Prince, my husband, invited him to drink chocolate with
 her. He died in less than two hours of most terrible convulsions. But
 this is only a bagatelle. My mother, in despair, and scarcely less
 afflicted than myself, determined to absent herself for some time from
 so fatal a place. She had a very fine estate in the neighbourhood of
 Gaeta. We embarked on board a galley of the country which was gilded
 like the great altar of St. Peter's at Rome. A Sallee corsair swooped
 down and boarded us. Our men defended themselves like the Pope's
 soldiers; they flung themselves upon their knees, and threw down their
 arms, begging of the corsair an absolution _in articulo mortis_.
 
 "Instantly they were stripped as bare as monkeys; my mother, our maids
 of honour, and myself were all served in the same manner. It is amazing
 with what expedition those gentry undress people. But what surprised me
 most was, that they thrust their fingers into the part of our bodies
 which the generality of women suffer no other instrument but--pipes to
 enter. It appeared to me a very strange kind of ceremony; but thus one
 judges of things when one has not seen the world. I afterwards learnt
 that it was to try whether we had concealed any diamonds. This is the
 practice established from time immemorial, among civilised nations that
 scour the seas. I was informed that the very religious Knights of Malta
 never fail to make this search when they take any Turkish prisoners of
 either sex. It is a law of nations from which they never deviate.
 
 "I need not tell _you_ how great a hardship it was for a young princess
 and her mother to be made slaves and carried to Morocco. You may easily
 imagine all we had to suffer on board the pirate vessel. My mother was
 still very handsome; our maids of honour, and even our waiting women,
 had more charms than are to be found in all Africa. As for myself, I was
 ravishing, was exquisite, grace itself, and I was a virgin! I did not
 remain so long; this flower, which had been reserved for the handsome
 Prince of Massa Carara, was plucked by the corsair captain. He was an
 abominable negro, and yet believed that he did me a great deal of
 honour. Certainly the Princess of Palestrina and myself must have been
 very strong to go through all that we experienced until our arrival at
 Morocco. But let us pass on; these are such common things as not to be
 worth mentioning.
 
 "Morocco swam in blood when we arrived. Fifty sons of the Emperor
 Muley-Ismael[11] had each their adherents; this produced fifty civil
 wars, of blacks against blacks, and blacks against tawnies, and tawnies
 against tawnies, and mulattoes against mulattoes. In short it was a
 continual carnage throughout the empire.
 
 "No sooner were we landed, than the blacks of a contrary faction to that
 of my captain attempted to rob him of his booty. Next to jewels and gold
 we were the most valuable things he had. I was witness to such a battle
 as you have never seen in your European climates. The northern nations
 have not that heat in their blood, nor that raging lust for women, so
 common in Africa. It seems that you Europeans have only milk in your
 veins; but it is vitriol, it is fire which runs in those of the
 inhabitants of Mount Atlas and the neighbouring countries. They fought
 with the fury of the lions, tigers, and serpents of the country, to see
 who should have us. A Moor seized my mother by the right arm, while my
 captain's lieutenant held her by the left; a Moorish soldier had hold of
 her by one leg, and one of our corsairs held her by the other. Thus
 almost all our women were drawn in quarters by four men. My captain
 concealed me behind him; and with his drawn scimitar cut and slashed
 every one that opposed his fury. At length I saw all our Italian women,
 and my mother herself, torn, mangled, massacred, by the monsters who
 disputed over them. The slaves, my companions, those who had taken them,
 soldiers, sailors, blacks, whites, mulattoes, and at last my captain,
 all were killed, and I remained dying on a heap of dead. Such scenes as
 this were transacted through an extent of three hundred leagues--and yet
 they never missed the five prayers a day ordained by Mahomet.
 
 "With difficulty I disengaged myself from such a heap of slaughtered
 bodies, and crawled to a large orange tree on the bank of a neighbouring
 rivulet, where I fell, oppressed with fright, fatigue, horror, despair,
 and hunger. Immediately after, my senses, overpowered, gave themselves
 up to sleep, which was yet more swooning than repose. I was in this
 state of weakness and insensibility, between life and death, when I
 felt myself pressed by something that moved upon my body. I opened my
 eyes, and saw a white man, of good countenance, who sighed, and who said
 between his teeth: '_O che sciagura d'essere senza coglioni!_'"[12]
 
 
 
 
 XII
 
 THE ADVENTURES OF THE OLD WOMAN CONTINUED.
 
 
 "Astonished and delighted to hear my native language, and no less
 surprised at what this man said, I made answer that there were much
 greater misfortunes than that of which he complained. I told him in a
 few words of the horrors which I had endured, and fainted a second time.
 He carried me to a neighbouring house, put me to bed, gave me food,
 waited upon me, consoled me, flattered me; he told me that he had never
 seen any one so beautiful as I, and that he never so much regretted the
 loss of what it was impossible to recover.
 
 "'I was born at Naples,' said he, 'there they geld two or three thousand
 children every year; some die of the operation, others acquire a voice
 more beautiful than that of women, and others are raised to offices of
 state.[13] This operation was performed on me with great success and I
 was chapel musician to madam, the Princess of Palestrina.'
 
 "'To my mother!' cried I.
 
 "'Your mother!' cried he, weeping. 'What! can you be that young
 princess whom I brought up until the age of six years, and who promised
 so early to be as beautiful as you?'
 
 "'It is I, indeed; but my mother lies four hundred yards hence, torn in
 quarters, under a heap of dead bodies.'
 
 "I told him all my adventures, and he made me acquainted with his;
 telling me that he had been sent to the Emperor of Morocco by a
 Christian power, to conclude a treaty with that prince, in consequence
 of which he was to be furnished with military stores and ships to help
 to demolish the commerce of other Christian Governments.
 
 "'My mission is done,' said this honest eunuch; 'I go to embark for
 Ceuta, and will take you to Italy. _Ma che sciagura d'essere senza
 coglioni!_'
 
 "I thanked him with tears of commiseration; and instead of taking me to
 Italy he conducted me to Algiers, where he sold me to the Dey. Scarcely
 was I sold, than the plague which had made the tour of Africa, Asia, and
 Europe, broke out with great malignancy in Algiers. You have seen
 earthquakes; but pray, miss, have you ever had the plague?"
 
 "Never," answered Cunegonde.
 
 "If you had," said the old woman, "you would acknowledge that it is far
 more terrible than an earthquake. It is common in Africa, and I caught
 it. Imagine to yourself the distressed situation of the daughter of a
 Pope, only fifteen years old, who, in less than three months, had felt
 the miseries of poverty and slavery, had been ravished almost every day,
 had beheld her mother drawn in quarters, had experienced famine and war,
 and was dying of the plague in Algiers. I did not die, however, but my
 eunuch, and the Dey, and almost the whole seraglio of Algiers perished.
 
 "As soon as the first fury of this terrible pestilence was over, a sale
 was made of the Dey's slaves; I was purchased by a merchant, and carried
 to Tunis; this man sold me to another merchant, who sold me again to
 another at Tripoli; from Tripoli I was sold to Alexandria, from
 Alexandria to Smyrna, and from Smyrna to Constantinople. At length I
 became the property of an Aga of the Janissaries, who was soon ordered
 away to the defence of Azof, then besieged by the Russians.
 
 "The Aga, who was a very gallant man, took his whole seraglio with him,
 and lodged us in a small fort on the Palus Meotides, guarded by two
 black eunuchs and twenty soldiers. The Turks killed prodigious numbers
 of the Russians, but the latter had their revenge. Azof was destroyed by
 fire, the inhabitants put to the sword, neither sex nor age was spared;
 until there remained only our little fort, and the enemy wanted to
 starve us out. The twenty Janissaries had sworn they would never
 surrender. The extremities of famine to which they were reduced, obliged
 them to eat our two eunuchs, for fear of violating their oath. And at
 the end of a few days they resolved also to devour the women.
 
 "We had a very pious and humane Iman, who preached an excellent sermon,
 exhorting them not to kill us all at once.
 
 "'Only cut off a buttock of each of those ladies,' said he, 'and you'll
 fare extremely well; if you must go to it again, there will be the same
 entertainment a few days hence; heaven will accept of so charitable an
 action, and send you relief.'
 
 "He had great eloquence; he persuaded them; we underwent this terrible
 operation. The Iman applied the same balsam to us, as he does to
 children after circumcision; and we all nearly died.
 
 "Scarcely had the Janissaries finished the repast with which we had
 furnished them, than the Russians came in flat-bottomed boats; not a
 Janissary escaped. The Russians paid no attention to the condition we
 were in. There are French surgeons in all parts of the world; one of
 them who was very clever took us under his care--he cured us; and as
 long as I live I shall remember that as soon as my wounds were healed he
 made proposals to me. He bid us all be of good cheer, telling us that
 the like had happened in many sieges, and that it was according to the
 laws of war.
 
 "As soon as my companions could walk, they were obliged to set out for
 Moscow. I fell to the share of a Boyard who made me his gardener, and
 gave me twenty lashes a day. But this nobleman having in two years' time
 been broke upon the wheel along with thirty more Boyards for some broils
 at court, I profited by that event; I fled. I traversed all Russia; I
 was a long time an inn-holder's servant at Riga, the same at Rostock, at
 Vismar, at Leipzig, at Cassel, at Utrecht, at Leyden, at the Hague, at
 Rotterdam. I waxed old in misery and disgrace, having only one-half of
 my posteriors, and always remembering I was a Pope's daughter. A hundred
 times I was upon the point of killing myself; but still I loved life.
 This ridiculous foible is perhaps one of our most fatal characteristics;
 for is there anything more absurd than to wish to carry continually a
 burden which one can always throw down? to detest existence and yet to
 cling to one's existence? in brief, to caress the serpent which devours
 us, till he has eaten our very heart?
 
 "In the different countries which it has been my lot to traverse, and
 the numerous inns where I have been servant, I have taken notice of a
 vast number of people who held their own existence in abhorrence, and
 yet I never knew of more than eight who voluntarily put an end to their
 misery; three negroes, four Englishmen, and a German professor named
 Robek.[14] I ended by being servant to the Jew, Don Issachar, who placed
 me near your presence, my fair lady. I am determined to share your fate,
 and have been much more affected with your misfortunes than with my own.
 I would never even have spoken to you of my misfortunes, had you not
 piqued me a little, and if it were not customary to tell stories on
 board a ship in order to pass away the time. In short, Miss Cunegonde, I
 have had experience, I know the world; therefore I advise you to divert
 yourself, and prevail upon each passenger to tell his story; and if
 there be one of them all, that has not cursed his life many a time, that
 has not frequently looked upon himself as the unhappiest of mortals, I
 give you leave to throw me headforemost into the sea."
 
 
 
 
 XIII
 
 HOW CANDIDE WAS FORCED AWAY FROM HIS FAIR CUNEGONDE AND THE OLD WOMAN.
 
 
 The beautiful Cunegonde having heard the old woman's history, paid her
 all the civilities due to a person of her rank and merit. She likewise
 accepted her proposal, and engaged all the passengers, one after the
 other, to relate their adventures; and then both she and Candide allowed
 that the old woman was in the right.
 
 "It is a great pity," said Candide, "that the sage Pangloss was hanged
 contrary to custom at an _auto-da-fe_; he would tell us most amazing
 things in regard to the physical and moral evils that overspread earth
 and sea, and I should be able, with due respect, to make a few
 objections."
 
 While each passenger was recounting his story, the ship made her way.
 They landed at Buenos Ayres. Cunegonde, Captain Candide, and the old
 woman, waited on the Governor, Don Fernando d'Ibaraa, y Figueora, y
 Mascarenes, y Lampourdos, y Souza. This nobleman had a stateliness
 becoming a person who bore so many names. He spoke to men with so noble
 a disdain, carried his nose so loftily, raised his voice so
 unmercifully, assumed so imperious an air, and stalked with such
 intolerable pride, that those who saluted him were strongly inclined to
 give him a good drubbing. Cunegonde appeared to him the most beautiful
 he had ever met. The first thing he did was to ask whether she was not
 the captain's wife. The manner in which he asked the question alarmed
 Candide; he durst not say she was his wife, because indeed she was not;
 neither durst he say she was his sister, because it was not so; and
 although this obliging lie had been formerly much in favour among the
 ancients, and although it could be useful to the moderns, his soul was
 too pure to betray the truth.
 
 "Miss Cunegonde," said he, "is to do me the honour to marry me, and we
 beseech your excellency to deign to sanction our marriage."
 
 Don Fernando d'Ibaraa, y Figueora, y Mascarenes, y Lampourdos, y Souza,
 turning up his moustachios, smiled mockingly, and ordered Captain
 Candide to go and review his company. Candide obeyed, and the Governor
 remained alone with Miss Cunegonde. He declared his passion, protesting
 he would marry her the next day in the face of the church, or otherwise,
 just as should be agreeable to herself. Cunegonde asked a quarter of an
 hour to consider of it, to consult the old woman, and to take her
 resolution.
 
 The old woman spoke thus to Cunegonde:
 
 "Miss, you have seventy-two quarterings, and not a farthing; it is now
 in your power to be wife to the greatest lord in South America, who has
 very beautiful moustachios. Is it for you to pique yourself upon
 inviolable fidelity? You have been ravished by Bulgarians; a Jew and an
 Inquisitor have enjoyed your favours. Misfortune gives sufficient
 excuse. I own, that if I were in your place, I should have no scruple in
 marrying the Governor and in making the fortune of Captain Candide."
 
 While the old woman spoke with all the prudence which age and experience
 gave, a small ship entered the port on board of which were an Alcalde
 and his alguazils, and this was what had happened.
 
 As the old woman had shrewdly guessed, it was a Grey Friar who stole
 Cunegonde's money and jewels in the town of Badajos, when she and
 Candide were escaping. The Friar wanted to sell some of the diamonds to
 a jeweller; the jeweller knew them to be the Grand Inquisitor's. The
 Friar before he was hanged confessed he had stolen them. He described
 the persons, and the route they had taken. The flight of Cunegonde and
 Candide was already known. They were traced to Cadiz. A vessel was
 immediately sent in pursuit of them. The vessel was already in the port
 of Buenos Ayres. The report spread that the Alcalde was going to land,
 and that he was in pursuit of the murderers of my lord the Grand
 Inquisitor. The prudent old woman saw at once what was to be done.
 
 "You cannot run away," said she to Cunegonde, "and you have nothing to
 fear, for it was not you that killed my lord; besides the Governor who
 loves you will not suffer you to be ill-treated; therefore stay."
 
 She then ran immediately to Candide.
 
 "Fly," said she, "or in an hour you will be burnt."
 
 There was not a moment to lose; but how could he part from Cunegonde,
 and where could he flee for shelter?
 
 
 
 
 XIV
 
 HOW CANDIDE AND CACAMBO WERE RECEIVED BY THE JESUITS OF PARAGUAY.
 
 
 Candide had brought such a valet with him from Cadiz, as one often meets
 with on the coasts of Spain and in the American colonies. He was a
 quarter Spaniard, born of a mongrel in Tucuman; he had been singing-boy,
 sacristan, sailor, monk, pedlar, soldier, and lackey. His name was
 Cacambo, and he loved his master, because his master was a very good
 man. He quickly saddled the two Andalusian horses.
 
 "Come, master, let us follow the old woman's advice; let us start, and
 run without looking behind us."
 
 Candide shed tears.
 
 "Oh! my dear Cunegonde! must I leave you just at a time when the
 Governor was going to sanction our nuptials? Cunegonde, brought to such
 a distance what will become of you?"
 
 "She will do as well as she can," said Cacambo; "the women are never at
 a loss, God provides for them, let us run."
 
 "Whither art thou carrying me? Where shall we go? What shall we do
 without Cunegonde?" said Candide.
 
 "By St. James of Compostella," said Cacambo, "you were going to fight
 against the Jesuits; let us go to fight for them; I know the road well,
 I'll conduct you to their kingdom, where they will be charmed to have a
 captain that understands the Bulgarian exercise. You'll make a
 prodigious fortune; if we cannot find our account in one world we shall
 in another. It is a great pleasure to see and do new things."
 
 "You have before been in Paraguay, then?" said Candide.
 
 "Ay, sure," answered Cacambo, "I was servant in the College of the
 Assumption, and am acquainted with the government of the good Fathers as
 well as I am with the streets of Cadiz. It is an admirable government.
 The kingdom is upwards of three hundred leagues in diameter, and divided
 into thirty provinces; there the Fathers possess all, and the people
 nothing; it is a masterpiece of reason and justice. For my part I see
 nothing so divine as the Fathers who here make war upon the kings of
 Spain and Portugal, and in Europe confess those kings; who here kill
 Spaniards, and in Madrid send them to heaven; this delights me, let us
 push forward. You are going to be the happiest of mortals. What pleasure
 will it be to those Fathers to hear that a captain who knows the
 Bulgarian exercise has come to them!"
 
 As soon as they reached the first barrier, Cacambo told the advanced
 guard that a captain wanted to speak with my lord the Commandant. Notice
 was given to the main guard, and immediately a Paraguayan officer ran
 and laid himself at the feet of the Commandant, to impart this news to
 him. Candide and Cacambo were disarmed, and their two Andalusian horses
 seized. The strangers were introduced between two files of musketeers;
 the Commandant was at the further end, with the three-cornered cap on
 his head, his gown tucked up, a sword by his side, and a spontoon[15] in
 his hand. He beckoned, and straightway the new-comers were encompassed
 by four-and-twenty soldiers. A sergeant told them they must wait, that
 the Commandant could not speak to them, and that the reverend Father
 Provincial does not suffer any Spaniard to open his mouth but in his
 presence, or to stay above three hours in the province.
 
 "And where is the reverend Father Provincial?" said Cacambo.
 
 "He is upon the parade just after celebrating mass," answered the
 sergeant, "and you cannot kiss his spurs till three hours hence."
 
 "However," said Cacambo, "the captain is not a Spaniard, but a German,
 he is ready to perish with hunger as well as myself; cannot we have
 something for breakfast, while we wait for his reverence?"
 
 The sergeant went immediately to acquaint the Commandant with what he
 had heard.
 
 "God be praised!" said the reverend Commandant, "since he is a German, I
 may speak to him; take him to my arbour."
 
 Candide was at once conducted to a beautiful summer-house, ornamented
 with a very pretty colonnade of green and gold marble, and with
 trellises, enclosing parraquets, humming-birds, fly-birds, guinea-hens,
 and all other rare birds. An excellent breakfast was provided in vessels
 of gold; and while the Paraguayans were eating maize out of wooden
 dishes, in the open fields and exposed to the heat of the sun, the
 reverend Father Commandant retired to his arbour.
 
 He was a very handsome young man, with a full face, white skin but high
 in colour; he had an arched eyebrow, a lively eye, red ears, vermilion
 lips, a bold air, but such a boldness as neither belonged to a Spaniard
 nor a Jesuit. They returned their arms to Candide and Cacambo, and also
 the two Andalusian horses; to whom Cacambo gave some oats to eat just by
 the arbour, having an eye upon them all the while for fear of a
 surprise.
 
 Candide first kissed the hem of the Commandant's robe, then they sat
 down to table.
 
 "You are, then, a German?" said the Jesuit to him in that language.
 
 "Yes, reverend Father," answered Candide.
 
 As they pronounced these words they looked at each other with great
 amazement, and with such an emotion as they could not conceal.
 
 "And from what part of Germany do you come?" said the Jesuit.
 
 "I am from the dirty province of Westphalia," answered Candide; "I was
 born in the Castle of Thunder-ten-Tronckh."
 
 "Oh! Heavens! is it possible?" cried the Commandant.
 
 "What a miracle!" cried Candide.
 
 "Is it really you?" said the Commandant.
 
 "It is not possible!" said Candide.
 
 They drew back; they embraced; they shed rivulets of tears.
 
 "What, is it you, reverend Father? You, the brother of the fair
 Cunegonde! You, that was slain by the Bulgarians! You, the Baron's son!
 You, a Jesuit in Paraguay! I must confess this is a strange world that
 we live in. Oh, Pangloss! Pangloss! how glad you would be if you had not
 been hanged!"
 
 The Commandant sent away the negro slaves and the Paraguayans, who
 served them with liquors in goblets of rock-crystal. He thanked God and
 St. Ignatius a thousand times; he clasped Candide in his arms; and their
 faces were all bathed with tears.
 
 "You will be more surprised, more affected, and transported," said
 Candide, "when I tell you that Cunegonde, your sister, whom you believe
 to have been ripped open, is in perfect health."
 
 "Where?"
 
 "In your neighbourhood, with the Governor of Buenos Ayres; and I was
 going to fight against you."
 
 Every word which they uttered in this long conversation but added wonder
 to wonder. Their souls fluttered on their tongues, listened in their
 ears, and sparkled in their eyes. As they were Germans, they sat a good
 while at table, waiting for the reverend Father Provincial, and the
 Commandant spoke to his dear Candide as follows.
 
 
 
 
 XV
 
 HOW CANDIDE KILLED THE BROTHER OF HIS DEAR CUNEGONDE.
 
 
 "I shall have ever present to my memory the dreadful day, on which I saw
 my father and mother killed, and my sister ravished. When the Bulgarians
 retired, my dear sister could not be found; but my mother, my father,
 and myself, with two maid-servants and three little boys all of whom had
 been slain, were put in a hearse, to be conveyed for interment to a
 chapel belonging to the Jesuits, within two leagues of our family seat.
 A Jesuit sprinkled us with some holy water; it was horribly salt; a few
 drops of it fell into my eyes; the father perceived that my eyelids
 stirred a little; he put his hand upon my heart and felt it beat. I
 received assistance, and at the end of three weeks I recovered. You
 know, my dear Candide, I was very pretty; but I grew much prettier, and
 the reverend Father Didrie,[16] Superior of that House, conceived the
 tenderest friendship for me; he gave me the habit of the order, some
 years after I was sent to Rome. The Father-General needed new levies of
 young German-Jesuits. The sovereigns of Paraguay admit as few Spanish
 Jesuits as possible; they prefer those of other nations as being more
 subordinate to their commands. I was judged fit by the reverend
 Father-General to go and work in this vineyard. We set out--a Pole, a
 Tyrolese, and myself. Upon my arrival I was honoured with a
 sub-deaconship and a lieutenancy. I am to-day colonel and priest. We
 shall give a warm reception to the King of Spain's troops; I will answer
 for it that they shall be excommunicated and well beaten. Providence
 sends you here to assist us. But is it, indeed, true that my dear sister
 Cunegonde is in the neighbourhood, with the Governor of Buenos Ayres?"
 
 Candide assured him on oath that nothing was more true, and their tears
 began afresh.
 
 The Baron could not refrain from embracing Candide; he called him his
 brother, his saviour.
 
 "Ah! perhaps," said he, "we shall together, my dear Candide, enter the
 town as conquerors, and recover my sister Cunegonde."
 
 "That is all I want," said Candide, "for I intended to marry her, and I
 still hope to do so."
 
 "You insolent!" replied the Baron, "would you have the impudence to
 marry my sister who has seventy-two quarterings! I find thou hast the
 most consummate effrontery to dare to mention so presumptuous a design!"
 
 Candide, petrified at this speech, made answer:
 
 "Reverend Father, all the quarterings in the world signify nothing; I
 rescued your sister from the arms of a Jew and of an Inquisitor; she has
 great obligations to me, she wishes to marry me; Master Pangloss always
 told me that all men are equal, and certainly I will marry her."
 
 "We shall see that, thou scoundrel!" said the Jesuit Baron de
 Thunder-ten-Tronckh, and that instant struck him across the face with
 the flat of his sword. Candide in an instant drew his rapier, and
 plunged it up to the hilt in the Jesuit's belly; but in pulling it out
 reeking hot, he burst into tears.
 
 "Good God!" said he, "I have killed my old master, my friend, my
 brother-in-law! I am the best-natured creature in the world, and yet I
 have already killed three men, and of these three two were priests."
 
 Cacambo, who stood sentry by the door of the arbour, ran to him.
 
 "We have nothing more for it than to sell our lives as dearly as we
 can," said his master to him, "without doubt some one will soon enter
 the arbour, and we must die sword in hand."
 
 Cacambo, who had been in a great many scrapes in his lifetime, did not
 lose his head; he took the Baron's Jesuit habit, put it on Candide, gave
 him the square cap, and made him mount on horseback. All this was done
 in the twinkling of an eye.
 
 "Let us gallop fast, master, everybody will take you for a Jesuit, going
 to give directions to your men, and we shall have passed the frontiers
 before they will be able to overtake us."
 
 He flew as he spoke these words, crying out aloud in Spanish:
 
 "Make way, make way, for the reverend Father Colonel."
 
 
 
 
 XVI
 
 ADVENTURES OF THE TWO TRAVELLERS, WITH TWO GIRLS, TWO MONKEYS, AND THE
 SAVAGES CALLED OREILLONS.
 
 
 Candide and his valet had got beyond the barrier, before it was known in
 the camp that the German Jesuit was dead. The wary Cacambo had taken
 care to fill his wallet with bread, chocolate, bacon, fruit, and a few
 bottles of wine. With their Andalusian horses they penetrated into an
 unknown country, where they perceived no beaten track. At length they
 came to a beautiful meadow intersected with purling rills. Here our two
 adventurers fed their horses. Cacambo proposed to his master to take
 some food, and he set him an example.
 
 "How can you ask me to eat ham," said Candide, "after killing the
 Baron's son, and being doomed never more to see the beautiful Cunegonde?
 What will it avail me to spin out my wretched days and drag them far
 from her in remorse and despair? And what will the _Journal of
 Trevoux_[17] say?"
 
 While he was thus lamenting his fate, he went on eating. The sun went
 down. The two wanderers heard some little cries which seemed to be
 uttered by women. They did not know whether they were cries of pain or
 joy; but they started up precipitately with that inquietude and alarm
 which every little thing inspires in an unknown country. The noise was
 made by two naked girls, who tripped along the mead, while two monkeys
 were pursuing them and biting their buttocks. Candide was moved with
 pity; he had learned to fire a gun in the Bulgarian service, and he was
 so clever at it, that he could hit a filbert in a hedge without touching
 a leaf of the tree. He took up his double-barrelled Spanish fusil, let
 it off, and killed the two monkeys.
 
 "God be praised! My dear Cacambo, I have rescued those two poor
 creatures from a most perilous situation. If I have committed a sin in
 killing an Inquisitor and a Jesuit, I have made ample amends by saving
 the lives of these girls. Perhaps they are young ladies of family; and
 this adventure may procure us great advantages in this country."
 
 He was continuing, but stopped short when he saw the two girls tenderly
 embracing the monkeys, bathing their bodies in tears, and rending the
 air with the most dismal lamentations.
 
 "Little did I expect to see such good-nature," said he at length to
 Cacambo; who made answer:
 
 "Master, you have done a fine thing now; you have slain the sweethearts
 of those two young ladies."
 
 "The sweethearts! Is it possible? You are jesting, Cacambo, I can never
 believe it!"
 
 "Dear master," replied Cacambo; "you are surprised at everything. Why
 should you think it so strange that in some countries there are monkeys
 which insinuate themselves into the good graces of the ladies; they are
 a fourth part human, as I am a fourth part Spaniard."
 
 "Alas!" replied Candide, "I remember to have heard Master Pangloss say,
 that formerly such accidents used to happen; that these mixtures were
 productive of Centaurs, Fauns, and Satyrs; and that many of the ancients
 had seen such monsters, but I looked upon the whole as fabulous."
 
 "You ought now to be convinced," said Cacambo, "that it is the truth,
 and you see what use is made of those creatures, by persons that have
 not had a proper education; all I fear is that those ladies will play us
 some ugly trick."
 
 These sound reflections induced Candide to leave the meadow and to
 plunge into a wood. He supped there with Cacambo; and after cursing the
 Portuguese inquisitor, the Governor of Buenos Ayres, and the Baron, they
 fell asleep on moss. On awaking they felt that they could not move; for
 during the night the Oreillons, who inhabited that country, and to whom
 the ladies had denounced them, had bound them with cords made of the
 bark of trees. They were encompassed by fifty naked Oreillons, armed
 with bows and arrows, with clubs and flint hatchets. Some were making a
 large cauldron boil, others were preparing spits, and all cried:
 
 "A Jesuit! a Jesuit! we shall be revenged, we shall have excellent
 cheer, let us eat the Jesuit, let us eat him up!"
 
 "I told you, my dear master," cried Cacambo sadly, "that those two girls
 would play us some ugly trick."
 
 Candide seeing the cauldron and the spits, cried:
 
 "We are certainly going to be either roasted or boiled. Ah! what would
 Master Pangloss say, were he to see how pure nature is formed?
 Everything is right, may be, but I declare it is very hard to have lost
 Miss Cunegonde and to be put upon a spit by Oreillons."
 
 Cacambo never lost his head.
 
 "Do not despair," said he to the disconsolate Candide, "I understand a
 little of the jargon of these people, I will speak to them."
 
 "Be sure," said Candide, "to represent to them how frightfully inhuman
 it is to cook men, and how very un-Christian."
 
 "Gentlemen," said Cacambo, "you reckon you are to-day going to feast
 upon a Jesuit. It is all very well, nothing is more unjust than thus to
 treat your enemies. Indeed, the law of nature teaches us to kill our
 neighbour, and such is the practice all over the world. If we do not
 accustom ourselves to eating them, it is because we have better fare.
 But you have not the same resources as we; certainly it is much better
 to devour your enemies than to resign to the crows and rooks the fruits
 of your victory. But, gentlemen, surely you would not choose to eat your
 friends. You believe that you are going to spit a Jesuit, and he is your
 defender. It is the enemy of your enemies that you are going to roast.
 As for myself, I was born in your country; this gentleman is my master,
 and, far from being a Jesuit, he has just killed one, whose spoils he
 wears; and thence comes your mistake. To convince you of the truth of
 what I say, take his habit and carry it to the first barrier of the
 Jesuit kingdom, and inform yourselves whether my master did not kill a
 Jesuit officer. It will not take you long, and you can always eat us if
 you find that I have lied to you. But I have told you the truth. You are
 too well acquainted with the principles of public law, humanity, and
 justice not to pardon us."
 
 The Oreillons found this speech very reasonable. They deputed two of
 their principal people with all expedition to inquire into the truth of
 the matter; these executed their commission like men of sense, and soon
 returned with good news. The Oreillons untied their prisoners, showed
 them all sorts of civilities, offered them girls, gave them refreshment,
 and reconducted them to the confines of their territories, proclaiming
 with great joy:
 
 "He is no Jesuit! He is no Jesuit!"
 
 Candide could not help being surprised at the cause of his deliverance.
 
 "What people!" said he; "what men! what manners! If I had not been so
 lucky as to run Miss Cunegonde's brother through the body, I should have
 been devoured without redemption. But, after all, pure nature is good,
 since these people, instead of feasting upon my flesh, have shown me a
 thousand civilities, when then I was not a Jesuit."
 
 
 
 
 XVII
 
 ARRIVAL OF CANDIDE AND HIS VALET AT EL DORADO, AND WHAT THEY SAW THERE.
 
 
 "You see," said Cacambo to Candide, as soon as they had reached the
 frontiers of the Oreillons, "that this hemisphere is not better than the
 others, take my word for it; let us go back to Europe by the shortest
 way."
 
 "How go back?" said Candide, "and where shall we go? to my own country?
 The Bulgarians and the Abares are slaying all; to Portugal? there I
 shall be burnt; and if we abide here we are every moment in danger of
 being spitted. But how can I resolve to quit a part of the world where
 my dear Cunegonde resides?"
 
 "Let us turn towards Cayenne," said Cacambo, "there we shall find
 Frenchmen, who wander all over the world; they may assist us; God will
 perhaps have pity on us."
 
 It was not easy to get to Cayenne; they knew vaguely in which direction
 to go, but rivers, precipices, robbers, savages, obstructed them all the
 way. Their horses died of fatigue. Their provisions were consumed; they
 fed a whole month upon wild fruits, and found themselves at last near a
 little river bordered with cocoa trees, which sustained their lives and
 their hopes.
 
 Cacambo, who was as good a counsellor as the old woman, said to Candide:
 
 "We are able to hold out no longer; we have walked enough. I see an
 empty canoe near the river-side; let us fill it with cocoanuts, throw
 ourselves into it, and go with the current; a river always leads to some
 inhabited spot. If we do not find pleasant things we shall at least find
 new things."
 
 "With all my heart," said Candide, "let us recommend ourselves to
 Providence."
 
 They rowed a few leagues, between banks, in some places flowery, in
 others barren; in some parts smooth, in others rugged. The stream ever
 widened, and at length lost itself under an arch of frightful rocks
 which reached to the sky. The two travellers had the courage to commit
 themselves to the current. The river, suddenly contracting at this
 place, whirled them along with a dreadful noise and rapidity. At the end
 of four-and-twenty hours they saw daylight again, but their canoe was
 dashed to pieces against the rocks. For a league they had to creep from
 rock to rock, until at length they discovered an extensive plain,
 bounded by inaccessible mountains. The country was cultivated as much
 for pleasure as for necessity. On all sides the useful was also the
 beautiful. The roads were covered, or rather adorned, with carriages of
 a glittering form and substance, in which were men and women of
 surprising beauty, drawn by large red sheep which surpassed in fleetness
 the finest coursers of Andalusia, Tetuan, and Mequinez.[18]
 
 "Here, however, is a country," said Candide, "which is better than
 Westphalia."
 
 He stepped out with Cacambo towards the first village which he saw. Some
 children dressed in tattered brocades played at quoits on the outskirts.
 Our travellers from the other world amused themselves by looking on. The
 quoits were large round pieces, yellow, red, and green, which cast a
 singular lustre! The travellers picked a few of them off the ground;
 this was of gold, that of emeralds, the other of rubies--the least of
 them would have been the greatest ornament on the Mogul's throne.
 
 "Without doubt," said Cacambo, "these children must be the king's sons
 that are playing at quoits!"
 
 The village schoolmaster appeared at this moment and called them to
 school.
 
 "There," said Candide, "is the preceptor of the royal family."
 
 The little truants immediately quitted their game, leaving the quoits
 on the ground with all their other playthings. Candide gathered them up,
 ran to the master, and presented them to him in a most humble manner,
 giving him to understand by signs that their royal highnesses had
 forgotten their gold and jewels. The schoolmaster, smiling, flung them
 upon the ground; then, looking at Candide with a good deal of surprise,
 went about his business.
 
 The travellers, however, took care to gather up the gold, the rubies,
 and the emeralds.
 
 "Where are we?" cried Candide. "The king's children in this country must
 be well brought up, since they are taught to despise gold and precious
 stones."
 
 Cacambo was as much surprised as Candide. At length they drew near the
 first house in the village. It was built like an European palace. A
 crowd of people pressed about the door, and there were still more in the
 house. They heard most agreeable music, and were aware of a delicious
 odour of cooking. Cacambo went up to the door and heard they were
 talking Peruvian; it was his mother tongue, for it is well known that
 Cacambo was born in Tucuman, in a village where no other language was
 spoken.
 
 "I will be your interpreter here," said he to Candide; "let us go in, it
 is a public-house."
 
 Immediately two waiters and two girls, dressed in cloth of gold, and
 their hair tied up with ribbons, invited them to sit down to table with
 the landlord. They served four dishes of soup, each garnished with two
 young parrots; a boiled condor[19] which weighed two hundred pounds; two
 roasted monkeys, of excellent flavour; three hundred humming-birds in
 one dish, and six hundred fly-birds in another; exquisite ragouts;
 delicious pastries; the whole served up in dishes of a kind of
 rock-crystal. The waiters and girls poured out several liqueurs drawn
 from the sugar-cane.
 
 Most of the company were chapmen and waggoners, all extremely polite;
 they asked Cacambo a few questions with the greatest circumspection, and
 answered his in the most obliging manner.
 
 As soon as dinner was over, Cacambo believed as well as Candide that
 they might well pay their reckoning by laying down two of those large
 gold pieces which they had picked up. The landlord and landlady shouted
 with laughter and held their sides. When the fit was over:
 
 "Gentlemen," said the landlord, "it is plain you are strangers, and such
 guests we are not accustomed to see; pardon us therefore for laughing
 when you offered us the pebbles from our highroads in payment of your
 reckoning. You doubtless have not the money of the country; but it is
 not necessary to have any money at all to dine in this house. All
 hostelries established for the convenience of commerce are paid by the
 government. You have fared but very indifferently because this is a poor
 village; but everywhere else, you will be received as you deserve."
 
 Cacambo explained this whole discourse with great astonishment to
 Candide, who was as greatly astonished to hear it.
 
 "What sort of a country then is this," said they to one another; "a
 country unknown to all the rest of the world, and where nature is of a
 kind so different from ours? It is probably the country where all is
 well; for there absolutely must be one such place. And, whatever Master
 Pangloss might say, I often found that things went very ill in
 Westphalia."
 
 
 
 
 XVIII
 
 WHAT THEY SAW IN THE COUNTRY OF EL DORADO.
 
 
 Cacambo expressed his curiosity to the landlord, who made answer:
 
 "I am very ignorant, but not the worse on that account. However, we have
 in this neighbourhood an old man retired from Court who is the most
 learned and most communicative person in the kingdom."
 
 At once he took Cacambo to the old man. Candide acted now only a second
 character, and accompanied his valet. They entered a very plain house,
 for the door was only of silver, and the ceilings were only of gold, but
 wrought in so elegant a taste as to vie with the richest. The
 antechamber, indeed, was only encrusted with rubies and emeralds, but
 the order in which everything was arranged made amends for this great
 simplicity.
 
 The old man received the strangers on his sofa, which was stuffed with
 humming-birds' feathers, and ordered his servants to present them with
 liqueurs in diamond goblets; after which he satisfied their curiosity
 in the following terms:
 
 "I am now one hundred and seventy-two years old, and I learnt of my late
 father, Master of the Horse to the King, the amazing revolutions of
 Peru, of which he had been an eyewitness. The kingdom we now inhabit is
 the ancient country of the Incas, who quitted it very imprudently to
 conquer another part of the world, and were at length destroyed by the
 Spaniards.
 
 "More wise by far were the princes of their family, who remained in
 their native country; and they ordained, with the consent of the whole
 nation, that none of the inhabitants should ever be permitted to quit
 this little kingdom; and this has preserved our innocence and happiness.
 The Spaniards have had a confused notion of this country, and have
 called it _El Dorado_; and an Englishman, whose name was Sir Walter
 Raleigh, came very near it about a hundred years ago; but being
 surrounded by inaccessible rocks and precipices, we have hitherto been
 sheltered from the rapaciousness of European nations, who have an
 inconceivable passion for the pebbles and dirt of our land, for the sake
 of which they would murder us to the last man."
 
 The conversation was long: it turned chiefly on their form of
 government, their manners, their women, their public entertainments,
 and the arts. At length Candide, having always had a taste for
 metaphysics, made Cacambo ask whether there was any religion in that
 country.
 
 The old man reddened a little.
 
 "How then," said he, "can you doubt it? Do you take us for ungrateful
 wretches?"
 
 Cacambo humbly asked, "What was the religion in El Dorado?"
 
 The old man reddened again.
 
 "Can there be two religions?" said he. "We have, I believe, the religion
 of all the world: we worship God night and morning."
 
 "Do you worship but one God?" said Cacambo, who still acted as
 interpreter in representing Candide's doubts.
 
 "Surely," said the old man, "there are not two, nor three, nor four. I
 must confess the people from your side of the world ask very
 extraordinary questions."
 
 Candide was not yet tired of interrogating the good old man; he wanted
 to know in what manner they prayed to God in El Dorado.
 
 "We do not pray to Him," said the worthy sage; "we have nothing to ask
 of Him; He has given us all we need, and we return Him thanks without
 ceasing."
 
 Candide having a curiosity to see the priests asked where they were.
 The good old man smiled.
 
 "My friend," said he, "we are all priests. The King and all the heads of
 families sing solemn canticles of thanksgiving every morning,
 accompanied by five or six thousand musicians."
 
 "What! have you no monks who teach, who dispute, who govern, who cabal,
 and who burn people that are not of their opinion?"
 
 "We must be mad, indeed, if that were the case," said the old man; "here
 we are all of one opinion, and we know not what you mean by monks."
 
 During this whole discourse Candide was in raptures, and he said to
 himself:
 
 "This is vastly different from Westphalia and the Baron's castle. Had
 our friend Pangloss seen El Dorado he would no longer have said that the
 castle of Thunder-ten-Tronckh was the finest upon earth. It is evident
 that one must travel."
 
 After this long conversation the old man ordered a coach and six sheep
 to be got ready, and twelve of his domestics to conduct the travellers
 to Court.
 
 "Excuse me," said he, "if my age deprives me of the honour of
 accompanying you. The King will receive you in a manner that cannot
 displease you; and no doubt you will make an allowance for the customs
 of the country, if some things should not be to your liking."
 
 Candide and Cacambo got into the coach, the six sheep flew, and in less
 than four hours they reached the King's palace situated at the extremity
 of the capital. The portal was two hundred and twenty feet high, and one
 hundred wide; but words are wanting to express the materials of which it
 was built. It is plain such materials must have prodigious superiority
 over those pebbles and sand which we call gold and precious stones.
 
 Twenty beautiful damsels of the King's guard received Candide and
 Cacambo as they alighted from the coach, conducted them to the bath, and
 dressed them in robes woven of the down of humming-birds; after which
 the great crown officers, of both sexes, led them to the King's
 apartment, between two files of musicians, a thousand on each side. When
 they drew near to the audience chamber Cacambo asked one of the great
 officers in what way he should pay his obeisance to his Majesty; whether
 they should throw themselves upon their knees or on their stomachs;
 whether they should put their hands upon their heads or behind their
 backs; whether they should lick the dust off the floor; in a word, what
 was the ceremony?
 
 "The custom," said the great officer, "is to embrace the King, and to
 kiss him on each cheek."
 
 Candide and Cacambo threw themselves round his Majesty's neck. He
 received them with all the goodness imaginable, and politely invited
 them to supper.
 
 While waiting they were shown the city, and saw the public edifices
 raised as high as the clouds, the market places ornamented with a
 thousand columns, the fountains of spring water, those of rose water,
 those of liqueurs drawn from sugar-cane, incessantly flowing into the
 great squares, which were paved with a kind of precious stone, which
 gave off a delicious fragrancy like that of cloves and cinnamon. Candide
 asked to see the court of justice, the parliament. They told him they
 had none, and that they were strangers to lawsuits. He asked if they had
 any prisons, and they answered no. But what surprised him most and gave
 him the greatest pleasure was the palace of sciences, where he saw a
 gallery two thousand feet long, and filled with instruments employed in
 mathematics and physics.
 
 After rambling about the city the whole afternoon, and seeing but a
 thousandth part of it, they were reconducted to the royal palace, where
 Candide sat down to table with his Majesty, his valet Cacambo, and
 several ladies. Never was there a better entertainment, and never was
 more wit shown at a table than that which fell from his Majesty. Cacambo
 explained the King's _bon-mots_ to Candide, and notwithstanding they
 were translated they still appeared to be _bon-mots_. Of all the things
 that surprised Candide this was not the least.
 
 They spent a month in this hospitable place. Candide frequently said to
 Cacambo:
 
 "I own, my friend, once more that the castle where I was born is nothing
 in comparison with this; but, after all, Miss Cunegonde is not here, and
 you have, without doubt, some mistress in Europe. If we abide here we
 shall only be upon a footing with the rest, whereas, if we return to our
 old world, only with twelve sheep laden with the pebbles of El Dorado,
 we shall be richer than all the kings in Europe. We shall have no more
 Inquisitors to fear, and we may easily recover Miss Cunegonde."
 
 This speech was agreeable to Cacambo; mankind are so fond of roving, of
 making a figure in their own country, and of boasting of what they have
 seen in their travels, that the two happy ones resolved to be no longer
 so, but to ask his Majesty's leave to quit the country.
 
 "You are foolish," said the King. "I am sensible that my kingdom is but
 a small place, but when a person is comfortably settled in any part he
 should abide there. I have not the right to detain strangers. It is a
 tyranny which neither our manners nor our laws permit. All men are free.
 Go when you wish, but the going will be very difficult. It is impossible
 to ascend that rapid river on which you came as by a miracle, and which
 runs under vaulted rocks. The mountains which surround my kingdom are
 ten thousand feet high, and as steep as walls; they are each over ten
 leagues in breadth, and there is no other way to descend them than by
 precipices. However, since you absolutely wish to depart, I shall give
 orders to my engineers to construct a machine that will convey you very
 safely. When we have conducted you over the mountains no one can
 accompany you further, for my subjects have made a vow never to quit the
 kingdom, and they are too wise to break it. Ask me besides anything that
 you please."
 
 "We desire nothing of your Majesty," says Candide, "but a few sheep
 laden with provisions, pebbles, and the earth of this country."
 
 The King laughed.
 
 "I cannot conceive," said he, "what pleasure you Europeans find in our
 yellow clay, but take as much as you like, and great good may it do
 you."
 
 At once he gave directions that his engineers should construct a machine
 to hoist up these two extraordinary men out of the kingdom. Three
 thousand good mathematicians went to work; it was ready in fifteen days,
 and did not cost more than twenty million sterling in the specie of that
 country. They placed Candide and Cacambo on the machine. There were two
 great red sheep saddled and bridled to ride upon as soon as they were
 beyond the mountains, twenty pack-sheep laden with provisions, thirty
 with presents of the curiosities of the country, and fifty with gold,
 diamonds, and precious stones. The King embraced the two wanderers very
 tenderly.
 
 Their departure, with the ingenious manner in which they and their sheep
 were hoisted over the mountains, was a splendid spectacle. The
 mathematicians took their leave after conveying them to a place of
 safety, and Candide had no other desire, no other aim, than to present
 his sheep to Miss Cunegonde.
 
 "Now," said he, "we are able to pay the Governor of Buenos Ayres if Miss
 Cunegonde can be ransomed. Let us journey towards Cayenne. Let us
 embark, and we will afterwards see what kingdom we shall be able to
 purchase."
 
 
 
 
 XIX
 
 WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM AT SURINAM AND HOW CANDIDE GOT ACQUAINTED WITH
 MARTIN.
 
 
 Our travellers spent the first day very agreeably. They were delighted
 with possessing more treasure than all Asia, Europe, and Africa could
 scrape together. Candide, in his raptures, cut Cunegonde's name on the
 trees. The second day two of their sheep plunged into a morass, where
 they and their burdens were lost; two more died of fatigue a few days
 after; seven or eight perished with hunger in a desert; and others
 subsequently fell down precipices. At length, after travelling a hundred
 days, only two sheep remained. Said Candide to Cacambo:
 
 "My friend, you see how perishable are the riches of this world; there
 is nothing solid but virtue, and the happiness of seeing Cunegonde once
 more."
 
 "I grant all you say," said Cacambo, "but we have still two sheep
 remaining, with more treasure than the King of Spain will ever have; and
 I see a town which I take to be Surinam, belonging to the Dutch. We are
 at the end of all our troubles, and at the beginning of happiness."
 
 As they drew near the town, they saw a negro stretched upon the ground,
 with only one moiety of his clothes, that is, of his blue linen drawers;
 the poor man had lost his left leg and his right hand.
 
 "Good God!" said Candide in Dutch, "what art thou doing there, friend,
 in that shocking condition?"
 
 "I am waiting for my master, Mynheer Vanderdendur, the famous merchant,"
 answered the negro.
 
 "Was it Mynheer Vanderdendur," said Candide, "that treated thee thus?"
 
 "Yes, sir," said the negro, "it is the custom. They give us a pair of
 linen drawers for our whole garment twice a year. When we work at the
 sugar-canes, and the mill snatches hold of a finger, they cut off the
 hand; and when we attempt to run away, they cut off the leg; both cases
 have happened to me. This is the price at which you eat sugar in Europe.
 Yet when my mother sold me for ten patagons[20] on the coast of Guinea,
 she said to me: 'My dear child, bless our fetiches, adore them for ever;
 they will make thee live happily; thou hast the honour of being the
 slave of our lords, the whites, which is making the fortune of thy
 father and mother.' Alas! I know not whether I have made their fortunes;
 this I know, that they have not made mine. Dogs, monkeys, and parrots
 are a thousand times less wretched than I. The Dutch fetiches, who have
 converted me, declare every Sunday that we are all of us children of
 Adam--blacks as well as whites. I am not a genealogist, but if these
 preachers tell truth, we are all second cousins. Now, you must agree,
 that it is impossible to treat one's relations in a more barbarous
 manner."
 
 "Oh, Pangloss!" cried Candide, "thou hadst not guessed at this
 abomination; it is the end. I must at last renounce thy optimism."
 
 "What is this optimism?" said Cacambo.
 
 "Alas!" said Candide, "it is the madness of maintaining that everything
 is right when it is wrong."
 
 Looking at the negro, he shed tears, and weeping, he entered Surinam.
 
 The first thing they inquired after was whether there was a vessel in
 the harbour which could be sent to Buenos Ayres. The person to whom they
 applied was a Spanish sea-captain, who offered to agree with them upon
 reasonable terms. He appointed to meet them at a public-house, whither
 Candide and the faithful Cacambo went with their two sheep, and awaited
 his coming.
 
 Candide, who had his heart upon his lips, told the Spaniard all his
 adventures, and avowed that he intended to elope with Miss Cunegonde.
 
 "Then I will take good care not to carry you to Buenos Ayres," said the
 seaman. "I should be hanged, and so would you. The fair Cunegonde is my
 lord's favourite mistress."
 
 This was a thunderclap for Candide: he wept for a long while. At last he
 drew Cacambo aside.
 
 "Here, my dear friend," said he to him, "this thou must do. We have,
 each of us in his pocket, five or six millions in diamonds; you are more
 clever than I; you must go and bring Miss Cunegonde from Buenos Ayres.
 If the Governor makes any difficulty, give him a million; if he will not
 relinquish her, give him two; as you have not killed an Inquisitor, they
 will have no suspicion of you; I'll get another ship, and go and wait
 for you at Venice; that's a free country, where there is no danger
 either from Bulgarians, Abares, Jews, or Inquisitors."
 
 Cacambo applauded this wise resolution. He despaired at parting from so
 good a master, who had become his intimate friend; but the pleasure of
 serving him prevailed over the pain of leaving him. They embraced with
 tears; Candide charged him not to forget the good old woman. Cacambo
 set out that very same day. This Cacambo was a very honest fellow.
 
 Candide stayed some time longer in Surinam, waiting for another captain
 to carry him and the two remaining sheep to Italy. After he had hired
 domestics, and purchased everything necessary for a long voyage, Mynheer
 Vanderdendur, captain of a large vessel, came and offered his services.
 
 "How much will you charge," said he to this man, "to carry me straight
 to Venice--me, my servants, my baggage, and these two sheep?"
 
 The skipper asked ten thousand piastres. Candide did not hesitate.
 
 "Oh! oh!" said the prudent Vanderdendur to himself, "this stranger gives
 ten thousand piastres unhesitatingly! He must be very rich."
 
 Returning a little while after, he let him know that upon second
 consideration, he could not undertake the voyage for less than twenty
 thousand piastres.
 
 "Well, you shall have them," said Candide.
 
 "Ay!" said the skipper to himself, "this man agrees to pay twenty
 thousand piastres with as much ease as ten."
 
 He went back to him again, and declared that he could not carry him to
 Venice for less than thirty thousand piastres.
 
 "Then you shall have thirty thousand," replied Candide.
 
 "Oh! oh!" said the Dutch skipper once more to himself, "thirty thousand
 piastres are a trifle to this man; surely these sheep must be laden with
 an immense treasure; let us say no more about it. First of all, let him
 pay down the thirty thousand piastres; then we shall see."
 
 Candide sold two small diamonds, the least of which was worth more than
 what the skipper asked for his freight. He paid him in advance. The two
 sheep were put on board. Candide followed in a little boat to join the
 vessel in the roads. The skipper seized his opportunity, set sail, and
 put out to sea, the wind favouring him. Candide, dismayed and stupefied,
 soon lost sight of the vessel.
 
 "Alas!" said he, "this is a trick worthy of the old world!"
 
 He put back, overwhelmed with sorrow, for indeed he had lost sufficient
 to make the fortune of twenty monarchs. He waited upon the Dutch
 magistrate, and in his distress he knocked over loudly at the door. He
 entered and told his adventure, raising his voice with unnecessary
 vehemence. The magistrate began by fining him ten thousand piastres for
 making a noise; then he listened patiently, promised to examine into his
 affair at the skipper's return, and ordered him to pay ten thousand
 piastres for the expense of the hearing.
 
 This drove Candide to despair; he had, indeed, endured misfortunes a
 thousand times worse; the coolness of the magistrate and of the skipper
 who had robbed him, roused his choler and flung him into a deep
 melancholy. The villainy of mankind presented itself before his
 imagination in all its deformity, and his mind was filled with gloomy
 ideas. At length hearing that a French vessel was ready to set sail for
 Bordeaux, as he had no sheep laden with diamonds to take along with him
 he hired a cabin at the usual price. He made it known in the town that
 he would pay the passage and board and give two thousand piastres to any
 honest man who would make the voyage with him, upon condition that this
 man was the most dissatisfied with his state, and the most unfortunate
 in the whole province.
 
 Such a crowd of candidates presented themselves that a fleet of ships
 could hardly have held them. Candide being desirous of selecting from
 among the best, marked out about one-twentieth of them who seemed to be
 sociable men, and who all pretended to merit his preference. He
 assembled them at his inn, and gave them a supper on condition that each
 took an oath to relate his history faithfully, promising to choose him
 who appeared to be most justly discontented with his state, and to
 bestow some presents upon the rest.
 
 They sat until four o'clock in the morning. Candide, in listening to all
 their adventures, was reminded of what the old woman had said to him in
 their voyage to Buenos Ayres, and of her wager that there was not a
 person on board the ship but had met with very great misfortunes. He
 dreamed of Pangloss at every adventure told to him.
 
 "This Pangloss," said he, "would be puzzled to demonstrate his system. I
 wish that he were here. Certainly, if all things are good, it is in El
 Dorado and not in the rest of the world."
 
 At length he made choice of a poor man of letters, who had worked ten
 years for the booksellers of Amsterdam. He judged that there was not in
 the whole world a trade which could disgust one more.
 
 This philosopher was an honest man; but he had been robbed by his wife,
 beaten by his son, and abandoned by his daughter who got a Portuguese to
 run away with her. He had just been deprived of a small employment, on
 which he subsisted; and he was persecuted by the preachers of Surinam,
 who took him for a Socinian. We must allow that the others were at least
 as wretched as he; but Candide hoped that the philosopher would
 entertain him during the voyage. All the other candidates complained
 that Candide had done them great injustice; but he appeased them by
 giving one hundred piastres to each.

 WHAT HAPPENED AT SEA TO CANDIDE AND MARTIN.
 
 
 The old philosopher, whose name was Martin, embarked then with Candide
 for Bordeaux. They had both seen and suffered a great deal; and if the
 vessel had sailed from Surinam to Japan, by the Cape of Good Hope, the
 subject of moral and natural evil would have enabled them to entertain
 one another during the whole voyage.
 
 Candide, however, had one great advantage over Martin, in that he always
 hoped to see Miss Cunegonde; whereas Martin had nothing at all to hope.
 Besides, Candide was possessed of money and jewels, and though he had
 lost one hundred large red sheep, laden with the greatest treasure upon
 earth; though the knavery of the Dutch skipper still sat heavy upon his
 mind; yet when he reflected upon what he had still left, and when he
 mentioned the name of Cunegonde, especially towards the latter end of a
 repast, he inclined to Pangloss's doctrine.
 
 "But you, Mr. Martin," said he to the philosopher, "what do you think
 of all this? what are your ideas on moral and natural evil?"
 
 "Sir," answered Martin, "our priests accused me of being a Socinian, but
 the real fact is I am a Manichean."[21]
 
 "You jest," said Candide; "there are no longer Manicheans in the world."
 
 "I am one," said Martin. "I cannot help it; I know not how to think
 otherwise."
 
 "Surely you must be possessed by the devil," said Candide.
 
 "He is so deeply concerned in the affairs of this world," answered
 Martin, "that he may very well be in me, as well as in everybody else;
 but I own to you that when I cast an eye on this globe, or rather on
 this little ball, I cannot help thinking that God has abandoned it to
 some malignant being. I except, always, El Dorado. I scarcely ever knew
 a city that did not desire the destruction of a neighbouring city, nor a
 family that did not wish to exterminate some other family. Everywhere
 the weak execrate the powerful, before whom they cringe; and the
 powerful beat them like sheep whose wool and flesh they sell. A million
 regimented assassins, from one extremity of Europe to the other, get
 their bread by disciplined depredation and murder, for want of more
 honest employment. Even in those cities which seem to enjoy peace, and
 where the arts flourish, the inhabitants are devoured by more envy,
 care, and uneasiness than are experienced by a besieged town. Secret
 griefs are more cruel than public calamities. In a word I have seen so
 much, and experienced so much that I am a Manichean."
 
 "There are, however, some things good," said Candide.
 
 "That may be," said Martin; "but I know them not."
 
 In the middle of this dispute they heard the report of cannon; it
 redoubled every instant. Each took out his glass. They saw two ships in
 close fight about three miles off. The wind brought both so near to the
 French vessel that our travellers had the pleasure of seeing the fight
 at their ease. At length one let off a broadside, so low and so truly
 aimed, that the other sank to the bottom. Candide and Martin could
 plainly perceive a hundred men on the deck of the sinking vessel; they
 raised their hands to heaven and uttered terrible outcries, and the next
 moment were swallowed up by the sea.
 
 "Well," said Martin, "this is how men treat one another."
 
 "It is true," said Candide; "there is something diabolical in this
 affair."
 
 While speaking, he saw he knew not what, of a shining red, swimming
 close to the vessel. They put out the long-boat to see what it could
 be: it was one of his sheep! Candide was more rejoiced at the recovery
 of this one sheep than he had been grieved at the loss of the hundred
 laden with the large diamonds of El Dorado.
 
 The French captain soon saw that the captain of the victorious vessel
 was a Spaniard, and that the other was a Dutch pirate, and the very same
 one who had robbed Candide. The immense plunder which this villain had
 amassed, was buried with him in the sea, and out of the whole only one
 sheep was saved.
 
 "You see," said Candide to Martin, "that crime is sometimes punished.
 This rogue of a Dutch skipper has met with the fate he deserved."
 
 "Yes," said Martin; "but why should the passengers be doomed also to
 destruction? God has punished the knave, and the devil has drowned the
 rest."
 
 The French and Spanish ships continued their course, and Candide
 continued his conversation with Martin. They disputed fifteen successive
 days, and on the last of those fifteen days, they were as far advanced
 as on the first. But, however, they chatted, they communicated ideas,
 they consoled each other. Candide caressed his sheep.
 
 "Since I have found thee again," said he, "I may likewise chance to find
 my Cunegonde."
 
 
 
 
 XXI
 
 CANDIDE AND MARTIN, REASONING, DRAW NEAR THE COAST OF FRANCE.
 
 
 At length they descried the coast of France.
 
 "Were you ever in France, Mr. Martin?" said Candide.
 
 "Yes," said Martin, "I have been in several provinces. In some one-half
 of the people are fools, in others they are too cunning; in some they
 are weak and simple, in others they affect to be witty; in all, the
 principal occupation is love, the next is slander, and the third is
 talking nonsense."
 
 "But, Mr. Martin, have you seen Paris?"
 
 "Yes, I have. All these kinds are found there. It is a chaos--a confused
 multitude, where everybody seeks pleasure and scarcely any one finds it,
 at least as it appeared to me. I made a short stay there. On my arrival
 I was robbed of all I had by pickpockets at the fair of St. Germain. I
 myself was taken for a robber and was imprisoned for eight days, after
 which I served as corrector of the press to gain the money necessary for
 my return to Holland on foot. I knew the whole scribbling rabble, the
 party rabble, the fanatic rabble. It is said that there are very polite
 people in that city, and I wish to believe it."
 
 "For my part, I have no curiosity to see France," said Candide. "You may
 easily imagine that after spending a month at El Dorado I can desire to
 behold nothing upon earth but Miss Cunegonde. I go to await her at
 Venice. We shall pass through France on our way to Italy. Will you bear
 me company?"
 
 "With all my heart," said Martin. "It is said that Venice is fit only
 for its own nobility, but that strangers meet with a very good reception
 if they have a good deal of money. I have none of it; you have,
 therefore I will follow you all over the world."
 
 "But do you believe," said Candide, "that the earth was originally a
 sea, as we find it asserted in that large book belonging to the
 captain?"
 
 "I do not believe a word of it," said Martin, "any more than I do of the
 many ravings which have been published lately."
 
 "But for what end, then, has this world been formed?" said Candide.
 
 "To plague us to death," answered Martin.
 
 "Are you not greatly surprised," continued Candide, "at the love which
 these two girls of the Oreillons had for those monkeys, of which I have
 already told you?"
 
 "Not at all," said Martin. "I do not see that that passion was strange.
 I have seen so many extraordinary things that I have ceased to be
 surprised."
 
 "Do you believe," said Candide, "that men have always massacred each
 other as they do to-day, that they have always been liars, cheats,
 traitors, ingrates, brigands, idiots, thieves, scoundrels, gluttons,
 drunkards, misers, envious, ambitious, bloody-minded, calumniators,
 debauchees, fanatics, hypocrites, and fools?"
 
 "Do you believe," said Martin, "that hawks have always eaten pigeons
 when they have found them?"
 
 "Yes, without doubt," said Candide.
 
 "Well, then," said Martin, "if hawks have always had the same character
 why should you imagine that men may have changed theirs?"
 
 "Oh!" said Candide, "there is a vast deal of difference, for free
 will----"
 
 And reasoning thus they arrived at Bordeaux.
 
 
 
 
 XXII
 
 WHAT HAPPENED IN FRANCE TO CANDIDE AND MARTIN.
 
 
 Candide stayed in Bordeaux no longer than was necessary for the selling
 of a few of the pebbles of El Dorado, and for hiring a good chaise to
 hold two passengers; for he could not travel without his Philosopher
 Martin. He was only vexed at parting with his sheep, which he left to
 the Bordeaux Academy of Sciences, who set as a subject for that year's
 prize, "to find why this sheep's wool was red;" and the prize was
 awarded to a learned man of the North, who demonstrated by A plus B
 minus C divided by Z, that the sheep must be red, and die of the rot.
 
 Meanwhile, all the travellers whom Candide met in the inns along his
 route, said to him, "We go to Paris." This general eagerness at length
 gave him, too, a desire to see this capital; and it was not so very
 great a _detour_ from the road to Venice.
 
 He entered Paris by the suburb of St. Marceau, and fancied that he was
 in the dirtiest village of Westphalia.
 
 Scarcely was Candide arrived at his inn, than he found himself attacked
 by a slight illness, caused by fatigue. As he had a very large diamond
 on his finger, and the people of the inn had taken notice of a
 prodigiously heavy box among his baggage, there were two physicians to
 attend him, though he had never sent for them, and two devotees who
 warmed his broths.
 
 "I remember," Martin said, "also to have been sick at Paris in my first
 voyage; I was very poor, thus I had neither friends, devotees, nor
 doctors, and I recovered."
 
 However, what with physic and bleeding, Candide's illness became
 serious. A parson of the neighborhood came with great meekness to ask
 for a bill for the other world payable to the bearer. Candide would do
 nothing for him; but the devotees assured him it was the new fashion. He
 answered that he was not a man of fashion. Martin wished to throw the
 priest out of the window. The priest swore that they would not bury
 Candide. Martin swore that he would bury the priest if he continued to
 be troublesome. The quarrel grew heated. Martin took him by the
 shoulders and roughly turned him out of doors; which occasioned great
 scandal and a law-suit.
 
 Candide got well again, and during his convalescence he had very good
 company to sup with him. They played high. Candide wondered why it was
 that the ace never came to him; but Martin was not at all astonished.
 
 Among those who did him the honours of the town was a little Abbe of
 Perigord, one of those busybodies who are ever alert, officious,
 forward, fawning, and complaisant; who watch for strangers in their
 passage through the capital, tell them the scandalous history of the
 town, and offer them pleasure at all prices. He first took Candide and
 Martin to La Comedie, where they played a new tragedy. Candide happened
 to be seated near some of the fashionable wits. This did not prevent his
 shedding tears at the well-acted scenes. One of these critics at his
 side said to him between the acts:
 
 "Your tears are misplaced; that is a shocking actress; the actor who
 plays with her is yet worse; and the play is still worse than the
 actors. The author does not know a word of Arabic, yet the scene is in
 Arabia; moreover he is a man that does not believe in innate ideas; and
 I will bring you, to-morrow, twenty pamphlets written against him."[22]
 
 "How many dramas have you in France, sir?" said Candide to the Abbe.
 
 "Five or six thousand."
 
 "What a number!" said Candide. "How many good?"
 
 "Fifteen or sixteen," replied the other.
 
 "What a number!" said Martin.
 
 Candide was very pleased with an actress who played Queen Elizabeth in a
 somewhat insipid tragedy[23] sometimes acted.
 
 "That actress," said he to Martin, "pleases me much; she has a likeness
 to Miss Cunegonde; I should be very glad to wait upon her."
 
 The Perigordian Abbe offered to introduce him. Candide, brought up in
 Germany, asked what was the etiquette, and how they treated queens of
 England in France.
 
 "It is necessary to make distinctions," said the Abbe. "In the provinces
 one takes them to the inn; in Paris, one respects them when they are
 beautiful, and throws them on the highway when they are dead."[24]
 
 "Queens on the highway!" said Candide.
 
 "Yes, truly," said Martin, "the Abbe is right. I was in Paris when Miss
 Monime passed, as the saying is, from this life to the other. She was
 refused what people call the _honours of sepulture_--that is to say, of
 rotting with all the beggars of the neighbourhood in an ugly cemetery;
 she was interred all alone by her company at the corner of the Rue de
 Bourgogne, which ought to trouble her much, for she thought nobly."
 
 "That was very uncivil," said Candide.
 
 "What would you have?" said Martin; "these people are made thus. Imagine
 all contradictions, all possible incompatibilities--you will find them
 in the government, in the law-courts, in the churches, in the public
 shows of this droll nation."
 
 "Is it true that they always laugh in Paris?" said Candide.
 
 "Yes," said the Abbe, "but it means nothing, for they complain of
 everything with great fits of laughter; they even do the most detestable
 things while laughing."
 
 "Who," said Candide, "is that great pig who spoke so ill of the piece at
 which I wept, and of the actors who gave me so much pleasure?"
 
 "He is a bad character," answered the Abbe, "who gains his livelihood by
 saying evil of all plays and of all books. He hates whatever succeeds,
 as the eunuchs hate those who enjoy; he is one of the serpents of
 literature who nourish themselves on dirt and spite; he is a
 _folliculaire_."
 
 "What is a _folliculaire_?" said Candide.
 
 "It is," said the Abbe, "a pamphleteer--a Freron."[25]
 
 Thus Candide, Martin, and the Perigordian conversed on the staircase,
 while watching every one go out after the performance.
 
 "Although I am eager to see Cunegonde again," said Candide, "I should
 like to sup with Miss Clairon, for she appears to me admirable."
 
 The Abbe was not the man to approach Miss Clairon, who saw only good
 company.
 
 "She is engaged for this evening," he said, "but I shall have the honour
 to take you to the house of a lady of quality, and there you will know
 Paris as if you had lived in it for years."
 
 Candide, who was naturally curious, let himself be taken to this lady's
 house, at the end of the Faubourg St. Honore. The company was occupied
 in playing faro; a dozen melancholy punters held each in his hand a
 little pack of cards; a bad record of his misfortunes. Profound silence
 reigned; pallor was on the faces of the punters, anxiety on that of the
 banker, and the hostess, sitting near the unpitying banker, noticed with
 lynx-eyes all the doubled and other increased stakes, as each player
 dog's-eared his cards; she made them turn down the edges again with
 severe, but polite attention; she showed no vexation for fear of losing
 her customers. The lady insisted upon being called the Marchioness of
 Parolignac. Her daughter, aged fifteen, was among the punters, and
 notified with a covert glance the cheatings of the poor people who
 tried to repair the cruelties of fate. The Perigordian Abbe, Candide and
 Martin entered; no one rose, no one saluted them, no one looked at them;
 all were profoundly occupied with their cards.
 
 "The Baroness of Thunder-ten-Tronckh was more polite," said Candide.
 
 However, the Abbe whispered to the Marchioness, who half rose, honoured
 Candide with a gracious smile, and Martin with a condescending nod; she
 gave a seat and a pack of cards to Candide, who lost fifty thousand
 francs in two deals, after which they supped very gaily, and every one
 was astonished that Candide was not moved by his loss; the servants said
 among themselves, in the language of servants:--
 
 "Some English lord is here this evening."
 
 The supper passed at first like most Parisian suppers, in silence,
 followed by a noise of words which could not be distinguished, then with
 pleasantries of which most were insipid, with false news, with bad
 reasoning, a little politics, and much evil speaking; they also
 discussed new books.
 
 "Have you seen," said the Perigordian Abbe, "the romance of Sieur
 Gauchat, doctor of divinity?"[26]
 
 "Yes," answered one of the guests, "but I have not been able to finish
 it. We have a crowd of silly writings, but all together do not approach
 the impertinence of 'Gauchat, Doctor of Divinity.' I am so satiated with
 the great number of detestable books with which we are inundated that I
 am reduced to punting at faro."
 
 "And the _Melanges_ of Archdeacon Trublet,[27] what do you say of that?"
 said the Abbe.
 
 "Ah!" said the Marchioness of Parolignac, "the wearisome mortal! How
 curiously he repeats to you all that the world knows! How heavily he
 discusses that which is not worth the trouble of lightly remarking upon!
 How, without wit, he appropriates the wit of others! How he spoils what
 he steals! How he disgusts me! But he will disgust me no longer--it is
 enough to have read a few of the Archdeacon's pages."
 
 There was at table a wise man of taste, who supported the Marchioness.
 They spoke afterwards of tragedies; the lady asked why there were
 tragedies which were sometimes played and which could not be read. The
 man of taste explained very well how a piece could have some interest,
 and have almost no merit; he proved in few words that it was not enough
 to introduce one or two of those situations which one finds in all
 romances, and which always seduce the spectator, but that it was
 necessary to be new without being odd, often sublime and always
 natural, to know the human heart and to make it speak; to be a great
 poet without allowing any person in the piece to appear to be a poet; to
 know language perfectly--to speak it with purity, with continuous
 harmony and without rhythm ever taking anything from sense.
 
 "Whoever," added he, "does not observe all these rules can produce one
 or two tragedies, applauded at a theatre, but he will never be counted
 in the ranks of good writers. There are very few good tragedies; some
 are idylls in dialogue, well written and well rhymed, others political
 reasonings which lull to sleep, or amplifications which repel; others
 demoniac dreams in barbarous style, interrupted in sequence, with long
 apostrophes to the gods, because they do not know how to speak to men,
 with false maxims, with bombastic commonplaces!"
 
 Candide listened with attention to this discourse, and conceived a great
 idea of the speaker, and as the Marchioness had taken care to place him
 beside her, he leaned towards her and took the liberty of asking who was
 the man who had spoken so well.
 
 "He is a scholar," said the lady, "who does not play, whom the Abbe
 sometimes brings to supper; he is perfectly at home among tragedies and
 books, and he has written a tragedy which was hissed, and a book of
 which nothing has ever been seen outside his bookseller's shop
 excepting the copy which he dedicated to me."
 
 "The great man!" said Candide. "He is another Pangloss!"
 
 Then, turning towards him, he said:
 
 "Sir, you think doubtless that all is for the best in the moral and
 physical world, and that nothing could be otherwise than it is?"
 
 "I, sir!" answered the scholar, "I know nothing of all that; I find that
 all goes awry with me; that no one knows either what is his rank, nor
 what is his condition, what he does nor what he ought to do; and that
 except supper, which is always gay, and where there appears to be enough
 concord, all the rest of the time is passed in impertinent quarrels;
 Jansenist against Molinist, Parliament against the Church, men of
 letters against men of letters, courtesans against courtesans,
 financiers against the people, wives against husbands, relatives against
 relatives--it is eternal war."
 
 "I have seen the worst," Candide replied. "But a wise man, who since has
 had the misfortune to be hanged, taught me that all is marvellously
 well; these are but the shadows on a beautiful picture."
 
 "Your hanged man mocked the world," said Martin. "The shadows are
 horrible blots."
 
 "They are men who make the blots," said Candide, "and they cannot be
 dispensed with."
 
 "It is not their fault then," said Martin.
 
 Most of the punters, who understood nothing of this language, drank, and
 Martin reasoned with the scholar, and Candide related some of his
 adventures to his hostess.
 
 After supper the Marchioness took Candide into her boudoir, and made him
 sit upon a sofa.
 
 "Ah, well!" said she to him, "you love desperately Miss Cunegonde of
 Thunder-ten-Tronckh?"
 
 "Yes, madame," answered Candide.
 
 The Marchioness replied to him with a tender smile:
 
 "You answer me like a young man from Westphalia. A Frenchman would have
 said, 'It is true that I have loved Miss Cunegonde, but seeing you,
 madame, I think I no longer love her.'"
 
 "Alas! madame," said Candide, "I will answer you as you wish."
 
 "Your passion for her," said the Marchioness, "commenced by picking up
 her handkerchief. I wish that you would pick up my garter."
 
 "With all my heart," said Candide. And he picked it up.
 
 "But I wish that you would put it on," said the lady.
 
 And Candide put it on.
 
 "You see," said she, "you are a foreigner. I sometimes make my Parisian
 lovers languish for fifteen days, but I give myself to you the first
 night because one must do the honours of one's country to a young man
 from Westphalia."
 
 The lady having perceived two enormous diamonds upon the hands of the
 young foreigner praised them with such good faith that from Candide's
 fingers they passed to her own.
 
 Candide, returning with the Perigordian Abbe, felt some remorse in
 having been unfaithful to Miss Cunegonde. The Abbe sympathised in his
 trouble; he had had but a light part of the fifty thousand francs lost
 at play and of the value of the two brilliants, half given, half
 extorted. His design was to profit as much as he could by the advantages
 which the acquaintance of Candide could procure for him. He spoke much
 of Cunegonde, and Candide told him that he should ask forgiveness of
 that beautiful one for his infidelity when he should see her in Venice.
 
 The Abbe redoubled his politeness and attentions, and took a tender
 interest in all that Candide said, in all that he did, in all that he
 wished to do.
 
 "And so, sir, you have a rendezvous at Venice?"
 
 "Yes, monsieur Abbe," answered Candide. "It is absolutely necessary
 that I go to meet Miss Cunegonde."
 
 And then the pleasure of talking of that which he loved induced him to
 relate, according to his custom, part of his adventures with the fair
 Westphalian.
 
 "I believe," said the Abbe, "that Miss Cunegonde has a great deal of
 wit, and that she writes charming letters?"
 
 "I have never received any from her," said Candide, "for being expelled
 from the castle on her account I had not an opportunity for writing to
 her. Soon after that I heard she was dead; then I found her alive; then
 I lost her again; and last of all, I sent an express to her two thousand
 five hundred leagues from here, and I wait for an answer."
 
 The Abbe listened attentively, and seemed to be in a brown study. He
 soon took his leave of the two foreigners after a most tender embrace.
 The following day Candide received, on awaking, a letter couched in
 these terms:
 
 "My very dear love, for eight days I have been ill in this town. I learn
 that you are here. I would fly to your arms if I could but move. I was
 informed of your passage at Bordeaux, where I left faithful Cacambo and
 the old woman, who are to follow me very soon. The Governor of Buenos
 Ayres has taken all, but there remains to me your heart. Come! your
 presence will either give me life or kill me with pleasure."
 
 This charming, this unhoped-for letter transported Candide with an
 inexpressible joy, and the illness of his dear Cunegonde overwhelmed him
 with grief. Divided between those two passions, he took his gold and his
 diamonds and hurried away, with Martin, to the hotel where Miss
 Cunegonde was lodged. He entered her room trembling, his heart
 palpitating, his voice sobbing; he wished to open the curtains of the
 bed, and asked for a light.
 
 "Take care what you do," said the servant-maid; "the light hurts her,"
 and immediately she drew the curtain again.
 
 "My dear Cunegonde," said Candide, weeping, "how are you? If you cannot
 see me, at least speak to me."
 
 "She cannot speak," said the maid.
 
 The lady then put a plump hand out from the bed, and Candide bathed it
 with his tears and afterwards filled it with diamonds, leaving a bag of
 gold upon the easy chair.
 
 In the midst of these transports in came an officer, followed by the
 Abbe and a file of soldiers.
 
 "There," said he, "are the two suspected foreigners," and at the same
 time he ordered them to be seized and carried to prison.
 
 "Travellers are not treated thus in El Dorado," said Candide.
 
 "I am more a Manichean now than ever," said Martin.
 
 "But pray, sir, where are you going to carry us?" said Candide.
 
 "To a dungeon," answered the officer.
 
 Martin, having recovered himself a little, judged that the lady who
 acted the part of Cunegonde was a cheat, that the Perigordian Abbe was a
 knave who had imposed upon the honest simplicity of Candide, and that
 the officer was another knave whom they might easily silence.
 
 Candide, advised by Martin and impatient to see the real Cunegonde,
 rather than expose himself before a court of justice, proposed to the
 officer to give him three small diamonds, each worth about three
 thousand pistoles.
 
 "Ah, sir," said the man with the ivory baton, "had you committed all the
 imaginable crimes you would be to me the most honest man in the world.
 Three diamonds! Each worth three thousand pistoles! Sir, instead of
 carrying you to jail I would lose my life to serve you. There are orders
 for arresting all foreigners, but leave it to me. I have a brother at
 Dieppe in Normandy! I'll conduct you thither, and if you have a diamond
 to give him he'll take as much care of you as I would."
 
 "And why," said Candide, "should all foreigners be arrested?"
 
 "It is," the Perigordian Abbe then made answer, "because a poor beggar
 of the country of Atrebatie[28] heard some foolish things said. This
 induced him to commit a parricide, not such as that of 1610 in the month
 of May,[29] but such as that of 1594 in the month of December,[30] and
 such as others which have been committed in other years and other months
 by other poor devils who had heard nonsense spoken."
 
 The officer then explained what the Abbe meant.
 
 "Ah, the monsters!" cried Candide. "What horrors among a people who
 dance and sing! Is there no way of getting quickly out of this country
 where monkeys provoke tigers? I have seen no bears in my country, but
 _men_ I have beheld nowhere except in El Dorado. In the name of God,
 sir, conduct me to Venice, where I am to await Miss Cunegonde."
 
 "I can conduct you no further than lower Normandy," said the officer.
 
 Immediately he ordered his irons to be struck off, acknowledged himself
 mistaken, sent away his men, set out with Candide and Martin for Dieppe,
 and left them in the care of his brother.
 
 There was then a small Dutch ship in the harbour. The Norman, who by the
 virtue of three more diamonds had become the most subservient of men,
 put Candide and his attendants on board a vessel that was just ready to
 set sail for Portsmouth in England.
 
 This was not the way to Venice, but Candide thought he had made his way
 out of hell, and reckoned that he would soon have an opportunity for
 resuming his journey.
 
 
 
 
 XXIII
 
 CANDIDE AND MARTIN TOUCHED UPON THE COAST OF ENGLAND, AND WHAT THEY SAW
 THERE.
 
 
 "Ah, Pangloss! Pangloss! Ah, Martin! Martin! Ah, my dear Cunegonde, what
 sort of a world is this?" said Candide on board the Dutch ship.
 
 "Something very foolish and abominable," said Martin.
 
 "You know England? Are they as foolish there as in France?"
 
 "It is another kind of folly," said Martin. "You know that these two
 nations are at war for a few acres of snow in Canada,[31] and that they
 spend over this beautiful war much more than Canada is worth. To tell
 you exactly, whether there are more people fit to send to a madhouse in
 one country than the other, is what my imperfect intelligence will not
 permit. I only know in general that the people we are going to see are
 very atrabilious."
 
 Talking thus they arrived at Portsmouth. The coast was lined with crowds
 of people, whose eyes were fixed on a fine man kneeling, with his eyes
 bandaged, on board one of the men of war in the harbour. Four soldiers
 stood opposite to this man; each of them fired three balls at his head,
 with all the calmness in the world; and the whole assembly went away
 very well satisfied.
 
 "What is all this?" said Candide; "and what demon is it that exercises
 his empire in this country?"
 
 He then asked who was that fine man who had been killed with so much
 ceremony. They answered, he was an Admiral.[32]
 
 "And why kill this Admiral?"
 
 "It is because he did not kill a sufficient number of men himself. He
 gave battle to a French Admiral; and it has been proved that he was not
 near enough to him."
 
 "But," replied Candide, "the French Admiral was as far from the English
 Admiral."
 
 "There is no doubt of it; but in this country it is found good, from
 time to time, to kill one Admiral to encourage the others."
 
 Candide was so shocked and bewildered by what he saw and heard, that he
 would not set foot on shore, and he made a bargain with the Dutch
 skipper (were he even to rob him like the Surinam captain) to conduct
 him without delay to Venice.
 
 The skipper was ready in two days. They coasted France; they passed in
 sight of Lisbon, and Candide trembled. They passed through the Straits,
 and entered the Mediterranean. At last they landed at Venice.
 
 "God be praised!" said Candide, embracing Martin. "It is here that I
 shall see again my beautiful Cunegonde. I trust Cacambo as myself. All
 is well, all will be well, all goes as well as possible."
 
 
 
 
 XXIV
 
 OF PAQUETTE AND FRIAR GIROFLEE.
 
 
 Upon their arrival at Venice, Candide went to search for Cacambo at
 every inn and coffee-house, and among all the ladies of pleasure, but to
 no purpose. He sent every day to inquire on all the ships that came in.
 But there was no news of Cacambo.
 
 "What!" said he to Martin, "I have had time to voyage from Surinam to
 Bordeaux, to go from Bordeaux to Paris, from Paris to Dieppe, from
 Dieppe to Portsmouth, to coast along Portugal and Spain, to cross the
 whole Mediterranean, to spend some months, and yet the beautiful
 Cunegonde has not arrived! Instead of her I have only met a Parisian
 wench and a Perigordian Abbe. Cunegonde is dead without doubt, and there
 is nothing for me but to die. Alas! how much better it would have been
 for me to have remained in the paradise of El Dorado than to come back
 to this cursed Europe! You are in the right, my dear Martin: all is
 misery and illusion."
 
 He fell into a deep melancholy, and neither went to see the opera, nor
 any of the other diversions of the Carnival; nay, he was proof against
 the temptations of all the ladies.
 
 "You are in truth very simple," said Martin to him, "if you imagine that
 a mongrel valet, who has five or six millions in his pocket, will go to
 the other end of the world to seek your mistress and bring her to you to
 Venice. If he find her, he will keep her to himself; if he do not find
 her he will get another. I advise you to forget your valet Cacambo and
 your mistress Cunegonde."
 
 Martin was not consoling. Candide's melancholy increased; and Martin
 continued to prove to him that there was very little virtue or happiness
 upon earth, except perhaps in El Dorado, where nobody could gain
 admittance.
 
 While they were disputing on this important subject and waiting for
 Cunegonde, Candide saw a young Theatin friar in St. Mark's Piazza,
 holding a girl on his arm. The Theatin looked fresh coloured, plump, and
 vigorous; his eyes were sparkling, his air assured, his look lofty, and
 his step bold. The girl was very pretty, and sang; she looked amorously
 at her Theatin, and from time to time pinched his fat cheeks.
 
 "At least you will allow me," said Candide to Martin, "that these two
 are happy. Hitherto I have met with none but unfortunate people in the
 whole habitable globe, except in El Dorado; but as to this pair, I would
 venture to lay a wager that they are very happy."
 
 "I lay you they are not," said Martin.
 
 "We need only ask them to dine with us," said Candide, "and you will see
 whether I am mistaken."
 
 Immediately he accosted them, presented his compliments, and invited
 them to his inn to eat some macaroni, with Lombard partridges, and
 caviare, and to drink some Montepulciano, Lachrymae Christi, Cyprus and
 Samos wine. The girl blushed, the Theatin accepted the invitation and
 she followed him, casting her eyes on Candide with confusion and
 surprise, and dropping a few tears. No sooner had she set foot in
 Candide's apartment than she cried out:
 
 "Ah! Mr. Candide does not know Paquette again."
 
 Candide had not viewed her as yet with attention, his thoughts being
 entirely taken up with Cunegonde; but recollecting her as she spoke.
 
 "Alas!" said he, "my poor child, it is you who reduced Doctor Pangloss
 to the beautiful condition in which I saw him?"
 
 "Alas! it was I, sir, indeed," answered Paquette. "I see that you have
 heard all. I have been informed of the frightful disasters that befell
 the family of my lady Baroness, and the fair Cunegonde. I swear to you
 that my fate has been scarcely less sad. I was very innocent when you
 knew me. A Grey Friar, who was my confessor, easily seduced me. The
 consequences were terrible. I was obliged to quit the castle some time
 after the Baron had sent you away with kicks on the backside. If a
 famous surgeon had not taken compassion on me, I should have died. For
 some time I was this surgeon's mistress, merely out of gratitude. His
 wife, who was mad with jealousy, beat me every day unmercifully; she was
 a fury. The surgeon was one of the ugliest of men, and I the most
 wretched of women, to be continually beaten for a man I did not love.
 You know, sir, what a dangerous thing it is for an ill-natured woman to
 be married to a doctor. Incensed at the behaviour of his wife, he one
 day gave her so effectual a remedy to cure her of a slight cold, that
 she died two hours after, in most horrid convulsions. The wife's
 relations prosecuted the husband; he took flight, and I was thrown into
 jail. My innocence would not have saved me if I had not been
 good-looking. The judge set me free, on condition that he succeeded the
 surgeon. I was soon supplanted by a rival, turned out of doors quite
 destitute, and obliged to continue this abominable trade, which appears
 so pleasant to you men, while to us women it is the utmost abyss of
 misery. I have come to exercise the profession at Venice. Ah! sir, if
 you could only imagine what it is to be obliged to caress indifferently
 an old merchant, a lawyer, a monk, a gondolier, an abbe, to be exposed
 to abuse and insults; to be often reduced to borrowing a petticoat, only
 to go and have it raised by a disagreeable man; to be robbed by one of
 what one has earned from another; to be subject to the extortions of the
 officers of justice; and to have in prospect only a frightful old age, a
 hospital, and a dung-hill; you would conclude that I am one of the most
 unhappy creatures in the world."[33]
 
 Paquette thus opened her heart to honest Candide, in the presence of
 Martin, who said to his friend:
 
 "You see that already I have won half the wager."
 
 Friar Giroflee stayed in the dining-room, and drank a glass or two of
 wine while he was waiting for dinner.
 
 "But," said Candide to Paquette, "you looked so gay and content when I
 met you; you sang and you behaved so lovingly to the Theatin, that you
 seemed to me as happy as you pretend to be now the reverse."
 
 "Ah! sir," answered Paquette, "this is one of the miseries of the trade.
 Yesterday I was robbed and beaten by an officer; yet to-day I must put
 on good humour to please a friar."
 
 Candide wanted no more convincing; he owned that Martin was in the
 right. They sat down to table with Paquette and the Theatin; the repast
 was entertaining; and towards the end they conversed with all
 confidence.
 
 "Father," said Candide to the Friar, "you appear to me to enjoy a state
 that all the world might envy; the flower of health shines in your face,
 your expression makes plain your happiness; you have a very pretty girl
 for your recreation, and you seem well satisfied with your state as a
 Theatin."
 
 "My faith, sir," said Friar Giroflee, "I wish that all the Theatins were
 at the bottom of the sea. I have been tempted a hundred times to set
 fire to the convent, and go and become a Turk. My parents forced me at
 the age of fifteen to put on this detestable habit, to increase the
 fortune of a cursed elder brother, whom God confound. Jealousy, discord,
 and fury, dwell in the convent. It is true I have preached a few bad
 sermons that have brought me in a little money, of which the prior stole
 half, while the rest serves to maintain my girls; but when I return at
 night to the monastery, I am ready to dash my head against the walls of
 the dormitory; and all my fellows are in the same case."
 
 Martin turned towards Candide with his usual coolness.
 
 "Well," said he, "have I not won the whole wager?"
 
 Candide gave two thousand piastres to Paquette, and one thousand to
 Friar Giroflee.
 
 "I'll answer for it," said he, "that with this they will be happy."
 
 "I do not believe it at all," said Martin; "you will, perhaps, with
 these piastres only render them the more unhappy."
 
 "Let that be as it may," said Candide, "but one thing consoles me. I see
 that we often meet with those whom we expected never to see more; so
 that, perhaps, as I have found my red sheep and Paquette, it may well be
 that I shall also find Cunegonde."
 
 "I wish," said Martin, "she may one day make you very happy; but I doubt
 it very much."
 
 "You are very hard of belief," said Candide.
 
 "I have lived," said Martin.
 
 "You see those gondoliers," said Candide, "are they not perpetually
 singing?"
 
 "You do not see them," said Martin, "at home with their wives and brats.
 The Doge has his troubles, the gondoliers have theirs. It is true that,
 all things considered, the life of a gondolier is preferable to that of
 a Doge; but I believe the difference to be so trifling that it is not
 worth the trouble of examining."
 
 "People talk," said Candide, "of the Senator Pococurante, who lives in
 that fine palace on the Brenta, where he entertains foreigners in the
 politest manner. They pretend that this man has never felt any
 uneasiness."
 
 "I should be glad to see such a rarity," said Martin.
 
 Candide immediately sent to ask the Lord Pococurante permission to wait
 upon him the next day.
 
 
 
 
 XXV
 
 THE VISIT TO LORD POCOCURANTE, A NOBLE VENETIAN.
 
 
 Candide and Martin went in a gondola on the Brenta, and arrived at the
 palace of the noble Signor Pococurante. The gardens, laid out with
 taste, were adorned with fine marble statues. The palace was beautifully
 built. The master of the house was a man of sixty, and very rich. He
 received the two travellers with polite indifference, which put Candide
 a little out of countenance, but was not at all disagreeable to Martin.
 
 First, two pretty girls, very neatly dressed, served them with
 chocolate, which was frothed exceedingly well. Candide could not refrain
 from commending their beauty, grace, and address.
 
 "They are good enough creatures," said the Senator. "I make them lie
 with me sometimes, for I am very tired of the ladies of the town, of
 their coquetries, of their jealousies, of their quarrels, of their
 humours, of their pettinesses, of their prides, of their follies, and of
 the sonnets which one must make, or have made, for them. But after all,
 these two girls begin to weary me."
 
 After breakfast, Candide walking into a long gallery was surprised by
 the beautiful pictures. He asked, by what master were the two first.
 
 "They are by Raphael," said the Senator. "I bought them at a great
 price, out of vanity, some years ago. They are said to be the finest
 things in Italy, but they do not please me at all. The colours are too
 dark, the figures are not sufficiently rounded, nor in good relief; the
 draperies in no way resemble stuffs. In a word, whatever may be said, I
 do not find there a true imitation of nature. I only care for a picture
 when I think I see nature itself; and there are none of this sort. I
 have a great many pictures, but I prize them very little."
 
 While they were waiting for dinner Pococurante ordered a concert.
 Candide found the music delicious.
 
 "This noise," said the Senator, "may amuse one for half an hour; but if
 it were to last longer it would grow tiresome to everybody, though they
 durst not own it. Music, to-day, is only the art of executing difficult
 things, and that which is only difficult cannot please long. Perhaps I
 should be fonder of the opera if they had not found the secret of making
 of it a monster which shocks me. Let who will go to see bad tragedies
 set to music, where the scenes are contrived for no other end than to
 introduce two or three songs ridiculously out of place, to show off an
 actress's voice. Let who will, or who can, die away with pleasure at the
 sight of an eunuch quavering the _role_ of Caesar, or of Cato, and
 strutting awkwardly upon the stage. For my part I have long since
 renounced those paltry entertainments which constitute the glory of
 modern Italy, and are purchased so dearly by sovereigns."
 
 Candide disputed the point a little, but with discretion. Martin was
 entirely of the Senator's opinion.
 
 They sat down to table, and after an excellent dinner they went into the
 library. Candide, seeing a Homer magnificently bound, commended the
 virtuoso on his good taste.
 
 "There," said he, "is a book that was once the delight of the great
 Pangloss, the best philosopher in Germany."
 
 "It is not mine," answered Pococurante coolly. "They used at one time to
 make me believe that I took a pleasure in reading him. But that
 continual repetition of battles, so extremely like one another; those
 gods that are always active without doing anything decisive; that Helen
 who is the cause of the war, and who yet scarcely appears in the piece;
 that Troy, so long besieged without being taken; all these together
 caused me great weariness. I have sometimes asked learned men whether
 they were not as weary as I of that work. Those who were sincere have
 owned to me that the poem made them fall asleep; yet it was necessary to
 have it in their library as a monument of antiquity, or like those rusty
 medals which are no longer of use in commerce."
 
 "But your Excellency does not think thus of Virgil?" said Candide.
 
 "I grant," said the Senator, "that the second, fourth, and sixth books
 of his _AEneid_ are excellent, but as for his pious AEneas, his strong
 Cloanthus, his friend Achates, his little Ascanius, his silly King
 Latinus, his bourgeois Amata, his insipid Lavinia, I think there can be
 nothing more flat and disagreeable. I prefer Tasso a good deal, or even
 the soporific tales of Ariosto."
 
 "May I presume to ask you, sir," said Candide, "whether you do not
 receive a great deal of pleasure from reading Horace?"
 
 "There are maxims in this writer," answered Pococurante, "from which a
 man of the world may reap great benefit, and being written in energetic
 verse they are more easily impressed upon the memory. But I care little
 for his journey to Brundusium, and his account of a bad dinner, or of
 his low quarrel between one Rupilius whose words he says were full of
 poisonous filth, and another whose language was imbued with vinegar. I
 have read with much distaste his indelicate verses against old women and
 witches; nor do I see any merit in telling his friend Maecenas that if he
 will but rank him in the choir of lyric poets, his lofty head shall
 touch the stars. Fools admire everything in an author of reputation. For
 my part, I read only to please myself. I like only that which serves my
 purpose."
 
 Candide, having been educated never to judge for himself, was much
 surprised at what he heard. Martin found there was a good deal of reason
 in Pococurante's remarks.
 
 "Oh! here is Cicero," said Candide. "Here is the great man whom I fancy
 you are never tired of reading."
 
 "I never read him," replied the Venetian. "What is it to me whether he
 pleads for Rabirius or Cluentius? I try causes enough myself; his
 philosophical works seem to me better, but when I found that he doubted
 of everything, I concluded that I knew as much as he, and that I had no
 need of a guide to learn ignorance."
 
 "Ha! here are four-score volumes of the Academy of Sciences," cried
 Martin. "Perhaps there is something valuable in this collection."
 
 "There might be," said Pococurante, "if only one of those rakers of
 rubbish had shown how to make pins; but in all these volumes there is
 nothing but chimerical systems, and not a single useful thing."
 
 "And what dramatic works I see here," said Candide, "in Italian,
 Spanish, and French."
 
 "Yes," replied the Senator, "there are three thousand, and not three
 dozen of them good for anything. As to those collections of sermons,
 which altogether are not worth a single page of Seneca, and those huge
 volumes of theology, you may well imagine that neither I nor any one
 else ever opens them."
 
 Martin saw some shelves filled with English books.
 
 "I have a notion," said he, "that a Republican must be greatly pleased
 with most of these books, which are written with a spirit of freedom."
 
 "Yes," answered Pococurante, "it is noble to write as one thinks; this
 is the privilege of humanity. In all our Italy we write only what we do
 not think; those who inhabit the country of the Caesars and the
 Antoninuses dare not acquire a single idea without the permission of a
 Dominican friar. I should be pleased with the liberty which inspires the
 English genius if passion and party spirit did not corrupt all that is
 estimable in this precious liberty."
 
 Candide, observing a Milton, asked whether he did not look upon this
 author as a great man.
 
 "Who?" said Pococurante, "that barbarian, who writes a long commentary
 in ten books of harsh verse on the first chapter of Genesis; that coarse
 imitator of the Greeks, who disfigures the Creation, and who, while
 Moses represents the Eternal producing the world by a word, makes the
 Messiah take a great pair of compasses from the armoury of heaven to
 circumscribe His work? How can I have any esteem for a writer who has
 spoiled Tasso's hell and the devil, who transforms Lucifer sometimes
 into a toad and other times into a pigmy, who makes him repeat the same
 things a hundred times, who makes him dispute on theology, who, by a
 serious imitation of Ariosto's comic invention of firearms, represents
 the devils cannonading in heaven? Neither I nor any man in Italy could
 take pleasure in those melancholy extravagances; and the marriage of Sin
 and Death, and the snakes brought forth by Sin, are enough to turn the
 stomach of any one with the least taste, [and his long description of a
 pest-house is good only for a grave-digger]. This obscure, whimsical,
 and disagreeable poem was despised upon its first publication, and I
 only treat it now as it was treated in its own country by
 contemporaries. For the matter of that I say what I think, and I care
 very little whether others think as I do."
 
 Candide was grieved at this speech, for he had a respect for Homer and
 was fond of Milton.
 
 "Alas!" said he softly to Martin, "I am afraid that this man holds our
 German poets in very great contempt."
 
 "There would not be much harm in that," said Martin.
 
 "Oh! what a superior man," said Candide below his breath. "What a great
 genius is this Pococurante! Nothing can please him."
 
 After their survey of the library they went down into the garden, where
 Candide praised its several beauties.
 
 "I know of nothing in so bad a taste," said the master. "All you see
 here is merely trifling. After to-morrow I will have it planted with a
 nobler design."
 
 "Well," said Candide to Martin when they had taken their leave, "you
 will agree that this is the happiest of mortals, for he is above
 everything he possesses."
 
 "But do you not see," answered Martin, "that he is disgusted with all he
 possesses? Plato observed a long while ago that those stomachs are not
 the best that reject all sorts of food."
 
 "But is there not a pleasure," said Candide, "in criticising
 everything, in pointing out faults where others see nothing but
 beauties?"
 
 "That is to say," replied Martin, "that there is some pleasure in having
 no pleasure."
 
 "Well, well," said Candide, "I find that I shall be the only happy man
 when I am blessed with the sight of my dear Cunegonde."
 
 "It is always well to hope," said Martin.
 
 However, the days and the weeks passed. Cacambo did not come, and
 Candide was so overwhelmed with grief that he did not even reflect that
 Paquette and Friar Giroflee did not return to thank him.
 
 
 
 
 XXVI
 
 OF A SUPPER WHICH CANDIDE AND MARTIN TOOK WITH SIX STRANGERS, AND WHO
 THEY WERE.[34]
 
 
 One evening that Candide and Martin were going to sit down to supper
 with some foreigners who lodged in the same inn, a man whose complexion
 was as black as soot, came behind Candide, and taking him by the arm,
 said:
 
 "Get yourself ready to go along with us; do not fail."
 
 Upon this he turned round and saw--Cacambo! Nothing but the sight of
 Cunegonde could have astonished and delighted him more. He was on the
 point of going mad with joy. He embraced his dear friend.
 
 "Cunegonde is here, without doubt; where is she? Take me to her that I
 may die of joy in her company."
 
 "Cunegonde is not here," said Cacambo, "she is at Constantinople."
 
 "Oh, heavens! at Constantinople! But were she in China I would fly
 thither; let us be off."
 
 "We shall set out after supper," replied Cacambo. "I can tell you
 nothing more; I am a slave, my master awaits me, I must serve him at
 table; speak not a word, eat, and then get ready."
 
 Candide, distracted between joy and grief, delighted at seeing his
 faithful agent again, astonished at finding him a slave, filled with the
 fresh hope of recovering his mistress, his heart palpitating, his
 understanding confused, sat down to table with Martin, who saw all these
 scenes quite unconcerned, and with six strangers who had come to spend
 the Carnival at Venice.
 
 Cacambo waited at table upon one of the strangers; towards the end of
 the entertainment he drew near his master, and whispered in his ear:
 
 "Sire, your Majesty may start when you please, the vessel is ready."
 
 On saying these words he went out. The company in great surprise looked
 at one another without speaking a word, when another domestic approached
 his master and said to him:
 
 "Sire, your Majesty's chaise is at Padua, and the boat is ready."
 
 The master gave a nod and the servant went away. The company all stared
 at one another again, and their surprise redoubled. A third valet came
 up to a third stranger, saying:
 
 "Sire, believe me, your Majesty ought not to stay here any longer. I am
 going to get everything ready."
 
 And immediately he disappeared. Candide and Martin did not doubt that
 this was a masquerade of the Carnival. Then a fourth domestic said to a
 fourth master:
 
 "Your Majesty may depart when you please."
 
 Saying this he went away like the rest. The fifth valet said the same
 thing to the fifth master. But the sixth valet spoke differently to the
 sixth stranger, who sat near Candide. He said to him:
 
 "Faith, Sire, they will no longer give credit to your Majesty nor to me,
 and we may perhaps both of us be put in jail this very night. Therefore
 I will take care of myself. Adieu."
 
 The servants being all gone, the six strangers, with Candide and Martin,
 remained in a profound silence. At length Candide broke it.
 
 "Gentlemen," said he, "this is a very good joke indeed, but why should
 you all be kings? For me I own that neither Martin nor I is a king."
 
 Cacambo's master then gravely answered in Italian:
 
 "I am not at all joking. My name is Achmet III. I was Grand Sultan many
 years. I dethroned my brother; my nephew dethroned me, my viziers were
 beheaded, and I am condemned to end my days in the old Seraglio. My
 nephew, the great Sultan Mahmoud, permits me to travel sometimes for my
 health, and I am come to spend the Carnival at Venice."
 
 A young man who sat next to Achmet, spoke then as follows:
 
 "My name is Ivan. I was once Emperor of all the Russias, but was
 dethroned in my cradle. My parents were confined in prison and I was
 educated there; yet I am sometimes allowed to travel in company with
 persons who act as guards; and I am come to spend the Carnival at
 Venice."
 
 The third said:
 
 "I am Charles Edward, King of England; my father has resigned all his
 legal rights to me. I have fought in defence of them; and above eight
 hundred of my adherents have been hanged, drawn, and quartered. I have
 been confined in prison; I am going to Rome, to pay a visit to the King,
 my father, who was dethroned as well as myself and my grandfather, and I
 am come to spend the Carnival at Venice."
 
 The fourth spoke thus in his turn:
 
 "I am the King of Poland; the fortune of war has stripped me of my
 hereditary dominions; my father underwent the same vicissitudes; I
 resign myself to Providence in the same manner as Sultan Achmet, the
 Emperor Ivan, and King Charles Edward, whom God long preserve; and I am
 come to the Carnival at Venice."
 
 The fifth said:
 
 "I am King of Poland also; I have been twice dethroned; but Providence
 has given me another country, where I have done more good than all the
 Sarmatian kings were ever capable of doing on the banks of the Vistula;
 I resign myself likewise to Providence, and am come to pass the Carnival
 at Venice."
 
 It was now the sixth monarch's turn to speak:
 
 "Gentlemen," said he, "I am not so great a prince as any of you;
 however, I am a king. I am Theodore, elected King of Corsica; I had the
 title of Majesty, and now I am scarcely treated as a gentleman. I have
 coined money, and now am not worth a farthing; I have had two
 secretaries of state, and now I have scarce a valet; I have seen myself
 on a throne, and I have seen myself upon straw in a common jail in
 London. I am afraid that I shall meet with the same treatment here
 though, like your majesties, I am come to see the Carnival at Venice."
 
 The other five kings listened to this speech with generous compassion.
 Each of them gave twenty sequins to King Theodore to buy him clothes and
 linen; and Candide made him a present of a diamond worth two thousand
 sequins.
 
 "Who can this private person be," said the five kings to one another,
 "who is able to give, and really has given, a hundred times as much as
 any of us?"
 
 Just as they rose from table, in came four Serene Highnesses, who had
 also been stripped of their territories by the fortune of war, and were
 come to spend the Carnival at Venice. But Candide paid no regard to
 these newcomers, his thoughts were entirely employed on his voyage to
 Constantinople, in search of his beloved Cunegonde.
 
 
 
 
 XXVII
 
 CANDIDE'S VOYAGE TO CONSTANTINOPLE.
 
 
 The faithful Cacambo had already prevailed upon the Turkish skipper, who
 was to conduct the Sultan Achmet to Constantinople, to receive Candide
 and Martin on his ship. They both embarked after having made their
 obeisance to his miserable Highness.
 
 "You see," said Candide to Martin on the way, "we supped with six
 dethroned kings, and of those six there was one to whom I gave charity.
 Perhaps there are many other princes yet more unfortunate. For my part,
 I have only lost a hundred sheep; and now I am flying into Cunegonde's
 arms. My dear Martin, yet once more Pangloss was right: all is for the
 best."
 
 "I wish it," answered Martin.
 
 "But," said Candide, "it was a very strange adventure we met with at
 Venice. It has never before been seen or heard that six dethroned kings
 have supped together at a public inn."
 
 "It is not more extraordinary," said Martin, "than most of the things
 that have happened to us. It is a very common thing for kings to be
 dethroned; and as for the honour we have had of supping in their
 company, it is a trifle not worth our attention."
 
 No sooner had Candide got on board the vessel than he flew to his old
 valet and friend Cacambo, and tenderly embraced him.
 
 "Well," said he, "what news of Cunegonde? Is she still a prodigy of
 beauty? Does she love me still? How is she? Thou hast doubtless bought
 her a palace at Constantinople?"
 
 "My dear master," answered Cacambo, "Cunegonde washes dishes on the
 banks of the Propontis, in the service of a prince, who has very few
 dishes to wash; she is a slave in the family of an ancient sovereign
 named Ragotsky,[35] to whom the Grand Turk allows three crowns a day in
 his exile. But what is worse still is, that she has lost her beauty and
 has become horribly ugly."
 
 "Well, handsome or ugly," replied Candide, "I am a man of honour, and it
 is my duty to love her still. But how came she to be reduced to so
 abject a state with the five or six millions that you took to her?"
 
 "Ah!" said Cacambo, "was I not to give two millions to Senor Don
 Fernando d'Ibaraa, y Figueora, y Mascarenes, y Lampourdos, y Souza,
 Governor of Buenos Ayres, for permitting Miss Cunegonde to come away?
 And did not a corsair bravely rob us of all the rest? Did not this
 corsair carry us to Cape Matapan, to Milo, to Nicaria, to Samos, to
 Petra, to the Dardanelles, to Marmora, to Scutari? Cunegonde and the old
 woman serve the prince I now mentioned to you, and I am slave to the
 dethroned Sultan."
 
 "What a series of shocking calamities!" cried Candide. "But after all, I
 have some diamonds left; and I may easily pay Cunegonde's ransom. Yet it
 is a pity that she is grown so ugly."
 
 Then, turning towards Martin: "Who do you think," said he, "is most to
 be pitied--the Sultan Achmet, the Emperor Ivan, King Charles Edward, or
 I?"
 
 "How should I know!" answered Martin. "I must see into your hearts to be
 able to tell."
 
 "Ah!" said Candide, "if Pangloss were here, he could tell."
 
 "I know not," said Martin, "in what sort of scales your Pangloss would
 weigh the misfortunes of mankind and set a just estimate on their
 sorrows. All that I can presume to say is, that there are millions of
 people upon earth who have a hundred times more to complain of than King
 Charles Edward, the Emperor Ivan, or the Sultan Achmet."
 
 "That may well be," said Candide.
 
 In a few days they reached the Bosphorus, and Candide began by paying a
 very high ransom for Cacambo. Then without losing time, he and his
 companions went on board a galley, in order to search on the banks of
 the Propontis for his Cunegonde, however ugly she might have become.
 
 Among the crew there were two slaves who rowed very badly, and to whose
 bare shoulders the Levantine captain would now and then apply blows from
 a bull's pizzle. Candide, from a natural impulse, looked at these two
 slaves more attentively than at the other oarsmen, and approached them
 with pity. Their features though greatly disfigured, had a slight
 resemblance to those of Pangloss and the unhappy Jesuit and Westphalian
 Baron, brother to Miss Cunegonde. This moved and saddened him. He looked
 at them still more attentively.
 
 "Indeed," said he to Cacambo, "if I had not seen Master Pangloss hanged,
 and if I had not had the misfortune to kill the Baron, I should think it
 was they that were rowing."
 
 At the names of the Baron and of Pangloss, the two galley-slaves uttered
 a loud cry, held fast by the seat, and let drop their oars. The captain
 ran up to them and redoubled his blows with the bull's pizzle.
 
 "Stop! stop! sir," cried Candide. "I will give you what money you
 please."
 
 "What! it is Candide!" said one of the slaves.
 
 "What! it is Candide!" said the other.
 
 "Do I dream?" cried Candide; "am I awake? or am I on board a galley? Is
 this the Baron whom I killed? Is this Master Pangloss whom I saw
 hanged?"
 
 "It is we! it is we!" answered they.
 
 "Well! is this the great philosopher?" said Martin.
 
 "Ah! captain," said Candide, "what ransom will you take for Monsieur de
 Thunder-ten-Tronckh, one of the first barons of the empire, and for
 Monsieur Pangloss, the profoundest metaphysician in Germany?"
 
 "Dog of a Christian," answered the Levantine captain, "since these two
 dogs of Christian slaves are barons and metaphysicians, which I doubt
 not are high dignities in their country, you shall give me fifty
 thousand sequins."
 
 "You shall have them, sir. Carry me back at once to Constantinople, and
 you shall receive the money directly. But no; carry me first to Miss
 Cunegonde."
 
 Upon the first proposal made by Candide, however, the Levantine captain
 had already tacked about, and made the crew ply their oars quicker than
 a bird cleaves the air.
 
 Candide embraced the Baron and Pangloss a hundred times.
 
 "And how happened it, my dear Baron, that I did not kill you? And, my
 dear Pangloss, how came you to life again after being hanged? And why
 are you both in a Turkish galley?"
 
 "And it is true that my dear sister is in this country?" said the Baron.
 
 "Yes," answered Cacambo.
 
 "Then I behold, once more, my dear Candide," cried Pangloss.
 
 Candide presented Martin and Cacambo to them; they embraced each other,
 and all spoke at once. The galley flew; they were already in the port.
 Instantly Candide sent for a Jew, to whom he sold for fifty thousand
 sequins a diamond worth a hundred thousand, though the fellow swore to
 him by Abraham that he could give him no more. He immediately paid the
 ransom for the Baron and Pangloss. The latter threw himself at the feet
 of his deliverer, and bathed them with his tears; the former thanked him
 with a nod, and promised to return him the money on the first
 opportunity.
 
 "But is it indeed possible that my sister can be in Turkey?" said he.
 
 "Nothing is more possible," said Cacambo, "since she scours the dishes
 in the service of a Transylvanian prince."
 
 Candide sent directly for two Jews and sold them some more diamonds, and
 then they all set out together in another galley to deliver Cunegonde
 from slavery.
 
 
 
 
 XXVIII
 
 WHAT HAPPENED TO CANDIDE, CUNEGONDE, PANGLOSS, MARTIN, ETC.
 
 
 "I ask your pardon once more," said Candide to the Baron, "your pardon,
 reverend father, for having run you through the body."
 
 "Say no more about it," answered the Baron. "I was a little too hasty, I
 own, but since you wish to know by what fatality I came to be a
 galley-slave I will inform you. After I had been cured by the surgeon of
 the college of the wound you gave me, I was attacked and carried off by
 a party of Spanish troops, who confined me in prison at Buenos Ayres at
 the very time my sister was setting out thence. I asked leave to return
 to Rome to the General of my Order. I was appointed chaplain to the
 French Ambassador at Constantinople. I had not been eight days in this
 employment when one evening I met with a young Ichoglan, who was a very
 handsome fellow. The weather was warm. The young man wanted to bathe,
 and I took this opportunity of bathing also. I did not know that it was
 a capital crime for a Christian to be found naked with a young
 Mussulman. A cadi ordered me a hundred blows on the soles of the feet,
 and condemned me to the galleys. I do not think there ever was a greater
 act of injustice. But I should be glad to know how my sister came to be
 scullion to a Transylvanian prince who has taken shelter among the
 Turks."
 
 "But you, my dear Pangloss," said Candide, "how can it be that I behold
 you again?"
 
 "It is true," said Pangloss, "that you saw me hanged. I should have been
 burnt, but you may remember it rained exceedingly hard when they were
 going to roast me; the storm was so violent that they despaired of
 lighting the fire, so I was hanged because they could do no better. A
 surgeon purchased my body, carried me home, and dissected me. He began
 with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula.
 One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the
 Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people
 marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was
 wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short,
 I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a
 frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back, and imagining
 that he had been dissecting the devil he ran away, dying with fear, and
 fell down the staircase in his flight. His wife, hearing the noise,
 flew from the next room. She saw me stretched out upon the table with my
 crucial incision. She was seized with yet greater fear than her husband,
 fled, and tumbled over him. When they came to themselves a little, I
 heard the wife say to her husband: 'My dear, how could you take it into
 your head to dissect a heretic? Do you not know that these people always
 have the devil in their bodies? I will go and fetch a priest this minute
 to exorcise him.' At this proposal I shuddered, and mustering up what
 little courage I had still remaining I cried out aloud, 'Have mercy on
 me!' At length the Portuguese barber plucked up his spirits. He sewed up
 my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of
 fifteen days. The barber found me a place as lackey to a knight of Malta
 who was going to Venice, but finding that my master had no money to pay
 me my wages I entered the service of a Venetian merchant, and went with
 him to Constantinople. One day I took it into my head to step into a
 mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was
 saying her paternosters. Her bosom was uncovered, and between her
 breasts she had a beautiful bouquet of tulips, roses, anemones,
 ranunculus, hyacinths, and auriculas. She dropped her bouquet; I picked
 it up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long
 in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was
 a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who
 ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the
 galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the
 young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from
 Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told
 us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had
 suffered greater injustice than I, and I insisted that it was far more
 innocent to take up a bouquet and place it again on a woman's bosom than
 to be found stark naked with an Ichoglan. We were continually disputing,
 and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation
 of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough
 to ransom us."
 
 "Well, my dear Pangloss," said Candide to him, "when you had been
 hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always
 think that everything happens for the best?"
 
 "I am still of my first opinion," answered Pangloss, "for I am a
 philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be
 wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in
 the world, and so is his _plenum_ and _materia subtilis_."
 
 
 
 
 XXIX
 
 HOW CANDIDE FOUND CUNEGONDE AND THE OLD WOMAN AGAIN.
 
 
 While Candide, the Baron, Pangloss, Martin, and Cacambo were relating
 their several adventures, were reasoning on the contingent or
 non-contingent events of the universe, disputing on effects and causes,
 on moral and physical evil, on liberty and necessity, and on the
 consolations a slave may feel even on a Turkish galley, they arrived at
 the house of the Transylvanian prince on the banks of the Propontis. The
 first objects which met their sight were Cunegonde and the old woman
 hanging towels out to dry.
 
 The Baron paled at this sight. The tender, loving Candide, seeing his
 beautiful Cunegonde embrowned, with blood-shot eyes, withered neck,
 wrinkled cheeks, and rough, red arms, recoiled three paces, seized with
 horror, and then advanced out of good manners. She embraced Candide and
 her brother; they embraced the old woman, and Candide ransomed them
 both.
 
 There was a small farm in the neighbourhood which the old woman
 proposed to Candide to make a shift with till the company could be
 provided for in a better manner. Cunegonde did not know she had grown
 ugly, for nobody had told her of it; and she reminded Candide of his
 promise in so positive a tone that the good man durst not refuse her. He
 therefore intimated to the Baron that he intended marrying his sister.
 
 "I will not suffer," said the Baron, "such meanness on her part, and
 such insolence on yours; I will never be reproached with this scandalous
 thing; my sister's children would never be able to enter the church in
 Germany. No; my sister shall only marry a baron of the empire."
 
 Cunegonde flung herself at his feet, and bathed them with her tears;
 still he was inflexible.
 
 "Thou foolish fellow," said Candide; "I have delivered thee out of the
 galleys, I have paid thy ransom, and thy sister's also; she was a
 scullion, and is very ugly, yet I am so condescending as to marry her;
 and dost thou pretend to oppose the match? I should kill thee again,
 were I only to consult my anger."
 
 "Thou mayest kill me again," said the Baron, "but thou shalt not marry
 my sister, at least whilst I am living."
 
 
 
 
 XXX
 
 THE CONCLUSION.
 
 
 At the bottom of his heart Candide had no wish to marry Cunegonde. But
 the extreme impertinence of the Baron determined him to conclude the
 match, and Cunegonde pressed him so strongly that he could not go from
 his word. He consulted Pangloss, Martin, and the faithful Cacambo.
 Pangloss drew up an excellent memorial, wherein he proved that the Baron
 had no right over his sister, and that according to all the laws of the
 empire, she might marry Candide with her left hand. Martin was for
 throwing the Baron into the sea; Cacambo decided that it would be better
 to deliver him up again to the captain of the galley, after which they
 thought to send him back to the General Father of the Order at Rome by
 the first ship. This advice was well received, the old woman approved
 it; they said not a word to his sister; the thing was executed for a
 little money, and they had the double pleasure of entrapping a Jesuit,
 and punishing the pride of a German baron.
 
 It is natural to imagine that after so many disasters Candide married,
 and living with the philosopher Pangloss, the philosopher Martin, the
 prudent Cacambo, and the old woman, having besides brought so many
 diamonds from the country of the ancient Incas, must have led a very
 happy life. But he was so much imposed upon by the Jews that he had
 nothing left except his small farm; his wife became uglier every day,
 more peevish and unsupportable; the old woman was infirm and even more
 fretful than Cunegonde. Cacambo, who worked in the garden, and took
 vegetables for sale to Constantinople, was fatigued with hard work, and
 cursed his destiny. Pangloss was in despair at not shining in some
 German university. For Martin, he was firmly persuaded that he would be
 as badly off elsewhere, and therefore bore things patiently. Candide,
 Martin, and Pangloss sometimes disputed about morals and metaphysics.
 They often saw passing under the windows of their farm boats full of
 Effendis, Pashas, and Cadis, who were going into banishment to Lemnos,
 Mitylene, or Erzeroum. And they saw other Cadis, Pashas, and Effendis
 coming to supply the place of the exiles, and afterwards exiled in their
 turn. They saw heads decently impaled for presentation to the Sublime
 Porte. Such spectacles as these increased the number of their
 dissertations; and when they did not dispute time hung so heavily upon
 their hands, that one day the old woman ventured to say to them:
 
 "I want to know which is worse, to be ravished a hundred times by negro
 pirates, to have a buttock cut off, to run the gauntlet among the
 Bulgarians, to be whipped and hanged at an _auto-da-fe_, to be
 dissected, to row in the galleys--in short, to go through all the
 miseries we have undergone, or to stay here and have nothing to do?"
 
 "It is a great question," said Candide.
 
 This discourse gave rise to new reflections, and Martin especially
 concluded that man was born to live either in a state of distracting
 inquietude or of lethargic disgust. Candide did not quite agree to that,
 but he affirmed nothing. Pangloss owned that he had always suffered
 horribly, but as he had once asserted that everything went wonderfully
 well, he asserted it still, though he no longer believed it.
 
 What helped to confirm Martin in his detestable principles, to stagger
 Candide more than ever, and to puzzle Pangloss, was that one day they
 saw Paquette and Friar Giroflee land at the farm in extreme misery. They
 had soon squandered their three thousand piastres, parted, were
 reconciled, quarrelled again, were thrown into gaol, had escaped, and
 Friar Giroflee had at length become Turk. Paquette continued her trade
 wherever she went, but made nothing of it.
 
 "I foresaw," said Martin to Candide, "that your presents would soon be
 dissipated, and only make them the more miserable. You have rolled in
 millions of money, you and Cacambo; and yet you are not happier than
 Friar Giroflee and Paquette."
 
 "Ha!" said Pangloss to Paquette, "Providence has then brought you
 amongst us again, my poor child! Do you know that you cost me the tip of
 my nose, an eye, and an ear, as you may see? What a world is this!"
 
 And now this new adventure set them philosophising more than ever.
 
 In the neighbourhood there lived a very famous Dervish who was esteemed
 the best philosopher in all Turkey, and they went to consult him.
 Pangloss was the speaker.
 
 "Master," said he, "we come to beg you to tell why so strange an animal
 as man was made."
 
 "With what meddlest thou?" said the Dervish; "is it thy business?"
 
 "But, reverend father," said Candide, "there is horrible evil in this
 world."
 
 "What signifies it," said the Dervish, "whether there be evil or good?
 When his highness sends a ship to Egypt, does he trouble his head
 whether the mice on board are at their ease or not?"
 
 "What, then, must we do?" said Pangloss.
 
 "Hold your tongue," answered the Dervish.
 
 "I was in hopes," said Pangloss, "that I should reason with you a little
 about causes and effects, about the best of possible worlds, the origin
 of evil, the nature of the soul, and the pre-established harmony."
 
 At these words, the Dervish shut the door in their faces.
 
 During this conversation, the news was spread that two Viziers and the
 Mufti had been strangled at Constantinople, and that several of their
 friends had been impaled. This catastrophe made a great noise for some
 hours. Pangloss, Candide, and Martin, returning to the little farm, saw
 a good old man taking the fresh air at his door under an orange bower.
 Pangloss, who was as inquisitive as he was argumentative, asked the old
 man what was the name of the strangled Mufti.
 
 "I do not know," answered the worthy man, "and I have not known the name
 of any Mufti, nor of any Vizier. I am entirely ignorant of the event you
 mention; I presume in general that they who meddle with the
 administration of public affairs die sometimes miserably, and that they
 deserve it; but I never trouble my head about what is transacting at
 Constantinople; I content myself with sending there for sale the fruits
 of the garden which I cultivate."
 
 Having said these words, he invited the strangers into his house; his
 two sons and two daughters presented them with several sorts of sherbet,
 which they made themselves, with Kaimak enriched with the candied-peel
 of citrons, with oranges, lemons, pine-apples, pistachio-nuts, and Mocha
 coffee unadulterated with the bad coffee of Batavia or the American
 islands. After which the two daughters of the honest Mussulman perfumed
 the strangers' beards.
 
 "You must have a vast and magnificent estate," said Candide to the Turk.
 
 "I have only twenty acres," replied the old man; "I and my children
 cultivate them; our labour preserves us from three great
 evils--weariness, vice, and want."
 
 Candide, on his way home, made profound reflections on the old man's
 conversation.
 
 "This honest Turk," said he to Pangloss and Martin, "seems to be in a
 situation far preferable to that of the six kings with whom we had the
 honour of supping."
 
 "Grandeur," said Pangloss, "is extremely dangerous according to the
 testimony of philosophers. For, in short, Eglon, King of Moab, was
 assassinated by Ehud; Absalom was hung by his hair, and pierced with
 three darts; King Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, was killed by Baasa; King
 Ela by Zimri; Ahaziah by Jehu; Athaliah by Jehoiada; the Kings
 Jehoiakim, Jeconiah, and Zedekiah, were led into captivity. You know how
 perished Croesus, Astyages, Darius, Dionysius of Syracuse, Pyrrhus,
 Perseus, Hannibal, Jugurtha, Ariovistus, Caesar, Pompey, Nero, Otho,
 Vitellius, Domitian, Richard II. of England, Edward II., Henry VI.,
 Richard III., Mary Stuart, Charles I., the three Henrys of France, the
 Emperor Henry IV.! You know----"
 
 "I know also," said Candide, "that we must cultivate our garden."
 
 "You are right," said Pangloss, "for when man was first placed in the
 Garden of Eden, he was put there _ut operaretur eum_, that he might
 cultivate it; which shows that man was not born to be idle."
 
 "Let us work," said Martin, "without disputing; it is the only way to
 render life tolerable."
 
 The whole little society entered into this laudable design, according to
 their different abilities. Their little plot of land produced plentiful
 crops. Cunegonde was, indeed, very ugly, but she became an excellent
 pastry cook; Paquette worked at embroidery; the old woman looked after
 the linen. They were all, not excepting Friar Giroflee, of some service
 or other; for he made a good joiner, and became a very honest man.
 
 Pangloss sometimes said to Candide:
 
 "There is a concatenation of events in this best of all possible worlds:
 for if you had not been kicked out of a magnificent castle for love of
 Miss Cunegonde: if you had not been put into the Inquisition: if you had
 not walked over America: if you had not stabbed the Baron: if you had
 not lost all your sheep from the fine country of El Dorado: you would
 not be here eating preserved citrons and pistachio-nuts."
 
 "All that is very well," answered Candide, "but let us cultivate our
 garden."
 
 
 
 
 FOOTNOTES:
 
 [1] P. 2. The name Pangloss is derived from two Greek words signifying
 "all" and "language."
 
 [2] P. 8. The Abares were a tribe of Tartars settled on the shores of
 the Danube, who later dwelt in part of Circassia.
 
 [3] P. 15. Venereal disease was said to have been first brought from
 Hispaniola, in the West Indies, by some followers of Columbus who were
 later employed in the siege of Naples. From this latter circumstance it
 was at one time known as the Neapolitan disease.
 
 [4] P. 19. The great earthquake of Lisbon happened on the first of
 November, 1755.
 
 [5] P. 20. Such was the aversion of the Japanese to the Christian faith
 that they compelled Europeans trading with their islands to trample on
 the cross, renounce all marks of Christianity, and swear that it was not
 their religion. See chap. xi. of the voyage to Laputa in Swift's
 _Gulliver's Travels_.
 
 [6] P. 23. This _auto-da-fe_ actually took place, some months after the
 earthquake, on June 20, 1756.
 
 [7] P. 23. The rejection of bacon convicting them, of course, of being
 Jews, and therefore fitting victims for an _auto-da-fe_.
 
 [8] P. 24. The _San-benito_ was a kind of loose over-garment painted
 with flames, figures of devils, the victim's own portrait, etc., worn by
 persons condemned to death by the Inquisition when going to the stake on
 the occasion of an _auto-da-fe_. Those who expressed repentance for
 their errors wore a garment of the same kind covered with flames
 directed downwards, while that worn by Jews, sorcerers, and renegades
 bore a St. Andrew's cross before and behind.
 
 [9] P. 26. "This Notre-Dame is of wood; every year she weeps on the day
 of her _fete_, and the people weep also. One day the preacher, seeing a
 carpenter with dry eyes, asked him how it was that he did not dissolve
 in tears when the Holy Virgin wept. 'Ah, my reverend father,' replied
 he, 'it is I who refastened her in her niche yesterday. I drove three
 great nails through her behind; it is then she would have wept if she
 had been able.'"--Voltaire, _Melanges_.
 
 [10] P. 42. The following posthumous note of Voltaire's was first added
 to M. Beuchot's edition of his works issued in 1829; "See the extreme
 discretion of the author; there has not been up to the present any Pope
 named Urban X.; he feared to give a bastard to a known Pope. What
 circumspection! What delicacy of conscience!" The last Pope Urban was
 the eighth, and he died in 1644.
 
 [11] P. 45. Muley-Ismael was Emperor of Morocco from 1672 to 1727, and
 was a notoriously cruel tyrant.
 
 [12] P. 47. "Oh, what a misfortune to be an eunuch!"
 
 [13] P. 48. Carlo Broschi, called Farinelli, an Italian singer, born at
 Naples in 1705, without being exactly Minister, governed Spain under
 Ferdinand VI.; he died in 1782. He has been made one of the chief
 persons in one of the comic operas of MM. Auber and Scribe.
 
 [14] P. 53. Jean Robeck, a Swede, who was born in 1672, will be found
 mentioned in Rousseau's _Nouvelle Heloise_. He drowned himself in the
 Weser at Bremen in 1729, and was the author of a Latin treatise on
 voluntary death, first printed in 1735.
 
 [15] P. 60. A spontoon was a kind of half-pike, a military weapon
 carried by officers of infantry and used as a medium for signalling
 orders to the regiment.
 
 [16] P. 64. Later Voltaire substituted the name of the Father Croust for
 that of Didrie. Of Croust he said in the _Dictionnaire Philosophique_
 that he was "the most brutal of the Society."
 
 [17] P. 68. By the _Journal of Trevoux_ Voltaire meant a critical
 periodical printed by the Jesuits at Trevoux under the title of
 _Memoires pour servir a l'Historie des Sciences et des Beaux-Arts_. It
 existed from 1701 until 1767, during which period its title underwent
 many changes.
 
 [18] P. 76. It has been suggested that Voltaire, in speaking of red
 sheep, referred to the llama, a South American ruminant allied to the
 camel. These animals are sometimes of a reddish colour, and were notable
 as pack-carriers and for their fleetness.
 
 [19] P. 78. The first English translator curiously gives "a tourene of
 bouilli that weighed two hundred pounds," as the equivalent of "_un
 contour bouilli qui pesait deux cent livres_." The French editor of the
 1869 reprint points out that the South American vulture, or condor, is
 meant; the name of this bird, it may be added, is taken from "_cuntur_,"
 that given it by the aborigines.
 
 [20] P. 90. Spanish half-crowns.
 
 [21] P. 99. _Socinians_; followers of the teaching of Lalius and Faustus
 Socinus (16th century), which denied the doctrine of the Trinity, the
 deity of Christ, the personality of the devil, the native and total
 depravity of man, the vicarious atonement and eternal punishment. The
 Socinians are now represented by the Unitarians. _Manicheans_; followers
 of Manes or Manichaeus (3rd century), a Persian who maintained that there
 are two principles, the one good and the other evil, each equally
 powerful in the government of the world.
 
 [22] P. 107. In the 1759 editions, in place of the long passage in
 brackets from here to page 215, there was only the following: "'Sir,'
 said the Perigordian Abbe to him, 'have you noticed that young person
 who has so roguish a face and so fine a figure? You may have her for ten
 thousand francs a month, and fifty thousand crowns in diamonds.' 'I have
 only a day or two to give her,' answered Candide, 'because I have a
 rendezvous at Venice.' In the evening after supper the insinuating
 Perigordian redoubled his politeness and attentions."
 
 [23] P. 108. The play referred to is supposed to be "Le Comte d'Essex,"
 by Thomas Corneille.
 
 [24] P. 108. In France actors were at one time looked upon as
 excommunicated persons, not worthy of burial in holy ground or with
 Christian rites. In 1730 the "honours of sepulture" were refused to
 Mademoiselle Lecouvreur (doubtless the Miss Monime of this passage).
 Voltaire's miscellaneous works contain a paper on the matter.
 
 [25] P. 109. Elie-Catherine Freron was a French critic (1719-1776) who
 incurred the enmity of Voltaire. In 1752 Freron, in _Lettres sur
 quelques ecrits du temps_, wrote pointedly of Voltaire as one who chose
 to be all things to all men, and Voltaire retaliated by references such
 as these in _Candide_.
 
 [26] P. 111. Gabriel Gauchat (1709-1779), French ecclesiastical writer,
 was author of a number of works on religious subjects.
 
 [27] P. 112. Nicholas Charles Joseph Trublet (1697-1770) was a French
 writer whose criticism of Voltaire was revenged in passages such as this
 one in _Candide_, and one in the _Pauvre Diable_ beginning:
 
     L'abbe Trublet avait alors le rage
     D'etre a Paris un petit personage.
 
 [28] P. 120. Damiens, who attempted the life of Louis XV. in 1757, was
 born at Arras, capital of Artois (Atrebatie).
 
 [29] P. 120. On May 14, 1610, Ravaillac assassinated Henry VI.
 
 [30] P. 120. On December 27, 1594, Jean Chatel attempted to assassinate
 Henry IV.
 
 [31] P. 122. This same curiously inept criticism of the war which cost
 France her American provinces occurs in Voltaire's _Memoirs_, wherein he
 says, "In 1756 England made a piratical war upon France for some acres
 of snow." See also his _Precis du Siecle de Louis_ XV.
 
 [32] P. 123. Admiral Byng was shot on March 14, 1757.
 
 [33] P. 129. Commenting upon this passage, M. Sarcey says admirably:
 "All is there! In those ten lines Voltaire has gathered all the griefs
 and all the terrors of these creatures; the picture is admirable for its
 truth and power! But do you not feel the pity and sympathy of the
 painter? Here irony becomes sad, and in a way an avenger. Voltaire cries
 out with horror against the society which throws some of its members
 into such an abyss. He has his 'Bartholomew' fever; we tremble with him
 through contagion."
 
 [34] P. 142. The following particulars of the six monarchs may prove not
 uninteresting. Achmet III. (_b._ 1673, _d._ 1739) was dethroned in 1730.
 Ivan VI. (_b._ 1740, _d._ 1762) was dethroned in 1741. Charles Edward
 Stuart, the Pretender (_b._ 1720, _d._ 1788). Auguste III. (_b._ 1696,
 _d._ 1763). Stanislaus (_b._ 1682, _d._ 1766). Theodore (_b._ 1690, _d._
 1755). It will be observed that, although quite impossible for the six
 kings ever to have met, five of them might have been made to do so
 without any anachronism.
 
 [35] P. 149. Francois Leopold Ragotsky (1676-1735).

 LETTERS ON ENGLAND
 by Voltaire
 
 
 INTRODUCTION
 
 
 Francois Marie Arouet, who called himself Voltaire, was the son of
 Francois Arouet of Poitou, who lived in Paris, had given up his office of
 notary two years before the birth of this his third son, and obtained
 some years afterwards a treasurer's office in the Chambre des Comptes.
 Voltaire was born in the year 1694.  He lived until within ten or eleven
 years of the outbreak of the Great French Revolution, and was a chief
 leader in the movement of thought that preceded the Revolution.  Though
 he lived to his eighty-fourth year, Voltaire was born with a weak body.
 His brother Armand, eight years his senior, became a Jansenist.  Voltaire
 when ten years old was placed with the Jesuits in the College Louis-le-
 Grand.  There he was taught during seven years, and his genius was
 encouraged in its bent for literature; skill in speaking and in writing
 being especially fostered in the system of education which the Jesuits
 had planned to produce capable men who by voice and pen could give a
 reason for the faith they held.  Verses written for an invalid soldier at
 the age of eleven won for young Voltaire the friendship of Ninon
 l'Enclos, who encouraged him to go on writing verses.  She died soon
 afterwards, and remembered him with a legacy of two thousand livres for
 purchase of books.  He wrote in his lively school-days a tragedy that
 afterwards he burnt.  At the age of seventeen he left the College Louis-
 le-Grand, where he said afterwards that he had been taught nothing but
 Latin and the Stupidities.  He was then sent to the law schools, and saw
 life in Paris as a gay young poet who, with all his brilliant liveliness,
 had an aptitude for looking on the tragic side of things, and one of
 whose first poems was an "Ode on the Misfortunes of Life."  His mother
 died when he was twenty.  Voltaire's father thought him a fool for his
 versifying, and attached him as secretary to the Marquis of Chateauneuf;
 when he went as ambassador to the Hague.  In December, 1713, he was
 dismissed for his irregularities.  In Paris his unsteadiness and his
 addiction to literature caused his father to rejoice in getting him
 housed in a country chateau with M. de Caumartin.  M. de Caumartin's
 father talked with such enthusiasm of Henri IV. and Sully that Voltaire
 planned the writing of what became his _Henriade_, and his "History of
 the Age of Louis XIV.," who died on the 1st of September, 1715.
 
 Under the regency that followed, Voltaire got into trouble again and
 again through the sharpness of his pen, and at last, accused of verse
 that satirised the Regent, he was locked up--on the 17th of May, 1717--in
 the Bastille.  There he wrote the first two books of his _Henriade_, and
 finished a play on OEdipus, which he had begun at the age of eighteen.  He
 did not obtain full liberty until the 12th of April, 1718, and it was at
 this time--with a clearly formed design to associate the name he took
 with work of high attempt in literature--that Francois Marie Arouet, aged
 twenty-four, first called himself Voltaire.
 
 Voltaire's _OEdipe_ was played with success in November, 1718.  A few
 months later he was again banished from Paris, and finished the
 _Henriade_ in his retirement, as well as another play, _Artemise_, that
 was acted in February, 1720.  Other plays followed.  In December, 1721,
 Voltaire visited Lord Bolingbroke, who was then an exile from England, at
 the Chateau of La Source.  There was now constant literary activity.  From
 July to October, 1722, Voltaire visited Holland with Madame de
 Rupelmonde.  After a serious attack of small-pox in November, 1723,
 Voltaire was active as a poet about the Court.  He was then in receipt of
 a pension of two thousand livres from the king, and had inherited more
 than twice as much by the death of his father in January, 1722.  But in
 December, 1725, a quarrel, fastened upon him by the Chevalier de Rohan,
 who had him waylaid and beaten, caused him to send a challenge.  For this
 he was arrested and lodged once more, in April, 1726, in the Bastille.
 There he was detained a month; and his first act when he was released was
 to ask for a passport to England.
 
 Voltaire left France, reached London in August, 1726, went as guest to
 the house of a rich merchant at Wandsworth, and remained three years in
 this country, from the age of thirty-two to the age of thirty-five.  He
 was here when George I. died, and George II. became king.  He published
 here his _Henriade_.  He wrote here his "History of Charles XII."  He
 read "Gulliver's Travels" as a new book, and might have been present at
 the first night of _The Beggar's Opera_.  He was here whet Sir Isaac
 Newton died.
 
 In 1731 he published at Rouen the _Lettres sur les Anglais_, which
 appeared in England in 1733 in the volume from which they are here
 reprinted.

 LETTERS ON ENGLAND
 
 
 LETTER I.--ON THE QUAKERS
 
 
 I was of opinion that the doctrine and history of so extraordinary a
 people were worthy the attention of the curious.  To acquaint myself with
 them I made a visit to one of the most eminent Quakers in England, who,
 after having traded thirty years, had the wisdom to prescribe limits to
 his fortune and to his desires, and was settled in a little solitude not
 far from London.  Being come into it, I perceived a small but regularly
 built house, vastly neat, but without the least pomp of furniture.  The
 Quaker who owned it was a hale, ruddy-complexioned old man, who had never
 been afflicted with sickness because he had always been insensible to
 passions, and a perfect stranger to intemperance.  I never in my life saw
 a more noble or a more engaging aspect than his.  He was dressed like
 those of his persuasion, in a plain coat without pleats in the sides, or
 buttons on the pockets and sleeves; and had on a beaver, the brims of
 which were horizontal like those of our clergy.  He did not uncover
 himself when I appeared, and advanced towards me without once stooping
 his body; but there appeared more politeness in the open, humane air of
 his countenance, than in the custom of drawing one leg behind the other,
 and taking that from the head which is made to cover it.  "Friend," says
 he to me, "I perceive thou art a stranger, but if I can do anything for
 thee, only tell me."  "Sir," said I to him, bending forwards and
 advancing, as is usual with us, one leg towards him, "I flatter myself
 that my just curiosity will not give you the least offence, and that
 you'll do me the honour to inform me of the particulars of your
 religion."  "The people of thy country," replied the Quaker, "are too
 full of their bows and compliments, but I never yet met with one of them
 who had so much curiosity as thyself.  Come in, and let us first dine
 together."  I still continued to make some very unseasonable ceremonies,
 it not being easy to disengage one's self at once from habits we have
 been long used to; and after taking part in a frugal meal, which began
 and ended with a prayer to God, I began to question my courteous host.  I
 opened with that which good Catholics have more than once made to
 Huguenots.  "My dear sir," said I, "were you ever baptised?"  "I never
 was," replied the Quaker, "nor any of my brethren."  "Zounds!" say I to
 him, "you are not Christians, then."  "Friend," replies the old man in a
 soft tone of voice, "swear not; we are Christians, and endeavour to be
 good Christians, but we are not of opinion that the sprinkling water on a
 child's head makes him a Christian."  "Heavens!" say I, shocked at his
 impiety, "you have then forgot that Christ was baptised by St. John."
 "Friend," replies the mild Quaker once again, "swear not; Christ indeed
 was baptised by John, but He himself never baptised anyone.  We are the
 disciples of Christ, not of John."  I pitied very much the sincerity of
 my worthy Quaker, and was absolutely for forcing him to get himself
 christened.  "Were that all," replied he very gravely, "we would submit
 cheerfully to baptism, purely in compliance with thy weakness, for we
 don't condemn any person who uses it; but then we think that those who
 profess a religion of so holy, so spiritual a nature as that of Christ,
 ought to abstain to the utmost of their power from the Jewish
 ceremonies."  "O unaccountable!" say I: "what! baptism a Jewish
 ceremony?"  "Yes, my friend," says he, "so truly Jewish, that a great
 many Jews use the baptism of John to this day.  Look into ancient
 authors, and thou wilt find that John only revived this practice; and
 that it had been used by the Hebrews, long before his time, in like
 manner as the Mahometans imitated the Ishmaelites in their pilgrimages to
 Mecca.  Jesus indeed submitted to the baptism of John, as He had suffered
 Himself to be circumcised; but circumcision and the washing with water
 ought to be abolished by the baptism of Christ, that baptism of the
 Spirit, that ablution of the soul, which is the salvation of mankind.
 Thus the forerunner said, 'I indeed baptise you with water unto
 repentance; but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I
 am not worthy to bear: he shall baptise you with the Holy Ghost and with
 fire.'  Likewise Paul, the great apostle of the Gentiles, writes as
 follows to the Corinthians, 'Christ sent me not to baptise, but to preach
 the Gospel;' and indeed Paul never baptised but two persons with water,
 and that very much against his inclinations.  He circumcised his disciple
 Timothy, and the other disciples likewise circumcised all who were
 willing to submit to that carnal ordinance.  But art thou circumcised?"
 added he.  "I have not the honour to be so," say I.  "Well, friend,"
 continues the Quaker, "thou art a Christian without being circumcised,
 and I am one without being baptised."  Thus did this pious man make a
 wrong but very specious application of four or five texts of Scripture
 which seemed to favour the tenets of his sect; but at the same time
 forgot very sincerely an hundred texts which made directly against them.
 I had more sense than to contest with him, since there is no possibility
 of convincing an enthusiast.  A man should never pretend to inform a
 lover of his mistress's faults, no more than one who is at law, of the
 badness of his cause; nor attempt to win over a fanatic by strength of
 reasoning.  Accordingly I waived the subject.
 
 "Well," said I to him, "what sort of a communion have you?"  "We have
 none like that thou hintest at among us," replied he.  "How! no
 communion?" said I.  "Only that spiritual one," replied he, "of hearts."
 He then began again to throw out his texts of Scripture; and preached a
 most eloquent sermon against that ordinance.  He harangued in a tone as
 though he had been inspired, to prove that the sacraments were merely of
 human invention, and that the word "sacrament" was not once mentioned in
 the Gospel.  "Excuse," said he, "my ignorance, for I have not employed a
 hundredth part of the arguments which might be brought to prove the truth
 of our religion, but these thou thyself mayest peruse in the Exposition
 of our Faith written by Robert Barclay.  It is one of the best pieces
 that ever was penned by man; and as our adversaries confess it to be of
 dangerous tendency, the arguments in it must necessarily be very
 convincing."  I promised to peruse this piece, and my Quaker imagined he
 had already made a convert of me.  He afterwards gave me an account in
 few words of some singularities which make this sect the contempt of
 others.  "Confess," said he, "that it was very difficult for thee to
 refrain from laughter, when I answered all thy civilities without
 uncovering my head, and at the same time said 'thee' and 'thou' to thee.
 However, thou appearest to me too well read not to know that in Christ's
 time no nation was so ridiculous as to put the plural number for the
 singular.  Augustus Caesar himself was spoken to in such phrases as
 these: 'I love thee,' 'I beseech thee,' 'I thank thee;' but he did not
 allow any person to call him 'Domine,' sir.  It was not till many ages
 after that men would have the word 'you,' as though they were double,
 instead of 'thou' employed in speaking to them; and usurped the
 flattering titles of lordship, of eminence, and of holiness, which mere
 worms bestow on other worms by assuring them that they are with a most
 profound respect, and an infamous falsehood, their most obedient humble
 servants.  It is to secure ourselves more strongly from such a shameless
 traffic of lies and flattery, that we 'thee' and 'thou' a king with the
 same freedom as we do a beggar, and salute no person; we owing nothing to
 mankind but charity, and to the laws respect and obedience.
 
 "Our apparel is also somewhat different from that of others, and this
 purely, that it may be a perpetual warning to us not to imitate them.
 Others wear the badges and marks of their several dignities, and we those
 of Christian humility.  We fly from all assemblies of pleasure, from
 diversions of every kind, and from places where gaming is practised; and
 indeed our case would be very deplorable, should we fill with such
 levities as those I have mentioned the heart which ought to be the
 habitation of God.  We never swear, not even in a court of justice, being
 of opinion that the most holy name of God ought not to be prostituted in
 the miserable contests betwixt man and man.  When we are obliged to
 appear before a magistrate upon other people's account (for law-suits are
 unknown among the Friends), we give evidence to the truth by sealing it
 with our yea or nay; and the judges believe us on our bare affirmation,
 whilst so many other Christians forswear themselves on the holy Gospels.
 We never war or fight in any case; but it is not that we are afraid, for
 so far from shuddering at the thoughts of death, we on the contrary bless
 the moment which unites us with the Being of Beings; but the reason of
 our not using the outward sword is, that we are neither wolves, tigers,
 nor mastiffs, but men and Christians.  Our God, who has commanded us to
 love our enemies, and to suffer without repining, would certainly not
 permit us to cross the seas, merely because murderers clothed in scarlet,
 and wearing caps two foot high, enlist citizens by a noise made with two
 little sticks on an ass's skin extended.  And when, after a victory is
 gained, the whole city of London is illuminated; when the sky is in a
 blaze with fireworks, and a noise is heard in the air, of thanksgivings,
 of bells, of organs, and of the cannon, we groan in silence, and are
 deeply affected with sadness of spirit and brokenness of heart, for the
 sad havoc which is the occasion of those public rejoicings."
 
 
 
 LETTER II.--ON THE QUAKERS
 
 
 Such was the substance of the conversation I had with this very singular
 person; but I was greatly surprised to see him come the Sunday following
 and take me with him to the Quakers' meeting.  There are several of these
 in London, but that which he carried me to stands near the famous pillar
 called The Monument.  The brethren were already assembled at my entering
 it with my guide.  There might be about four hundred men and three
 hundred women in the meeting.  The women hid their faces behind their
 fans, and the men were covered with their broad-brimmed hats.  All were
 seated, and the silence was universal.  I passed through them, but did
 not perceive so much as one lift up his eyes to look at me.  This silence
 lasted a quarter of an hour, when at last one of them rose up, took off
 his hat, and, after making a variety of wry faces and groaning in a most
 lamentable manner, he, partly from his nose and partly from his mouth,
 threw out a strange, confused jumble of words (borrowed, as he imagined,
 from the Gospel) which neither himself nor any of his hearers understood.
 When this distorter had ended his beautiful soliloquy, and that the
 stupid, but greatly edified, congregation were separated, I asked my
 friend how it was possible for the judicious part of their assembly to
 suffer such a babbling?  "We are obliged," says he, "to suffer it,
 because no one knows when a man rises up to hold forth whether he will be
 moved by the Spirit or by folly.  In this doubt and uncertainty we listen
 patiently to everyone; we even allow our women to hold forth.  Two or
 three of these are often inspired at one and the same time, and it is
 then that a most charming noise is heard in the Lord's house."  "You
 have, then, no priests?" say I to him.  "No, no, friend," replies the
 Quaker, "to our great happiness."  Then opening one of the Friends'
 books, as he called it, he read the following words in an emphatic
 tone:--"'God forbid we should presume to ordain anyone to receive the
 Holy Spirit on the Lord's Day to the prejudice of the rest of the
 brethren.'  Thanks to the Almighty, we are the only people upon earth
 that have no priests.  Wouldst thou deprive us of so happy a distinction?
 Why should we abandon our babe to mercenary nurses, when we ourselves
 have milk enough for it?  These mercenary creatures would soon domineer
 in our houses and destroy both the mother and the babe.  God has said,
 'Freely you have received, freely give.'  Shall we, after these words,
 cheapen, as it were, the Gospel, sell the Holy Ghost, and make of an
 assembly of Christians a mere shop of traders?  We don't pay a set of men
 clothed in black to assist our poor, to bury our dead, or to preach to
 the brethren.  These offices are all of too tender a nature for us ever
 to entrust them to others."  "But how is it possible for you," said I,
 with some warmth, "to know whether your discourse is really inspired by
 the Almighty?"  "Whosoever," says he, "shall implore Christ to enlighten
 him, and shall publish the Gospel truths he may feel inwardly, such an
 one may be assured that he is inspired by the Lord."  He then poured
 forth a numberless multitude of Scripture texts which proved, as he
 imagined, that there is no such thing as Christianity without an
 immediate revelation, and added these remarkable words: "When thou movest
 one of thy limbs, is it moved by thy own power?  Certainly not; for this
 limb is often sensible to involuntary motions.  Consequently he who
 created thy body gives motion to this earthly tabernacle.  And are the
 several ideas of which thy soul receives the impression formed by
 thyself?  Much less are they, since these pour in upon thy mind whether
 thou wilt or no; consequently thou receivest thy ideas from Him who
 created thy soul.  But as He leaves thy affections at full liberty, He
 gives thy mind such ideas as thy affections may deserve; if thou livest
 in God, thou actest, thou thinkest in God.  After this thou needest only
 but open thine eyes to that light which enlightens all mankind, and it is
 then thou wilt perceive the truth, and make others perceive it."  "Why,
 this," said I, "is Malebranche's doctrine to a tittle."  "I am acquainted
 with thy Malebranche," said he; "he had something of the Friend in him,
 but was not enough so."  These are the most considerable particulars I
 learnt concerning the doctrine of the Quakers.  In my next letter I shall
 acquaint you with their history, which you will find more singular than
 their opinions.
 
 
 
 LETTER III.--ON THE QUAKERS
 
 
 You have already heard that the Quakers date from Christ, who, according
 to them, was the first Quaker.  Religion, say these, was corrupted a
 little after His death, and remained in that state of corruption about
 sixteen hundred years.  But there were always a few Quakers concealed in
 the world, who carefully preserved the sacred fire, which was
 extinguished in all but themselves, until at last this light spread
 itself in England in 1642.
 
 It was at the time when Great Britain was torn to pieces by the intestine
 wars which three or four sects had raised in the name of God, that one
 George Fox, born in Leicestershire, and son to a silk-weaver, took it
 into his head to preach, and, as he pretended, with all the requisites of
 a true apostle--that is, without being able either to read or write.  He
 was about twenty-five years of age, irreproachable in his life and
 conduct, and a holy madman.  He was equipped in leather from head to
 foot, and travelled from one village to another, exclaiming against war
 and the clergy.  Had his invectives been levelled against the soldiery
 only he would have been safe enough, but he inveighed against
 ecclesiastics.  Fox was seized at Derby, and being carried before a
 justice of peace, he did not once offer to pull off his leathern hat,
 upon which an officer gave him a great box of the ear, and cried to him,
 "Don't you know you are to appear uncovered before his worship?"  Fox
 presented his other cheek to the officer, and begged him to give him
 another box for God's sake.  The justice would have had him sworn before
 he asked him any questions.  "Know, friend," says Fox to him, "that I
 never swear."  The justice, observing he "thee'd" and "thou'd" him, sent
 him to the House of Correction, in Derby, with orders that he should be
 whipped there.  Fox praised the Lord all the way he went to the House of
 Correction, where the justice's order was executed with the utmost
 severity.  The men who whipped this enthusiast were greatly surprised to
 hear him beseech them to give him a few more lashes for the good of his
 soul.  There was no need of entreating these people; the lashes were
 repeated, for which Fox thanked them very cordially, and began to preach.
 At first the spectators fell a-laughing, but they afterwards listened to
 him; and as enthusiasm is an epidemical distemper, many were persuaded,
 and those who scourged him became his first disciples.  Being set at
 liberty, he ran up and down the country with a dozen proselytes at his
 heels, still declaiming against the clergy, and was whipped from time to
 time.  Being one day set in the pillory, he harangued the crowd in so
 strong and moving a manner, that fifty of the auditors became his
 converts, and he won the rest so much in his favour that, his head being
 freed tumultuously from the hole where it was fastened, the populace went
 and searched for the Church of England clergyman who had been chiefly
 instrumental in bringing him to this punishment, and set him on the same
 pillory where Fox had stood.
 
 Fox was bold enough to convert some of Oliver Cromwell's soldiers, who
 thereupon quitted the service and refused to take the oaths.  Oliver,
 having as great a contempt for a sect which would not allow its members
 to fight, as Sixtus Quintus had for another sect, _Dove non si chiamava_,
 began to persecute these new converts.  The prisons were crowded with
 them, but persecution seldom has any other effect than to increase the
 number of proselytes.  These came, therefore, from their confinement more
 strongly confirmed in the principles they had imbibed, and followed by
 their gaolers, whom they had brought over to their belief.  But the
 circumstances which contributed chiefly to the spreading of this sect
 were as follows:--Fox thought himself inspired, and consequently was of
 opinion that he must speak in a manner different from the rest of
 mankind.  He thereupon began to writhe his body, to screw up his face, to
 hold in his breath, and to exhale it in a forcible manner, insomuch that
 the priestess of the Pythian god at Delphos could not have acted her part
 to better advantage.  Inspiration soon became so habitual to him that he
 could scarce deliver himself in any other manner.  This was the first
 gift he communicated to his disciples.  These aped very sincerely their
 master's several grimaces, and shook in every limb the instant the fit of
 inspiration came upon them, whence they were called Quakers.  The vulgar
 attempted to mimic them; they trembled, they spake through the nose, they
 quaked and fancied themselves inspired by the Holy Ghost.  The only thing
 now wanting was a few miracles, and accordingly they wrought some.
 
 Fox, this modern patriarch, spoke thus to a justice of peace before a
 large assembly of people: "Friend, take care what thou dost; God will
 soon punish thee for persecuting His saints."  This magistrate, being one
 who besotted himself every day with bad beer and brandy, died of an
 apoplexy two days after, the moment he had signed a _mittimus_ for
 imprisoning some Quakers.  The sudden death with which this justice was
 seized was not ascribed to his intemperance, but was universally looked
 upon as the effect of the holy man's predictions; so that this accident
 made more converts to Quakerism than a thousand sermons and as many
 shaking fits could have done.  Oliver, finding them increase daily, was
 desirous of bringing them over to his party, and for that purpose
 attempted to bribe them by money.  However, they were incorruptible,
 which made him one day declare that this religion was the only one he had
 ever met with that had resisted the charms of gold.
 
 The Quakers were several times persecuted under Charles II.; not upon a
 religious account, but for refusing to pay the tithes, for "theeing" and
 "thouing" the magistrates, and for refusing to take the oaths enacted by
 the laws.
 
 At last Robert Barclay, a native of Scotland, presented to the King, in
 1675, his "Apology for the Quakers," a work as well drawn up as the
 subject could possibly admit.  The dedication to Charles II. is not
 filled with mean, flattering encomiums, but abounds with bold touches in
 favour of truth and with the wisest counsels.  "Thou hast tasted," says
 he to the King at the close of his epistle dedicatory, "of prosperity and
 adversity; thou knowest what it is to be banished thy native country; to
 be overruled as well as to rule and sit upon the throne; and, being
 oppressed, thou hast reason to know how hateful the Oppressor is both to
 God and man.  If, after all these warnings and advertisements, thou dost
 not turn unto the Lord with all thy heart, but forget Him who remembered
 thee in thy distress, and give up thyself to follow lust and vanity,
 surely great will be thy condemnation.
 
 "Against which snare, as well as the temptation of those that may or do
 feed thee and prompt thee to evil, the most excellent and prevalent
 remedy will be, to apply thyself to that light of Christ which shineth in
 thy conscience, which neither can nor will flatter thee nor suffer thee
 to be at ease in thy sins, but doth and will deal plainly and faithfully
 with thee, as those that are followers thereof have plainly done.--Thy
 faithful friend and subject, Robert Barclay."
 
 A more surprising circumstance is, that this epistle, written by a
 private man of no figure, was so happy in its effects, as to put a stop
 to the persecution.
 
 
 
 LETTER IV.--ON THE QUAKERS
 
 
 About this time arose the illustrious William Penn, who established the
 power of the Quakers in America, and would have made them appear
 venerable in the eyes of the Europeans, were it possible for mankind to
 respect virtue when revealed in a ridiculous light.  He was the only son
 of Vice-Admiral Penn, favourite of the Duke of York, afterwards King
 James II.
 
 William Penn, at twenty years of age, happening to meet with a Quaker in
 Cork, whom he had known at Oxford, this man made a proselyte of him; and
 William being a sprightly youth, and naturally eloquent, having a winning
 aspect, and a very engaging carriage, he soon gained over some of his
 intimates.  He carried matters so far, that he formed by insensible
 degrees a society of young Quakers, who met at his house; so that he was
 at the head of a sect when a little above twenty.
 
 Being returned, after his leaving Cork, to the Vice-Admiral his father,
 instead of falling upon his knees to ask his blessing, he went up to him
 with his hat on, and said, "Friend, I am very glad to see thee in good
 health."  The Vice-Admiral imagined his son to be crazy, but soon finding
 he was turned Quaker, he employed all the methods that prudence could
 suggest to engage him to behave and act like other people.  The youth
 made no other answer to his father, than by exhorting him to turn Quaker
 also.  At last his father confined himself to this single request, viz.,
 "that he should wait upon the King and the Duke of York with his hat
 under his arm, and should not 'thee' and 'thou' them."  William answered,
 "that he could not do these things, for conscience' sake," which
 exasperated his father to such a degree, that he turned him out of doors.
 Young Pen gave God thanks for permitting him to suffer so early in His
 cause, after which he went into the city, where he held forth, and made a
 great number of converts.
 
 The Church of England clergy found their congregations dwindle away
 daily; and Penn being young, handsome, and of a graceful stature, the
 court as well as the city ladies flocked very devoutly to his meeting.
 The patriarch, George Fox, hearing of his great reputation, came to
 London (though the journey was very long) purely to see and converse with
 him.  Both resolved to go upon missions into foreign countries, and
 accordingly they embarked for Holland, after having left labourers
 sufficient to take care of the London vineyard.
 
 Their labours were crowned with success in Amsterdam, but a circumstance
 which reflected the greatest honour on them, and at the same time put
 their humility to the greatest trial, was the reception they met with
 from Elizabeth, the Princess Palatine, aunt to George I. of Great
 Britain, a lady conspicuous for her genius and knowledge, and to whom
 Descartes had dedicated his Philosophical Romance.
 
 She was then retired to the Hague, where she received these Friends, for
 so the Quakers were at that time called in Holland.  This princess had
 several conferences with them in her palace, and she at last entertained
 so favourable an opinion of Quakerism, that they confessed she was not
 far from the kingdom of heaven.  The Friends sowed likewise the good seed
 in Germany, but reaped very little fruit; for the mode of "theeing" and
 "thouing" was not approved of in a country where a man is perpetually
 obliged to employ the titles of "highness" and "excellency."  William
 Penn returned soon to England upon hearing of his father's sickness, in
 order to see him before he died.  The Vice-Admiral was reconciled to his
 son, and though of a different persuasion, embraced him tenderly.  William
 made a fruitless exhortation to his father not to receive the sacrament,
 but to die a Quaker, and the good old man entreated his son William to
 wear buttons on his sleeves, and a crape hatband in his beaver, but all
 to no purpose.
 
 William Penn inherited very large possessions, part of which consisted in
 Crown debts due to the Vice-Admiral for sums he had advanced for the sea
 service.  No moneys were at that time more insecure than those owing from
 the king.  Penn was obliged to go more than once, and "thee" and "thou"
 King Charles and his Ministers, in order to recover the debt; and at
 last, instead of specie, the Government invested him with the right and
 sovereignty of a province of America, to the south of Maryland.  Thus was
 a Quaker raised to sovereign power.  Penn set sail for his new dominions
 with two ships freighted with Quakers, who followed his fortune.  The
 country was then called Pennsylvania from William Penn, who there founded
 Philadelphia, now the most flourishing city in that country.  The first
 step he took was to enter into an alliance with his American neighbours,
 and this is the only treaty between those people and the Christians that
 was not ratified by an oath, and was never infringed.  The new sovereign
 was at the same time the legislator of Pennsylvania, and enacted very
 wise and prudent laws, none of which have ever been changed since his
 time.  The first is, to injure no person upon a religious account, and to
 consider as brethren all those who believe in one God.
 
 He had no sooner settled his government, but several American merchants
 came and peopled this colony.  The natives of the country, instead of
 flying into the woods, cultivated by insensible degrees a friendship with
 the peaceable Quakers.  They loved these foreigners as much as they
 detested the other Christians who had conquered and laid waste America.
 In a little time a great number of these savages (falsely so called),
 charmed with the mild and gentle disposition of their neighbours, came in
 crowds to William Penn, and besought him to admit them into the number of
 his vassals.  It was very rare and uncommon for a sovereign to be
 "thee'd" and "thou'd" by the meanest of his subjects, who never took
 their hats off when they came into his presence; and as singular for a
 Government to be without one priest in it, and for a people to be without
 arms, either offensive or defensive; for a body of citizens to be
 absolutely undistinguished but by the public employments, and for
 neighbours not to entertain the least jealousy one against the other.
 
 William Penn might glory in having brought down upon earth the so much
 boasted golden age, which in all probability never existed but in
 Pennsylvania.  He returned to England to settle some affairs relating to
 his new dominions.  After the death of King Charles II., King James, who
 had loved the father, indulged the same affection to the son, and no
 longer considered him as an obscure sectary, but as a very great man.  The
 king's politics on this occasion agreed with his inclinations.  He was
 desirous of pleasing the Quakers by annulling the laws made against
 Nonconformists, in order to have an opportunity, by this universal
 toleration, of establishing the Romish religion.  All the sectarists in
 England saw the snare that was laid for them, but did not give into it;
 they never failing to unite when the Romish religion, their common enemy,
 is to be opposed.  But Penn did not think himself bound in any manner to
 renounce his principles, merely to favour Protestants to whom he was
 odious, in opposition to a king who loved him.  He had established a
 universal toleration with regard to conscience in America, and would not
 have it thought that he intended to destroy it in Europe, for which
 reason he adhered so inviolably to King James, that a report prevailed
 universally of his being a Jesuit.  This calumny affected him very
 strongly, and he was obliged to justify himself in print.  However, the
 unfortunate King James II., in whom, as in most princes of the Stuart
 family, grandeur and weakness were equally blended, and who, like them,
 as much overdid some things as he was short in others, lost his kingdom
 in a manner that is hardly to be accounted for.
 
 All the English sectarists accepted from William III, and his Parliament
 the toleration and indulgence which they had refused when offered by King
 James.  It was then the Quakers began to enjoy, by virtue of the laws,
 the several privileges they possess at this time.  Penn having at last
 seen Quakerism firmly established in his native country, went back to
 Pennsylvania.  His own people and the Americans received him with tears
 of joy, as though he had been a father who was returned to visit his
 children.  All the laws had been religiously observed in his absence, a
 circumstance in which no legislator had ever been happy but himself.
 After having resided some years in Pennsylvania he left it, but with
 great reluctance, in order to return to England, there to solicit some
 matters in favour of the commerce of Pennsylvania.  But he never saw it
 again, he dying in Ruscombe, in Berkshire, in 1718.
 
 I am not able to guess what fate Quakerism may have in America, but I
 perceive it dwindles away daily in England.  In all countries where
 liberty of conscience is allowed, the established religion will at last
 swallow up all the rest.  Quakers are disqualified from being members of
 Parliament; nor can they enjoy any post or preferment, because an oath
 must always be taken on these occasions, and they never swear.  They are
 therefore reduced to the necessity of subsisting upon traffic.  Their
 children, whom the industry of their parents has enriched, are desirous
 of enjoying honours, of wearing buttons and ruffles; and quite ashamed of
 being called Quakers they become converts to the Church of England,
 merely to be in the fashion.
 
 
 
 LETTER V.--ON THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
 
 
 England is properly the country of sectarists.  _Multae sunt mansiones in
 domo patris mei_ (in my Father's house are many mansions).  An
 Englishman, as one to whom liberty is natural, may go to heaven his own
 way.
 
 Nevertheless, though every one is permitted to serve God in whatever mode
 or fashion he thinks proper, yet their true religion, that in which a man
 makes his fortune, is the sect of Episcopalians or Churchmen, called the
 Church of England, or simply the Church, by way of eminence.  No person
 can possess an employment either in England or Ireland unless he be
 ranked among the faithful, that is, professes himself a member of the
 Church of England.  This reason (which carries mathematical evidence with
 it) has converted such numbers of Dissenters of all persuasions, that not
 a twentieth part of the nation is out of the pale of the Established
 Church.  The English clergy have retained a great number of the Romish
 ceremonies, and especially that of receiving, with a most scrupulous
 attention, their tithes.  They also have the pious ambition to aim at
 superiority.
 
 Moreover, they inspire very religiously their flock with a holy zeal
 against Dissenters of all denominations.  This zeal was pretty violent
 under the Tories in the four last years of Queen Anne; but was productive
 of no greater mischief than the breaking the windows of some
 meeting-houses and the demolishing of a few of them.  For religious rage
 ceased in England with the civil wars, and was no more under Queen Anne
 than the hollow noise of a sea whose billows still heaved, though so long
 after the storm when the Whigs and Tories laid waste their native
 country, in the same manner as the Guelphs and Ghibelins formerly did
 theirs.  It was absolutely necessary for both parties to call in religion
 on this occasion; the Tories declared for Episcopacy, and the Whigs, as
 some imagined, were for abolishing it; however, after these had got the
 upper hand, they contented themselves with only abridging it.
 
 At the time when the Earl of Oxford and the Lord Bolingbroke used to
 drink healths to the Tories, the Church of England considered those
 noblemen as the defenders of its holy privileges.  The lower House of
 Convocation (a kind of House of Commons) composed wholly of the clergy,
 was in some credit at that time; at least the members of it had the
 liberty to meet, to dispute on ecclesiastical matters, to sentence
 impious books from time to time to the flames, that is, books written
 against themselves.  The Ministry which is now composed of Whigs does not
 so much as allow those gentlemen to assemble, so that they are at this
 time reduced (in the obscurity of their respective parishes) to the
 melancholy occupation of praying for the prosperity of the Government
 whose tranquillity they would willingly disturb.  With regard to the
 bishops, who are twenty-six in all, they still have seats in the House of
 Lords in spite of the Whigs, because the ancient abuse of considering
 them as barons subsists to this day.  There is a clause, however, in the
 oath which the Government requires from these gentlemen, that puts their
 Christian patience to a very great trial, viz., that they shall be of the
 Church of England as by law established.  There are few bishops, deans,
 or other dignitaries, but imagine they are so _jure divino_; it is
 consequently a great mortification to them to be obliged to confess that
 they owe their dignity to a pitiful law enacted by a set of profane
 laymen.  A learned monk (Father Courayer) wrote a book lately to prove
 the validity and succession of English ordinations.  This book was forbid
 in France, but do you believe that the English Ministry were pleased with
 it?  Far from it.  Those wicked Whigs don't care a straw whether the
 episcopal succession among them hath been interrupted or not, or whether
 Bishop Parker was consecrated (as it is pretended) in a tavern or a
 church; for these Whigs are much better pleased that the Bishops should
 derive their authority from the Parliament than from the Apostles.  The
 Lord Bolingbroke observed that this notion of divine right would only
 make so many tyrants in lawn sleeves, but that the laws made so many
 citizens.
 
 With regard to the morals of the English clergy, they are more regular
 than those of France, and for this reason.  All the clergy (a very few
 excepted) are educated in the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, far
 from the depravity and corruption which reign in the capital.  They are
 not called to dignities till very late, at a time of life when men are
 sensible of no other passion but avarice, that is, when their ambition
 craves a supply.  Employments are here bestowed both in the Church and
 the army, as a reward for long services; and we never see youngsters made
 bishops or colonels immediately upon their laying aside the academical
 gown; and besides most of the clergy are married.  The stiff and awkward
 air contracted by them at the University, and the little familiarity the
 men of this country have with the ladies, commonly oblige a bishop to
 confine himself to, and rest contented with, his own.  Clergymen
 sometimes take a glass at the tavern, custom giving them a sanction on
 this occasion; and if they fuddle themselves it is in a very serious
 manner, and without giving the least scandal.
 
 That fable-mixed kind of mortal (not to be defined), who is neither of
 the clergy nor of the laity; in a word, the thing called _Abbe_ in
 France; is a species quite unknown in England.  All the clergy here are
 very much upon the reserve, and most of them pedants.  When these are
 told that in France young fellows famous for their dissoluteness, and
 raised to the highest dignities of the Church by female intrigues,
 address the fair publicly in an amorous way, amuse themselves in writing
 tender love songs, entertain their friends very splendidly every night at
 their own houses, and after the banquet is ended withdraw to invoke the
 assistance of the Holy Ghost, and call themselves boldly the successors
 of the Apostles, they bless God for their being Protestants.  But these
 are shameless heretics, who deserve to be blown hence through the flames
 to old Nick, as Rabelais says, and for this reason I do not trouble
 myself about them.
 
 
 
 LETTER VI.--ON THE PRESBYTERIANS
 
 
 The Church of England is confined almost to the kingdom whence it
 received its name, and to Ireland, for Presbyterianism is the established
 religion in Scotland.  This Presbyterianism is directly the same with
 Calvinism, as it was established in France, and is now professed at
 Geneva.  As the priests of this sect receive but very inconsiderable
 stipends from their churches, and consequently cannot emulate the
 splendid luxury of bishops, they exclaim very naturally against honours
 which they can never attain to.  Figure to yourself the haughty Diogenes
 trampling under foot the pride of Plato.  The Scotch Presbyterians are
 not very unlike that proud though tattered reasoner.  Diogenes did not
 use Alexander half so impertinently as these treated King Charles II.;
 for when they took up arms in his cause in opposition to Oliver, who had
 deceived them, they forced that poor monarch to undergo the hearing of
 three or four sermons every day, would not suffer him to play, reduced
 him to a state of penitence and mortification, so that Charles soon grew
 sick of these pedants, and accordingly eloped from them with as much joy
 as a youth does from school.
 
 A Church of England minister appears as another Cato in presence of a
 juvenile, sprightly French graduate, who bawls for a whole morning
 together in the divinity schools, and hums a song in chorus with ladies
 in the evening; but this Cato is a very spark when before a Scotch
 Presbyterian.  The latter affects a serious gait, puts on a sour look,
 wears a vastly broad-brimmed hat and a long cloak over a very short coat,
 preaches through the nose, and gives the name of the whore of Babylon to
 all churches where the ministers are so fortunate as to enjoy an annual
 revenue of five or six thousand pounds, and where the people are weak
 enough to suffer this, and to give them the titles of my lord, your
 lordship, or your eminence.
 
 These gentlemen, who have also some churches in England, introduced there
 the mode of grave and severe exhortations.  To them is owing the
 sanctification of Sunday in the three kingdoms.  People are there
 forbidden to work or take any recreation on that day, in which the
 severity is twice as great as that of the Romish Church.  No operas,
 plays, or concerts are allowed in London on Sundays, and even cards are
 so expressly forbidden that none but persons of quality, and those we
 call the genteel, play on that day; the rest of the nation go either to
 church, to the tavern, or to see their mistresses.
 
 Though the Episcopal and Presbyterian sects are the two prevailing ones
 in Great Britain, yet all others are very welcome to come and settle in
 it, and live very sociably together, though most of their preachers hate
 one another almost as cordially as a Jansenist damns a Jesuit.
 
 Take a view of the Royal Exchange in London, a place more venerable than
 many courts of justice, where the representatives of all nations meet for
 the benefit of mankind.  There the Jew, the Mahometan, and the Christian
 transact together, as though they all professed the same religion, and
 give the name of infidel to none but bankrupts.  There the Presbyterian
 confides in the Anabaptist, and the Churchman depends on the Quaker's
 word.
 
 If one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would very
 possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut
 one another's throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live
 happy and in peace.
 
 
 
 LETTER VII.--ON THE SOCINIANS, OR ARIANS, OR ANTITRINITARIANS
 
 
 There is a little sect here composed of clergymen, and of a few very
 learned persons among the laity, who, though they do not call themselves
 Arians or Socinians, do yet dissent entirely from St. Athanasius with
 regard to their notions of the Trinity, and declare very frankly that the
 Father is greater than the Son.
 
 Do you remember what is related of a certain orthodox bishop, who, in
 order to convince an emperor of the reality of consubstantiation, put his
 hand under the chin of the monarch's son, and took him by the nose in
 presence of his sacred majesty?  The emperor was going to order his
 attendants to throw the bishop out of the window, when the good old man
 gave him this handsome and convincing reason: "Since your majesty," says
 he, "is angry when your son has not due respect shown him, what
 punishment do you think will God the Father inflict on those who refuse
 His Son Jesus the titles due to Him?"  The persons I just now mentioned
 declare that the holy bishop took a very wrong step, that his argument
 was inconclusive, and that the emperor should have answered him thus:
 "Know that there are two ways by which men may be wanting in respect to
 me--first, in not doing honour sufficient to my son; and, secondly, in
 paying him the same honour as to me."
 
 Be this as it will, the principles of Arius begin to revive, not only in
 England, but in Holland and Poland.  The celebrated Sir Isaac Newton
 honoured this opinion so far as to countenance it.  This philosopher
 thought that the Unitarians argued more mathematically than we do.  But
 the most sanguine stickler for Arianism is the illustrious Dr. Clark.
 This man is rigidly virtuous, and of a mild disposition, is more fond of
 his tenets than desirous of propagating them, and absorbed so entirely in
 problems and calculations that he is a mere reasoning machine.
 
 It is he who wrote a book which is much esteemed and little understood,
 on the existence of God, and another, more intelligible, but pretty much
 contemned, on the truth of the Christian religion.
 
 He never engaged in scholastic disputes, which our friend calls venerable
 trifles.  He only published a work containing all the testimonies of the
 primitive ages for and against the Unitarians, and leaves to the reader
 the counting of the voices and the liberty of forming a judgment.  This
 book won the doctor a great number of partisans, and lost him the See of
 Canterbury; but, in my humble opinion, he was out in his calculation, and
 had better have been Primate of all England than merely an Arian parson.
 
 You see that opinions are subject to revolutions as well as empires.
 Arianism, after having triumphed during three centuries, and been forgot
 twelve, rises at last out of its own ashes; but it has chosen a very
 improper season to make its appearance in, the present age being quite
 cloyed with disputes and sects.  The members of this sect are, besides,
 too few to be indulged the liberty of holding public assemblies, which,
 however, they will, doubtless, be permitted to do in case they spread
 considerably.  But people are now so very cold with respect to all things
 of this kind, that there is little probability any new religion, or old
 one, that may be revived, will meet with favour.  Is it not whimsical
 enough that Luther, Calvin, and Zuinglius, all of them wretched authors,
 should have founded sects which are now spread over a great part of
 Europe, that Mahomet, though so ignorant, should have given a religion to
 Asia and Africa, and that Sir Isaac Newton, Dr. Clark, Mr. Locke, Mr. Le
 Clerc, etc., the greatest philosophers, as well as the ablest writers of
 their ages, should scarcely have been able to raise a little flock, which
 even decreases daily.
 
 This it is to be born at a proper period of time.  Were Cardinal de Retz
 to return again into the world, neither his eloquence nor his intrigues
 would draw together ten women in Paris.
 
 Were Oliver Cromwell, he who beheaded his sovereign, and seized upon the
 kingly dignity, to rise from the dead, he would be a wealthy City trader,
 and no more.
 
 
 
 LETTER VIII.--ON THE PARLIAMENT
 
 
 The members of the English Parliament are fond of comparing themselves to
 the old Romans.
 
 Not long since Mr. Shippen opened a speech in the House of Commons with
 these words, "The majesty of the people of England would be wounded."  The
 singularity of the expression occasioned a loud laugh; but this
 gentleman, so far from being disconcerted, repeated the same words with a
 resolute tone of voice, and the laugh ceased.  In my opinion, the majesty
 of the people of England has nothing in common with that of the people of
 Rome, much less is there any affinity between their Governments.  There
 is in London a senate, some of the members whereof are accused (doubtless
 very unjustly) of selling their voices on certain occasions, as was done
 in Rome; this is the only resemblance.  Besides, the two nations appear
 to me quite opposite in character, with regard both to good and evil.  The
 Romans never knew the dreadful folly of religious wars, an abomination
 reserved for devout preachers of patience and humility.  Marius and
 Sylla, Caesar and Pompey, Anthony and Augustus, did not draw their swords
 and set the world in a blaze merely to determine whether the flamen
 should wear his shirt over his robe, or his robe over his shirt, or
 whether the sacred chickens should eat and drink, or eat only, in order
 to take the augury.  The English have hanged one another by law, and cut
 one another to pieces in pitched battles, for quarrels of as trifling a
 nature.  The sects of the Episcopalians and Presbyterians quite
 distracted these very serious heads for a time.  But I fancy they will
 hardly ever be so silly again, they seeming to be grown wiser at their
 own expense; and I do not perceive the least inclination in them to
 murder one another merely about syllogisms, as some zealots among them
 once did.
 
 But here follows a more essential difference between Rome and England,
 which gives the advantage entirely to the latter--viz., that the civil
 wars of Rome ended in slavery, and those of the English in liberty.  The
 English are the only people upon earth who have been able to prescribe
 limits to the power of kings by resisting them; and who, by a series of
 struggles, have at last established that wise Government where the Prince
 is all-powerful to do good, and, at the same time, is restrained from
 committing evil; where the nobles are great without insolence, though
 there are no vassals; and where the people share in the Government
 without confusion.
 
 The House of Lords and that of the Commons divide the legislative power
 under the king, but the Romans had no such balance.  The patricians and
 plebeians in Rome were perpetually at variance, and there was no
 intermediate power to reconcile them.  The Roman senate, who were so
 unjustly, so criminally proud as not to suffer the plebeians to share
 with them in anything, could find no other artifice to keep the latter
 out of the administration than by employing them in foreign wars.  They
 considered the plebeians as a wild beast, whom it behoved them to let
 loose upon their neighbours, for fear they should devour their masters.
 Thus the greatest defect in the Government of the Romans raised them to
 be conquerors.  By being unhappy at home, they triumphed over and
 possessed themselves of the world, till at last their divisions sunk them
 to slavery.
 
 The Government of England will never rise to so exalted a pitch of glory,
 nor will its end be so fatal.  The English are not fired with the
 splendid folly of making conquests, but would only prevent their
 neighbours from conquering.  They are not only jealous of their own
 liberty, but even of that of other nations.  The English were exasperated
 against Louis XIV. for no other reason but because he was ambitious, and
 declared war against him merely out of levity, not from any interested
 motives.
 
 The English have doubtless purchased their liberties at a very high
 price, and waded through seas of blood to drown the idol of arbitrary
 power.  Other nations have been involved in as great calamities, and have
 shed as much blood; but then the blood they spilt in defence of their
 liberties only enslaved them the more.
 
 That which rises to a revolution in England is no more than a sedition in
 other countries.  A city in Spain, in Barbary, or in Turkey, takes up
 arms in defence of its privileges, when immediately it is stormed by
 mercenary troops, it is punished by executioners, and the rest of the
 nation kiss the chains they are loaded with.  The French are of opinion
 that the government of this island is more tempestuous than the sea which
 surrounds it, which indeed is true; but then it is never so but when the
 king raises the storm--when he attempts to seize the ship of which he is
 only the chief pilot.  The civil wars of France lasted longer, were more
 cruel, and productive of greater evils than those of England; but none of
 these civil wars had a wise and prudent liberty for their object.
 
 In the detestable reigns of Charles IX. and Henry III. the whole affair
 was only whether the people should be slaves to the Guises.  With regard
 to the last war of Paris, it deserves only to be hooted at.  Methinks I
 see a crowd of schoolboys rising up in arms against their master, and
 afterwards whipped for it.  Cardinal de Retz, who was witty and brave
 (but to no purpose), rebellious without a cause, factious without design,
 and head of a defenceless party, caballed for caballing sake, and seemed
 to foment the civil war merely out of diversion.  The Parliament did not
 know what he intended, nor what he did not intend.  He levied troops by
 Act of Parliament, and the next moment cashiered them.  He threatened, he
 begged pardon; he set a price upon Cardinal Mazarin's head, and
 afterwards congratulated him in a public manner.  Our civil wars under
 Charles VI. were bloody and cruel, those of the League execrable, and
 that of the Frondeurs ridiculous.
 
 That for which the French chiefly reproach the English nation is the
 murder of King Charles I., whom his subjects treated exactly as he would
 have treated them had his reign been prosperous.  After all, consider on
 one side Charles I., defeated in a pitched battle, imprisoned, tried,
 sentenced to die in Westminster Hall, and then beheaded.  And on the
 other, the Emperor Henry VII., poisoned by his chaplain at his receiving
 the Sacrament; Henry III. stabbed by a monk; thirty assassinations
 projected against Henry IV., several of them put in execution, and the
 last bereaving that great monarch of his life.  Weigh, I say, all these
 wicked attempts, and then judge.
 
 
 
 LETTER IX.--ON THE GOVERNMENT
 
 
 That mixture in the English Government, that harmony between King, Lords,
 and commons, did not always subsist.  England was enslaved for a long
 series of years by the Romans, the Saxons, the Danes, and the French
 successively.  William the Conqueror particularly, ruled them with a rod
 of iron.  He disposed as absolutely of the lives and fortunes of his
 conquered subjects as an eastern monarch; and forbade, upon pain of
 death, the English either fire or candle in their houses after eight
 o'clock; whether was this to prevent their nocturnal meetings, or only to
 try, by an odd and whimsical prohibition, how far it was possible for one
 man to extend his power over his fellow-creatures.  It is true, indeed,
 that the English had Parliaments before and after William the Conqueror,
 and they boast of them, as though these assemblies then called
 Parliaments, composed of ecclesiastical tyrants and of plunderers
 entitled barons, had been the guardians of the public liberty and
 happiness.
 
 The barbarians who came from the shores of the Baltic, and settled in the
 rest of Europe, brought with them the form of government called States or
 Parliaments, about which so much noise is made, and which are so little
 understood.  Kings, indeed, were not absolute in those days; but then the
 people were more wretched upon that very account, and more completely
 enslaved.  The chiefs of these savages, who had laid waste France, Italy,
 Spain, and England, made themselves monarchs.  Their generals divided
 among themselves the several countries they had conquered, whence sprung
 those margraves, those peers, those barons, those petty tyrants, who
 often contested with their sovereigns for the spoils of whole nations.
 These were birds of prey fighting with an eagle for doves whose blood the
 victorious was to suck.  Every nation, instead of being governed by one
 master, was trampled upon by a hundred tyrants.  The priests soon played
 a part among them.  Before this it had been the fate of the Gauls, the
 Germans, and the Britons, to be always governed by their Druids and the
 chiefs of their villages, an ancient kind of barons, not so tyrannical as
 their successors.  These Druids pretended to be mediators between God and
 man.  They enacted laws, they fulminated their excommunications, and
 sentenced to death.  The bishops succeeded, by insensible degrees, to
 their temporal authority in the Goth and Vandal government.  The popes
 set themselves at their head, and armed with their briefs, their bulls,
 and reinforced by monks, they made even kings tremble, deposed and
 assassinated them at pleasure, and employed every artifice to draw into
 their own purses moneys from all parts of Europe.  The weak Ina, one of
 the tyrants of the Saxon Heptarchy in England, was the first monarch who
 submitted, in his pilgrimage to Rome, to pay St. Peter's penny
 (equivalent very near to a French crown) for every house in his
 dominions.  The whole island soon followed his example; England became
 insensibly one of the Pope's provinces, and the Holy Father used to send
 from time to time his legates thither to levy exorbitant taxes.  At last
 King John delivered up by a public instrument the kingdom of England to
 the Pope, who had excommunicated him; but the barons, not finding their
 account in this resignation, dethroned the wretched King John and seated
 Louis, father to St. Louis, King of France, in his place.  However, they
 were soon weary of their new monarch, and accordingly obliged him to
 return to France.
 
 Whilst that the barons, the bishops, and the popes, all laid waste
 England, where all were for ruling the most numerous, the most useful,
 even the most virtuous, and consequently the most venerable part of
 mankind, consisting of those who study the laws and the sciences, of
 traders, of artificers, in a word, of all who were not tyrants--that is,
 those who are called the people: these, I say, were by them looked upon
 as so many animals beneath the dignity of the human species.  The Commons
 in those ages were far from sharing in the government, they being
 villains or peasants, whose labour, whose blood, were the property of
 their masters who entitled themselves the nobility.  The major part of
 men in Europe were at that time what they are to this day in several
 parts of the world--they were villains or bondsmen of lords--that is, a
 kind of cattle bought and sold with the land.  Many ages passed away
 before justice could be done to human nature--before mankind were
 conscious that it was abominable for many to sow, and but few reap.  And
 was not France very happy, when the power and authority of those petty
 robbers was abolished by the lawful authority of kings and of the people?
 
 Happily, in the violent shocks which the divisions between kings and the
 nobles gave to empires, the chains of nations were more or less heavy.
 Liberty in England sprang from the quarrels of tyrants.  The barons
 forced King John and King Henry III. to grant the famous Magna Charta,
 the chief design of which was indeed to make kings dependent on the
 Lords; but then the rest of the nation were a little favoured in it, in
 order that they might join on proper occasions with their pretended
 masters.  This great Charter, which is considered as the sacred origin of
 the English liberties, shows in itself how little liberty was known.
 
 The title alone proves that the king thought he had a just right to be
 absolute; and that the barons, and even the clergy, forced him to give up
 the pretended right, for no other reason but because they were the most
 powerful.
 
 Magna Charta begins in this style: "We grant, of our own free will, the
 following privileges to the archbishops, bishops, priors, and barons of
 our kingdom," etc.
 
 The House of Commons is not once mentioned in the articles of this
 Charter--a proof that it did not yet exist, or that it existed without
 power.  Mention is therein made, by name, of the freemen of England--a
 melancholy proof that some were not so.  It appears, by Article XXXII.,
 that these pretended freemen owed service to their lords.  Such a liberty
 as this was not many removes from slavery.
 
 By Article XXI., the king ordains that his officers shall not
 henceforward seize upon, unless they pay for them, the horses and carts
 of freemen.  The people considered this ordinance as a real liberty,
 though it was a greater tyranny.  Henry VII., that happy usurper and
 great politician, who pretended to love the barons, though he in reality
 hated and feared them, got their lands alienated.  By this means the
 villains, afterwards acquiring riches by their industry, purchased the
 estates and country seats of the illustrious peers who had ruined
 themselves by their folly and extravagance, and all the lands got by
 insensible degrees into other hands.
 
 The power of the House of Commons increased every day.  The families of
 the ancient peers were at last extinct; and as peers only are properly
 noble in England, there would be no such thing in strictness of law as
 nobility in that island, had not the kings created new barons from time
 to time, and preserved the body of peers, once a terror to them, to
 oppose them to the Commons, since become so formidable.
 
 All these new peers who compose the Higher House receive nothing but
 their titles from the king, and very few of them have estates in those
 places whence they take their titles.  One shall be Duke of D-, though he
 has not a foot of land in Dorsetshire; and another is Earl of a village,
 though he scarce knows where it is situated.  The peers have power, but
 it is only in the Parliament House.
 
 There is no such thing here as _haute_, _moyenne_, and _basse
 justice_--that is, a power to judge in all matters civil and criminal;
 nor a right or privilege of hunting in the grounds of a citizen, who at
 the same time is not permitted to fire a gun in his own field.
 
 No one is exempted in this country from paying certain taxes because he
 is a nobleman or a priest.  All duties and taxes are settled by the House
 of Commons, whose power is greater than that of the Peers, though
 inferior to it in dignity.  The spiritual as well as temporal Lords have
 the liberty to reject a Money Bill brought in by the Commons; but they
 are not allowed to alter anything in it, and must either pass or throw it
 out without restriction.  When the Bill has passed the Lords and is
 signed by the king, then the whole nation pays, every man in proportion
 to his revenue or estate, not according to his title, which would be
 absurd.  There is no such thing as an arbitrary subsidy or poll-tax, but
 a real tax on the lands, of all which an estimate was made in the reign
 of the famous King William III.
 
 The land-tax continues still upon the same foot, though the revenue of
 the lands is increased.  Thus no one is tyrannised over, and every one is
 easy.  The feet of the peasants are not bruised by wooden shoes; they eat
 white bread, are well clothed, and are not afraid of increasing their
 stock of cattle, nor of tiling their houses, from any apprehension that
 their taxes will be raised the year following.  The annual income of the
 estates of a great many commoners in England amounts to two hundred
 thousand livres, and yet these do not think it beneath them to plough the
 lands which enrich them, and on which they enjoy their liberty.
 
 
 
 LETTER X.--ON TRADE
 
 
 As trade enriched the citizens in England, so it contributed to their
 freedom, and this freedom on the other side extended their commerce,
 whence arose the grandeur of the State.  Trade raised by insensible
 degrees the naval power, which gives the English a superiority over the
 seas, and they now are masters of very near two hundred ships of war.
 Posterity will very probably be surprised to hear that an island whose
 only produce is a little lead, tin, fuller's-earth, and coarse wool,
 should become so powerful by its commerce, as to be able to send, in
 1723, three fleets at the same time to three different and far distanced
 parts of the globe.  One before Gibraltar, conquered and still possessed
 by the English; a second to Portobello, to dispossess the King of Spain
 of the treasures of the West Indies; and a third into the Baltic, to
 prevent the Northern Powers from coming to an engagement.
 
 At the time when Louis XIV. made all Italy tremble, and that his armies,
 which had already possessed themselves of Savoy and Piedmont, were upon
 the point of taking Turin; Prince Eugene was obliged to march from the
 middle of Germany in order to succour Savoy.  Having no money, without
 which cities cannot be either taken or defended, he addressed himself to
 some English merchants.  These, at an hour and half's warning, lent him
 five millions, whereby he was enabled to deliver Turin, and to beat the
 French; after which he wrote the following short letter to the persons
 who had disbursed him the above-mentioned sums: "Gentlemen, I have
 received your money, and flatter myself that I have laid it out to your
 satisfaction."  Such a circumstance as this raises a just pride in an
 English merchant, and makes him presume (not without some reason) to
 compare himself to a Roman citizen; and, indeed, a peer's brother does
 not think traffic beneath him.  When the Lord Townshend was Minister of
 State, a brother of his was content to be a City merchant; and at the
 time that the Earl of Oxford governed Great Britain, a younger brother
 was no more than a factor in Aleppo, where he chose to live, and where he
 died.  This custom, which begins, however, to be laid aside, appears
 monstrous to Germans, vainly puffed up with their extraction.  These
 think it morally impossible that the son of an English peer should be no
 more than a rich and powerful citizen, for all are princes in Germany.
 There have been thirty highnesses of the same name, all whose patrimony
 consisted only in their escutcheons and their pride.
 
 In France the title of marquis is given gratis to any one who will accept
 of it; and whosoever arrives at Paris from the midst of the most remote
 provinces with money in his purse, and a name terminating in _ac_ or
 _ille_, may strut about, and cry, "Such a man as I!  A man of my rank and
 figure!" and may look down upon a trader with sovereign contempt; whilst
 the trader on the other side, by thus often hearing his profession
 treated so disdainfully, is fool enough to blush at it.  However, I need
 not say which is most useful to a nation; a lord, powdered in the tip of
 the mode, who knows exactly at what o'clock the king rises and goes to
 bed, and who gives himself airs of grandeur and state, at the same time
 that he is acting the slave in the ante-chamber of a prime minister; or a
 merchant, who enriches his country, despatches orders from his counting-
 house to Surat and Grand Cairo, and contributes to the well-being of the
 world.
 
 
 
 LETTER XI.--ON INOCULATION
 
 
 It is inadvertently affirmed in the Christian countries of Europe that
 the English are fools and madmen.  Fools, because they give their
 children the small-pox to prevent their catching it; and madmen, because
 they wantonly communicate a certain and dreadful distemper to their
 children, merely to prevent an uncertain evil.  The English, on the other
 side, call the rest of the Europeans cowardly and unnatural.  Cowardly,
 because they are afraid of putting their children to a little pain;
 unnatural, because they expose them to die one time or other of the small-
 pox.  But that the reader may be able to judge whether the English or
 those who differ from them in opinion are in the right, here follows the
 history of the famed inoculation, which is mentioned with so much dread
 in France.
 
 The Circassian women have, from time immemorial, communicated the small-
 pox to their children when not above six months old by making an incision
 in the arm, and by putting into this incision a pustule, taken carefully
 from the body of another child.  This pustule produces the same effect in
 the arm it is laid in as yeast in a piece of dough; it ferments, and
 diffuses through the whole mass of blood the qualities with which it is
 impregnated.  The pustules of the child in whom the artificial small-pox
 has been thus inoculated are employed to communicate the same distemper
 to others.  There is an almost perpetual circulation of it in Circassia;
 and when unhappily the small-pox has quite left the country, the
 inhabitants of it are in as great trouble and perplexity as other nations
 when their harvest has fallen short.
 
 The circumstance that introduced a custom in Circassia, which appears so
 singular to others, is nevertheless a cause common to all nations, I mean
 maternal tenderness and interest.
 
 The Circassians are poor, and their daughters are beautiful, and indeed,
 it is in them they chiefly trade.  They furnish with beauties the
 seraglios of the Turkish Sultan, of the Persian Sophy, and of all those
 who are wealthy enough to purchase and maintain such precious
 merchandise.  These maidens are very honourably and virtuously instructed
 to fondle and caress men; are taught dances of a very polite and
 effeminate kind; and how to heighten by the most voluptuous artifices the
 pleasures of their disdainful masters for whom they are designed.  These
 unhappy creatures repeat their lesson to their mothers, in the same
 manner as little girls among us repeat their catechism without
 understanding one word they say.
 
 Now it often happened that, after a father and mother had taken the
 utmost care of the education of their children, they were frustrated of
 all their hopes in an instant.  The small-pox getting into the family,
 one daughter died of it, another lost an eye, a third had a great nose at
 her recovery, and the unhappy parents were completely ruined.  Even,
 frequently, when the small-pox became epidemical, trade was suspended for
 several years, which thinned very considerably the seraglios of Persia
 and Turkey.
 
 A trading nation is always watchful over its own interests, and grasps at
 every discovery that may be of advantage to its commerce.  The
 Circassians observed that scarce one person in a thousand was ever
 attacked by a small-pox of a violent kind.  That some, indeed, had this
 distemper very favourably three or four times, but never twice so as to
 prove fatal; in a word, that no one ever had it in a violent degree twice
 in his life.  They observed farther, that when the small-pox is of the
 milder sort, and the pustules have only a tender, delicate skin to break
 through, they never leave the least scar in the face.  From these natural
 observations they concluded, that in case an infant of six months or a
 year old should have a milder sort of small-pox, he would not die of it,
 would not be marked, nor be ever afflicted with it again.
 
 In order, therefore, to preserve the life and beauty of their children,
 the only thing remaining was to give them the small-pox in their infant
 years.  This they did by inoculating in the body of a child a pustule
 taken from the most regular and at the same time the most favourable sort
 of small-pox that could be procured.
 
 The experiment could not possibly fail.  The Turks, who are people of
 good sense, soon adopted this custom, insomuch that at this time there is
 not a bassa in Constantinople but communicates the small-pox to his
 children of both sexes immediately upon their being weaned.
 
 Some pretend that the Circassians borrowed this custom anciently from the
 Arabians; but we shall leave the clearing up of this point of history to
 some learned Benedictine, who will not fail to compile a great many
 folios on this subject, with the several proofs or authorities.  All I
 have to say upon it is that, in the beginning of the reign of King George
 I., the Lady Wortley Montague, a woman of as fine a genius, and endued
 with as great a strength of mind, as any of her sex in the British
 Kingdoms, being with her husband, who was ambassador at the Porte, made
 no scruple to communicate the small-pox to an infant of which she was
 delivered in Constantinople.  The chaplain represented to his lady, but
 to no purpose, that this was an unchristian operation, and therefore that
 it could succeed with none but infidels.  However, it had the most happy
 effect upon the son of the Lady Wortley Montague, who, at her return to
 England, communicated the experiment to the Princess of Wales, now Queen
 of England.  It must be confessed that this princess, abstracted from her
 crown and titles, was born to encourage the whole circle of arts, and to
 do good to mankind.  She appears as an amiable philosopher on the throne,
 having never let slip one opportunity of improving the great talents she
 received from Nature, nor of exerting her beneficence.  It is she who,
 being informed that a daughter of Milton was living, but in miserable
 circumstances, immediately sent her a considerable present.  It is she
 who protects the learned Father Courayer.  It is she who condescended to
 attempt a reconciliation between Dr. Clark and Mr. Leibnitz.  The moment
 this princess heard of inoculation, she caused an experiment of it to be
 made on four criminals sentenced to die, and by that means preserved
 their lives doubly; for she not only saved them from the gallows, but by
 means of this artificial small-pox prevented their ever having that
 distemper in a natural way, with which they would very probably have been
 attacked one time or other, and might have died of in a more advanced
 age.
 
 The princess being assured of the usefulness of this operation, caused
 her own children to be inoculated.  A great part of the kingdom followed
 her example, and since that time ten thousand children, at least, of
 persons of condition owe in this manner their lives to her Majesty and to
 the Lady Wortley Montague; and as many of the fair sex are obliged to
 them for their beauty.
 
 Upon a general calculation, threescore persons in every hundred have the
 small-pox.  Of these threescore, twenty die of it in the most favourable
 season of life, and as many more wear the disagreeable remains of it in
 their faces so long as they live.  Thus, a fifth part of mankind either
 die or are disfigured by this distemper.  But it does not prove fatal to
 so much as one among those who are inoculated in Turkey or in England,
 unless the patient be infirm, or would have died had not the experiment
 been made upon him.  Besides, no one is disfigured, no one has the small-
 pox a second time, if the inoculation was perfect.  It is therefore
 certain, that had the lady of some French ambassador brought this secret
 from Constantinople to Paris, the nation would have been for ever obliged
 to her.  Then the Duke de Villequier, father to the Duke d'Aumont, who
 enjoys the most vigorous constitution, and is the healthiest man in
 France, would not have been cut off in the flower of his age.
 
 The Prince of Soubise, happy in the finest flush of health, would not
 have been snatched away at five-and-twenty, nor the Dauphin, grandfather
 to Louis XV., have been laid in his grave in his fiftieth year.  Twenty
 thousand persons whom the small-pox swept away at Paris in 1723 would
 have been alive at this time.  But are not the French fond of life, and
 is beauty so inconsiderable an advantage as to be disregarded by the
 ladies?  It must be confessed that we are an odd kind of people.  Perhaps
 our nation will imitate ten years hence this practice of the English, if
 the clergy and the physicians will but give them leave to do it; or
 possibly our countrymen may introduce inoculation three months hence in
 France out of mere whim, in case the English should discontinue it
 through fickleness.
 
 I am informed that the Chinese have practised inoculation these hundred
 years, a circumstance that argues very much in its favour, since they are
 thought to be the wisest and best governed people in the world.  The
 Chinese, indeed, do not communicate this distemper by inoculation, but at
 the nose, in the same manner as we take snuff.  This is a more agreeable
 way, but then it produces the like effects; and proves at the same time
 that had inoculation been practised in France it would have saved the
 lives of thousands.
 
 
 
 LETTER XII.--ON THE LORD BACON
 
 
 Not long since the trite and frivolous question following was debated in
 a very polite and learned company, viz., Who was the greatest man, Caesar,
 Alexander, Tamerlane, Cromwell, &c.?
 
 Somebody answered that Sir Isaac Newton excelled them all.  The
 gentleman's assertion was very just; for if true greatness consists in
 having received from heaven a mighty genius, and in having employed it to
 enlighten our own mind and that of others, a man like Sir Isaac Newton,
 whose equal is hardly found in a thousand years, is the truly great man.
 And those politicians and conquerors (and all ages produce some) were
 generally so many illustrious wicked men.  That man claims our respect
 who commands over the minds of the rest of the world by the force of
 truth, not those who enslave their fellow-creatures: he who is acquainted
 with the universe, not they who deface it.
 
 Since, therefore, you desire me to give you an account of the famous
 personages whom England has given birth to, I shall begin with Lord
 Bacon, Mr. Locke, Sir Isaac Newton, &c.  Afterwards the warriors and
 Ministers of State shall come in their order.
 
 I must begin with the celebrated Viscount Verulam, known in Europe by the
 name of Bacon, which was that of his family.  His father had been Lord
 Keeper, and himself was a great many years Lord Chancellor under King
 James I.  Nevertheless, amidst the intrigues of a Court, and the affairs
 of his exalted employment, which alone were enough to engross his whole
 time, he yet found so much leisure for study as to make himself a great
 philosopher, a good historian, and an elegant writer; and a still more
 surprising circumstance is that he lived in an age in which the art of
 writing justly and elegantly was little known, much less true philosophy.
 Lord Bacon, as is the fate of man, was more esteemed after his death than
 in his lifetime.  His enemies were in the British Court, and his admirers
 were foreigners.
 
 When the Marquis d'Effiat attended in England upon the Princess Henrietta
 Maria, daughter to Henry IV., whom King Charles I. had married, that
 Minister went and visited the Lord Bacon, who, being at that time sick in
 his bed, received him with the curtains shut close.  "You resemble the
 angels," says the Marquis to him; "we hear those beings spoken of
 perpetually, and we believe them superior to men, but are never allowed
 the consolation to see them."
 
 You know that this great man was accused of a crime very unbecoming a
 philosopher: I mean bribery and extortion.  You know that he was
 sentenced by the House of Lords to pay a fine of about four hundred
 thousand French livres, to lose his peerage and his dignity of
 Chancellor; but in the present age the English revere his memory to such
 a degree, that they will scarce allow him to have been guilty.  In case
 you should ask what are my thoughts on this head, I shall answer you in
 the words which I heard the Lord Bolingbroke use on another occasion.
 Several gentlemen were speaking, in his company, of the avarice with
 which the late Duke of Marlborough had been charged, some examples
 whereof being given, the Lord Bolingbroke was appealed to (who, having
 been in the opposite party, might perhaps, without the imputation of
 indecency, have been allowed to clear up that matter): "He was so great a
 man," replied his lordship, "that I have forgot his vices."
 
 I shall therefore confine myself to those things which so justly gained
 Lord Bacon the esteem of all Europe.
 
 The most singular and the best of all his pieces is that which, at this
 time, is the most useless and the least read, I mean his _Novum
 Scientiarum Organum_.  This is the scaffold with which the new philosophy
 was raised; and when the edifice was built, part of it at least, the
 scaffold was no longer of service.
 
 The Lord Bacon was not yet acquainted with Nature, but then he knew, and
 pointed out, the several paths that lead to it.  He had despised in his
 younger years the thing called philosophy in the Universities, and did
 all that lay in his power to prevent those societies of men instituted to
 improve human reason from depraving it by their quiddities, their horrors
 of the vacuum, their substantial forms, and all those impertinent terms
 which not only ignorance had rendered venerable, but which had been made
 sacred by their being ridiculously blended with religion.
 
 He is the father of experimental philosophy.  It must, indeed, be
 confessed that very surprising secrets had been found out before his
 time--the sea-compass, printing, engraving on copper plates,
 oil-painting, looking-glasses; the art of restoring, in some measure, old
 men to their sight by spectacles; gunpowder, &c., had been discovered.  A
 new world had been fought for, found, and conquered.  Would not one
 suppose that these sublime discoveries had been made by the greatest
 philosophers, and in ages much more enlightened than the present?  But it
 was far otherwise; all these great changes happened in the most stupid
 and barbarous times.  Chance only gave birth to most of those inventions;
 and it is very probable that what is called chance contributed very much
 to the discovery of America; at least, it has been always thought that
 Christopher Columbus undertook his voyage merely on the relation of a
 captain of a ship which a storm had driven as far westward as the
 Caribbean Islands.  Be this as it will, men had sailed round the world,
 and could destroy cities by an artificial thunder more dreadful than the
 real one; but, then, they were not acquainted with the circulation of the
 blood, the weight of the air, the laws of motion, light, the number of
 our planets, &c.  And a man who maintained a thesis on Aristotle's
 "Categories," on the universals _a parte rei_, or such-like nonsense, was
 looked upon as a prodigy.
 
 The most astonishing, the most useful inventions, are not those which
 reflect the greatest honour on the human mind.  It is to a mechanical
 instinct, which is found in many men, and not to true philosophy, that
 most arts owe their origin.
 
 The discovery of fire, the art of making bread, of melting and preparing
 metals, of building houses, and the invention of the shuttle, are
 infinitely more beneficial to mankind than printing or the sea-compass:
 and yet these arts were invented by uncultivated, savage men.
 
 What a prodigious use the Greeks and Romans made afterwards of mechanics!
 Nevertheless, they believed that there were crystal heavens, that the
 stars were small lamps which sometimes fell into the sea, and one of
 their greatest philosophers, after long researches, found that the stars
 were so many flints which had been detached from the earth.
 
 In a word, no one before the Lord Bacon was acquainted with experimental
 philosophy, nor with the several physical experiments which have been
 made since his time.  Scarce one of them but is hinted at in his work,
 and he himself had made several.  He made a kind of pneumatic engine, by
 which he guessed the elasticity of the air.  He approached, on all sides
 as it were, to the discovery of its weight, and had very near attained
 it, but some time after Torricelli seized upon this truth.  In a little
 time experimental philosophy began to be cultivated on a sudden in most
 parts of Europe.  It was a hidden treasure which the Lord Bacon had some
 notion of, and which all the philosophers, encouraged by his promises,
 endeavoured to dig up.
 
 But that which surprised me most was to read in his work, in express
 terms, the new attraction, the invention of which is ascribed to Sir
 Isaac Newton.
 
 We must search, says Lord Bacon, whether there may not be a kind of
 magnetic power which operates between the earth and heavy bodies, between
 the moon and the ocean, between the planets, &c.  In another place he
 says either heavy bodies must be carried towards the centre of the earth,
 or must be reciprocally attracted by it; and in the latter case it is
 evident that the nearer bodies, in their falling, draw towards the earth,
 the stronger they will attract one another.  We must, says he, make an
 experiment to see whether the same clock will go faster on the top of a
 mountain or at the bottom of a mine; whether the strength of the weights
 decreases on the mountain and increases in the mine.  It is probable that
 the earth has a true attractive power.
 
 This forerunner in philosophy was also an elegant writer, an historian,
 and a wit.
 
 His moral essays are greatly esteemed, but they were drawn up in the view
 of instructing rather than of pleasing; and, as they are not a satire
 upon mankind, like Rochefoucauld's "Maxims," nor written upon a sceptical
 plan, like Montaigne's "Essays," they are not so much read as those two
 ingenious authors.
 
 His History of Henry VII. was looked upon as a masterpiece, but how is it
 possible that some persons can presume to compare so little a work with
 the history of our illustrious Thuanus?
 
 Speaking about the famous impostor Perkin, son to a converted Jew, who
 assumed boldly the name and title of Richard IV., King of England, at the
 instigation of the Duchess of Burgundy, and who disputed the crown with
 Henry VII., the Lord Bacon writes as follows:--
 
 "At this time the King began again to be haunted with sprites, by the
 magic and curious arts of the Lady Margaret, who raised up the ghost of
 Richard, Duke of York, second son to King Edward IV., to walk and vex the
 King.
 
 "After such time as she (Margaret of Burgundy) thought he (Perkin
 Warbeck) was perfect in his lesson, she began to cast with herself from
 what coast this blazing star should first appear, and at what time it
 must be upon the horizon of Ireland; for there had the like meteor strong
 influence before."
 
 Methinks our sagacious Thuanus does not give in to such fustian, which
 formerly was looked upon as sublime, but in this age is justly called
 nonsense.
 
 
 
 LETTER XIII.--ON MR. LOCKE
 
 
 Perhaps no man ever had a more judicious or more methodical genius, or
 was a more acute logician than Mr. Locke, and yet he was not deeply
 skilled in the mathematics.  This great man could never subject himself
 to the tedious fatigue of calculations, nor to the dry pursuit of
 mathematical truths, which do not at first present any sensible objects
 to the mind; and no one has given better proofs than he, that it is
 possible for a man to have a geometrical head without the assistance of
 geometry.  Before his time, several great philosophers had declared, in
 the most positive terms, what the soul of man is; but as these absolutely
 knew nothing about it, they might very well be allowed to differ entirely
 in opinion from one another.
 
 In Greece, the infant seat of arts and of errors, and where the grandeur
 as well as folly of the human mind went such prodigious lengths, the
 people used to reason about the soul in the very same manner as we do.
 
 The divine Anaxagoras, in whose honour an altar was erected for his
 having taught mankind that the sun was greater than Peloponnesus, that
 snow was black, and that the heavens were of stone, affirmed that the
 soul was an aerial spirit, but at the same time immortal.  Diogenes (not
 he who was a cynical philosopher after having coined base money) declared
 that the soul was a portion of the substance of God: an idea which we
 must confess was very sublime.  Epicurus maintained that it was composed
 of parts in the same manner as the body.
 
 Aristotle, who has been explained a thousand ways, because he is
 unintelligible, was of opinion, according to some of his disciples, that
 the understanding in all men is one and the same substance.
 
 The divine Plato, master of the divine Aristotle,--and the divine
 Socrates, master of the divine Plato--used to say that the soul was
 corporeal and eternal.  No doubt but the demon of Socrates had instructed
 him in the nature of it.  Some people, indeed, pretend that a man who
 boasted his being attended by a familiar genius must infallibly be either
 a knave or a madman, but this kind of people are seldom satisfied with
 anything but reason.
 
 With regard to the Fathers of the Church, several in the primitive ages
 believed that the soul was human, and the angels and God corporeal.  Men
 naturally improve upon every system.  St. Bernard, as Father Mabillon
 confesses, taught that the soul after death does not see God in the
 celestial regions, but converses with Christ's human nature only.
 However, he was not believed this time on his bare word; the adventure of
 the crusade having a little sunk the credit of his oracles.  Afterwards a
 thousand schoolmen arose, such as the Irrefragable Doctor, the Subtile
 Doctor, the Angelic Doctor, the Seraphic Doctor, and the Cherubic Doctor,
 who were all sure that they had a very clear and distinct idea of the
 soul, and yet wrote in such a manner, that one would conclude they were
 resolved no one should understand a word in their writings.  Our
 Descartes, born to discover the errors of antiquity, and at the same time
 to substitute his own, and hurried away by that systematic spirit which
 throws a cloud over the minds of the greatest men, thought he had
 demonstrated that the soul is the same thing as thought, in the same
 manner as matter, in his opinion, is the same as extension.  He asserted,
 that man thinks eternally, and that the soul, at its coming into the
 body, is informed with the whole series of metaphysical notions: knowing
 God, infinite space, possessing all abstract ideas--in a word, completely
 endued with the most sublime lights, which it unhappily forgets at its
 issuing from the womb.
 
 Father Malebranche, in his sublime illusions, not only admitted innate
 ideas, but did not doubt of our living wholly in God, and that God is, as
 it were, our soul.
 
 Such a multitude of reasoners having written the romance of the soul, a
 sage at last arose, who gave, with an air of the greatest modesty, the
 history of it.  Mr. Locke has displayed the human soul in the same manner
 as an excellent anatomist explains the springs of the human body.  He
 everywhere takes the light of physics for his guide.  He sometimes
 presumes to speak affirmatively, but then he presumes also to doubt.
 Instead of concluding at once what we know not, he examines gradually
 what we would know.  He takes an infant at the instant of his birth; he
 traces, step by step, the progress of his understanding; examines what
 things he has in common with beasts, and what he possesses above them.
 Above all, he consults himself: the being conscious that he himself
 thinks.
 
 "I shall leave," says he, "to those who know more of this matter than
 myself, the examining whether the soul exists before or after the
 organisation of our bodies.  But I confess that it is my lot to be
 animated with one of those heavy souls which do not think always; and I
 am even so unhappy as not to conceive that it is more necessary the soul
 should think perpetually than that bodies should be for ever in motion."
 
 With regard to myself, I shall boast that I have the honour to be as
 stupid in this particular as Mr. Locke.  No one shall ever make me
 believe that I think always: and I am as little inclined as he could be
 to fancy that some weeks after I was conceived I was a very learned soul;
 knowing at that time a thousand things which I forgot at my birth; and
 possessing when in the womb (though to no manner of purpose) knowledge
 which I lost the instant I had occasion for it; and which I have never
 since been able to recover perfectly.
 
 Mr. Locke, after having destroyed innate ideas; after having fully
 renounced the vanity of believing that we think always; after having laid
 down, from the most solid principles, that ideas enter the mind through
 the senses; having examined our simple and complex ideas; having traced
 the human mind through its several operations; having shown that all the
 languages in the world are imperfect, and the great abuse that is made of
 words every moment, he at last comes to consider the extent or rather the
 narrow limits of human knowledge.  It was in this chapter he presumed to
 advance, but very modestly, the following words: "We shall, perhaps,
 never be capable of knowing whether a being, purely material, thinks or
 not."  This sage assertion was, by more divines than one, looked upon as
 a scandalous declaration that the soul is material and mortal.  Some
 Englishmen, devout after their way, sounded an alarm.  The superstitious
 are the same in society as cowards in an army; they themselves are seized
 with a panic fear, and communicate it to others.  It was loudly exclaimed
 that Mr. Locke intended to destroy religion; nevertheless, religion had
 nothing to do in the affair, it being a question purely philosophical,
 altogether independent of faith and revelation.  Mr. Locke's opponents
 needed but to examine, calmly and impartially, whether the declaring that
 matter can think, implies a contradiction; and whether God is able to
 communicate thought to matter.  But divines are too apt to begin their
 declarations with saying that God is offended when people differ from
 them in opinion; in which they too much resemble the bad poets, who used
 to declare publicly that Boileau spake irreverently of Louis XIV.,
 because he ridiculed their stupid productions.  Bishop Stillingfleet got
 the reputation of a calm and unprejudiced divine because he did not
 expressly make use of injurious terms in his dispute with Mr. Locke.  That
 divine entered the lists against him, but was defeated; for he argued as
 a schoolman, and Locke as a philosopher, who was perfectly acquainted
 with the strong as well as the weak side of the human mind, and who
 fought with weapons whose temper he knew.  If I might presume to give my
 opinion on so delicate a subject after Mr. Locke, I would say, that men
 have long disputed on the nature and the immortality of the soul.  With
 regard to its immortality, it is impossible to give a demonstration of
 it, since its nature is still the subject of controversy; which, however,
 must be thoroughly understood before a person can be able to determine
 whether it be immortal or not.  Human reason is so little able, merely by
 its own strength, to demonstrate the immortality of the soul, that it was
 absolutely necessary religion should reveal it to us.  It is of advantage
 to society in general, that mankind should believe the soul to be
 immortal; faith commands us to do this; nothing more is required, and the
 matter is cleared up at once.  But it is otherwise with respect to its
 nature; it is of little importance to religion, which only requires the
 soul to be virtuous, whatever substance it may be made of.  It is a clock
 which is given us to regulate, but the artist has not told us of what
 materials the spring of this chock is composed.
 
 I am a body, and, I think, that's all I know of the matter.  Shall I
 ascribe to an unknown cause, what I can so easily impute to the only
 second cause I am acquainted with?  Here all the school philosophers
 interrupt me with their arguments, and declare that there is only
 extension and solidity in bodies, and that there they can have nothing
 but motion and figure.  Now motion, figure, extension and solidity cannot
 form a thought, and consequently the soul cannot be matter.  All this so
 often repeated mighty series of reasoning, amounts to no more than this:
 I am absolutely ignorant what matter is; I guess, but imperfectly, some
 properties of it; now I absolutely cannot tell whether these properties
 may be joined to thought.  As I therefore know nothing, I maintain
 positively that matter cannot think.  In this manner do the schools
 reason.
 
 Mr. Locke addressed these gentlemen in the candid, sincere manner
 following: At least confess yourselves to be as ignorant as I.  Neither
 your imaginations nor mine are able to comprehend in what manner a body
 is susceptible of ideas; and do you conceive better in what manner a
 substance, of what kind soever, is susceptible of them?  As you cannot
 comprehend either matter or spirit, why will you presume to assert
 anything?
 
 The superstitious man comes afterwards and declares, that all those must
 be burnt for the good of their souls, who so much as suspect that it is
 possible for the body to think without any foreign assistance.  But what
 would these people say should they themselves be proved irreligious?  And
 indeed, what man can presume to assert, without being guilty at the same
 time of the greatest impiety, that it is impossible for the Creator to
 form matter with thought and sensation?  Consider only, I beg you, what a
 dilemma you bring yourselves into, you who confine in this manner the
 power of the Creator.  Beasts have the same organs, the same sensations,
 the same perceptions as we; they have memory, and combine certain ideas.
 In case it was not in the power of God to animate matter, and inform it
 with sensation, the consequence would be, either that beasts are mere
 machines, or that they have a spiritual soul.
 
 Methinks it is clearly evident that beasts cannot be mere machines, which
 I prove thus.  God has given to them the very same organs of sensation as
 to us: if therefore they have no sensation, God has created a useless
 thing; now according to your own confession God does nothing in vain; He
 therefore did not create so many organs of sensation, merely for them to
 be uninformed with this faculty; consequently beasts are not mere
 machines.  Beasts, according to your assertion, cannot be animated with a
 spiritual soul; you will, therefore, in spite of yourself, be reduced to
 this only assertion, viz., that God has endued the organs of beasts, who
 are mere matter, with the faculties of sensation and perception, which
 you call instinct in them.  But why may not God, if He pleases,
 communicate to our more delicate organs, that faculty of feeling,
 perceiving, and thinking, which we call human reason?  To whatever side
 you turn, you are forced to acknowledge your own ignorance, and the
 boundless power of the Creator.  Exclaim therefore no more against the
 sage, the modest philosophy of Mr. Locke, which so far from interfering
 with religion, would be of use to demonstrate the truth of it, in case
 religion wanted any such support.  For what philosophy can be of a more
 religious nature than that, which affirming nothing but what it conceives
 clearly, and conscious of its own weakness, declares that we must always
 have recourse to God in our examining of the first principles?
 
 Besides, we must not be apprehensive that any philosophical opinion will
 ever prejudice the religion of a country.  Though our demonstrations
 clash directly with our mysteries, that is nothing to the purpose, for
 the latter are not less revered upon that account by our Christian
 philosophers, who know very well that the objects of reason and those of
 faith are of a very different nature.  Philosophers will never form a
 religious sect, the reason of which is, their writings are not calculated
 for the vulgar, and they themselves are free from enthusiasm.  If we
 divide mankind into twenty parts, it will be found that nineteen of these
 consist of persons employed in manual labour, who will never know that
 such a man as Mr. Locke existed.  In the remaining twentieth part how few
 are readers?  And among such as are so, twenty amuse themselves with
 romances to one who studies philosophy.  The thinking part of mankind is
 confined to a very small number, and these will never disturb the peace
 and tranquillity of the world.
 
 Neither Montaigne, Locke, Bayle, Spinoza, Hobbes, the Lord Shaftesbury,
 Collins, nor Toland lighted up the firebrand of discord in their
 countries; this has generally been the work of divines, who being at
 first puffed up with the ambition of becoming chiefs of a sect, soon grew
 very desirous of being at the head of a party.  But what do I say?  All
 the works of the modern philosophers put together will never make so much
 noise as even the dispute which arose among the Franciscans, merely about
 the fashion of their sleeves and of their cowls.
 
 
 
 LETTER XIV.--ON DESCARTES AND SIR ISAAC NEWTON
 
 
 A Frenchman who arrives in London, will find philosophy, like everything
 else, very much changed there.  He had left the world a plenum, and he
 now finds it a vacuum.  At Paris the universe is seen composed of
 vortices of subtile matter; but nothing like it is seen in London.  In
 France, it is the pressure of the moon that causes the tides; but in
 England it is the sea that gravitates towards the moon; so that when you
 think that the moon should make it flood with us, those gentlemen fancy
 it should be ebb, which very unluckily cannot be proved.  For to be able
 to do this, it is necessary the moon and the tides should have been
 inquired into at the very instant of the creation.
 
 You will observe farther, that the sun, which in France is said to have
 nothing to do in the affair, comes in here for very near a quarter of its
 assistance.  According to your Cartesians, everything is performed by an
 impulsion, of which we have very little notion; and according to Sir
 Isaac Newton, it is by an attraction, the cause of which is as much
 unknown to us.  At Paris you imagine that the earth is shaped like a
 melon, or of an oblique figure; at London it has an oblate one.  A
 Cartesian declares that light exists in the air; but a Newtonian asserts
 that it comes from the sun in six minutes and a half.  The several
 operations of your chemistry are performed by acids, alkalies and subtile
 matter; but attraction prevails even in chemistry among the English.
 
 The very essence of things is totally changed.  You neither are agreed
 upon the definition of the soul, nor on that of matter.  Descartes, as I
 observed in my last, maintains that the soul is the same thing with
 thought, and Mr. Locke has given a pretty good proof of the contrary.
 
 Descartes asserts farther, that extension alone constitutes matter, but
 Sir Isaac adds solidity to it.
 
 How furiously contradictory are these opinions!
 
    "Non nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites."
 
    VIRGIL, Eclog. III.
 
    "'Tis not for us to end such great disputes."
 
 This famous Newton, this destroyer of the Cartesian system, died in
 March, anno 1727.  His countrymen honoured him in his lifetime, and
 interred him as though he had been a king who had made his people happy.
 
 The English read with the highest satisfaction, and translated into their
 tongue, the Elogium of Sir Isaac Newton, which M. de Fontenelle spoke in
 the Academy of Sciences.  M. de Fontenelle presides as judge over
 philosophers; and the English expected his decision, as a solemn
 declaration of the superiority of the English philosophy over that of the
 French.  But when it was found that this gentleman had compared Descartes
 to Sir Isaac, the whole Royal Society in London rose up in arms.  So far
 from acquiescing with M. Fontenelle's judgment, they criticised his
 discourse.  And even several (who, however, were not the ablest
 philosophers in that body) were offended at the comparison; and for no
 other reason but because Descartes was a Frenchman.
 
 It must be confessed that these two great men differed very much in
 conduct, in fortune, and in philosophy.
 
 Nature had indulged Descartes with a shining and strong imagination,
 whence he became a very singular person both in private life and in his
 manner of reasoning.  This imagination could not conceal itself even in
 his philosophical works, which are everywhere adorned with very shining,
 ingenious metaphors and figures.  Nature had almost made him a poet; and
 indeed he wrote a piece of poetry for the entertainment of Christina,
 Queen of Sweden, which however was suppressed in honour to his memory.
 
 He embraced a military life for some time, and afterwards becoming a
 complete philosopher, he did not think the passion of love derogatory to
 his character.  He had by his mistress a daughter called Froncine, who
 died young, and was very much regretted by him.  Thus he experienced
 every passion incident to mankind.
 
 He was a long time of opinion that it would be necessary for him to fly
 from the society of his fellow creatures, and especially from his native
 country, in order to enjoy the happiness of cultivating his philosophical
 studies in full liberty.
 
 Descartes was very right, for his contemporaries were not knowing enough
 to improve and enlighten his understanding, and were capable of little
 else than of giving him uneasiness.
 
 He left France purely to go in search of truth, which was then persecuted
 by the wretched philosophy of the schools.  However, he found that reason
 was as much disguised and depraved in the universities of Holland, into
 which he withdrew, as in his own country.  For at the time that the
 French condemned the only propositions of his philosophy which were true,
 he was persecuted by the pretended philosophers of Holland, who
 understood him no better; and who, having a nearer view of his glory,
 hated his person the more, so that he was obliged to leave Utrecht.
 Descartes was injuriously accused of being an atheist, the last refuge of
 religious scandal: and he who had employed all the sagacity and
 penetration of his genius, in searching for new proofs of the existence
 of a God, was suspected to believe there was no such Being.
 
 Such a persecution from all sides, must necessarily suppose a most
 exalted merit as well as a very distinguished reputation, and indeed he
 possessed both.  Reason at that time darted a ray upon the world through
 the gloom of the schools, and the prejudices of popular superstition.  At
 last his name spread so universally, that the French were desirous of
 bringing him back into his native country by rewards, and accordingly
 offered him an annual pension of a thousand crowns.  Upon these hopes
 Descartes returned to France; paid the fees of his patent, which was sold
 at that time, but no pension was settled upon him.  Thus disappointed, he
 returned to his solitude in North Holland, where he again pursued the
 study of philosophy, whilst the great Galileo, at fourscore years of age,
 was groaning in the prisons of the Inquisition, only for having
 demonstrated the earth's motion.
 
 At last Descartes was snatched from the world in the flower of his age at
 Stockholm.  His death was owing to a bad regimen, and he expired in the
 midst of some literati who were his enemies, and under the hands of a
 physician to whom he was odious.
 
 The progress of Sir Isaac Newton's life was quite different.  He lived
 happy, and very much honoured in his native country, to the age of
 fourscore and five years.
 
 It was his peculiar felicity, not only to be born in a country of
 liberty, but in an age when all scholastic impertinences were banished
 from the world.  Reason alone was cultivated, and mankind could only be
 his pupil, not his enemy.
 
 One very singular difference in the lives of these two great men is, that
 Sir Isaac, during the long course of years he enjoyed, was never sensible
 to any passion, was not subject to the common frailties of mankind, nor
 ever had any commerce with women--a circumstance which was assured me by
 the physician and surgeon who attended him in his last moments.
 
 We may admire Sir Isaac Newton on this occasion, but then we must not
 censure Descartes.
 
 The opinion that generally prevails in England with regard to these new
 philosophers is, that the latter was a dreamer, and the former a sage.
 
 Very few people in England read Descartes, whose works indeed are now
 useless.  On the other side, but a small number peruse those of Sir
 Isaac, because to do this the student must be deeply skilled in the
 mathematics, otherwise those works will be unintelligible to him.  But
 notwithstanding this, these great men are the subject of everyone's
 discourse.  Sir Isaac Newton is allowed every advantage, whilst Descartes
 is not indulged a single one.  According to some, it is to the former
 that we owe the discovery of a vacuum, that the air is a heavy body, and
 the invention of telescopes.  In a word, Sir Isaac Newton is here as the
 Hercules of fabulous story, to whom the ignorant ascribed all the feats
 of ancient heroes.
 
 In a critique that was made in London on Mr. de Fontenelle's discourse,
 the writer presumed to assert that Descartes was not a great
 geometrician.  Those who make such a declaration may justly be reproached
 with flying in their master's face.  Descartes extended the limits of
 geometry as far beyond the place where he found them, as Sir Isaac did
 after him.  The former first taught the method of expressing curves by
 equations.  This geometry which, thanks to him for it, is now grown
 common, was so abstruse in his time, that not so much as one professor
 would undertake to explain it; and Schotten in Holland, and Format in
 France, were the only men who understood it.
 
 He applied this geometrical and inventive genius to dioptrics, which,
 when treated of by him, became a new art.  And if he was mistaken in some
 things, the reason of that is, a man who discovers a new tract of land
 cannot at once know all the properties of the soil.  Those who come after
 him, and make these lands fruitful, are at least obliged to him for the
 discovery.  I will not deny but that there are innumerable errors in the
 rest of Descartes' works.
 
 Geometry was a guide he himself had in some measure fashioned, which
 would have conducted him safely through the several paths of natural
 philosophy.  Nevertheless, he at last abandoned this guide, and gave
 entirely into the humour of forming hypotheses; and then philosophy was
 no more than an ingenious romance, fit only to amuse the ignorant.  He
 was mistaken in the nature of the soul, in the proofs of the existence of
 a God, in matter, in the laws of motion, and in the nature of light.  He
 admitted innate ideas, he invented new elements, he created a world; he
 made man according to his own fancy; and it is justly said, that the man
 of Descartes is, in fact, that of Descartes only, very different from the
 real one.
 
 He pushed his metaphysical errors so far, as to declare that two and two
 make four for no other reason but because God would have it so.  However,
 it will not be making him too great a compliment if we affirm that he was
 valuable even in his mistakes.  He deceived himself; but then it was at
 least in a methodical way.  He destroyed all the absurd chimeras with
 which youth had been infatuated for two thousand years.  He taught his
 contemporaries how to reason, and enabled them to employ his own weapons
 against himself.  If Descartes did not pay in good money, he however did
 great service in crying down that of a base alloy.
 
 I indeed believe that very few will presume to compare his philosophy in
 any respect with that of Sir Isaac Newton.  The former is an essay, the
 latter a masterpiece.  But then the man who first brought us to the path
 of truth, was perhaps as great a genius as he who afterwards conducted us
 through it.
 
 Descartes gave sight to the blind.  These saw the errors of antiquity and
 of the sciences.  The path he struck out is since become boundless.
 Rohault's little work was, during some years, a complete system of
 physics; but now all the Transactions of the several academies in Europe
 put together do not form so much as the beginning of a system.  In
 fathoming this abyss no bottom has been found.  We are now to examine
 what discoveries Sir Isaac Newton has made in it.
 
 
 
 LETTER XV.--ON ATTRACTION
 
 
 The discoveries which gained Sir Isaac Newton so universal a reputation,
 relate to the system of the world, to light, to geometrical infinities;
 and, lastly, to chronology, with which he used to amuse himself after the
 fatigue of his severer studies.
 
 I will now acquaint you (without prolixity if possible) with the few
 things I have been able to comprehend of all these sublime ideas.  With
 regard to the system of our world, disputes were a long time maintained,
 on the cause that turns the planets, and keeps them in their orbits: and
 on those causes which make all bodies here below descend towards the
 surface of the earth.
 
 The system of Descartes, explained and improved since his time, seemed to
 give a plausible reason for all those phenomena; and this reason seemed
 more just, as it is simple and intelligible to all capacities.  But in
 philosophy, a student ought to doubt of the things he fancies he
 understands too easily, as much as of those he does not understand.
 
 Gravity, the falling of accelerated bodies on the earth, the revolution
 of the planets in their orbits, their rotations round their axis, all
 this is mere motion.  Now motion cannot perhaps be conceived any
 otherwise than by impulsion; therefore all those bodies must be impelled.
 But by what are they impelled?  All space is full, it therefore is filled
 with a very subtile matter, since this is imperceptible to us; this
 matter goes from west to east, since all the planets are carried from
 west to east.  Thus from hypothesis to hypothesis, from one appearance to
 another, philosophers have imagined a vast whirlpool of subtile matter,
 in which the planets are carried round the sun: they also have created
 another particular vortex which floats in the great one, and which turns
 daily round the planets.  When all this is done, it is pretended that
 gravity depends on this diurnal motion; for, say these, the velocity of
 the subtile matter that turns round our little vortex, must be seventeen
 times more rapid than that of the earth; or, in case its velocity is
 seventeen times greater than that of the earth, its centrifugal force
 must be vastly greater, and consequently impel all bodies towards the
 earth.  This is the cause of gravity, according to the Cartesian system.
 But the theorist, before he calculated the centrifugal force and velocity
 of the subtile matter, should first have been certain that it existed.
 
 Sir Isaac Newton, seems to have destroyed all these great and little
 vortices, both that which carries the planets round the sun, as well as
 the other which supposes every planet to turn on its own axis.
 
 First, with regard to the pretended little vortex of the earth, it is
 demonstrated that it must lose its motion by insensible degrees; it is
 demonstrated, that if the earth swims in a fluid, its density must be
 equal to that of the earth; and in case its density be the same, all the
 bodies we endeavour to move must meet with an insuperable resistance.
 
 With regard to the great vortices, they are still more chimerical, and it
 is impossible to make them agree with Kepler's law, the truth of which
 has been demonstrated.  Sir Isaac shows, that the revolution of the fluid
 in which Jupiter is supposed to be carried, is not the same with regard
 to the revolution of the fluid of the earth, as the revolution of Jupiter
 with respect to that of the earth.  He proves, that as the planets make
 their revolutions in ellipses, and consequently being at a much greater
 distance one from the other in their Aphelia, and a little nearer in
 their Perihelia; the earth's velocity, for instance, ought to be greater
 when it is nearer Venus and Mars, because the fluid that carries it
 along, being then more pressed, ought to have a greater motion; and yet
 it is even then that the earth's motion is slower.
 
 He proves that there is no such thing as a celestial matter which goes
 from west to east since the comets traverse those spaces, sometimes from
 east to west, and at other times from north to south.
 
 In fine, the better to resolve, if possible, every difficulty, he proves,
 and even by experiments, that it is impossible there should be a plenum;
 and brings back the vacuum, which Aristotle and Descartes had banished
 from the world.
 
 Having by these and several other arguments destroyed the Cartesian
 vortices, he despaired of ever being able to discover whether there is a
 secret principle in nature which, at the same time, is the cause of the
 motion of all celestial bodies, and that of gravity on the earth.  But
 being retired in 1666, upon account of the Plague, to a solitude near
 Cambridge; as he was walking one day in his garden, and saw some fruits
 fall from a tree, he fell into a profound meditation on that gravity, the
 cause of which had so long been sought, but in vain, by all the
 philosophers, whilst the vulgar think there is nothing mysterious in it.
 He said to himself; that from what height soever in our hemisphere, those
 bodies might descend, their fall would certainly be in the progression
 discovered by Galileo; and the spaces they run through would be as the
 square of the times.  Why may not this power which causes heavy bodies to
 descend, and is the same without any sensible diminution at the remotest
 distance from the centre of the earth, or on the summits of the highest
 mountains, why, said Sir Isaac, may not this power extend as high as the
 moon?  And in case its influence reaches so far, is it not very probable
 that this power retains it in its orbit, and determines its motion?  But
 in case the moon obeys this principle (whatever it be) may we not
 conclude very naturally that the rest of the planets are equally subject
 to it?  In case this power exists (which besides is proved) it must
 increase in an inverse ratio of the squares of the distances.  All,
 therefore, that remains is, to examine how far a heavy body, which should
 fall upon the earth from a moderate height, would go; and how far in the
 same time, a body which should fall from the orbit of the moon, would
 descend.  To find this, nothing is wanted but the measure of the earth,
 and the distance of the moon from it.
 
 Thus Sir Isaac Newton reasoned.  But at that time the English had but a
 very imperfect measure of our globe, and depended on the uncertain
 supposition of mariners, who computed a degree to contain but sixty
 English miles, whereas it consists in reality of near seventy.  As this
 false computation did not agree with the conclusions which Sir Isaac
 intended to draw from them, he laid aside this pursuit.  A half-learned
 philosopher, remarkable only for his vanity, would have made the measure
 of the earth agree, anyhow, with his system.  Sir Isaac, however, chose
 rather to quit the researches he was then engaged in.  But after Mr.
 Picard had measured the earth exactly, by tracing that meridian which
 redounds so much to the honour of the French, Sir Isaac Newton resumed
 his former reflections, and found his account in Mr. Picard's
 calculation.
 
 A circumstance which has always appeared wonderful to me, is that such
 sublime discoveries should have been made by the sole assistance of a
 quadrant and a little arithmetic.
 
 The circumference of the earth is 123,249,600 feet.  This, among other
 things, is necessary to prove the system of attraction.
 
 The instant we know the earth's circumference, and the distance of the
 moon, we know that of the moon's orbit, and the diameter of this orbit.
 The moon performs its revolution in that orbit in twenty-seven days,
 seven hours, forty-three minutes.  It is demonstrated, that the moon in
 its mean motion makes an hundred and fourscore and seven thousand nine
 hundred and sixty feet (of Paris) in a minute.  It is likewise
 demonstrated, by a known theorem, that the central force which should
 make a body fall from the height of the moon, would make its velocity no
 more than fifteen Paris feet in a minute of time.  Now, if the law by
 which bodies gravitate and attract one another in an inverse ratio to the
 squares of the distances be true, if the same power acts according to
 that law throughout all nature, it is evident that as the earth is sixty
 semi-diameters distant from the moon, a heavy body must necessarily fall
 (on the earth) fifteen feet in the first second, and fifty-four thousand
 feet in the first minute.
 
 Now a heavy body falls, in reality, fifteen feet in the first second, and
 goes in the first minute fifty-four thousand feet, which number is the
 square of sixty multiplied by fifteen.  Bodies, therefore, gravitate in
 an inverse ratio of the squares of the distances; consequently, what
 causes gravity on earth, and keeps the moon in its orbit, is one and the
 same power; it being demonstrated that the moon gravitates on the earth,
 which is the centre of its particular motion, it is demonstrated that the
 earth and the moon gravitate on the sun which is the centre of their
 annual motion.
 
 The rest of the planets must be subject to this general law; and if this
 law exists, these planets must follow the laws which Kepler discovered.
 All these laws, all these relations are indeed observed by the planets
 with the utmost exactness; therefore, the power of attraction causes all
 the planets to gravitate towards the sun, in like manner as the moon
 gravitates towards our globe.
 
 Finally, as in all bodies re-action is equal to action, it is certain
 that the earth gravitates also towards the moon; and that the sun
 gravitates towards both.  That every one of the satellites of Saturn
 gravitates towards the other four, and the other four towards it; all
 five towards Saturn, and Saturn towards all.  That it is the same with
 regard to Jupiter; and that all these globes are attracted by the sun,
 which is reciprocally attracted by them.
 
 This power of gravitation acts proportionably to the quantity of matter
 in bodies, a truth which Sir Isaac has demonstrated by experiments.  This
 new discovery has been of use to show that the sun (the centre of the
 planetary system) attracts them all in a direct ratio of their quantity
 of matter combined with their nearness.  From hence Sir Isaac, rising by
 degrees to discoveries which seemed not to be formed for the human mind,
 is bold enough to compute the quantity of matter contained in the sun and
 in every planet; and in this manner shows, from the simple laws of
 mechanics, that every celestial globe ought necessarily to be where it is
 placed.
 
 His bare principle of the laws of gravitation accounts for all the
 apparent inequalities in the course of the celestial globes.  The
 variations of the moon are a necessary consequence of those laws.
 Moreover, the reason is evidently seen why the nodes of the moon perform
 their revolutions in nineteen years, and those of the earth in about
 twenty-six thousand.  The several appearances observed in the tides are
 also a very simple effect of this attraction.  The proximity of the moon,
 when at the full, and when it is new, and its distance in the quadratures
 or quarters, combined with the action of the sun, exhibit a sensible
 reason why the ocean swells and sinks.
 
 After having shown by his sublime theory the course and inequalities of
 the planets, he subjects comets to the same law.  The orbit of these
 fires (unknown for so great a series of years), which was the terror of
 mankind and the rock against which philosophy split, placed by Aristotle
 below the moon, and sent back by Descartes above the sphere of Saturn, is
 at last placed in its proper seat by Sir Isaac Newton.
 
 He proves that comets are solid bodies which move in the sphere of the
 sun's activity, and that they describe an ellipsis so very eccentric, and
 so near to parabolas, that certain comets must take up above five hundred
 years in their revolution.
 
 The learned Dr. Halley is of opinion that the comet seen in 1680 is the
 same which appeared in Julius Caesar's time.  This shows more than any
 other that comets are hard, opaque bodies; for it descended so near to
 the sun, as to come within a sixth part of the diameter of this planet
 from it, and consequently might have contracted a degree of heat two
 thousand times stronger than that of red-hot iron; and would have been
 soon dispersed in vapour, had it not been a firm, dense body.  The
 guessing the course of comets began then to be very much in vogue.  The
 celebrated Bernoulli concluded by his system that the famous comet of
 1680 would appear again the 17th of May, 1719.  Not a single astronomer
 in Europe went to bed that night.  However, they needed not to have broke
 their rest, for the famous comet never appeared.  There is at least more
 cunning, if not more certainty, in fixing its return to so remote a
 distance as five hundred and seventy-five years.  As to Mr. Whiston, he
 affirmed very seriously that in the time of the Deluge a comet overflowed
 the terrestrial globe.  And he was so unreasonable as to wonder that
 people laughed at him for making such an assertion.  The ancients were
 almost in the same way of thinking with Mr. Whiston, and fancied that
 comets were always the forerunners of some great calamity which was to
 befall mankind.  Sir Isaac Newton, on the contrary, suspected that they
 are very beneficent, and that vapours exhale from them merely to nourish
 and vivify the planets, which imbibe in their course the several
 particles the sun has detached from the comets, an opinion which, at
 least, is more probable than the former.  But this is not all.  If this
 power of gravitation or attraction acts on all the celestial globes, it
 acts undoubtedly on the several parts of these globes.  For in case
 bodies attract one another in proportion to the quantity of matter
 contained in them, it can only be in proportion to the quantity of their
 parts; and if this power is found in the whole, it is undoubtedly in the
 half; in the quarters in the eighth part, and so on in _infinitum_.
 
 This is attraction, the great spring by which all Nature is moved.  Sir
 Isaac Newton, after having demonstrated the existence of this principle,
 plainly foresaw that its very name would offend; and, therefore, this
 philosopher, in more places than one of his books, gives the reader some
 caution about it.  He bids him beware of confounding this name with what
 the ancients called occult qualities, but to be satisfied with knowing
 that there is in all bodies a central force, which acts to the utmost
 limits of the universe, according to the invariable laws of mechanics.
 
 It is surprising, after the solemn protestations Sir Isaac made, that
 such eminent men as Mr. Sorin and Mr. de Fontenelle should have imputed
 to this great philosopher the verbal and chimerical way of reasoning of
 the Aristotelians; Mr. Sorin in the Memoirs of the Academy of 1709, and
 Mr. de Fontenelle in the very eulogium of Sir Isaac Newton.
 
 Most of the French (the learned and others) have repeated this reproach.
 These are for ever crying out, "Why did he not employ the word
 _impulsion_, which is so well understood, rather than that of
 _attraction_, which is unintelligible?"
 
 Sir Isaac might have answered these critics thus:--"First, you have as
 imperfect an idea of the word impulsion as of that of attraction; and in
 case you cannot conceive how one body tends towards the centre of another
 body, neither can you conceive by what power one body can impel another.
 
 "Secondly, I could not admit of impulsion; for to do this I must have
 known that a celestial matter was the agent.  But so far from knowing
 that there is any such matter, I have proved it to be merely imaginary.
 
 "Thirdly, I use the word attraction for no other reason but to express an
 effect which I discovered in Nature--a certain and indisputable effect of
 an unknown principle--a quality inherent in matter, the cause of which
 persons of greater abilities than I can pretend to may, if they can, find
 out."
 
 "What have you, then, taught us?" will these people say further; "and to
 what purpose are so many calculations to tell us what you yourself do not
 comprehend?"
 
 "I have taught you," may Sir Isaac rejoin, "that all bodies gravitate
 towards one another in proportion to their quantity of matter; that these
 central forces alone keep the planets and comets in their orbits, and
 cause them to move in the proportion before set down.  I demonstrate to
 you that it is impossible there should be any other cause which keeps the
 planets in their orbits than that general phenomenon of gravity.  For
 heavy bodies fall on the earth according to the proportion demonstrated
 of central forces; and the planets finishing their course according to
 these same proportions, in case there were another power that acted upon
 all those bodies, it would either increase their velocity or change their
 direction.  Now, not one of those bodies ever has a single degree of
 motion or velocity, or has any direction but what is demonstrated to be
 the effect of the central forces.  Consequently it is impossible there
 should be any other principle."
 
 Give me leave once more to introduce Sir Isaac speaking.  Shall he not be
 allowed to say? "My case and that of the ancients is very different.
 These saw, for instance, water ascend in pumps, and said, 'The water
 rises because it abhors a vacuum.'  But with regard to myself; I am in
 the case of a man who should have first observed that water ascends in
 pumps, but should leave others to explain the cause of this effect.  The
 anatomist, who first declared that the motion of the arm is owing to the
 contraction of the muscles, taught mankind an indisputable truth.  But
 are they less obliged to him because he did not know the reason why the
 muscles contract?  The cause of the elasticity of the air is unknown, but
 he who first discovered this spring performed a very signal service to
 natural philosophy.  The spring that I discovered was more hidden and
 more universal, and for that very reason mankind ought to thank me the
 more.  I have discovered a new property of matter--one of the secrets of
 the Creator--and have calculated and discovered the effects of it.  After
 this, shall people quarrel with me about the name I give it?"
 
 Vortices may be called an occult quality, because their existence was
 never proved.  Attraction, on the contrary, is a real thing, because its
 effects are demonstrated, and the proportions of it are calculated.  The
 cause of this cause is among the _Arcana_ of the Almighty.
 
    "Precedes huc, et non amplius."
 
 (Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther.)
 
 
 
 LETTER XVI.--ON SIR ISAAC NEWTON'S OPTICS
 
 
 The philosophers of the last age found out a new universe; and a
 circumstance which made its discovery more difficult was that no one had
 so much as suspected its existence.  The most sage and judicious were of
 opinion that it was a frantic rashness to dare so much as to imagine that
 it was possible to guess the laws by which the celestial bodies move and
 the manner how light acts.  Galileo, by his astronomical discoveries,
 Kepler, by his calculation, Descartes (at least, in his dioptrics), and
 Sir Isaac Newton, in all his works, severally saw the mechanism of the
 springs of the world.  The geometricians have subjected infinity to the
 laws of calculation.  The circulation of the blood in animals, and of the
 sap in vegetables, have changed the face of Nature with regard to us.  A
 new kind of existence has been given to bodies in the air-pump.  By the
 assistance of telescopes bodies have been brought nearer to one another.
 Finally, the several discoveries which Sir Isaac Newton has made on light
 are equal to the boldest things which the curiosity of man could expect
 after so many philosophical novelties.
 
 Till Antonio de Dominis the rainbow was considered as an inexplicable
 miracle.  This philosopher guessed that it was a necessary effect of the
 sun and rain.  Descartes gained immortal fame by his mathematical
 explication of this so natural a phenomenon.  He calculated the
 reflections and refractions of light in drops of rain.  And his sagacity
 on this occasion was at that time looked upon as next to divine.
 
 But what would he have said had it been proved to him that he was
 mistaken in the nature of light; that he had not the least reason to
 maintain that it is a globular body?  That it is false to assert that
 this matter, spreading itself through the whole, waits only to be
 projected forward by the sun, in order to be put in action, in like
 manner as a long staff acts at one end when pushed forward by the other.
 That light is certainly darted by the sun; in fine, that light is
 transmitted from the sun to the earth in about seven minutes, though a
 cannonball, which were not to lose any of its velocity, could not go that
 distance in less than twenty-five years.  How great would have been his
 astonishment had he been told that light does not reflect directly by
 impinging against the solid parts of bodies, that bodies are not
 transparent when they have large pores, and that a man should arise who
 would demonstrate all these paradoxes, and anatomise a single ray of
 light with more dexterity than the ablest artist dissects a human body.
 This man is come.  Sir Isaac Newton has demonstrated to the eye, by the
 bare assistance of the prism, that light is a composition of coloured
 rays, which, being united, form white colour.  A single ray is by him
 divided into seven, which all fall upon a piece of linen, or a sheet of
 white paper, in their order, one above the other, and at unequal
 distances.  The first is red, the second orange, the third yellow, the
 fourth green, the fifth blue, the sixth indigo, the seventh a
 violet-purple.  Each of these rays, transmitted afterwards by a hundred
 other prisms, will never change the colour it bears; in like manner, as
 gold, when completely purged from its dross, will never change afterwards
 in the crucible.  As a superabundant proof that each of these elementary
 rays has inherently in itself that which forms its colour to the eye,
 take a small piece of yellow wood, for instance, and set it in the ray of
 a red colour; this wood will instantly be tinged red.  But set it in the
 ray of a green colour, it assumes a green colour, and so of all the rest.
 
 From what cause, therefore, do colours arise in Nature?  It is nothing
 but the disposition of bodies to reflect the rays of a certain order and
 to absorb all the rest.
 
 What, then, is this secret disposition?  Sir Isaac Newton demonstrates
 that it is nothing more than the density of the small constituent
 particles of which a body is composed.  And how is this reflection
 performed?  It was supposed to arise from the rebounding of the rays, in
 the same manner as a ball on the surface of a solid body.  But this is a
 mistake, for Sir Isaac taught the astonished philosophers that bodies are
 opaque for no other reason but because their pores are large, that light
 reflects on our eyes from the very bosom of those pores, that the smaller
 the pores of a body are the more such a body is transparent.  Thus paper,
 which reflects the light when dry, transmits it when oiled, because the
 oil, by filling its pores, makes them much smaller.
 
 It is there that examining the vast porosity of bodies, every particle
 having its pores, and every particle of those particles having its own,
 he shows we are not certain that there is a cubic inch of solid matter in
 the universe, so far are we from conceiving what matter is.  Having thus
 divided, as it were, light into its elements, and carried the sagacity of
 his discoveries so far as to prove the method of distinguishing compound
 colours from such as are primitive, he shows that these elementary rays,
 separated by the prism, are ranged in their order for no other reason but
 because they are refracted in that very order; and it is this property
 (unknown till he discovered it) of breaking or splitting in this
 proportion; it is this unequal refraction of rays, this power of
 refracting the red less than the orange colour, &c., which he calls the
 different refrangibility.  The most reflexible rays are the most
 refrangible, and from hence he evinces that the same power is the cause
 both of the reflection and refraction of light.
 
 But all these wonders are merely but the opening of his discoveries.  He
 found out the secret to see the vibrations or fits of light which come
 and go incessantly, and which either transmit light or reflect it,
 according to the density of the parts they meet with.  He has presumed to
 calculate the density of the particles of air necessary between two
 glasses, the one flat, the other convex on one side, set one upon the
 other, in order to operate such a transmission or reflection, or to form
 such and such a colour.
 
 From all these combinations he discovers the proportion in which light
 acts on bodies and bodies act on light.
 
 He saw light so perfectly, that he has determined to what degree of
 perfection the art of increasing it, and of assisting our eyes by
 telescopes, can be carried.
 
 Descartes, from a noble confidence that was very excusable, considering
 how strongly he was fired at the first discoveries he made in an art
 which he almost first found out; Descartes, I say, hoped to discover in
 the stars, by the assistance of telescopes, objects as small as those we
 discern upon the earth.
 
 But Sir Isaac has shown that dioptric telescopes cannot be brought to a
 greater perfection, because of that refraction, and of that very
 refrangibility, which at the same time that they bring objects nearer to
 us, scatter too much the elementary rays.  He has calculated in these
 glasses the proportion of the scattering of the red and of the blue rays;
 and proceeding so far as to demonstrate things which were not supposed
 even to exist, he examines the inequalities which arise from the shape or
 figure of the glass, and that which arises from the refrangibility.  He
 finds that the object glass of the telescope being convex on one side and
 flat on the other, in case the flat side be turned towards the object,
 the error which arises from the construction and position of the glass is
 above five thousand times less than the error which arises from the
 refrangibility; and, therefore, that the shape or figure of the glasses
 is not the cause why telescopes cannot be carried to a greater
 perfection, but arises wholly from the nature of light.
 
 For this reason he invented a telescope, which discovers objects by
 reflection, and not by refraction.  Telescopes of this new kind are very
 hard to make, and their use is not easy; but, according to the English, a
 reflective telescope of but five feet has the same effect as another of a
 hundred feet in length.
 
 
 
 LETTER XVII.--ON INFINITES IN GEOMETRY, AND SIR ISAAC NEWTON'S CHRONOLOGY
 
 
 The labyrinth and abyss of infinity is also a new course Sir Isaac Newton
 has gone through, and we are obliged to him for the clue, by whose
 assistance we are enabled to trace its various windings.
 
 Descartes got the start of him also in this astonishing invention.  He
 advanced with mighty steps in his geometry, and was arrived at the very
 borders of infinity, but went no farther.  Dr. Wallis, about the middle
 of the last century, was the first who reduced a fraction by a perpetual
 division to an infinite series.
 
 The Lord Brouncker employed this series to square the hyperbola.
 
 Mercator published a demonstration of this quadrature; much about which
 time Sir Isaac Newton, being then twenty-three years of age, had invented
 a general method, to perform on all geometrical curves what had just
 before been tried on the hyperbola.
 
 It is to this method of subjecting everywhere infinity to algebraical
 calculations, that the name is given of differential calculations or of
 fluxions and integral calculation.  It is the art of numbering and
 measuring exactly a thing whose existence cannot be conceived.
 
 And, indeed, would you not imagine that a man laughed at you who should
 declare that there are lines infinitely great which form an angle
 infinitely little?
 
 That a right line, which is a right line so long as it is finite, by
 changing infinitely little its direction, becomes an infinite curve; and
 that a curve may become infinitely less than another curve?
 
 That there are infinite squares, infinite cubes, and infinites of
 infinites, all greater than one another, and the last but one of which is
 nothing in comparison of the last?
 
 All these things, which at first appear to be the utmost excess of
 frenzy, are in reality an effort of the subtlety and extent of the human
 mind, and the art of finding truths which till then had been unknown.
 
 This so bold edifice is even founded on simple ideas.  The business is to
 measure the diagonal of a square, to give the area of a curve, to find
 the square root of a number, which has none in common arithmetic.  After
 all, the imagination ought not to be startled any more at so many orders
 of infinites than at the so well-known proposition, viz., that curve
 lines may always be made to pass between a circle and a tangent; or at
 that other, namely, that matter is divisible in _infinitum_.  These two
 truths have been demonstrated many years, and are no less
 incomprehensible than the things we have been speaking of.
 
 For many years the invention of this famous calculation was denied to Sir
 Isaac Newton.  In Germany Mr. Leibnitz was considered as the inventor of
 the differences or moments, called fluxions, and Mr. Bernouilli claimed
 the integral calculus.  However, Sir Isaac is now thought to have first
 made the discovery, and the other two have the glory of having once made
 the world doubt whether it was to be ascribed to him or them.  Thus some
 contested with Dr. Harvey the invention of the circulation of the blood,
 as others disputed with Mr. Perrault that of the circulation of the sap.
 
 Hartsocher and Leuwenhoek disputed with each other the honour of having
 first seen the _vermiculi_ of which mankind are formed.  This Hartsocher
 also contested with Huygens the invention of a new method of calculating
 the distance of a fixed star.  It is not yet known to what philosopher we
 owe the invention of the cycloid.
 
 Be this as it will, it is by the help of this geometry of infinites that
 Sir Isaac Newton attained to the most sublime discoveries.  I am now to
 speak of another work, which, though more adapted to the capacity of the
 human mind, does nevertheless display some marks of that creative genius
 with which Sir Isaac Newton was informed in all his researches.  The work
 I mean is a chronology of a new kind, for what province soever he
 undertook he was sure to change the ideas and opinions received by the
 rest of men.
 
 Accustomed to unravel and disentangle chaos, he was resolved to convey at
 least some light into that of the fables of antiquity which are blended
 and confounded with history, and fix an uncertain chronology.  It is true
 that there is no family, city, or nation, but endeavours to remove its
 original as far backward as possible.  Besides, the first historians were
 the most negligent in setting down the eras: books were infinitely less
 common than they are at this time, and, consequently, authors being not
 so obnoxious to censure, they therefore imposed upon the world with
 greater impunity; and, as it is evident that these have related a great
 number of fictitious particulars, it is probable enough that they also
 gave us several false eras.
 
 It appeared in general to Sir Isaac that the world was five hundred years
 younger than chronologers declare it to be.  He grounds his opinion on
 the ordinary course of Nature, and on the observations which astronomers
 have made.
 
 By the course of Nature we here understand the time that every generation
 of men lives upon the earth.  The Egyptians first employed this vague and
 uncertain method of calculating when they began to write the beginning of
 their history.  These computed three hundred and forty-one generations
 from Menes to Sethon; and, having no fixed era, they supposed three
 generations to consist of a hundred years.  In this manner they computed
 eleven thousand three hundred and forty years from Menes's reign to that
 of Sethon.
 
 The Greeks before they counted by Olympiads followed the method of the
 Egyptians, and even gave a little more extent to generations, making each
 to consist of forty years.
 
 Now, here, both the Egyptians and the Greeks made an erroneous
 computation.  It is true, indeed, that, according to the usual course of
 Nature, three generations last about a hundred and twenty years; but
 three reigns are far from taking up so many.  It is very evident that
 mankind in general live longer than kings are found to reign, so that an
 author who should write a history in which there were no dates fixed, and
 should know that nine kings had reigned over a nation; such an historian
 would commit a great error should he allow three hundred years to these
 nine monarchs.  Every generation takes about thirty-six years; every
 reign is, one with the other, about twenty.  Thirty kings of England have
 swayed the sceptre from William the Conqueror to George I., the years of
 whose reigns added together amount to six hundred and forty-eight years;
 which, being divided equally among the thirty kings, give to every one a
 reign of twenty-one years and a half very near.  Sixty-three kings of
 France have sat upon the throne; these have, one with another, reigned
 about twenty years each.  This is the usual course of Nature.  The
 ancients, therefore, were mistaken when they supposed the durations in
 general of reigns to equal that of generations.  They, therefore, allowed
 too great a number of years, and consequently some years must be
 subtracted from their computation.
 
 Astronomical observations seem to have lent a still greater assistance to
 our philosopher.  He appears to us stronger when he fights upon his own
 ground.
 
 You know that the earth, besides its annual motion which carries it round
 the sun from west to east in the space of a year, has also a singular
 revolution which was quite unknown till within these late years.  Its
 poles have a very slow retrograde motion from east to west, whence it
 happens that their position every day does not correspond exactly with
 the same point of the heavens.  This difference, which is so insensible
 in a year, becomes pretty considerable in time; and in threescore and
 twelve years the difference is found to be of one degree, that is to say,
 the three hundred and sixtieth part of the circumference of the whole
 heaven.  Thus after seventy-two years the colure of the vernal equinox
 which passed through a fixed star, corresponds with another fixed star.
 Hence it is that the sun, instead of being in that part of the heavens in
 which the Ram was situated in the time of Hipparchus, is found to
 correspond with that part of the heavens in which the Bull was situated;
 and the Twins are placed where the Bull then stood.  All the signs have
 changed their situation, and yet we still retain the same manner of
 speaking as the ancients did.  In this age we say that the sun is in the
 Ram in the spring, from the same principle of condescension that we say
 that the sun turns round.
 
 Hipparchus was the first among the Greeks who observed some change in the
 constellations with regard to the equinoxes, or rather who learnt it from
 the Egyptians.  Philosophers ascribed this motion to the stars; for in
 those ages people were far from imagining such a revolution in the earth,
 which was supposed to be immovable in every respect.  They therefore
 created a heaven in which they fixed the several stars, and gave this
 heaven a particular motion by which it was carried towards the east,
 whilst that all the stars seemed to perform their diurnal revolution from
 east to west.  To this error they added a second of much greater
 consequence, by imagining that the pretended heaven of the fixed stars
 advanced one degree eastward every hundred years.  In this manner they
 were no less mistaken in their astronomical calculation than in their
 system of natural philosophy.  As for instance, an astronomer in that age
 would have said that the vernal equinox was in the time of such and such
 an observation, in such a sign, and in such a star.  It has advanced two
 degrees of each since the time that observation was made to the present.
 Now two degrees are equivalent to two hundred years; consequently the
 astronomer who made that observation lived just so many years before me.
 It is certain that an astronomer who had argued in this manner would have
 mistook just fifty-four years; hence it is that the ancients, who were
 doubly deceived, made their great year of the world, that is, the
 revolution of the whole heavens, to consist of thirty-six thousand years.
 But the moderns are sensible that this imaginary revolution of the heaven
 of the stars is nothing else than the revolution of the poles of the
 earth, which is performed in twenty-five thousand nine hundred years.  It
 may be proper to observe transiently in this place, that Sir Isaac, by
 determining the figure of the earth, has very happily explained the cause
 of this revolution.
 
 All this being laid down, the only thing remaining to settle chronology
 is to see through what star the colure of the equinoxes passes, and where
 it intersects at this time the ecliptic in the spring; and to discover
 whether some ancient writer does not tell us in what point the ecliptic
 was intersected in his time, by the same colure of the equinoxes.
 
 Clemens Alexandrinus informs us, that Chiron, who went with the
 Argonauts, observed the constellations at the time of that famous
 expedition, and fixed the vernal equinox to the middle of the Ram; the
 autumnal equinox to the middle of Libra; our summer solstice to the
 middle of Cancer, and our winter solstice to the middle of Capricorn.
 
 A long time after the expedition of the Argonauts, and a year before the
 Peloponnesian war, Methon observed that the point of the summer solstice
 passed through the eighth degree of Cancer.
 
 Now every sign of the zodiac contains thirty degrees.  In Chiron's time,
 the solstice was arrived at the middle of the sign, that is to say to the
 fifteenth degree.  A year before the Peloponnesian war it was at the
 eighth, and therefore it had retarded seven degrees.  A degree is
 equivalent to seventy-two years; consequently, from the beginning of the
 Peloponnesian war to the expedition of the Argonauts, there is no more
 than an interval of seven times seventy-two years, which make five
 hundred and four years, and not seven hundred years as the Greeks
 computed.  Thus in comparing the position of the heavens at this time
 with their position in that age, we find that the expedition of the
 Argonauts ought to be placed about nine hundred years before Christ, and
 not about fourteen hundred; and consequently that the world is not so old
 by five hundred years as it was generally supposed to be.  By this
 calculation all the eras are drawn nearer, and the several events are
 found to have happened later than is computed.  I do not know whether
 this ingenious system will be favourably received; and whether these
 notions will prevail so far with the learned, as to prompt them to reform
 the chronology of the world.  Perhaps these gentlemen would think it too
 great a condescension to allow one and the same man the glory of having
 improved natural philosophy, geometry, and history.  This would be a kind
 of universal monarchy, with which the principle of self-love that is in
 man will scarce suffer him to indulge his fellow-creature; and, indeed,
 at the same time that some very great philosophers attacked Sir Isaac
 Newton's attractive principle, others fell upon his chronological system.
 Time that should discover to which of these the victory is due, may
 perhaps only leave the dispute still more undetermined.
 
 
 
 LETTER XVIII.--ON TRAGEDY
 
 
 The English as well as the Spaniards were possessed of theatres at a time
 when the French had no more than moving, itinerant stages.  Shakspeare,
 who was considered as the Corneille of the first-mentioned nation, was
 pretty nearly contemporary with Lopez de Vega, and he created, as it
 were, the English theatre.  Shakspeare boasted a strong fruitful genius.
 He was natural and sublime, but had not so much as a single spark of good
 taste, or knew one rule of the drama.  I will now hazard a random, but,
 at the same time, true reflection, which is, that the great merit of this
 dramatic poet has been the ruin of the English stage.  There are such
 beautiful, such noble, such dreadful scenes in this writer's monstrous
 farces, to which the name of tragedy is given, that they have always been
 exhibited with great success.  Time, which alone gives reputation to
 writers, at last makes their very faults venerable.  Most of the
 whimsical gigantic images of this poet, have, through length of time (it
 being a hundred and fifty years since they were first drawn) acquired a
 right of passing for sublime.  Most of the modern dramatic writers have
 copied him; but the touches and descriptions which are applauded in
 Shakspeare, are hissed at in these writers; and you will easily believe
 that the veneration in which this author is held, increases in proportion
 to the contempt which is shown to the moderns.  Dramatic writers don't
 consider that they should not imitate him; and the ill-success of
 Shakspeare's imitators produces no other effect, than to make him be
 considered as inimitable.  You remember that in the tragedy of _Othello,
 Moor of Venice_, a most tender piece, a man strangles his wife on the
 stage, and that the poor woman, whilst she is strangling, cries aloud
 that she dies very unjustly.  You know that in _Hamlet, Prince of
 Denmark_, two grave-diggers make a grave, and are all the time drinking,
 singing ballads, and making humorous reflections (natural indeed enough
 to persons of their profession) on the several skulls they throw up with
 their spades; but a circumstance which will surprise you is, that this
 ridiculous incident has been imitated.  In the reign of King Charles II.,
 which was that of politeness, and the Golden Age of the liberal arts;
 Otway, in his _Venice Preserved_, introduces Antonio the senator, and
 Naki, his courtesan, in the midst of the horrors of the Marquis of
 Bedemar's conspiracy.  Antonio, the superannuated senator plays, in his
 mistress's presence, all the apish tricks of a lewd, impotent debauchee,
 who is quite frantic and out of his senses.  He mimics a bull and a dog,
 and bites his mistress's legs, who kicks and whips him.  However, the
 players have struck these buffooneries (which indeed were calculated
 merely for the dregs of the people) out of Otway's tragedy; but they have
 still left in Shakspeare's _Julius Caesar_ the jokes of the Roman
 shoemakers and cobblers, who are introduced in the same scene with Brutus
 and Cassius.  You will undoubtedly complain, that those who have hitherto
 discoursed with you on the English stage, and especially on the
 celebrated Shakspeare, have taken notice only of his errors; and that no
 one has translated any of those strong, those forcible passages which
 atone for all his faults.  But to this I will answer, that nothing is
 easier than to exhibit in prose all the silly impertinences which a poet
 may have thrown out; but that it is a very difficult task to translate
 his fine verses.  All your junior academical sophs, who set up for
 censors of the eminent writers, compile whole volumes; but methinks two
 pages which display some of the beauties of great geniuses, are of
 infinitely more value than all the idle rhapsodies of those commentators;
 and I will join in opinion with all persons of good taste in declaring,
 that greater advantage may be reaped from a dozen verses of Homer of
 Virgil, than from all the critiques put together which have been made on
 those two great poets.
 
 I have ventured to translate some passages of the most celebrated English
 poets, and shall now give you one from Shakspeare.  Pardon the blemishes
 of the translation for the sake of the original; and remember always that
 when you see a version, you see merely a faint print of a beautiful
 picture.  I have made choice of part of the celebrated soliloquy in
 _Hamlet_, which you may remember is as follows:--
 
    "To be, or not to be? that is the question!
    Whether 't is nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing, end them?  To die! to sleep!
    No more! and by a sleep to say we end
    The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to!  'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wished.  To die! to sleep!
    To sleep; perchance to dream!  O, there's the rub;
    For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause.  There's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life:
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    The oppressor's wrong, the poor man's contumely,
    The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin.  Who would fardels bear
    To groan and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death,
    The undiscovered country, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have,
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought:
    And enterprises of great weight and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry,
    And lose the name of action--"
 
 My version of it runs thus:--
 
    "Demeure, il faut choisir et passer a l'instant
    De la vie, a la mort, ou de l'etre au neant.
    Dieux cruels, s'il en est, eclairez mon courage.
    Faut-il vieillir courbe sous la main qui m'outrage,
    Supporter, ou finir mon malheur et mon sort?
    Qui suis je?  Qui m'arrete! et qu'est-ce que la mort?
    C'est la fin de nos maux, c'est mon unique asile
    Apres de longs transports, c'est un sommeil tranquile.
    On s'endort, et tout meurt, mais un affreux reveil
    Doit succeder peut etre aux douceurs du sommeil!
    On nous menace, on dit que cette courte vie,
    De tourmens eternels est aussi-tot suivie.
    O mort! moment fatal! affreuse eternite!
    Tout coeur a ton seul nom se glace epouvante.
    Eh! qui pourroit sans toi supporter cette vie,
    De nos pretres menteurs benir l'hypocrisie:
    D'une indigne maitresse encenser les erreurs,
    Ramper sous un ministre, adorer ses hauteurs;
    Et montrer les langueurs de son ame abattue,
    A des amis ingrats qui detournent la vue?
    La mort seroit trop douce en ces extremitez,
    Mais le scrupule parle, et nous crie, arretez;
    Il defend a nos mains cet heureux homicide
    Et d'un heros guerrier, fait un Chretien timide," &c.
 
 Do not imagine that I have translated Shakspeare in a servile manner.  Woe
 to the writer who gives a literal version; who by rendering every word of
 his original, by that very means enervates the sense, and extinguishes
 all the fire of it.  It is on such an occasion one may justly affirm,
 that the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens.
 
 Here follows another passage copied from a celebrated tragic writer among
 the English.  It is Dryden, a poet in the reign of Charles II.--a writer
 whose genius was too exuberant, and not accompanied with judgment enough.
 Had he written only a tenth part of the works he left behind him, his
 character would have been conspicuous in every part; but his great fault
 is his having endeavoured to be universal.
 
 The passage in question is as follows:--
 
    "When I consider life, 't is all a cheat,
    Yet fooled by hope, men favour the deceit;
    Trust on and think, to-morrow will repay;
    To-morrow's falser than the former day;
    Lies more; and whilst it says we shall be blest
    With some new joy, cuts off what we possessed;
    Strange cozenage! none would live past years again,
    Yet all hope pleasure in what yet remain,
    And from the dregs of life think to receive
    What the first sprightly running could not give.
    I'm tired with waiting for this chymic gold,
    Which fools us young, and beggars us when old."
 
 I shall now give you my translation:--
 
    "De desseins en regrets et d'erreurs en desirs
    Les mortals insenses promenent leur folie.
    Dans des malheurs presents, dans l'espoir des plaisirs
    Nous ne vivons jamais, nous attendons la vie.
    Demain, demain, dit-on, va combler tous nos voeux.
    Demain vient, et nous laisse encore plus malheureux.
    Quelle est l'erreur, helas! du soin qui nous devore,
    Nul de nous ne voudroit recommencer son cours.
    De nos premiers momens nous maudissons l'aurore,
    Et de la nuit qui vient nous attendons encore,
    Ce qu'ont en vain promis les plus beaux de nos jours," &c.
 
 It is in these detached passages that the English have hitherto excelled.
 Their dramatic pieces, most of which are barbarous and without decorum,
 order, or verisimilitude, dart such resplendent flashes through this
 gleam, as amaze and astonish.  The style is too much inflated, too
 unnatural, too closely copied from the Hebrew writers, who abound so much
 with the Asiatic fustian.  But then it must be also confessed that the
 stilts of the figurative style, on which the English tongue is lifted up,
 raises the genius at the same time very far aloft, though with an
 irregular pace.  The first English writer who composed a regular tragedy,
 and infused a spirit of elegance through every part of it, was the
 illustrious Mr. Addison.  His "Cato" is a masterpiece, both with regard
 to the diction and to the beauty and harmony of the numbers.  The
 character of Cato is, in my opinion, vastly superior to that of Cornelia
 in the "Pompey" of Corneille, for Cato is great without anything like
 fustian, and Cornelia, who besides is not a necessary character, tends
 sometimes to bombast.  Mr. Addison's Cato appears to me the greatest
 character that was ever brought upon any stage, but then the rest of them
 do not correspond to the dignity of it, and this dramatic piece, so
 excellently well writ, is disfigured by a dull love plot, which spreads a
 certain languor over the whole, that quite murders it.
 
 The custom of introducing love at random and at any rate in the drama
 passed from Paris to London about 1660, with our ribbons and our
 perruques.  The ladies who adorn the theatrical circle there, in like
 manner as in this city, will suffer love only to be the theme of every
 conversation.  The judicious Mr. Addison had the effeminate complaisance
 to soften the severity of his dramatic character, so as to adapt it to
 the manners of the age, and, from an endeavour to please, quite ruined a
 masterpiece in its kind.  Since his time the drama is become more
 regular, the audience more difficult to be pleased, and writers more
 correct and less bold.  I have seen some new pieces that were written
 with great regularity, but which, at the same time, were very flat and
 insipid.  One would think that the English had been hitherto formed to
 produce irregular beauties only.  The shining monsters of Shakspeare give
 infinite more delight than the judicious images of the moderns.  Hitherto
 the poetical genius of the English resembles a tufted tree planted by the
 hand of Nature, that throws out a thousand branches at random, and
 spreads unequally, but with great vigour.  It dies if you attempt to
 force its nature, and to lop and dress it in the same manner as the trees
 of the Garden of Marli.
 
 
 
 LETTER XIX.--ON COMEDY
 
 
 I am surprised that the judicious and ingenious Mr. de Muralt, who has
 published some letters on the English and French nations, should have
 confined himself; in treating of comedy, merely to censure Shadwell the
 comic writer.  This author was had in pretty great contempt in Mr. de
 Muralt's time, and was not the poet of the polite part of the nation.  His
 dramatic pieces, which pleased some time in acting, were despised by all
 persons of taste, and might be compared to many plays which I have seen
 in France, that drew crowds to the playhouse, at the same time that they
 were intolerable to read; and of which it might be said, that the whole
 city of Paris exploded them, and yet all flocked to see them represented
 on the stage.  Methinks Mr. de Muralt should have mentioned an excellent
 comic writer (living when he was in England), I mean Mr. Wycherley, who
 was a long time known publicly to be happy in the good graces of the most
 celebrated mistress of King Charles II.  This gentleman, who passed his
 life among persons of the highest distinction, was perfectly well
 acquainted with their lives and their follies, and painted them with the
 strongest pencil, and in the truest colours.  He has drawn a misanthrope
 or man-hater, in imitation of that of Moliere.  All Wycherley's strokes
 are stronger and bolder than those of our misanthrope, but then they are
 less delicate, and the rules of decorum are not so well observed in this
 play.  The English writer has corrected the only defect that is in
 Moliere's comedy, the thinness of the plot, which also is so disposed
 that the characters in it do not enough raise our concern.  The English
 comedy affects us, and the contrivance of the plot is very ingenious, but
 at the same time it is too bold for the French manners.  The fable is
 this:--A captain of a man-of-war, who is very brave, open-hearted, and
 inflamed with a spirit of contempt for all mankind, has a prudent,
 sincere friend, whom he yet is suspicious of; and a mistress that loves
 him with the utmost excess of passion.  The captain so far from returning
 her love, will not even condescend to look upon her, but confides
 entirely in a false friend, who is the most worthless wretch living.  At
 the same time he has given his heart to a creature, who is the greatest
 coquette and the most perfidious of her sex, and he is so credulous as to
 be confident she is a Penelope, and his false friend a Cato.  He embarks
 on board his ship in order to go and fight the Dutch, having left all his
 money, his jewels, and everything he had in the world to this virtuous
 creature, whom at the same time he recommends to the care of his supposed
 faithful friend.  Nevertheless the real man of honour, whom he suspects
 so unaccountably, goes on board the ship with him, and the mistress, on
 whom he would not bestow so much as one glance, disguises herself in the
 habit of a page, and is with him the whole voyage, without his once
 knowing that she is of a sex different from that she attempts to pass
 for, which, by the way, is not over natural.
 
 The captain having blown up his own ship in an engagement, returns to
 England abandoned and undone, accompanied by his page and his friend,
 without knowing the friendship of the one or the tender passion of the
 other.  Immediately he goes to the jewel among women, who he expected had
 preserved her fidelity to him and the treasure he had left in her hands.
 He meets with her indeed, but married to the honest knave in whom he had
 reposed so much confidence, and finds she had acted as treacherously with
 regard to the casket he had entrusted her with.  The captain can scarce
 think it possible that a woman of virtue and honour can act so vile a
 part; but to convince him still more of the reality of it, this very
 worthy lady falls in love with the little page, and will force him to her
 embraces.  But as it is requisite justice should be done, and that in a
 dramatic piece virtue ought to be rewarded and vice punished, it is at
 last found that the captain takes his page's place, and lies with his
 faithless mistress, cuckolds his treacherous friend, thrusts his sword
 through his body, recovers his casket, and marries his page.  You will
 observe that this play is also larded with a petulant, litigious old
 woman (a relation of the captain), who is the most comical character that
 was ever brought upon the stage.
 
 Wycherley has also copied from Moliere another play, of as singular and
 bold a cast, which is a kind of _Ecole des Femmes_, or, _School for
 Married Women_.
 
 The principal character in this comedy is one Homer, a sly fortune
 hunter, and the terror of all the City husbands.  This fellow, in order
 to play a surer game, causes a report to be spread, that in his last
 illness, the surgeons had found it necessary to have him made a eunuch.
 Upon his appearing in this noble character, all the husbands in town
 flock to him with their wives, and now poor Homer is only puzzled about
 his choice.  However, he gives the preference particularly to a little
 female peasant, a very harmless, innocent creature, who enjoys a fine
 flush of health, and cuckolds her husband with a simplicity that has
 infinitely more merit than the witty malice of the most experienced
 ladies.  This play cannot indeed be called the school of good morals, but
 it is certainly the school of wit and true humour.
 
 Sir John Vanbrugh has written several comedies, which are more humorous
 than those of Mr. Wycherley, but not so ingenious.  Sir John was a man of
 pleasure, and likewise a poet and an architect.  The general opinion is,
 that he is as sprightly in his writings as he is heavy in his buildings.
 It is he who raised the famous Castle of Blenheim, a ponderous and
 lasting monument of our unfortunate Battle of Hochstet.  Were the
 apartments but as spacious as the walls are thick, this castle would be
 commodious enough.  Some wag, in an epitaph he made on Sir John Vanbrugh,
 has these lines:--
 
    "Earth lie light on him, for he
    Laid many a heavy load on thee."
 
 Sir John having taken a tour into France before the glorious war that
 broke out in 1701, was thrown into the Bastille, and detained there for
 some time, without being ever able to discover the motive which had
 prompted our ministry to indulge him with this mark of their distinction.
 He wrote a comedy during his confinement; and a circumstance which
 appears to me very extraordinary is, that we don't meet with so much as a
 single satirical stroke against the country in which he had been so
 injuriously treated.
 
 The late Mr. Congreve raised the glory of comedy to a greater height than
 any English writer before or since his time.  He wrote only a few plays,
 but they are all excellent in their kind.  The laws of the drama are
 strictly observed in them; they abound with characters all which are
 shadowed with the utmost delicacy, and we don't meet with so much as one
 low or coarse jest.  The language is everywhere that of men of honour,
 but their actions are those of knaves--a proof that he was perfectly well
 acquainted with human nature, and frequented what we call polite company.
 He was infirm and come to the verge of life when I knew him.  Mr.
 Congreve had one defect, which was his entertaining too mean an idea of
 his first profession (that of a writer), though it was to this he owed
 his fame and fortune.  He spoke of his works as of trifles that were
 beneath him; and hinted to me, in our first conversation, that I should
 visit him upon no other footing than that of a gentleman who led a life
 of plainness and simplicity.  I answered, that had he been so unfortunate
 as to be a mere gentleman, I should never have come to see him; and I was
 very much disgusted at so unseasonable a piece of vanity.
 
 Mr. Congreve's comedies are the most witty and regular, those of Sir John
 Vanbrugh most gay and humorous, and those of Mr. Wycherley have the
 greatest force and spirit.  It may be proper to observe that these fine
 geniuses never spoke disadvantageously of Moliere; and that none but the
 contemptible writers among the English have endeavoured to lessen the
 character of that great comic poet.  Such Italian musicians as despise
 Lully are themselves persons of no character or ability; but a Buononcini
 esteems that great artist, and does justice to his merit.
 
 The English have some other good comic writers living, such as Sir
 Richard Steele and Mr. Cibber, who is an excellent player, and also Poet
 Laureate--a title which, how ridiculous soever it may be thought, is yet
 worth a thousand crowns a year (besides some considerable privileges) to
 the person who enjoys it.  Our illustrious Corneille had not so much.
 
 To conclude.  Don't desire me to descend to particulars with regard to
 these English comedies, which I am so fond of applauding; nor to give you
 a single smart saying or humorous stroke from Wycherley or Congreve.  We
 don't laugh in rending a translation.  If you have a mind to understand
 the English comedy, the only way to do this will be for you to go to
 England, to spend three years in London, to make yourself master of the
 English tongue, and to frequent the playhouse every night.  I receive but
 little pleasure from the perusal of Aristophanes and Plautus, and for
 this reason, because I am neither a Greek nor a Roman.  The delicacy of
 the humour, the allusion, the _a propos_--all these are lost to a
 foreigner.
 
 But it is different with respect to tragedy, this treating only of
 exalted passions and heroical follies, which the antiquated errors of
 fable or history have made sacred.  OEdipus, Electra, and such-like
 characters, may with as much propriety be treated of by the Spaniards,
 the English, or us, as by the Greeks.  But true comedy is the speaking
 picture of the follies and ridiculous foibles of a nation; so that he
 only is able to judge of the painting who is perfectly acquainted with
 the people it represents.
 
 
 
 LETTER XX.--ON SUCH OF THE NOBILITY AS CULTIVATE THE BELLES LETTRES
 
 
 There once was a time in France when the polite arts were cultivated by
 persons of the highest rank in the state.  The courtiers particularly
 were conversant in them, although indolence, a taste for trifles, and a
 passion for intrigue, were the divinities of the country.  The Court
 methinks at this time seems to have given into a taste quite opposite to
 that of polite literature, but perhaps the mode of thinking may be
 revived in a little time.  The French are of so flexible a disposition,
 may be moulded into such a variety of shapes, that the monarch needs but
 command and he is immediately obeyed.  The English generally think, and
 learning is had in greater honour among them than in our country--an
 advantage that results naturally from the form of their government.  There
 are about eight hundred persons in England who have a right to speak in
 public, and to support the interest of the kingdom; and near five or six
 thousand may in their turns aspire to the same honour.  The whole nation
 set themselves up as judges over these, and every man has the liberty of
 publishing his thoughts with regard to public affairs, which shows that
 all the people in general are indispensably obliged to cultivate their
 understandings.  In England the governments of Greece and Rome are the
 subject of every conversation, so that every man is under a necessity of
 perusing such authors as treat of them, how disagreeable soever it may be
 to him; and this study leads naturally to that of polite literature.
 Mankind in general speak well in their respective professions.  What is
 the reason why our magistrates, our lawyers, our physicians, and a great
 number of the clergy, are abler scholars, have a finer taste, and more
 wit, than persons of all other professions?  The reason is, because their
 condition of life requires a cultivated and enlightened mind, in the same
 manner as a merchant is obliged to be acquainted with his traffic.  Not
 long since an English nobleman, who was very young, came to see me at
 Paris on his return from Italy.  He had written a poetical description of
 that country, which, for delicacy and politeness, may vie with anything
 we meet with in the Earl of Rochester, or in our Chaulieu, our Sarrasin,
 or Chapelle.  The translation I have given of it is so inexpressive of
 the strength and delicate humour of the original, that I am obliged
 seriously to ask pardon of the author and of all who understand English.
 However, as this is the only method I have to make his lordship's verses
 known, I shall here present you with them in our tongue:--
 
    "Qu'ay je donc vu dans l'Italie?
    Orgueil, astuce, et pauvrete,
    Grands complimens, peu de bonte
    Et beaucoup de ceremonie.
 
    "L'extravagante comedie
    Que souvent l'Inquisition
    Vent qu'on nomme religion
    Mais qu'ici nous nommons folie.
 
    "La Nature en vain bienfaisante
    Vent enricher ses lieux charmans,
    Des pretres la main desolante
    Etouffe ses plus beaux presens.
 
    "Les monsignors, soy disant Grands,
    Seuls dans leurs palais magnifiques
    Y sont d'illustres faineants,
    Sans argent, et sans domestiques.
 
    "Pour les petits, sans liberte,
    Martyrs du joug qui les domine,
    Ils ont fait voeu de pauvrete,
    Priant Dieu par oisivete
    Et toujours jeunant par famine.
 
    "Ces beaux lieux du Pape benis
    Semblent habitez par les diables;
    Et les habitans miserables
    Sont damnes dans le Paradis."
 
 
 
 LETTER XXI.--ON THE EARL OF ROCHESTER AND MR. WALLER
 
 
 The Earl of Rochester's name is universally known.  Mr. de St. Evremont
 has made very frequent mention of him, but then he has represented this
 famous nobleman in no other light than as the man of pleasure, as one who
 was the idol of the fair; but, with regard to myself, I would willingly
 describe in him the man of genius, the great poet.  Among other pieces
 which display the shining imagination, his lordship only could boast he
 wrote some satires on the same subjects as those our celebrated Boileau
 made choice of.  I do not know any better method of improving the taste
 than to compare the productions of such great geniuses as have exercised
 their talent on the same subject.  Boileau declaims as follows against
 human reason in his "Satire on Man:"
 
    "Cependant a le voir plein de vapeurs legeres,
    Soi-meme se bercer de ses propres chimeres,
    Lui seul de la nature est la baze et l'appui,
    Et le dixieme ciel ne tourne que pour lui.
    De tous les animaux il est ici le maitre;
    Qui pourroit le nier, poursuis tu?  Moi peut-etre.
    Ce maitre pretendu qui leur donne des loix,
    Ce roi des animaux, combien a-t'il de rois?"
 
    "Yet, pleased with idle whimsies of his brain,
    And puffed with pride, this haughty thing would fain
    Be think himself the only stay and prop
    That holds the mighty frame of Nature up.
    The skies and stars his properties must seem,
    * * *
    Of all the creatures he's the lord, he cries.
    * * *
    And who is there, say you, that dares deny
    So owned a truth?  That may be, sir, do I.
    * * *
    This boasted monarch of the world who awes
    The creatures here, and with his nod gives laws
    This self-named king, who thus pretends to be
    The lord of all, how many lords has he?"
 
    OLDHAM, _a little altered_.
 
 The Lord Rochester expresses himself, in his "Satire against Man," in
 pretty near the following manner.  But I must first desire you always to
 remember that the versions I give you from the English poets are written
 with freedom and latitude, and that the restraint of our versification,
 and the delicacies of the French tongue, will not allow a translator to
 convey into it the licentious impetuosity and fire of the English
 numbers:--
 
    "Cet esprit que je hais, cet esprit plein d'erreur,
    Ce n'est pas ma raison, c'est la tienne, docteur.
    C'est la raison frivole, inquiete, orgueilleuse
    Des sages animaux, rivale dedaigneuse,
    Qui croit entr'eux et l'Ange, occuper le milieu,
    Et pense etre ici bas l'image de son Dieu.
    Vil atome imparfait, qui croit, doute, dispute
    Rampe, s'eleve, tombe, et nie encore sa chute,
    Qui nous dit je suis libre, en nous montrant ses fers,
    Et dont l'oeil trouble et faux, croit percer l'univers.
    Allez, reverends fous, bienheureux fanatiques,
    Compilez bien l'amas de vos riens scholastiques,
    Peres de visions, et d'enigmes sacres,
    Auteurs du labirinthe, ou vous vous egarez.
    Allez obscurement eclaircir vos misteres,
    Et courez dans l'ecole adorer vos chimeres.
    Il est d'autres erreurs, il est de ces devots
    Condamne par eux memes a l'ennui du repos.
    Ce mystique encloitre, fier de son indolence
    Tranquille, au sein de Dieu.  Que peut il faire?  Il pense.
    Non, tu ne penses point, miserable, tu dors:
    Inutile a la terre, et mis au rang des morts.
    Ton esprit enerve croupit dans la molesse.
    Reveille toi, sois homme, et sors de ton ivresse.
    L'homme est ne pour agir, et tu pretens penser?"  &c.
 
 The original runs thus:--
 
    "Hold mighty man, I cry all this we know,
    And 'tis this very reason I despise,
    This supernatural gift that makes a mite
    Think he's the image of the Infinite;
    Comparing his short life, void of all rest,
    To the eternal and the ever blest.
    This busy, puzzling stirrer up of doubt,
    That frames deep mysteries, then finds them out,
    Filling, with frantic crowds of thinking fools,
    Those reverend bedlams, colleges, and schools;
    Borne on whose wings each heavy sot can pierce
    The limits of the boundless universe.
    So charming ointments make an old witch fly,
    And bear a crippled carcase through the sky.
    'Tis this exalted power, whose business lies
    In nonsense and impossibilities.
    This made a whimsical philosopher
    Before the spacious world his tub prefer;
    And we have modern cloistered coxcombs, who
    Retire to think, 'cause they have naught to do.
    But thoughts are given for action's government,
    Where action ceases, thought's impertinent."
 
 Whether these ideas are true or false, it is certain they are expressed
 with an energy and fire which form the poet.  I shall be very far from
 attempting to examine philosophically into these verses, to lay down the
 pencil, and take up the rule and compass on this occasion; my only design
 in this letter being to display the genius of the English poets, and
 therefore I shall continue in the same view.
 
 The celebrated Mr. Waller has been very much talked of in France, and Mr.
 De la Fontaine, St. Evremont, and Bayle have written his eulogium, but
 still his name only is known.  He had much the same reputation in London
 as Voiture had in Paris, and in my opinion deserved it better.  Voiture
 was born in an age that was just emerging from barbarity; an age that was
 still rude and ignorant, the people of which aimed at wit, though they
 had not the least pretensions to it, and sought for points and conceits
 instead of sentiments.  Bristol stones are more easily found than
 diamonds.  Voiture, born with an easy and frivolous, genius, was the
 first who shone in this aurora of French literature.  Had he come into
 the world after those great geniuses who spread such a glory over the age
 of Louis XIV., he would either have been unknown, would have been
 despised, or would have corrected his style.  Boileau applauded him, but
 it was in his first satires, at a time when the taste of that great poet
 was not yet formed.  He was young, and in an age when persons form a
 judgment of men from their reputation, and not from their writings.
 Besides, Boileau was very partial both in his encomiums and his censures.
 He applauded Segrais, whose works nobody reads; he abused Quinault, whose
 poetical pieces every one has got by heart; and is wholly silent upon La
 Fontaine.  Waller, though a better poet than Voiture, was not yet a
 finished poet.  The graces breathe in such of Waller's works as are writ
 in a tender strain; but then they are languid through negligence, and
 often disfigured with false thoughts.  The English had not in his time
 attained the art of correct writing.  But his serious compositions
 exhibit a strength and vigour which could not have been expected from the
 softness and effeminacy of his other pieces.  He wrote an elegy on Oliver
 Cromwell, which, with all its faults, is nevertheless looked upon as a
 masterpiece.  To understand this copy of verses you are to know that the
 day Oliver died was remarkable for a great storm.  His poem begins in
 this manner:--
 
    "Il n'est plus, s'en est fait, soumettons nous au sort,
    Le ciel a signale ce jour par des tempetes,
    Et la voix des tonnerres eclatant sur nos tetes
    Vient d'annoncer sa mort.
 
    "Par ses derniers soupirs il ebranle cet ile;
    Cet ile que son bras fit trembler tant de fois,
    Quand dans le cours de ses exploits,
    Il brisoit la tete des Rois,
    Et soumettoit un peuple a son joug seul docile.
 
    "Mer tu t'en es trouble; O mer tes flots emus
    Semblent dire en grondant aux plus lointains rivages
    Que l'effroi de la terre et ton maitre n'est plus.
 
    "Tel au ciel autrefois s'envola Romulus,
    Tel il quitta la Terre, au milieu des orages,
    Tel d'un peuple guerrier il recut les homages;
    Obei dans sa vie, sa mort adore,
    Son palais fut un Temple," &c.
 
 * * * * *
 
    "We must resign! heaven his great soul does claim
    In storms as loud as his immortal fame;
    His dying groans, his last breath shakes our isle,
    And trees uncut fall for his funeral pile:
    About his palace their broad roots are tost
    Into the air; so Romulus was lost!
    New Rome in such a tempest missed her king,
    And from obeying fell to worshipping.
    On OEta's top thus Hercules lay dead,
    With ruined oaks and pines about him spread.
    Nature herself took notice of his death,
    And, sighing, swelled the sea with such a breath,
    That to remotest shores the billows rolled,
    Th' approaching fate of his great ruler told."
 
    WALLER.
 
 It was this elogium that gave occasion to the reply (taken notice of in
 Bayle's Dictionary), which Waller made to King Charles II.  This king, to
 whom Waller had a little before (as is usual with bards and monarchs)
 presented a copy of verses embroidered with praises, reproached the poet
 for not writing with so much energy and fire as when he had applauded the
 Usurper (meaning Oliver).  "Sir," replied Waller to the king, "we poets
 succeed better in fiction than in truth."  This answer was not so sincere
 as that which a Dutch ambassador made, who, when the same monarch
 complained that his masters paid less regard to him than they had done to
 Cromwell.  "Ah, sir!" says the Ambassador, "Oliver was quite another
 man--"  It is not my intent to give a commentary on Waller's character,
 nor on that of any other person; for I consider men after their death in
 no other light than as they were writers, and wholly disregard everything
 else.  I shall only observe that Waller, though born in a court, and to
 an estate of five or six thousand pounds sterling a year, was never so
 proud or so indolent as to lay aside the happy talent which Nature had
 indulged him.  The Earls of Dorset and Roscommon, the two Dukes of
 Buckingham, the Lord Halifax, and so many other noblemen, did not think
 the reputation they obtained of very great poets and illustrious writers,
 any way derogatory to their quality.  They are more glorious for their
 works than for their titles.  These cultivated the polite arts with as
 much assiduity as though they had been their whole dependence.
 
 They also have made learning appear venerable in the eyes of the vulgar,
 who have need to be led in all things by the great; and who,
 nevertheless, fashion their manners less after those of the nobility (in
 England I mean) than in any other country in the world.
 
 
 
 LETTER XXII.--ON MR. POPE AND SOME OTHER FAMOUS POETS
 
 
 I intended to treat of Mr. Prior, one of the most amiable English poets,
 whom you saw Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary at Paris in 1712.  I
 also designed to have given you some idea of the Lord Roscommon's and the
 Lord Dorset's muse; but I find that to do this I should be obliged to
 write a large volume, and that, after much pains and trouble, you would
 have but an imperfect idea of all those works.  Poetry is a kind of music
 in which a man should have some knowledge before he pretends to judge of
 it.  When I give you a translation of some passages from those foreign
 poets, I only prick down, and that imperfectly, their music; but then I
 cannot express the taste of their harmony.
 
 There is one English poem especially which I should despair of ever
 making you understand, the title whereof is "Hudibras."  The subject of
 it is the Civil War in the time of the grand rebellion, and the
 principles and practice of the Puritans are therein ridiculed.  It is Don
 Quixote, it is our "Satire Menippee" blended together.  I never found so
 much wit in one single book as in that, which at the same time is the
 most difficult to be translated.  Who would believe that a work which
 paints in such lively and natural colours the several foibles and follies
 of mankind, and where we meet with more sentiments than words, should
 baffle the endeavours of the ablest translator?  But the reason of this
 is, almost every part of it alludes to particular incidents.  The clergy
 are there made the principal object of ridicule, which is understood but
 by few among the laity.  To explain this a commentary would be requisite,
 and humour when explained is no longer humour.  Whoever sets up for a
 commentator of smart sayings and repartees is himself a blockhead.  This
 is the reason why the works of the ingenious Dean Swift, who has been
 called the English Rabelais, will never be well understood in France.
 This gentleman has the honour (in common with Rabelais) of being a
 priest, and, like him, laughs at everything; but, in my humble opinion,
 the title of the English Rabelais which is given the dean is highly
 derogatory to his genius.  The former has interspersed his unaccountably-
 fantastic and unintelligible book with the most gay strokes of humour;
 but which, at the same time, has a greater proportion of impertinence.  He
 has been vastly lavish of erudition, of smut, and insipid raillery.  An
 agreeable tale of two pages is purchased at the expense of whole volumes
 of nonsense.  There are but few persons, and those of a grotesque taste,
 who pretend to understand and to esteem this work; for, as to the rest of
 the nation, they laugh at the pleasant and diverting touches which are
 found in Rabelais and despise his book.  He is looked upon as the prince
 of buffoons.  The readers are vexed to think that a man who was master of
 so much wit should have made so wretched a use of it; he is an
 intoxicated philosopher who never wrote but when he was in liquor.
 
 Dean Swift is Rabelais in his senses, and frequenting the politest
 company.  The former, indeed, is not so gay as the latter, but then he
 possesses all the delicacy, the justness, the choice, the good taste, in
 all which particulars our giggling rural Vicar Rabelais is wanting.  The
 poetical numbers of Dean Swift are of a singular and almost inimitable
 taste; true humour, whether in prose or verse, seems to be his peculiar
 talent; but whoever is desirous of understanding him perfectly must visit
 the island in which he was born.
 
 It will be much easier for you to form an idea of Mr. Pope's works.  He
 is, in my opinion, the most elegant, the most correct poet; and, at the
 same time, the most harmonious (a circumstance which redounds very much
 to the honour of this muse) that England ever gave birth to.  He has
 mellowed the harsh sounds of the English trumpet to the soft accents of
 the flute.  His compositions may be easily translated, because they are
 vastly clear and perspicuous; besides, most of his subjects are general,
 and relative to all nations.
 
 His "Essay on Criticism" will soon be known in France by the translation
 which l'Abbe de Resnel has made of it.
 
 Here is an extract from his poem entitled the "Rape of the Lock," which I
 just now translated with the latitude I usually take on these occasions;
 for, once again, nothing can be more ridiculous than to translate a poet
 literally:--
 
    "Umbriel, a l'instant, vieil gnome rechigne,
    Va d'une aile pesante et d'un air renfrogne
    Chercher en murmurant la caverne profonde,
    Ou loin des doux raions que repand l'oeil du monde
    La Deesse aux Vapeurs a choisi son sejour,
    Les Tristes Aquilons y sifflent a l'entour,
    Et le souffle mal sain de leur aride haleine
    Y porte aux environs la fievre et la migraine.
    Sur un riche sofa derriere un paravent
    Loin des flambeaux, du bruit, des parleurs et du vent,
    La quinteuse deesse incessamment repose,
    Le coeur gros de chagrin, sans en savoir la cause.
    N'aiant pense jamais, l'esprit toujours trouble,
    L'oeil charge, le teint pale, et l'hypocondre enfle.
    La medisante Envie, est assise aupres d'elle,
    Vieil spectre feminin, decrepite pucelle,
    Avec un air devot dechirant son prochain,
    Et chansonnant les Gens l'Evangile a la main.
    Sur un lit plein de fleurs negligemment panchee
    Une jeune beaute non loin d'elle est couchee,
    C'est l'Affectation qui grassaie en parlant,
    Ecoute sans entendre, et lorgne en regardant.
    Qui rougit sans pudeur, et rit de tout sans joie,
    De cent maux differens pretend qu'elle est la proie;
    Et pleine de sante sous le rouge et le fard,
    Se plaint avec molesse, et se pame avec art."
 
    "Umbriel, a dusky, melancholy sprite
    As ever sullied the fair face of light,
    Down to the central earth, his proper scene,
    Repairs to search the gloomy cave of Spleen.
    Swift on his sooty pinions flits the gnome,
    And in a vapour reached the dismal dome.
    No cheerful breeze this sullen region knows,
    The dreaded east is all the wind that blows.
    Here, in a grotto, sheltered close from air,
    And screened in shades from day's detested glare,
    She sighs for ever on her pensive bed,
    Pain at her side, and Megrim at her head,
    Two handmaids wait the throne.  Alike in place,
    But differing far in figure and in face,
    Here stood Ill-nature, like an ancient maid,
    Her wrinkled form in black and white arrayed;
    With store of prayers for mornings, nights, and noons,
    Her hand is filled; her bosom with lampoons.
    There Affectation, with a sickly mien,
    Shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen,
    Practised to lisp, and hang the head aside,
    Faints into airs, and languishes with pride;
    On the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe,
    Wrapt in a gown, for sickness and for show."
 
 This extract, in the original (not in the faint translation I have given
 you of it), may be compared to the description of _la Molesse_ (softness
 or effeminacy), in Boileau's "Lutrin."
 
 Methinks I now have given you specimens enough from the English poets.  I
 have made some transient mention of their philosophers, but as for good
 historians among them, I don't know of any; and, indeed, a Frenchman was
 forced to write their history.  Possibly the English genius, which is
 either languid or impetuous, has not yet acquired that unaffected
 eloquence, that plain but majestic air which history requires.  Possibly
 too, the spirit of party which exhibits objects in a dim and confused
 light may have sunk the credit of their historians.  One half of the
 nation is always at variance with the other half.  I have met with people
 who assured me that the Duke of Marlborough was a coward, and that Mr.
 Pope was a fool; just as some Jesuits in France declare Pascal to have
 been a man of little or no genius, and some Jansenists affirm Father
 Bourdaloue to have been a mere babbler.  The Jacobites consider Mary
 Queen of Scots as a pious heroine, but those of an opposite party look
 upon her as a prostitute, an adulteress, a murderer.  Thus the English
 have memorials of the several reigns, but no such thing as a history.
 There is, indeed, now living, one Mr. Gordon (the public are obliged to
 him for a translation of Tacitus), who is very capable of writing the
 history of his own country, but Rapin de Thoyras got the start of him.  To
 conclude, in my opinion the English have not such good historians as the
 French have no such thing as a real tragedy, have several delightful
 comedies, some wonderful passages in certain of their poems, and boast of
 philosophers that are worthy of instructing mankind.  The English have
 reaped very great benefit from the writers of our nation, and therefore
 we ought (since they have not scrupled to be in our debt) to borrow from
 them.  Both the English and we came after the Italians, who have been our
 instructors in all the arts, and whom we have surpassed in some.  I
 cannot determine which of the three nations ought to be honoured with the
 palm; but happy the writer who could display their various merits.
 
 
 
 LETTER XXIII.--ON THE REGARD THAT OUGHT TO BE SHOWN TO MEN OF LETTERS
 
 
 Neither the English nor any other people have foundations established in
 favour of the polite arts like those in France.  There are Universities
 in most countries, but it is in France only that we meet with so
 beneficial an encouragement for astronomy and all parts of the
 mathematics, for physic, for researches into antiquity, for painting,
 sculpture, and architecture.  Louis XIV. has immortalised his name by
 these several foundations, and this immortality did not cost him two
 hundred thousand livres a year.
 
 I must confess that one of the things I very much wonder at is, that as
 the Parliament of Great Britain have promised a reward of 20,000 pounds
 sterling to any person who may discover the longitude, they should never
 have once thought to imitate Louis XIV. in his munificence with regard to
 the arts and sciences.
 
 Merit, indeed, meets in England with rewards of another kind, which
 redound more to the honour of the nation.  The English have so great a
 veneration for exalted talents, that a man of merit in their country is
 always sure of making his fortune.  Mr. Addison in France would have been
 elected a member of one of the academies, and, by the credit of some
 women, might have obtained a yearly pension of twelve hundred livres, or
 else might have been imprisoned in the Bastile, upon pretence that
 certain strokes in his tragedy of _Cato_ had been discovered which
 glanced at the porter of some man in power.  Mr. Addison was raised to
 the post of Secretary of State in England.  Sir Isaac Newton was made
 Master of the Royal Mint.  Mr. Congreve had a considerable employment.
 Mr. Prior was Plenipotentiary.  Dr. Swift is Dean of St. Patrick in
 Dublin, and is more revered in Ireland than the Primate himself.  The
 religion which Mr. Pope professes excludes him, indeed, from preferments
 of every kind, but then it did not prevent his gaining two hundred
 thousand livres by his excellent translation of Homer.  I myself saw a
 long time in France the author of _Rhadamistus_ ready to perish for
 hunger.  And the son of one of the greatest men our country ever gave
 birth to, and who was beginning to run the noble career which his father
 had set him, would have been reduced to the extremes of misery had he not
 been patronised by Monsieur Fagon.
 
 But the circumstance which mostly encourages the arts in England is the
 great veneration which is paid them.  The picture of the Prime Minister
 hangs over the chimney of his own closet, but I have seen that of Mr.
 Pope in twenty noblemen's houses.  Sir Isaac Newton was revered in his
 lifetime, and had a due respect paid to him after his death; the greatest
 men in the nation disputing who should have the honour of holding up his
 pall.  Go into Westminster Abbey, and you will find that what raises the
 admiration of the spectator is not the mausoleums of the English kings,
 but the monuments which the gratitude of the nation has erected to
 perpetuate the memory of those illustrious men who contributed to its
 glory.  We view their statues in that abbey in the same manner as those
 of Sophocles, Plato, and other immortal personages were viewed in Athens;
 and I am persuaded that the bare sight of those glorious monuments has
 fired more than one breast, and been the occasion of their becoming great
 men.
 
 The English have even been reproached with paying too extravagant honours
 to mere merit, and censured for interring the celebrated actress Mrs.
 Oldfield in Westminster Abbey, with almost the same pomp as Sir Isaac
 Newton.  Some pretend that the English had paid her these great funeral
 honours, purposely to make us more strongly sensible of the barbarity and
 injustice which they object to us, for having buried Mademoiselle Le
 Couvreur ignominiously in the fields.
 
 But be assured from me, that the English were prompted by no other
 principle in burying Mrs. Oldfield in Westminster Abbey than their good
 sense.  They are far from being so ridiculous as to brand with infamy an
 art which has immortalised a Euripides and a Sophocles; or to exclude
 from the body of their citizens a set of people whose business is to set
 off with the utmost grace of speech and action those pieces which the
 nation is proud of.
 
 Under the reign of Charles I. and in the beginning of the civil wars
 raised by a number of rigid fanatics, who at last were the victims to it;
 a great many pieces were published against theatrical and other shows,
 which were attacked with the greater virulence because that monarch and
 his queen, daughter to Henry I. of France, were passionately fond of
 them.
 
 One Mr. Prynne, a man of most furiously scrupulous principles, who would
 have thought himself damned had he worn a cassock instead of a short
 cloak, and have been glad to see one-half of mankind cut the other to
 pieces for the glory of God, and the _Propaganda Fide_; took it into his
 head to write a most wretched satire against some pretty good comedies,
 which were exhibited very innocently every night before their majesties.
 He quoted the authority of the Rabbis, and some passages from St.
 Bonaventure, to prove that the OEdipus of Sophocles was the work of the
 evil spirit; that Terence was excommunicated _ipso facto_; and added,
 that doubtless Brutus, who was a very severe Jansenist, assassinated
 Julius Caesar for no other reason but because he, who was Pontifex
 Maximus, presumed to write a tragedy the subject of which was OEdipus.
 Lastly, he declared that all who frequented the theatre were
 excommunicated, as they thereby renounced their baptism.  This was
 casting the highest insult on the king and all the royal family; and as
 the English loved their prince at that time, they could not bear to hear
 a writer talk of excommunicating him, though they themselves afterwards
 cut his head off.  Prynne was summoned to appear before the Star Chamber;
 his wonderful book, from which Father Le Brun stole his, was sentenced to
 be burnt by the common hangman, and himself to lose his ears.  His trial
 is now extant.
 
 The Italians are far from attempting to cast a blemish on the opera, or
 to excommunicate Signor Senesino or Signora Cuzzoni.  With regard to
 myself, I could presume to wish that the magistrates would suppress I
 know not what contemptible pieces written against the stage.  For when
 the English and Italians hear that we brand with the greatest mark of
 infamy an art in which we excel; that we excommunicate persons who
 receive salaries from the king; that we condemn as impious a spectacle
 exhibited in convents and monasteries; that we dishonour sports in which
 Louis XIV. and Louis XV., performed as actors; that we give the title of
 the devil's works to pieces which are received by magistrates of the most
 severe character, and represented before a virtuous queen; when, I say,
 foreigners are told of this insolent conduct, this contempt for the royal
 authority, and this Gothic rusticity which some presume to call Christian
 severity, what an idea must they entertain of our nation?  And how will
 it be possible for them to conceive, either that our laws give a sanction
 to an art which is declared infamous, or that some persons dare to stamp
 with infamy an art which receives a sanction from the laws, is rewarded
 by kings, cultivated and encouraged by the greatest men, and admired by
 whole nations?  And that Father Le Brun's impertinent libel against the
 stage is seen in a bookseller's shop, standing the very next to the
 immortal labours of Racine, of Corneille, of Moliere, &c.
 
 
 
 LETTER XXIV.--ON THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND OTHER ACADEMIES
 
 
 The English had an Academy of Sciences many years before us, but then it
 is not under such prudent regulations as ours, the only reason of which
 very possibly is, because it was founded before the Academy of Paris; for
 had it been founded after, it would very probably have adopted some of
 the sage laws of the former and improved upon others.
 
 Two things, and those the most essential to man, are wanting in the Royal
 Society of London, I mean rewards and laws.  A seat in the Academy at
 Paris is a small but secure fortune to a geometrician or a chemist; but
 this is so far from being the case at London, that the several members of
 the Royal Society are at a continual, though indeed small expense.  Any
 man in England who declares himself a lover of the mathematics and
 natural philosophy, and expresses an inclination to be a member of the
 Royal Society, is immediately elected into it.  But in France it is not
 enough that a man who aspires to the honour of being a member of the
 Academy, and of receiving the royal stipend, has a love for the sciences;
 he must at the same time be deeply skilled in them; and is obliged to
 dispute the seat with competitors who are so much the more formidable as
 they are fired by a principle of glory, by interest, by the difficulty
 itself; and by that inflexibility of mind which is generally found in
 those who devote themselves to that pertinacious study, the mathematics.
 
 The Academy of Sciences is prudently confined to the study of Nature,
 and, indeed, this is a field spacious enough for fifty or threescore
 persons to range in.  That of London mixes indiscriminately literature
 with physics; but methinks the founding an academy merely for the polite
 arts is more judicious, as it prevents confusion, and the joining, in
 some measure, of heterogeneals, such as a dissertation on the
 head-dresses of the Roman ladies with a hundred or more new curves.
 
 As there is very little order and regularity in the Royal Society, and
 not the least encouragement; and that the Academy of Paris is on a quite
 different foot, it is no wonder that our transactions are drawn up in a
 more just and beautiful manner than those of the English.  Soldiers who
 are under a regular discipline, and besides well paid, must necessarily
 at last perform more glorious achievements than others who are mere
 volunteers.  It must indeed be confessed that the Royal Society boast
 their Newton, but then he did not owe his knowledge and discoveries to
 that body; so far from it, that the latter were intelligible to very few
 of his fellow members.  A genius like that of Sir Isaac belonged to all
 the academies in the world, because all had a thousand things to learn of
 him.
 
 The celebrated Dean Swift formed a design, in the latter end of the late
 Queen's reign, to found an academy for the English tongue upon the model
 of that of the French.  This project was promoted by the late Earl of
 Oxford, Lord High Treasurer, and much more by the Lord Bolingbroke,
 Secretary of State, who had the happy talent of speaking without
 premeditation in the Parliament House with as much purity as Dean Swift
 wrote in his closet, and who would have been the ornament and protector
 of that academy.  Those only would have been chosen members of it whose
 works will last as long as the English tongue, such as Dean Swift, Mr.
 Prior, whom we saw here invested with a public character, and whose fame
 in England is equal to that of La Fontaine in France; Mr. Pope, the
 English Boileau, Mr. Congreve, who may be called their Moliere, and
 several other eminent persons whose names I have forgot; all these would
 have raised the glory of that body to a great height even in its infancy.
 But Queen Anne being snatched suddenly from the world, the Whigs were
 resolved to ruin the protectors of the intended academy, a circumstance
 that was of the most fatal consequence to polite literature.  The members
 of this academy would have had a very great advantage over those who
 first formed that of the French, for Swift, Prior, Congreve, Dryden,
 Pope, Addison, &c. had fixed the English tongue by their writings;
 whereas Chapelain, Colletet, Cassaigne, Faret, Perrin, Cotin, our first
 academicians, were a disgrace to their country; and so much ridicule is
 now attached to their very names, that if an author of some genius in
 this age had the misfortune to be called Chapelain or Cotin, he would be
 under a necessity of changing his name.
 
 One circumstance, to which the English Academy should especially have
 attended, is to have prescribed to themselves occupations of a quite
 different kind from those with which our academicians amuse themselves.  A
 wit of this country asked me for the memoirs of the French Academy.  I
 answered, they have no memoirs, but have printed threescore or fourscore
 volumes in quarto of compliments.  The gentleman perused one or two of
 them, but without being able to understand the style in which they were
 written, though he understood all our good authors perfectly.  "All,"
 says he, "I see in these elegant discourses is, that the member elect
 having assured the audience that his predecessor was a great man, that
 Cardinal Richelieu was a very great man, that the Chancellor Seguier was
 a pretty great man, that Louis XIV. was a more than great man, the
 director answers in the very same strain, and adds, that the member elect
 may also be a sort of great man, and that himself, in quality of
 director, must also have some share in this greatness."
 
 The cause why all these academical discourses have unhappily done so
 little honour to this body is evident enough.  _Vitium est temporis
 potius quam hominis_ (the fault is owing to the age rather than to
 particular persons).  It grew up insensibly into a custom for every
 academician to repeat these elogiums at his reception; it was laid down
 as a kind of law that the public should be indulged from time to time the
 sullen satisfaction of yawning over these productions.  If the reason
 should afterwards be sought, why the greatest geniuses who have been
 incorporated into that body have sometimes made the worst speeches, I
 answer, that it is wholly owing to a strong propension, the gentlemen in
 question had to shine, and to display a thread-bare, worn-out subject in
 a new and uncommon light.  The necessity of saying something, the
 perplexity of having nothing to say, and a desire of being witty, are
 three circumstances which alone are capable of making even the greatest
 writer ridiculous.  These gentlemen, not being able to strike out any new
 thoughts, hunted after a new play of words, and delivered themselves
 without thinking at all: in like manner as people who should seem to chew
 with great eagerness, and make as though they were eating, at the same
 time that they were just starved.
 
 It is a law in the French Academy, to publish all those discourses by
 which only they are known, but they should rather make a law never to
 print any of them.
 
 But the Academy of the _Belles Lettres_ have a more prudent and more
 useful object, which is, to present the public with a collection of
 transactions that abound with curious researches and critiques.  These
 transactions are already esteemed by foreigners; and it were only to be
 wished that some subjects in them had been more thoroughly examined, and
 that others had not been treated at all.  As, for instance, we should
 have been very well satisfied, had they omitted I know not what
 dissertation on the prerogative of the right hand over the left; and some
 others, which, though not published under so ridiculous a title, are yet
 written on subjects that are almost as frivolous and silly.
 
 The Academy of Sciences, in such of their researches as are of a more
 difficult kind and a more sensible use, embrace the knowledge of nature
 and the improvements of the arts.  We may presume that such profound,
 such uninterrupted pursuits as these, such exact calculations, such
 refined discoveries, such extensive and exalted views, will, at last,
 produce something that may prove of advantage to the universe.  Hitherto,
 as we have observed together, the most useful discoveries have been made
 in the most barbarous times.  One would conclude that the business of the
 most enlightened ages and the most learned bodies, is, to argue and
 debate on things which were invented by ignorant people.  We know exactly
 the angle which the sail of a ship is to make with the keel in order to
 its sailing better; and yet Columbus discovered America without having
 the least idea of the property of this angle: however, I am far from
 inferring from hence that we are to confine ourselves merely to a blind
 practice, but happy it were, would naturalists and geometricians unite,
 as much as possible, the practice with the theory.
 
 Strange, but so it is, that those things which reflect the greatest
 honour on the human mind are frequently of the least benefit to it!  A
 man who understands the four fundamental rules of arithmetic, aided by a
 little good sense, shall amass prodigious wealth in trade, shall become a
 Sir Peter Delme, a Sir Richard Hopkins, a Sir Gilbert Heathcote, whilst a
 poor algebraist spends his whole life in searching for astonishing
 properties and relations in numbers, which at the same time are of no
 manner of use, and will not acquaint him with the nature of exchanges.
 This is very nearly the case with most of the arts: there is a certain
 point beyond which all researches serve to no other purpose than merely
 to delight an inquisitive mind.  Those ingenious and useless truths may
 be compared to stars which, by being placed at too great a distance,
 cannot afford us the least light.
 
 With regard to the French Academy, how great a service would they do to
 literature, to the language, and the nation, if, instead of publishing a
 set of compliments annually, they would give us new editions of the
 valuable works written in the age of Louis XIV., purged from the several
 errors of diction which are crept into them.  There are many of these
 errors in Corneille and Moliere, but those in La Fontaine are very
 numerous.  Such as could not be corrected might at least be pointed out.
 By this means, as all the Europeans read those works, they would teach
 them our language in its utmost purity--which, by that means, would be
 fixed to a lasting standard; and valuable French books being then printed
 at the King's expense, would prove one of the most glorious monuments the
 nation could boast.  I have been told that Boileau formerly made this
 proposal, and that it has since been revived by a gentleman eminent for
 his genius, his fine sense, and just taste for criticism; but this
 thought has met with the fate of many other useful projects, of being
 applauded and neglected.

 Publisher's preface.
 
 Voltaire's lengthy correspondences do not contain anything that might
 indicate the period in which _Micromegas_ was published. The engraved
 title of the edition that I believe to be the original displays no
 date. Abbot Trublet, in his _Biography of Fontenelle_, does not
 hesitate to say that _Micromegas_ is directed against Fontenelle; but
 does not speak of the date of publication. I have therefore retained
 that given by the Kehl editions: 1752. However there is an edition
 carrying the date of 1700. Is this date authentic? I would not make
 this claim; far from it. I have therefore followed the Kehl editions,
 in which _Micromegas_ is preceded by this warning:
 
 
 This novel can be seen as an imitation of Gulliver's Travels. It
 contains many allusions.  The dwarf of Saturn is Mr. Fontenelle.
 Despite his gentleness, his carefulness, his philosophy, all of
 which should endear him to Mr. Voltaire, he is linked with the
 enemies of this great man, and appears to share, if not in their
 hate, at least in their preemptive censures. He was deeply hurt by
 the role he played in this novel, and perhaps even more so due to
 the justness, though severe, of the critique; the strong praise
 given elsewhere in the novel only lends more weight to the
 rebukes. The words that end this work do not soften the wounds,
 and the good that is said of the secretary of the academy of Paris
 does not console Mr. Fontenelle for the ridicule that is permitted
 to befall the one at the academy of Saturn.
 
 
 The notes without signature, and those indicated by letters, are
 written by Voltaire.
 
 The notes signed with a K have been written by the Kehl publishers,
 Mr. Condorcet and Mr. Decroix. It is impossible to rigorously
 distinguish between the additions made by these two.
 
 The additions that I have given to the notes of Voltaire or to the
 notes of the Kehl publishers, are separated from the others by a --,
 and are, as they are mine, signed by the initial of my name.

 CHAPTER I.
 
 Voyage of an inhabitant of the Sirius star to the planet Saturn.
 
 
 On one of the planets that orbits the star named Sirius there lived a
 spirited young man, who I had the honor of meeting on the last voyage
 he made to our little ant hill. He was called Micromegas[1], a
 fitting name for anyone so great. He was eight leagues tall, or
 24,000 geometric paces of five feet each.
 
 
 [1] From _micros_, small, and from _megas_, large.  B.
 
 
 Certain geometers[2], always of use to the public, will immediately
 take up their pens, and will find that since Mr. Micromegas,
 inhabitant of the country of Sirius, is 24,000 paces tall, which is
 equivalent to 20,000 feet, and since we citizens of the earth are
 hardly five feet tall, and our sphere 9,000 leagues around; they will
 find, I say, that it is absolutely necessary that the sphere that
 produced him was 21,600,000 times greater in circumference than our
 little Earth. Nothing in nature is simpler or more orderly. The
 sovereign states of Germany or Italy, which one can traverse in a
 half hour, compared to the empires of Turkey, Moscow, or China, are
 only feeble reflections of the prodigious differences that nature has
 placed in all beings.
 
 
 [2] This is how the text reads in the first editions. Others, in
 place of "geometers," put "algebraists."  B.
 
 
 His excellency's size being as great as I have said, all our
 sculptors and all our painters will agree without protest that his
 belt would have been 50,000 feet around, which gives him very good
 proportions.[3] His nose taking up one third of his attractive
 face, and his attractive face taking up one seventh of his attractive
 body, it must be admitted that the nose of the Sirian is 6,333 feet
 plus a fraction; which is manifest.
 
 
 [3] I restore this sentence in accordance with the first editions.
 B.
 
 
 As for his mind, it is one of the most cultivated that we have. He
 knows many things. He invented some of them. He was not even 250
 years old when he studied, as is customary, at the most celebrated[4]
 colleges of his planet, where he managed to figure out by pure
 willpower more than 50 of Euclid's propositions. That makes 18 more
 than Blaise Pascal, who, after having figured out 32 while screwing
 around, according to his sister's reports, later became a fairly
 mediocre geometer[5] and a very bad metaphysician. Towards his 450th
 year, near the end of his infancy, he dissected many small insects no
 more than 100 feet in diameter, which would evade ordinary
 microscopes. He wrote a very curious book about this, and it gave him
 some income. The mufti of his country, an extremely ignorant
 worrywart, found some suspicious, rash[6], disagreeable, and
 heretical propositions in the book, smelled heresy, and pursued it
 vigorously; it was a matter of finding out whether the substantial
 form of the fleas of Sirius were of the same nature as those of the
 snails. Micromegas gave a spirited defense; he brought in some women
 to testify in his favor; the trial lasted 220 years. Finally the
 mufti had the book condemned by jurisconsults who had not read it,
 and the author was ordered not to appear in court for 800 years[7].
 
 
 [4] In place of "the most celebrated" that one finds in the first
 edition, subsequent editions read "some jesuit."  B.
 
 [5] Pascal became a very great geometer, not in the same class as
 those that contributed to the progress of science with great
 discoveries, like Descartes, Newton, but certainly ranked among
 the geometers, whose works display a genius of the first order. K.
 
 [6]  The edition that I believe to be original reads: "rash,
 smelling heresy." The present text is dated 1756.  B.
 
 [7] Mr. Voltaire had been persecuted by the theatin Boyer for
 having stated in his _Letters on the English_ that our souls
 develop at the same time as our organs, just like the souls of
 animals.  K.
 
 
 He was thereby dealt the minor affliction of being banished from a
 court that consisted of nothing but harassment and pettiness. He
 wrote an amusing song at the expense of the mufti, which the latter
 hardly noticed; and he took to voyaging from planet to planet in
 order to develop his heart and mind[8], as the saying goes. Those
 that travel only by stage coach or sedan will probably be surprised
 learn of the carriage of this vessel; for we, on our little pile of
 mud, can only conceive of that to which we are accustomed. Our
 voyager was very familiar with the laws of gravity and with all the
 other attractive and repulsive forces. He utilized them so well that,
 whether with the help of a ray of sunlight or some comet, he jumped
 from globe to globe like a bird vaulting itself from branch to
 branch. He quickly spanned the Milky Way, and I am obliged to report
 that he never saw, throughout the stars it is made up of, the
 beautiful empyrean sky that the vicar Derham[9] boasts of having seen
 at the other end of his telescope. I do not claim that Mr. Derham has
 poor eyesight, God forbid! But Micromegas was on site, which makes
 him a reliable witness, and I do not want to contradict anyone.
 Micromegas, after having toured around, arrived at the planet Saturn.
 As accustomed as he was to seeing new things, he could not, upon
 seeing the smallness of the planet and its inhabitants, stop himself
 from smiling with the superiority that occasionally escapes the
 wisest of us. For in the end Saturn is hardly nine times bigger than
 Earth, and the citizens of this country are dwarfs, no more than a
 thousand fathoms tall, or somewhere around there. He and his men
 poked fun at them at first, like Italian musicians laughing at the
 music of Lully when he comes to France. But, as the Sirian had a good
 heart, he understood very quickly that a thinking being is not
 necessarily ridiculous just because he is only 6,000 feet tall. He
 got to know the Saturnians after their shock wore off. He built a
 strong friendship with the secretary of the academy of Saturn, a
 spirited man who had not invented anything, to tell the truth, but
 who understood the inventions of others very well, and who wrote some
 passable verses and carried out some complicated calculations. I will
 report here, for the reader's satisfaction, a singular conversation
 that Micromegas had with the secretary one day.
 
 
 [8]  See my note, page 110.  B.  [this note, in Zadig, says: "This
 line is mostly written at the expense of Rollin, who often employs
 these expressions in his _Treatise on Studies_. Voltaire returns
 to it often: see, in the present volume, chapter I of Micromegas,
 and in volume XXXIV, chapter XI of _The Man of Forty Crowns_,
 chapter IX of _The White Bull_ and volume XI, the second verse of
 song VIII of _The Young Virgin_.  B."]

 works that seek to prove the existence of God through detailing
 the wonders of nature: unfortunately he and his imitators are
 often mistaken in their explanation of these wonders; they rave
 about the wisdom that is revealed in a phenomenon, but one soon
 discovers that the phenomenon is completely different than they
 supposed; so it is only their own fabrications that give them this
 impression of wisdom. This fault, common to all works of its type,
 discredited them. One knows too far in advance that the author
 will end up admiring whatever he has chosen to discuss.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER II.
 
 Conversation between the inhabitant of Sirius and that of Saturn.
 
 
 After his excellency laid himself down to rest the secretary
 approached him.
 
 "You have to admit," said Micromegas, "that nature is extremely
 varied."
 
 "Yes," said the Saturnian, "nature is like a flower bed wherein the
 flowers--"
 
 "Ugh!" said the other, "leave off with flower beds."
 
 The secretary began again. "Nature is like an assembly of blonde and
 brown-haired girls whose jewels--"
 
 "What am I supposed to do with your brown-haired girls?" said the
 other.
 
 "Then she is like a gallery of paintings whose features--"
 
 "Certainly not!" said the voyager. "I say again that nature is like
 nature. Why bother looking for comparisons?"
 
 "To please you," replied the Secretary.
 
 "I do not want to be pleased," answered the voyager. "I want to be
 taught. Tell me how many senses the men of your planet have."
 
 "We only have 72," said the academic, "and we always complain about
 it. Our imagination surpasses our needs. We find that with our 72
 senses, our ring, our five moons, we are too restricted; and in spite
 of all our curiosity and the fairly large number of passions that
 result from our 72 senses, we have plenty of time to get bored."
 
 "I believe it," said Micromegas, "for on our planet we have almost
 1,000 senses; and yet we still have a kind of vague feeling, a sort
 of worry, that warns us that there are even more perfect beings. I
 have traveled a bit; and I have seen mortals that surpass us, some
 far superior. But I have not seen any that desire only what they
 truly need, and who need only what they indulge in. Maybe someday I
 will happen upon a country that lacks nothing; but so far no one has
 given me any word of a place like that."
 
 The Saturnian and the Sirian proceeded to wear themselves out in
 speculating; but after a lot of very ingenious and very dubious
 reasoning, it was necessary to return to the facts.
 
 "How long do you live?" said the Sirian.
 
 "Oh! For a very short time," replied the small man from Saturn.
 
 "Same with us," said the Sirian. "we always complain about it. It
 must be a universal law of nature."
 
 "Alas! We only live through 500 revolutions around the sun," said the
 Saturnian. (This translates to about 15,000 years, by our standards.)
 "You can see yourself that this is to die almost at the moment one is
 born; our existence is a point, our lifespan an instant, our planet
 an atom. Hardly do we begin to learn a little when death arrives,
 before we get any experience. As for me, I do not dare make any
 plans. I see myself as a drop of water in an immense ocean. I am
 ashamed, most of all before you, of how ridiculously I figure in this
 world."
 
 Micromegas replied, "If you were not a philosopher, I would fear
 burdening you by telling you that our lifespan is 700 times longer
 than yours; but you know very well when it is necessary to return
 your body to the elements, and reanimate nature in another form,
 which we call death. When this moment of metamorphosis comes, to have
 lived an eternity or to have lived a day amounts to precisely the
 same thing. I have been to countries where they live a thousand times
 longer than we do, and they also die. But people everywhere have the
 good sense to know their role and to thank the Author of nature. He
 has scattered across this universe a profusion of varieties with a
 kind of admirable uniformity. For example, all the thinking beings
 are different, and all resemble one another in the gift of thought
 and desire. Matter is extended everywhere, but has different
 properties on each planet. How many diverse properties do you count
 in yours?"
 
 "If you mean those properties," said the Saturnian, "without which we
 believe that the planet could not subsist as it is, we count 300 of
 them, like extension, impenetrability, mobility, gravity,
 divisibility, and the rest."
 
 "Apparently," replied the voyager, "this small number suffices for
 what the Creator had in store for your dwelling. I admire his wisdom
 in everything; I see differences everywhere, but also proportion.
 Your planet is small, your inhabitants are as well. You have few
 sensations; your matter has few properties; all this is the work of
 Providence. What color is your sun upon examination?"
 
 "A very yellowish white," said the Saturnian. "And when we divide one
 of its rays, we find that it contains seven colors."
 
 "Our sun strains at red," said the Sirian, "and we have 39 primary
 colors. There is no one sun, among those that I have gotten close to
 that resembles it, just as there is no one face among you that is
 identical to the others."
 
 After numerous questions of this nature, he learned how many
 essentially different substances are found on Saturn. He learned that
 there were only about thirty, like God, space, matter, the beings
 with extension that sense, the beings with extension that sense and
 think, the thinking beings that have no extension; those that are
 penetrable, those that are not, and the rest. The Sirian, whose home
 contained 300 and who had discovered 3,000 of them in his voyages,
 prodigiously surprised the philosopher of Saturn. Finally, after
 having told each other a little of what they knew and a lot of what
 they did not know, after having reasoned over the course of a
 revolution around the sun, they resolved to go on a small
 philosophical voyage together.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER III.
 
 Voyage of the two inhabitants of Sirius and Saturn.
 
 
 Our two philosophers were just ready to take off into Saturn's
 atmosphere with a very nice provision of mathematical instrument when
 the ruler of Saturn, who had heard news of the departure, came in
 tears to remonstrate. She was a pretty, petite brunette who was only
 660 fathoms tall, but who compensated for this small size with many
 other charms.
 
 "Cruelty!" she cried, "after resisting you for 1,500 years, just when
 I was beginning to come around, when I'd spent hardly a hundred[1]
 years in your arms, you leave me to go on a voyage with a giant from
 another world; go, you're only curious, you've never been in love: if
 you were a true Saturnian, you would be faithful. Where are you
 running off to? What do you want? Our five moons are less errant than
 you, our ring less inconsistent. It's over, I will never love anyone
 ever again."
 
 The philosopher embraced her, cried with her, philosopher that he
 was; and the woman, after swooning, went off to console herself with
 the help of one of the dandies of the country.
 
 
 [1] The 1773 edition is the first that reads "a hundred"; all the
 earlier editions read: "two hundred."  B.
 
 
 Our two explorers left all the same; they alighted first on the ring,
 which they found to be fairly flat, as conjectured by an illustrious
 inhabitant of our little sphere[2]; from there they went easily from
 moon to moon. A comet passed by the last; they flew onto it with
 their servants and their instruments. When they had traveled about
 one hundred fifty million leagues, they met with the satellites of
 Jupiter. They stopped at Jupiter and stayed for a week, during which
 time they learned some very wonderful secrets that would have been
 forthcoming in print if not for the inquisition, which found some of
 the propositions to be a little harsh. But I have read the manuscript
 in the library of the illustrious archbishop of...., who with a
 generosity and goodness that is impossible to praise allowed me to
 see his books. I promised him a long article in the first edition of
 Moreri, and I will not forget his children, who give such a great
 hope of perpetuating the race of their illustrious father.
 
 
 [2] Huygens.  See volume XXVI, page 398.  B.
 
 
 But let us now return to our travelers. Upon leaving Jupiter they
 traversed a space of around one hundred million leagues and
 approached the planet Mars, which, as we know, is five times smaller
 than our own; they swung by two moons that cater to this planet but
 have escaped the notice of our astronomers. I know very well that
 Father Castel will write, perhaps even agreeably enough, against the
 existence of these two moons; but I rely on those who reason by
 analogy. These good philosophers know how unlikely it would be for
 Mars, so far from the sun, to have gotten by with less than two
 moons. Whatever the case may be, our explorers found it so small that
 they feared not being able to land on it, and they passed it by like
 two travelers disdainful of a bad village cabaret, pressing on
 towards a neighboring city. But the Sirian and his companion soon
 regretted it. They traveled a long time without finding anything.
 Finally they perceived a small candle, it was earth; this was a
 pitiful sight to those who had just left Jupiter. Nevertheless, from
 fear of further regret, they resolved to touch down. Carried by the
 tail of a comet, and finding an aurora borealis at the ready, they
 started towards it, and arrived at Earth on the northern coast of the
 Baltic sea, July 5, 1737, new style.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER IV.
 
 What happened on planet Earth.
 
 
 After resting for some time they ate two mountains for lunch, which
 their crew fixed up pretty nicely. Then they decided to get to know
 the small country they were in. They went first from north to south.
 The usual stride of the Sirian and his crew was around 30,000 feet.
 The dwarf from Saturn, who clocked in at no more than a thousand
 fathoms, trailed behind, breathing heavily. He had to make twelve
 steps each time the other took a stride; imagine (if it is alright to
 make such a comparison) a very small lapdog following a captain of
 the guards of the Prussian king.
 
 Since our strangers moved fairly rapidly, they circumnavigated the
 globe in 36 hours. The sun, in truth, or rather the Earth, makes a
 similar voyage in a day; but you have to imagine that the going is
 much easier when one turns on one's axis instead of walking on one's
 feet. So there they were, back where they started, after having seen
 the nearly imperceptible pond we call _the Mediterranean_, and the
 other little pool that, under the name _Ocean_, encircles the
 molehill. The dwarf never got in over his knees, and the other hardly
 wet his heels. On their way they did all they could to see whether
 the planet was inhabited or not. They crouched, laid down, felt
 around everywhere; but their eyes and their hands were not
 proportionate to the little beings that crawl here, they could not
 feel in the least any sensation that might lead them to suspect that
 we and our associates, the other inhabitants of this planet, have the
 honor of existing.
 
 The dwarf, who was a bit hasty sometimes, decided straightaway that
 the planet was uninhabited. His first reason was that he had not seen
 anyone. Micromegas politely indicated that this logic was rather
 flawed: "For," said he, "you do not see with your little eyes certain
 stars of the 50th magnitude that I can perceive very distinctly. Do
 you conclude that these stars do not exist?"
 
 "But," said the dwarf, "I felt around a lot."
 
 "But," answered the other, "you have pretty weak senses."
 
 "But," replied the dwarf, "this planet is poorly constructed. It is
 so irregular and has such a ridiculous shape! Everything here seems
 to be in chaos: you see these little rivulets, none of which run in a
 straight line, these pools of water that are neither round, nor
 square, nor oval, nor regular by any measure; all these little pointy
 specks scattered across the earth that grate on my feet? (This was in
 reference to mountains.) Look at its shape again, how it is flat at
 the poles, how it clumsily revolves around the sun in a way that
 necessarily eliminates the climates of the poles? To tell the truth,
 what really makes me think it is uninhabited is that it seems that no
 one of good sense would want to stay."
 
 "Well," said Micromegas, "maybe the inhabitants of this planet are
 not of good sense! But in the end it looks like this may be for a
 reason. Everything appears irregular to you here, you say, because
 everything on Saturn and Jupiter is drawn in straight lines. This
 might be the[1] reason that you are a bit puzzled here. Have I not
 told you that I have continually noticed variety in my travels?"
 
 
 [1] All the editions that precede those of Kehl read: "It might be
 for this"  B.
 
 
 The Saturnian responded to all these points. The dispute might never
 have finished if it were not for Micromegas who, getting worked up,
 had the good luck to break the thread of his diamond necklace. The
 diamonds fell; they were pretty little carats of fairly irregular
 size, of which the largest weighed four hundred pounds and the
 smallest fifty. The dwarf recaptured some of them; bending down for a
 better look, he perceived that these diamonds were cut with the help
 of an excellent microscope. So he took out a small microscope of 160
 feet in diameter and put it up to his eye; and Micromegas took up one
 of 2,005 feet in diameter. They were excellent; but neither one of
 them could see anything right away and had to adjust them. Finally
 the Saturnian saw something elusive that moved in the shallow waters
 of the Baltic sea; it was a whale. He carefully picked it up with his
 little finger and, resting it on the nail of his thumb, showed it to
 the Sirian, who began laughing for a second time at the ludicrously
 small scale of the things on our planet. The Saturnian, persuaded
 that our world was inhabited, figured very quickly that it was
 inhabited only by whales; and as he was very good at reasoning, he
 was determined to infer the origin and evolution of such a small
 atom; whether it had ideas, a will, liberty. Micromegas was confused.
 He examined the animal very patiently and found no reason to believe
 that a soul was lodged in it. The two voyagers were therefore
 inclined to believe that there is no spirit in our home, when with
 the help of the microscope they perceived something as large as a
 whale floating on the Baltic Sea. We know that a flock of
 philosophers was at this time returning from the Arctic Circle, where
 they had made some observations, which no one had dared make up to
 then. The gazettes claimed that their vessel ran aground on the coast
 of Bothnia, and that they were having a lot of difficulty setting
 things straight; but the world never shows its cards. I am going to
 tell how it really happened, artlessly and without bias; which is no
 small thing for an historian.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER V.
 
 Experiments and reasonings of the two voyagers.
 
 
 Micromegas slowly reached his hand towards the place where the object
 had appeared, extended two fingers, and withdrew them for fear of
 being mistaken, then opened and closed them, and skillfully seized
 the vessel that carried these fellows, putting it on his fingernail
 without pressing it too hard for fear of crushing it.
 
 "Here is a very different animal from the first," said the dwarf from
 Saturn.
 
 The Sirian put the so-called animal in the palm of his hand. The
 passengers and the crew, who believed themselves to have been lifted
 up by a hurricane, and who thought they were on some sort of boulder,
 scurried around; the sailors took the barrels of wine, threw them
 overboard onto Micromegas hand, and followed after. The geometers
 took their quadrants, their sextants, two Lappland girls[1], and
 descended onto the Sirian's fingers. They made so much fuss that he
 finally felt something move, tickling his fingers. It was a steel-tipped
 baton being pressed into his index finger. He judged, by this
 tickling, that it had been ejected from some small animal that he was
 holding; but he did not suspect anything else at first. The
 microscope, which could barely distinguish a whale from a boat, could
 not capture anything as elusive as a man. I do not claim to outrage
 anyone's vanity, but I am obliged to ask that important men make an
 observation here. Taking the size of a man to be about five feet, the
 figure we strike on Earth is like that struck by an animal of about
 six hundred thousandths[2] the height of a flea on a ball five feet
 around. Imagine something that can hold the Earth in its hands, and
 which has organs in proportion to ours--and it may very well be that
 there are such things--conceive, I beg of you, what these things
 would think of the battles that allow a vanquisher to take a village
 only to lose it later.
 
 
 [1] See the notes to the speech in verse, "On Moderation" (Volume
 XII), and those of "Russia to Paris" (Volume XIV).  K.
 
 [2] The edition that I take to be original reads "sixty
 thousandths."  B.
 
 
 I do not doubt that if ever some captain of some troop of imposing
 grenadiers reads this work he will increase the size of the hats of
 his troops by at least two imposing feet. But I warn him that it will
 have been done in vain; that he and his will never grow any larger
 than infinitely small.
 
 What marvelous skill it must have taken for our philosopher from
 Sirius to perceive the atoms I have just spoken of. When Leuwenhoek
 and Hartsoeker tinkered with the first or thought they saw the grains
 that make us up, they did not by any means make such an astonishing
 discovery. What pleasure Micromegas felt at seeing these little
 machines move, at examining all their scurrying, at following them in
 their enterprises! how he cried out! with what joy he placed one of
 his microscopes in the hands of his traveling companion!
 
 "I see them," they said at the same time, "look how they are carrying
 loads, stooping, getting up again." They spoke like that, hands
 trembling from the pleasure of seeing such new objects, and from fear
 of losing them. The Saturnian, passing from an excess of incredulity
 to an excess of credulity, thought he saw them mating.
 
 "Ah!" he said. "I have caught nature in the act"[1]. But he was
 fooled by appearances, which happens only too often, whether one is
 using a microscope or not.
 
 
 [1] _j'ai pris la nature sur le fait_. A happy, good-natured turn
 of phrase expressed by Fontenelle upon making some observations of
 natural history.  K.
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER VI.
 
 What happened to them among men.
 
 
 Micromegas, a much better observer than his dwarf, clearly saw that
 the atoms were speaking to each other, and pointed this out to his
 companion, who, ashamed of being mistaken about them reproducing, did
 not want to believe that such a species could communicate. He had the
 gift of language as well as the Sirian. He could not hear the atoms
 talk, and he supposed that they did not speak. Moreover, how could
 these impossibly small beings have vocal organs, and what would they
 have to say? To speak, one must think, more or less; but if they
 think, they must therefore have the equivalent of a soul. But to
 attribute the equivalent of a soul to this species seemed absurd to
 him.
 
 "But," said the Sirian, "you believed right away that they made love.
 Do you believe that one can make love without thinking and without
 uttering one word, or at least without making oneself heard? Do you
 suppose as well that it is more difficult to produce an argument than
 an infant? Both appear to be great mysteries to me."
 
 "I do not dare believe or deny it," said the dwarf. "I have no more
 opinions. We must try to examine these insects and reason after."
 
 "That is very well said," echoed Micromegas, and he briskly took out
 a pair of scissors with which he cut his fingernails, and from the
 parings of his thumbnail he improvised a kind of speaking-trumpet,
 like a vast funnel, and put the end up to his ear. The circumference
 of the funnel enveloped the vessel and the entire crew. The weakest
 voice entered into the circular fibers of the nails in such a way
 that, thanks to his industriousness, the philosopher above could hear
 the drone of our insects below perfectly. In a small number of hours
 he was able to distinguish words, and finally to understand French.
 The dwarf managed to do the same, though with more difficulty. The
 voyagers' surprise redoubled each second. They heard the mites speak
 fairly intelligently. This performance of nature's seemed
 inexplicable to them. You may well believe that the Sirian and the
 dwarf burned with impatience to converse with the atoms. The dwarf
 feared that his thunderous voice, and assuredly Micromegas, would
 deafen the mites without being understood. They had to diminish its
 force. They placed toothpicks in their mouths, whose tapered ends
 fell around the ship. The Sirian put the dwarf on his knees and the
 ship with its crew on a fingernail. He lowered his head and spoke
 softly. Finally, relying on these precautions and many others, he
 began his speech like so:
 
 "Invisible insects, that the hand of the Creator has caused to spring
 up in the abyss of the infinitely small, I thank him for allowing me
 to uncover these seemingly impenetrable secrets. Perhaps those at my
 court would not deign to give you audience, but I mistrust no one,
 and I offer you my protection."
 
 If anyone has ever been surprised, it was the people who heard these
 words. They could not figure out where they were coming from. The
 chaplain of the vessel recited the exorcism prayers, the sailors
 swore, and the philosophers of the vessel constructed systems; but no
 matter what systems they came up with, they could not figure out who
 was talking. The dwarf from Saturn, who had a softer voice than
 Micromegas, told them in a few words what species they were dealing
 with. He told them about the voyage from Saturn, brought them up to
 speed on what Mr. Micromegas was, and after lamenting how small they
 were, asked them if they had always been in this miserable state so
 near nothingness, what they were doing on a globe that appeared to
 belong to whales, whether they were happy, if they reproduced, if
 they had a soul, and a hundred other questions of this nature.
 
 A reasoner among the troop, more daring than the others, and shocked
 that someone might doubt his soul, observed the interlocutor with
 sight-vanes pointed at a quarter circle from two different stations,
 and at the third spoke thusly: "You believe then, Sir, that because
 you are a thousand fathoms tall from head to toe, that you are a--"
 
 "A thousand fathoms!" cried the dwarf. "Good heavens! How could he
 know my height? A thousand fathoms! You cannot mistake him for a
 flea. This atom just measured me! He is a surveyor, he knows my size;
 and I, who can only see him through a microscope, I still do not know
 his!"
 
 "Yes, I measured you," said the physician, "and I will measure your
 large companion as well." The proposition was accepted, his
 excellency laid down flat; for were he to stay upright his head would
 have been among the clouds. Our philosophers planted a great shaft on
 him, in a place that doctor Swift would have named, but that I will
 restrain myself from calling by its name, out of respect for the
 ladies. Next, by a series of triangles linked together, they
 concluded that what they saw was in effect a young man of 120,000
 feet[1].
 
 
 [1]The edition I believe to be original reads, "a beautiful
 young ... of 120,000 feet."  B.
 
 
 So Micromegas delivered these words: "I see more than ever that one
 must not judge anything by its apparent size. Oh God! you who have
 given intelligence to substance that appears contemptible. The
 infinitely small costs you as little as the infinitely large; and if
 it is possible that there are such small beings as these, there may
 just as well be a spirit bigger than those of the superb animals that
 I have seen in the heavens, whose feet alone would cover this
 planet."
 
 One of the philosophers responded that he could certainly imagine
 that there are intelligent beings much smaller than man. He
 recounted, not every fabulous thing Virgil says about bees, but what
 Swammerdam discovered, and what Reaumur has anatomized. He explained
 finally that there are animals that are to bees what bees are to man,
 what the Sirian himself was for the vast animals he had spoken of,
 and what these large animals are to other substances before which
 they looked like atoms. Little by little the conversation became
 interesting, and Micromegas spoke thusly:
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER VII.
 
 Conversation with the men.
 
 
 "Oh intelligent atoms, in which the Eternal Being desired to make
 manifest his skill and his power, you must, no doubt, taste pure joys
 on your planet; for having so little matter, and appearing to be
 entirely spirit, you must live out your life thinking and loving, the
 veritable life of the mind. Nowhere have I seen true bliss, but it is
 here, without a doubt."
 
 At this all the philosophers shook their heads, and one of them, more
 frank than the others, avowed that if one excepts a small number of
 inhabitants held in poor regard, all the rest are an assembly of mad,
 vicious, and wretched people. "We have more substance than is
 necessary," he said, "to do evil, if evil comes from substance; and
 too much spirit, if evil comes from spirit. Did you know, for
 example, that as I am speaking with you[1], there are 100,000 madmen
 of our species wearing hats, killing 100,000 other animals wearing
 turbans, or being massacred by them, and that we have used almost
 surface of the Earth for this purpose since time immemorial?"
 
 
 [1] We saw, at the end of chapter III, that the story occurs in
 1737. Voltaire is referring to the war between the Turks and the
 Russians, from 1736 to 1739.  B.
 
 
 The Sirian shuddered, and asked the reason for these horrible
 quarrels between such puny animals.
 
 "It is a matter," said the philosopher, "of some piles of mud as big
 as your heel[2]. It is not that any of these millions of men that
 slit each other's throats care about this pile of mud. It is only a
 matter of determining if it should belong to a certain man who we
 call 'Sultan,' or to another who we call, for whatever reason,
 'Czar.' Neither one has ever seen nor will ever see the little piece
 of Earth, and almost none of these animals that mutually kill
 themselves have ever seen the animal for which they kill."
 
 
 [2] Crimea, which all the same was not reunited with Russia until
 1783.  B.
 
 
 "Oh! Cruel fate!" cried the Sirian with indignation, "who could
 conceive of this excess of maniacal rage! It makes me want to take
 three steps and crush this whole anthill of ridiculous assassins."
 
 "Do not waste your time," someone responded, "they are working
 towards ruin quickly enough. Know that after ten years only one
 hundredth of these scoundrels will be here. Know that even if they
 have not drawn swords, hunger, fatigue, or intemperance will overtake
 them. Furthermore, it is not they that should be punished, it is
 those sedentary barbarians who from the depths of their offices
 order, while they are digesting their last meal, the massacre of a
 million men, and who subsequently give solemn thanks to God."
 
 The voyager was moved with pity for the small human race, where he
 was discovering such surprising contrasts.
 
 "Since you are amongst the small number of wise men," he told these
 sirs, "and since apparently you do not kill anyone for money, tell
 me, I beg of you, what occupies your time."
 
 "We dissect flies," said the philosopher, "we measure lines, we
 gather figures; we agree with each other on two or three points that
 we do not understand."
 
 It suddenly took the Sirian and the Saturnian's fancy to question
 these thinking atoms, to learn what it was they agreed on.
 
 "What do you measure," said the Saturnian, "from the Dog Star to the
 great star of the Gemini?"
 
 They responded all at once, "thirty-two and a half degrees."
 
 "What do you measure from here to the moon?"
 
 "60 radii of the Earth even."
 
 "How much does your air weigh?"
 
 He thought he had caught them[3], but they all told him that air
 weighed around 900 times less than an identical volume of the purest
 water, and 19,000 times less than a gold ducat. The little dwarf from
 Saturn, surprised at their responses, was tempted to accuse of
 witchcraft the same people he had refused a soul fifteen minutes
 earlier.
 
 
 [3] The edition I believe to be original reads "put them off" in
 place of "caught them."
 
 
 Finally Micromegas said to them, "Since you know what is exterior to
 you so well, you must know what is interior even better. Tell me what
 your soul is, and how you form ideas." The philosophers spoke all at
 once as before, but they were of different views. The oldest cited
 Aristotle, another pronounced the name of Descartes; this one here,
 Malebranche; another Leibnitz; another Locke. An old peripatetic
 spoke up with confidence: "The soul is an entelechy, and a reason
 gives it the power to be what it is." This is what Aristotle
 expressly declares, page 633 of the Louvre edition. He cited the
 passage[4].
 
 [4] Here is the passage such as it is transcribed in the edition
 dated 1750: "Entele'xeia' tis esi kai' lo'gos tou dy'namin
 e'xontos toude' ei'nai."
 
 This passage of Aristotle, _On the Soul_, book II, chapter II, is
 translated thusly by Casaubon: _Anima quaedam perfectio et actus
 ac ratio est quod potentiam habet ut ejusmodi sit_.  B.
 
 "I do not understand Greek very well," said the giant.
 
 "Neither do I," said the philosophical mite.
 
 "Why then," the Sirian retorted, "are you citing some man named
 Aristotle in the Greek?"
 
 "Because," replied the savant, "one should always cite what one does
 not understand at all in the language one understands the least."
 
 The Cartesian took the floor and said: "The soul is a pure spirit
 that has received in the belly of its mother all metaphysical ideas,
 and which, leaving that place, is obliged to go to school, and to
 learn all over again what it already knew, and will not know again."
 
 "It is not worth the trouble," responded the animal with the height
 of eight leagues, "for your soul to be so knowledgeable in its
 mother's stomach, only to be so ignorant when you have hair on your
 chin. But what do you understand by the mind?"
 
 "You are asking me?" said the reasoner. "I have no idea. We say that
 it is not matter--"
 
 "But do you at least know what matter is?"
 
 "Certainly," replied the man. "For example this stone is grey, has
 such and such a form, has three dimensions, is heavy and divisible."
 
 "Well!" said the Sirian, "this thing that appears to you to be
 divisible, heavy, and grey, will you tell me what it is? You see some
 attributes, but behind those, are you familiar with that?
 
 "No," said the other.
 
 "--So you do not know what matter is."
 
 So Micromegas, addressing another sage that he held on a thumb, asked
 what his soul was, and what it did.
 
 "Nothing at all," said the Malebranchist philosopher[5]. "God does
 everything for me. I see everything in him, I do everything in him;
 it is he who does everything that I get mixed up in."
 
 
 [5] See the opuscule entitled "All in God" in _Miscellaneous_
 (1796).
 
 
 "It would be just as well not to exist," retorted the sage of Sirius.
 "And you, my friend," he said to a Leibnitzian who was there, "what
 is your soul?"
 
 "It is," answered the Leibnitzian, "the hand of a clock that tells
 the time while my body rings out. Or, if you like, it is my soul that
 rings out while my body tells the time, or my soul is the mirror of
 the universe, and my body is the border of the mirror. All that is
 clear."
 
 A small partisan of Locke was nearby, and when he was finally given
 the floor: "I do not know," said he, "how I think, but I know that I
 have only ever thought through my senses. That there are immaterial
 and intelligent substances I do not doubt, but that it is impossible
 for God to communicate thought to matter I doubt very much. I revere
 the eternal power. It is not my place to limit it. I affirm nothing,
 and content myself with believing that many more things are possible
 than one would think."
 
 The animal from Sirius smiled. He did not find this the least bit
 sage, while the dwarf from Saturn would have kissed the sectarian of
 Locke were it not for the extreme disproportion. But there was,
 unfortunately, a little animalcule in a square hat who interrupted
 all the other animalcule philosophers. He said that he knew the
 secret: that everything would be found in the _Summa_ of Saint
 Thomas. He looked the two celestial inhabitants up and down. He
 argued that their people, their worlds, their suns, their stars, had
 all been made uniquely for mankind. At this speech, our two voyagers
 nearly fell over with that inextinguishable laughter which, according
 to Homer[6], is shared with the gods. Their shoulders and their
 stomachs heaved up and down, and in these convulsions the vessel that
 the Sirian had on his nail fell into one of the Saturnian's trouser
 pockets. These two good men searched for it a long time, found it
 finally, and tidied it up neatly. The Sirian resumed his discussion
 with the little mites. He spoke to them with great kindness, although
 in the depths of his heart he was a little angry that the infinitely
 small had an almost infinitely great pride. He promised to make them
 a beautiful philosophical book[7], written very small for their
 usage, and said that in this book they would see the point of
 everything. Indeed, he gave them this book before leaving. It was
 taken to the academy of science in Paris, but when the ancient[8]
 secretary opened it, he saw nothing but blank pages. "Ah!" he said,
 "I suspected as much."
 
 
 [6] Illiad, I, 599.  B.
 
 [7] The edition that I believe to be original, and the one dated
 1750, reads, "philosophical book, that would teach them of
 admirable things, and show them the goodness of things."
 
 [8] Although this scene occurs in 1737, as one saw in pages 177 to
 188, one could assign the epithet of "old" to Fontenelle, who was
 80 at that point, and who died 20 years later. In 1740 he resigned
 from his position as perpetual secretary.

 CHAP. I.
 
     DESCRIPTION OF RUSSIA.
 
 
 The empire of Russia is the largest in the whole globe, extending from
 west to east upwards of two thousand common leagues of France,[1] and
 about eight hundred in its greatest breadth from north to south. It
 borders upon Poland and the Frozen Sea, and joins to Sweden and China.
 Its length from the island of Dago, in the westernmost part of Livonia,
 to its most eastern limits, takes in near one hundred and seventy
 degrees, so that when it is noon in the western parts of the empire, it
 is nearly midnight in the eastern. Its breadth from north to south is
 three thousand six hundred wersts, which make eight hundred and fifty of
 our common French leagues.
 
 The limits of this country were so little known in the last century,
 that, in 1689, when it was reported, that the Chinese and the Russians
 were at war, and that in order to terminate their differences, the
 emperor _Camhi_ on the one hand, and the czars Ivan or John, and Peter,
 on the other, had sent their ministers to meet an embassy within three
 hundred leagues of Pekin, on the frontiers of the two empires, the
 account was at first treated as a fiction.
 
 The country now comprehended under the name of Russia, or the Russias,
 is of a greater extent than all the rest of Europe, or than ever the
 Roman empire was, or that of Darius subdued by Alexander; for it
 contains upwards of one million one hundred thousand square leagues.
 Neither the Roman empire, nor that of Alexander, contained more than
 five hundred and fifty thousand each; and there is not a kingdom in
 Europe the twelfth part so extensive as the Roman empire; but to make
 Russia as populous, as plentiful, and as well stored with towns as our
 southern countries, would require whole ages, and a race of monarchs
 such as Peter the Great.
 
 The English ambassador, who resided at Petersburg in 1733, and who had
 been at Madrid, says, in his manuscript relation, that in Spain, which
 is the least populous state in Europe, there may be reckoned forty
 persons to every square mile, and in Russia not above five. We shall see
 in the second chapter, whether this minister was mistaken. Marshal
 Vauban, the greatest of engineers, and the best of citizens, computes,
 that, in France, every square mile contains two hundred inhabitants.
 These calculations are never very exact, but they serve to shew the
 amazing disproportion in the population of two different countries.
 
 I shall observe here, that from Petersburg to Pekin, there is hardly one
 mountain to be met with in the route which the caravans might take
 through independent Tartary, and that from Petersburg to the north of
 France, by the road of Dantzic, Hamburg, and Amsterdam, there is not
 even a hill of any eminence to be seen. This observation leaves room to
 doubt of the truth of that theory, which makes the mountains to have
 been formed by the rolling of the waves of the sea, and supposes all
 that is at present dry land, to have been for a long time covered with
 water: but how comes it to pass, that the waves, which, according to the
 supposition, formed the Alps, the Pyrenees, and Mount Taurus, did not
 likewise form some eminence or hill from Normandy to China, which is a
 winding space of above three thousand leagues? Geography, thus
 considered, may furnish lights to natural philosophy, or at least give
 room for rational doubts.
 
 Formerly we called Russia by the name of Muscovy, from the city of
 Moscow, the capital of that empire, and the residence of the grand
 dukes: but at present the ancient name of Russia prevails.
 
 It is not my business in this place to inquire, why the countries from
 Smolensko, to the other side of Moscow, were called White Russia, or why
 Hubner gives it the name of Black, nor for what reason the government of
 Kiow should be named Red Russia.
 
 It is very likely that Madies the Scythian, who made an irruption into
 Asia, near seven hundred years before our vulgar aera, might have carried
 his arms into these regions, as Gengis-Khan and Tamerlane did
 afterwards, and as probably others had done long before Madies. Every
 part of antiquity is not deserving of our inquiries; that of the
 Chinese, the Indians, the Persians, and the Egyptians, is ascertained
 from illustrious and interesting monuments; but these monuments suppose
 others of a far more ancient date, since it required many ages to teach
 men the art of transmitting their thoughts by permanent signs, and no
 less time was required to form a regular language; and yet we have no
 such monuments even in this polite part of Europe. The art of writing
 was a long time unknown to all the North: the patriarch Constantine, who
 wrote the history of Kiow in the Russian language, acknowledges, that
 the use of writing was not known in these countries in the fifth
 century.
 
 Let others examine whether the Huns, the Slavi, and the Tartars,
 formerly led their wandering and famished tribes towards the source of
 the Boristhenes;[2] my design is to shew what czar Peter created, and
 not to engage in a useless attempt, to clear up the chaos of antiquity.
 We should always keep in mind, that no family upon earth knows its first
 founder, and consequently, that no nation knows its first origin.
 
 I use the name of Russians to designate the inhabitants of this great
 empire. That of Roxolanians, which was formerly given them, would indeed
 be more sonorous, but we shall conform to the custom of the language in
 which we write. News-papers and other memoirs have for some time used
 the word Russians; but as this name comes too near to that of Prussians,
 I shall abide by that of Russ, which almost all our writers have given
 them. Besides, it appeared to me, that the most extensive people on the
 earth ought to be known by some appellation that may distinguish them
 absolutely from all other nations.[3]
 
 This empire is at present divided into sixteen large governments, that
 will one day be subdivided, when the northern and eastern countries come
 to be more inhabited.
 
 These sixteen governments, which contain several immense provinces are
 the following:--
 
 
 LIVONIA.
 
 The nearest province to our part of the world is that of Livonia, one of
 the most fruitful in the whole North. In the twelfth century the
 inhabitants were pagans; at this time certain merchants of Bremen and
 Lubeck traded to this country, and a body of religious crusaders, called
 _port-glaives_, or sword-bearers, who were afterwards incorporated in
 the Teutonic order, made themselves masters of this province in the
 thirteenth century, at the time when the fury of the crusades armed the
 Christians against every one who was not of their religion. Albert,
 margrave of Brandenburg, grand-master of these religious conquerors,
 made himself sovereign of Livonia and of Brandenburg-Prussia, about the
 year 1514. From that time, the Russians and Poles began to dispute for
 the possession of this province. Soon afterwards it was invaded by the
 Swedes, and for a long while continued to be ravaged by these several
 powers. Gustavus Adolphus having conquered it, it was then ceded to the
 Swedes in 1660, by the famous treaty of Oliva; and, at length, czar
 Peter wrested it from these latter, as will be seen in the course of
 this history.
 
 Courland, which joins to Livonia, is still in vassalage to Poland,
 though it depends greatly upon Russia. These are the western limits of
 this empire in Christendom.
 
 
 _Of the Governments of_ REVEL, PETERSBURG, _and_ WYBURG.
 
 More northward is the government of Revel and Esthonia. Revel was built
 by the Danes in the thirteenth century. The Swedes were in possession
 of this province, from the time that country put itself under the
 protection of that crown in 1561. This is another of the conquests of
 Peter the Great.
 
 On the borders of Esthonia lies the gulf of Finland. To the eastward of
 this sea, and at the junction of the Neva with the lake Ladoga,[4] is
 situated Petersburg, the most modern and best built city in the whole
 empire, founded by czar Peter, in spite of all the united obstacles
 which opposed its foundation.
 
 This city is situated on the bay of Kronstat, in the midst of nine
 rivers, by which its different quarters are divided. In the centre of
 this city is almost an impregnable fortress, built on an island, formed
 by the main-stream of the river Neva: seven canals are cut from the
 rivers, and wash the walls of one of the royal palaces of the admiralty,
 of the dock-yard for the galleys, and of several buildings of
 manufactories. Thirty-five large churches contribute to adorn the city;
 among which five are allotted for foreigners of the Roman Catholic,
 Calvinist, and Lutheran religions: these are as so many temples raised
 to toleration, and examples to other nations. There are five palaces;
 the old one, called the summer palace, situated on the river Neva, has a
 very large and beautiful stone balustrade, which runs all along the
 river side. The new summer palace near the triumphal gate, is one of the
 finest pieces of architecture in Europe. The admiralty buildings, the
 school for cadets, the imperial college, the academy of sciences, the
 exchange, and the merchants' warehouses, are all magnificent structures,
 and monuments of taste and public utility. The town-house, the public
 dispensary, where all the vessels are of porcelain, the court magazines,
 the foundery, the arsenal, the bridges, the markets, the squares, the
 barracks for the horse and foot guards, contribute at once to the
 embellishment and safety of the city, which is said to contain at
 present four hundred thousand souls. In the environs of the city are
 several villas or country-seats, which surprise all travellers by their
 magnificence. There is one in particular which has water-works superior
 to those of Versailles. There was nothing of all this in 1702, the whole
 being then an impassable morass. Petersburg is considered as the capital
 of Ingria, a small province subdued by Peter I. Wyburg, another of his
 conquests, and that part of Finland which was lost, and ceded by the
 Swedes in 1742, make another government.
 
 
 ARCHANGEL.
 
 Higher up, proceeding towards the north, is the province of Archangel, a
 country entirely new to the southern nations of Europe. It took its name
 from St. Michael, the Archangel, under whose patronage it was put long
 after the Russians had embraced Christianity, which did not happen till
 the beginning of the eleventh century; and they were not known to the
 other nations of Europe till the middle of the sixteenth. The English,
 in 1533, endeavouring to find out a north-east passage to the East
 Indies, Chancellor, captain of one of the ships fitted out for this
 expedition, discovered the port of Archangel in the White Sea; at that
 time it was a desert place, having only one convent, and a little
 church, dedicated to St. Michael, the Archangel.
 
 The English sailing up the river Dwina,[5] arrived at the midland part
 of the country, and at length at Moscow. Here they easily made
 themselves masters of the trade of Russia, which was removed from the
 city of Novogorod, where it was carried on by land to this sea-port,
 which is inaccessible indeed during seven months in the year; but,
 nevertheless, this trade proved more beneficial to the empire than the
 fairs of Novogorod, that had fallen to decay in consequence of the wars
 with Sweden. The English obtained the privilege of trading thither
 without paying any duties; a manner of trading which is apparently the
 most beneficial to all nations. The Dutch soon came in for a share of
 the trade of Archangel, then unknown to other nations.
 
 Long before this time, the Genoese and Venetians had established a trade
 with the Russians by the mouth of the Tanais or Don,[6] where they had
 built a town called Tana. This branch of the Italian commerce was
 destroyed by the ravages of Tamerlane, in that part of the world; but
 that of Archangel continued, with great advantages both to the English
 and Dutch, till the time that Peter the Great opened a passage into his
 dominions by the Baltic Sea.
 
 
 RUSSIAN LAPLAND.
 
 _Of the Government of Archangel._
 
 To the west of Archangel, and within its government, lies Russian
 Lapland, the third part of this country, the other two belonging to
 Sweden and Denmark. This is a very large tract, occupying about eight
 degrees of longitude, and extending in latitude from one polar circle to
 the North Cape[7]. The natives of this country were confusedly known to
 the ancients, under the name of troglodytes and northern pigmies;
 appellations suitable enough to men, who, for the most part, are not
 above four feet and a half high, and dwell in caverns; they are just the
 same people they were at that time. They are of a tawny complexion,
 though the other people of the north are white, and for the most part
 very low in stature; though their neighbours, and the people of Iceland,
 under the polar circle, are tall: they seem made for their mountainous
 country, being nimble, squat, and robust; their skins are hard, the
 better to resist the cold, their thighs and legs are slender, their feet
 small, to enable them to run more nimbly amongst the rocks, with which
 their province is covered. They are passionately fond of their own
 country, which none but themselves can be pleased with, and are able to
 live no where else. Some have affirmed, upon the credit of Olaus, that
 these people were originally natives of Finland, and that they removed
 into Lapland, where they diminished in stature: but why might they not
 as well have made choice of lands less northerly, where the conveniences
 of life were to be had in greater plenty? How comes it that they differ
 so totally from their pretended ancestors in features, figure, and
 complexion? Methinks we might, with as great reason, suppose that the
 grass which grows in Lapland is produced from that of Denmark, and that
 the fishes, peculiar to their lakes, came from those of Sweden. It is
 most likely that the Laplanders are, like their animals, the produce of
 their own country, and that nature has made the one for the other.
 
 Those who inhabit the frontiers of Finland, have adopted some of the
 expressions of their neighbours, as happens to every people: but when
 two nations give to things of common use, to objects which are
 continually before their eyes, names absolutely different, it affords a
 strong presumption, that one of them is not a colony from the other. The
 Finlanders call a bear Karu, the Laplanders Muriet: the sun in the
 Finnish language is called Auringa, in the Lapland tongue Beve. Here is
 not the least analogy. The inhabitants of Finland, and Swedish Lapland,
 formerly worshipped an idol whom they called Iumalac, and since the
 reign of Gustavus Adolphus, to whom they are indebted for the
 appellation of Lutherans, they call Jesus Christ the son of Iumalac. The
 Muscovite or Russian Laplanders, are at present thought to be of the
 Greek church; but those who wander about the mountains of the North
 Cape, are satisfied with adoring one God under certain rude forms, as
 has been the ancient custom of all the nations called Nomades, or
 wandering nations.
 
 This race of people, who are inconsiderable in numbers, have but very
 few ideas, and are happy in not having more, which would only occasion
 them to have new wants which they could not satisfy: at present they
 live contented, and free from diseases, notwithstanding the excessive
 coldness of their climate; they drink nothing but water, and attain to a
 great age. The custom imputed to them of entreating strangers to lie
 with their wives and daughters, which they esteem as an honour done to
 them, probably arose from a notion of the superiority of strangers, and
 a desire of amending, by their means, the defects of their own race.
 This was a custom established amongst the virtuous Lacedemonians. A
 husband would entreat a favour of a comely young man, to give him
 handsome children, whom he might adopt. Jealousy, and the laws, prevent
 the rest of mankind from giving their wives up to the embraces of
 another; but the Laplanders have few or no laws, and are in all
 probability, strangers to jealousy.
 
 
 MOSCOW.
 
 Ascending the river Dwina from north to south, we travel up the country
 till we come to Moscow, the capital of the empire. This city was long
 the centre of the Russian dominions, before they were extended on the
 side of China and Persia.
 
 Moscow, lying in 55 degrees and a half, north latitude, in a warmer
 climate, and more fruitful soil than that of Petersburg, is situated in
 the midst of a large and delightful plain on the river Moskwa, and two
 lesser rivers, which with the former lose themselves in the Occa, and
 afterwards help to swell the stream of the Wolga. This city, in the 13th
 century, was only a collection of huts inhabited by a set of miserable
 wretches, oppressed by the descendants of Gengis Khan.
 
 The Kremlin, or ancient palace of the great dukes, was not built till
 the 14th century; of such modern date are cities in this part of the
 world. This palace was built by Italian architects, as were several
 churches in the Gothic taste which then prevailed throughout all Europe.
 There are two built by the famous Aristotle, of Bologna, who flourished
 in the 15th century; but the private houses were no better than wooden
 huts.
 
 The first writer who brought us acquainted with Moscow, was Olearius;
 who, in 1633, went thither as the companion of an embassy from the duke
 of Holstein. A native of Holstein must naturally be struck with wonder
 at the immense extent of the city of Moscow, with its five quarters,
 especially the magnificent one belonging to the czars, and with the
 Asiatic splendour which then reigned at that court. There was nothing
 equal to it in Germany at that time, nor any city by far so extensive or
 well peopled.
 
 On the contrary, the earl of Carlisle, who was ambassador from Charles
 II. to the czar Alexis, in 1633, complains in his relation that he could
 not meet with any one convenience of life in Moscow; no inns on the
 road, nor refreshments of any kind. One judged as a German, the other as
 an Englishman, and both by comparison. The Englishman was shocked to see
 most of the Boyards or Muscovite noblemen, sleep upon boards or benches,
 with only the skins of animals under them; but this was the ancient
 practice of all nations. The houses, which were almost all built of
 wood, had scarcely any furniture, few or none of their tables were
 covered with cloth; there was no pavement in the streets; nothing
 agreeable; nothing convenient; very few artificers, and those few
 extremely awkward, and employed only in works of absolute necessity.
 These people might have passed for Spartans, had they been sober.
 
 But, on public days, the court displays all the splendour of a Persian
 monarch. The earl says, he could see nothing but gold and precious
 stones on the robes of the czar and his courtiers. These dresses were
 not manufactured in the country; and yet, it is evident, that the people
 might be rendered industrious long before that time. In the reign of the
 czar Boris Godonow, the largest bell was cast at Moscow, in Europe; and
 in the patriarchal church there were several ornaments in silver, worked
 in a very curious manner. These pieces of workmanship, which were made
 under the direction of Germans and Italians, were only transient
 efforts. It is daily industry, and the continual exercise of a great
 number of arts, that makes a nation flourishing. Poland, and the
 neighbouring nations, were at that time very little superior to the
 Russians. The handicraft trades were not in greater perfection in the
 north of Germany, nor were the polite arts much better known, than in
 the middle of the seventeenth century.
 
 Though the city of Moscow, at that time, had neither the magnificence
 nor arts of our great cities in Europe, yet its circumference of twenty
 miles; the part called the Chinese town, where all the rarities of China
 are exhibited; the spacious quarter of the Kremlin, where stood the
 palace of the czars; the gilded domes, the lofty and conspicuous
 turrets; and, lastly, the prodigious number of its inhabitants,
 amounting to near 500,000. All this together, rendered Moscow one of the
 most considerable cities in the world.
 
 Theodore, or Foedor, eldest brother to Peter the Great, began to
 improve Moscow. He ordered several large houses to be built of stone,
 though without any regular architecture. He encouraged the principal
 persons of his court to build, advancing them sums of money, and
 furnishing them with materials. He was the first who collected studs of
 fine horses, and made several useful embellishments. Peter, who was
 attentive to every thing, did not neglect Moscow at the time he was
 building Petersburg; for he caused it to be paved, adorned it with noble
 edifices, and enriched it with manufactures; and, within these few
 years, M. de Showalow, high chamberlain to the empress Elizabeth,
 daughter to Peter the Great, has founded an university in this city.
 This is the same person who furnished me with the memorials, from which
 I have compiled the present history, and who was himself much more
 capable to have done it, even in the French language, had not his great
 modesty determined him to resign the task to me, as will evidently
 appear from his own letters on this subject, which I have deposited in
 the public library of Geneva.
 
 
 SMOLENSKO.
 
 Westward of the duchy of Moscow, is that of Smolensko, a part of the
 ancient Sarmatia Europea. The duchies of Moscow and Smolensko composed
 what is properly called White Russia. Smolensko, which at first belonged
 to the great dukes of Russia, was conquered by the great duke of
 Lithuania, in the beginning of the fifteenth century, and was retaken
 one hundred years afterwards by its old masters. Sigismund III. king of
 Poland, got possession of it in 1611. The czar Alexis, father of Peter
 I. recovered it again in 1654, since which time it has always
 constituted part of the Russian empire. The panegyric of Peter the
 Great, pronounced in the academy of sciences at Paris, takes notice,
 that before his time the Russians had made no conquests either to the
 west or south; but this is evidently a mistake.
 
 
 _Of the Governments of_ NOVOGOROD _and_ KIOW, _or the_ UKRAINE.
 
 Between Petersburg and Smolensko, lies the province of Novogorod;[8] and
 is said to be the country in which the ancient _Slavi_, or Sclavonians,
 made their first settlements. But from whence came these _Slavi_, whose
 language has spread over all the north-east part of Europe? _Sla_
 signifies a chief, and _slave_ one belonging to a chief. All that we
 know concerning these ancient _Slaves_ is, that they were a race of
 conquerors; that they built the city of Novogorod the Great, at the head
 of a navigable river; and that this city was for a long time in
 possession of a flourishing trade, and was a potent ally to the Hanse
 Towns. Czar Iwan Wassiliawitsch (or John Basilowitz) made a conquest of
 it in 1467, and carried away all its riches, which contributed to the
 magnificence of the court of Moscow, till then almost unknown.
 
 To the south of the province of Smolensko, we meet with the province of
 Kiow, otherwise called the Lesser Russia, Red Russia, or the Ukraine,
 through which runs the Dnieper, called by the Greeks the Boristhenes.
 The difference of these two names, the one so harsh to pronounce, and
 the other so melodious, served to shew us, together with a hundred other
 like instances, the rudeness of all the ancient people of the North, in
 comparison with the graces of the Greek language. Kiow, the capital
 city, formerly Kisow, was built by the emperors of Constantinople, who
 made it a colony: here are still to be seen several Greek inscriptions
 upwards of twelve hundred years old. This is the only city of any
 antiquity in these countries, where men lived so long together without
 building walls. Here it was that the great dukes of Russia held their
 residence in the eleventh century, before the Tartars brought it under
 their subjection.
 
 The inhabitants of the Ukraine, called Cossacks, are a mixture of the
 ancient Roxolanians, Sarmatians, and Tartars, blended together. Rome and
 Constantinople, though so long the mistress of other nations, are not to
 compare in fertility of country with the Ukraine. Nature has there
 exerted her utmost efforts for the service of mankind; but they have not
 seconded those efforts by industry, living only upon the spontaneous
 productions of an uncultivated, but fruitful soil, and the exercise of
 rapine. Though fond, to a degree of enthusiasm, of that most valuable of
 all blessings, liberty; yet they were always in subjection, either to
 the Poles or to the Turks, till the year 1654, when they threw
 themselves into the arms of Russia, but with some limitations. At length
 they were entirely subdued by Peter the Great.
 
 Other nations are divided into cities and towns; this into ten
 regiments. At the head of which is a chief, who used to be elected by a
 majority of votes, and is called by the name of Hetman, or Itman. This
 captain of the nation was not invested with supreme power. At present
 the itman is a person nominated by the czar, from among the great lords
 of the court; and is, in fact, no more that the governor of the
 province, like governors of the _pays d'etats_ in France, that have
 retained some privileges.
 
 At first the inhabitants of this country were all either Pagans or
 Mahometans; but, when they entered into the service of Poland, they
 were baptized Christians of the Roman communion; and now, that they are
 in the service of Russia, they belong to the Greek church.
 
 Amongst these are comprehended the Zaporavian Cossacks, who are much the
 same as our Bucaniers, or freebooters, living upon rapine. They are
 distinguished from all other people, by never admitting women to live
 among them; as the Amazons are said never to have admitted any man. The
 women, whom they make use of for propagation, live upon other islands on
 the river; they have no marriages amongst them, nor any domestic
 economy; they inroll the male children in their militia, and leave the
 girls to the care of their mothers. A brother has frequently children by
 his sister, and a father by his daughter. They know no other laws than
 customs, introduced by necessity: however, they make use of some prayers
 from the Greek ritual. Fort St. Elizabeth has been lately built on the
 Boristhenes, to keep them in awe. They serve as irregulars in the
 Russian armies, and hapless is the fate of those who fall into their
 hands.
 
 
 _Of the Governments of_ BELGOROD, WORONITZ, _and_ NISCHGOROD.
 
 To the north-east of the province of Kiow, between the Boristhenes and
 the Tanais, or Don, is the government of Belgorod, which is as large as
 that of Kiow. This is one of the most fruitful provinces of Russia, and
 furnishes Poland with a prodigious number of that large cattle known by
 the name of Ukraine oxen. These two provinces are secured from the
 incursions of the petty Tartar tribes, by lines extending from the
 Boristhenes to the Tanais, and well furnished with forts and redoubts.
 
 Farther northward we cross the Tanais, and come into the government of
 Worownitz, or Veronise, which extends as far as the banks of the Palus
 Maeotis. In the neighbourhood of the capital of this province, which is
 called, by the Russians, Woronestch, at the mouth of the river of the
 same name, which falls into the Don, Peter the Great built his first
 fleet; an undertaking which was at that time entirely new to the
 inhabitants of these vast dominions. From thence we come to the
 government of Nischgorod, abounding with grain, and is watered by the
 river Wolga.
 
 
 ASTRACAN.
 
 From the latter province we proceed southward to the kingdom of
 Astracan. This country reaches from forty-three and a half degrees north
 latitude (in a most delightful climate) to near fifty, including about
 as many degrees of longitude as of latitude. It is bounded on one side
 by the Caspian Sea, and on the other by the mountains of Circassia,
 projecting beyond the Caspian, along mount Caucasus. It is watered by
 the great river Wolga, the Jaick, and several other lesser streams,
 between which, according to Mr. Perry, the English engineer, canals
 might be cut, that would serve as reservoirs to receive the overflowing
 of the waters; and by that means answer the same purposes as the canals
 of the Nile, and make the soil more fruitful: but to the right and left
 of the Wolga and Jaick, this fine country was inhabited, or rather
 infested, by Tartars, who never apply themselves to agriculture, but
 have always lived as strangers and sojourners upon the face of the
 earth.
 
 The above named engineer, Perry, who was employed by Peter the Great in
 these parts, found a vast track of land covered with pasture, leguminous
 plants, cherry and almond trees, and large flocks of wild sheep, who fed
 in these solitary places, and whose flesh was excellent. The inhabitants
 of these countries must be conquered and civilized, in order to second
 the efforts of nature, who has been forced in the climate of Petersburg.
 
 The kingdom of Astracan is a part of the ancient Capshak, conquered by
 Gengis-Khan, and afterwards by Tamerlane, whose dominion extended as far
 as Moscow. The czar, John Basilides, grandson of John Basilowitz, and
 the greatest conqueror of all the Russian princes, delivered his country
 from the Tartarian yoke, in the sixteenth century, and added the kingdom
 of Astracan to his other conquests, in 1554.
 
 Astracan is the boundary of Asia and Europe, and is so situated as to be
 able to carry on a trade with both; as merchandizes may be conveyed from
 the Caspian Sea, up to this town, by means of the Wolga. This was one of
 the grand schemes of Peter the Great, and has been partly carried into
 execution. An entire suburb of Astracan is inhabited by Indians.
 
 
 OREMBURG.
 
 To the south-east of the kingdom of Astracan, is a small country, newly
 planted, called Oremburg. The town of this name was built in the year
 1734, on the banks of the river Jaick. This province is thick covered
 with hills, that are parts of Mount Caucasus. The passes in these
 mountains, and of the rivers that run down from them, are defended by
 forts raised at equal distances. In this region, formerly uninhabited,
 the Persians come at present, to hide from the rapacity of robbers,
 such of their effects as have escaped the fury of the civil wars. The
 city of Oremburg is become the asylum of the Persians and their riches,
 and is grown considerable by their calamities. The natives of Great
 Bukari come hither to trade, so that it is become the mart of Asia.
 
 
 _Of the Government of_ CASAN, _and of_ GREAT PERMIA.
 
 Beyond the Wolga and Jaick, towards the north, lies the kingdom of
 Casan, which, like that of Astracan, fell by partition to one of the
 sons of Gengis Khan, and afterwards to a son of Tamerlane, and was at
 length conquered by John Basilides. It is still inhabited by a number of
 Mahometan Tartars. This vast country stretches as far as Siberia; it is
 allowed to have been formerly very flourishing and rich, and still
 retains some part of its pristine opulence. A province of this kingdom,
 called Great Permia, and since Solikam, was the staple for the
 merchandizes of Persia, and the furs of Tartary. There has been found in
 Permia a great quantity of the coin of the first Caliphs, and some
 Tartarian idols, made of gold;[9] but these monuments of ancient
 opulence were found in the midst of barren deserts and extreme poverty,
 where there were not the least traces of commerce: revolutions of this
 nature may easily happen to a barren country, seeing they are so soon
 brought about in the most fruitful provinces.
 
 The famous Swedish prisoner, Strahlemberg, who made such advantageous
 use of his misfortunes, and who examined those extensive countries with
 so much attention, was the first who gave an air of probability to a
 fact, which before had been always thought incredible; namely,
 concerning the ancient commerce of these provinces. Pliny and Pomponius
 Mela relate, that, in the reign of Augustus, a king of the Suevi made a
 present to Metellus Celer of some Indians who had been cast by a storm
 upon the coasts bordering on the Elbe. But how could inhabitants of
 India navigate the Germanic seas? This adventure was deemed fabulous by
 all our moderns, especially after the change made in the commerce of our
 hemisphere by the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope. But formerly it
 was no more extraordinary to see an Indian trading to the parts to the
 north west of his country, than to see a Roman go from India by the way
 of Arabia. The Indians went to Persia, and thence embarked on the
 Hyrcanian Sea, and ascending the Rha, now the Wolga, got to Great Permia
 through the river Kama; from whence they might take shipping again on
 the Black Sea, or the Baltic. They have, in all times, been enterprising
 men. The Tyrians undertook most surprising voyages.
 
 If after surveying all these vast provinces, we direct our view towards
 the east, we shall find the limits of Europe and Asia again confounded.
 A new name is wanting for a considerable part of the globe. The ancients
 divided their known world into Europe, Asia, and Africa: but they had
 not seen the tenth part of it: hence it happens, that when we pass the
 Palus Maeotis we are at a loss to know where Europe ends, or Asia begins;
 all that tract of country lying beyond mount Taurus was distinguished by
 the general appellation of Scythia, and afterwards by that of Tartary.
 It might not be improper, perhaps, to give the name of Terrae Arcticae,
 or Northern Lands, to the country extending from the Baltic Sea to the
 confines of China; as that of Terrae Australes, or Southern Lands, are to
 that equally extensive part of the world, situated under the Antarctic
 Pole, and which serves to counterpoise the globe.
 
 
 _Of the Governments of_ SIBERIA, _of the_ SAMOJEDES, _the_ OSTIAKS
 KAMTSHATKA, _&c._
 
 Siberia, with the territories beyond it, extends from the frontiers of
 the provinces of Archangel, Casan, and Astracan, eastward as far as the
 sea of Japan: it joined the southern parts of Russia by Mount Caucasus;
 from thence, to the country of Kamtshatka, is about one thousand two
 hundred computed French leagues; and from southern Tartary, which serves
 as its boundary, to the Frozen Sea, about four hundred, which is the
 least breadth of the Russian empire. This country produces the richest
 furs; and this occasioned the discovery of it in the year 1563.
 
 In the sixteenth century, in the reign of the czar, John Basilides,
 and not in that of Foedor Johannowitz, a private person in the
 neighbourhood of Archangel, named Anika, one tolerably rich for his
 condition of life and country, took notice that certain men of an
 extraordinary figure, and dressed in a manner unknown to that country,
 and who spoke a language understood by none but themselves, came every
 year down a river which falls into the Dwina,[10] and brought martens
 and black foxes, which they trucked for nails and pieces of glass; just
 as the first savages of America used to exchange their gold with the
 Spaniards: he caused them to be followed by his sons and servants, as
 far as their own country. These were the Samojedes, a people who seem
 to resemble the Laplanders, but are of a different race. They are, like
 that people, unacquainted with the use of bread; and like them, they
 yoke rein-deer to draw their sledges. They live in caverns and huts,
 amidst the snow;[11] but in other respects, nature has made a visible
 difference between this species of men and the Laplanders. Their upper
 jaw projects forward, so as to be on a level with their nose, and their
 ears are placed higher. Both the men and women have no hair in any other
 part of their bodies, but their heads; and their nipple is of a deep
 black, like ebony. The Lapland men and women are distinguished by no
 such marks. By memoirs sent from these countries so little known, I have
 been informed, that the author of the curious natural history of the
 king's garden, is mistaken, where, in speaking of the many curiosities
 of human nature, he confounds the Lapland race with that of the
 Samojedes. There are many more different species of men than is commonly
 thought. The Samojedes, and the Hottentots, seem to be the two extremes
 of our continent; and if we observe the black nipples of the Samojedian
 women, and the apron with which nature has furnished the Hottentot
 females, and which hangs half way down their thighs, we may have some
 idea of the great variety of our animal species, a variety unknown to
 those inhabiting great cities, who are generally strangers to almost
 every thing that is not immediately within their view.
 
 The Samojedes are as singular in their moral as in their physical
 distinctions; they pay no worship to the Supreme Being; they border upon
 Manicheism, or rather upon the religion of the ancient Magi in this one
 point, that they acknowledge a good and an evil principle. The horrible
 climate they inhabit may in some measure excuse this belief, which is of
 such ancient date, and so natural to those who are ignorant and unhappy.
 
 Theft, or murder, is never heard of amongst them; being in a manner
 devoid of passions, they are strangers to injustice; they have no terms
 in their language to denote vice and virtue, their extreme simplicity
 has not yet permitted them to form abstract ideas, they are wholly
 guided by pensation, and this is perhaps an incontestable proof that men
 naturally love justice, when not blinded by inordinate passions.
 
 Some of these savages were prevailed on to suffer themselves to be
 carried to Moscow, where many things they saw struck them with
 admiration. They gazed upon the emperor as their god, and voluntarily
 engaged for themselves and countrymen a present of two martens, or
 sables, every year for each inhabitant. Colonies were soon settled
 beyond the Oby,[12] and the Irtis,[13] and some forts built. In the year
 1595, a Cossack officer was sent into this country, who conquered it for
 the czar with only a few soldiers and some artillery, as Cortez did
 Mexico; but he only made a conquest of barren deserts.
 
 In sailing up the Oby to the junction of the river Irtis with the Tobol,
 they found a petty settlement, which they converted into the town of
 Tobol,[14] now the capital of Siberia, and a considerable place. Who
 could imagine that this country was for a long time the residence of
 those very Huns, who under Attila carried their depredations as far as
 the gates of Rome, and that these Huns came from the north of China? The
 Usbeck Tartars succeeded the Huns, and the Russians the Usbecks. The
 possession of these savage countries has been disputed with as much
 murderous fury, as that of the most fruitful provinces. Siberia was
 formerly better peopled than it is at present, especially towards the
 southern parts; if we may judge from the rivers and sepulchral
 monuments.
 
 All this part of the world, from the sixtieth degree of latitude, or
 thereabouts, as far as those mountains of perpetual ice which border the
 north seas, is totally different from the regions of the temperate zone,
 the earth produces neither the same plants, nor the same animals, nor
 are there the same sort of fishes in their lakes and rivers.
 
 Below the country of the Samojedes lies that of the Ostiaks, along the
 river Oby. These people have no resemblance in any respect with the
 Samojedes, save that like them and all the first race of men, they are
 hunters, fishermen, and shepherds; some of them have no religion, not
 being formed into any society, and the others who live together in herds
 or clans, have a kind of worship, and pray to the principal object of
 their wants; they adore the skin of a sheep, because this creature is of
 all others the most serviceable to them; just as the Egyptian husbandmen
 made choice of an ox, as an emblem of the Deity who created that
 creature for the use of man.
 
 The Ostiaks have likewise other idols, whose origin and worship are as
 little deserving our notice as their worshippers. There were some
 converts to Christianity made amongst them in the year 1712; but these,
 like the lowest of our peasants, are Christians without knowing what
 they profess. Several writers pretend that these people were natives of
 Great Permia, but as Great Permia is in a manner a desert, how comes it
 that its inhabitants should settle themselves at such a distance, and so
 inconveniently? This is a difficulty not worth clearing up. Every nation
 which has not cultivated the polite arts, deserves to remain in
 obscurity.
 
 In the country of the Ostiaks in particular, and amongst their
 neighbours the Burates and Jakutians, they often discover a kind of
 ivory under ground, the nature of which is as yet unknown. Some take it
 to be a sort of fossil, and others the tooth of a species of elephants,
 the breed of which have been destroyed: but where is the country that
 does not afford some natural productions, which at once astonish and
 confound philosophy.
 
 Several mountains in this country abound with the amianthes or asbestos,
 a kind of incombustible flax, of which a sort of cloth and paper is
 sometimes made.
 
 To the south of the Ostiaks are the Burates, another people, who have
 not yet been made Christians. Eastward there are several hordes, whom
 the Russians have not as yet entirely subdued.
 
 None of these people have the least knowledge of the calendar: they
 reckon their time by snows, and not by the apparent motion of the sun:
 as it snows regularly, and for a long time every winter, they say, 'I am
 so many snows old,' just as we say, I am so many years.
 
 And here I must relate the accounts given by the Swedish officer
 Strahlemberg, who was taken prisoner in the battle of Pultowa, and lived
 fifteen years in Siberia, and made the entire tour of that country. He
 says, that there are still some remains of an ancient people, whose skin
 is spotted or variegated with different colours, and that he himself had
 seen some of them, and the fact has been confirmed to me by Russians
 born at Tobolsky. The variety of the human species seems to be greatly
 diminished, as we find very few of these extraordinary people, and they
 have probably been exterminated by some other race: for instance there
 are very few Albinos, or White Moors; one of them was presented to the
 academy of sciences at Paris, which I saw. It is the same with respect
 to several other species of animals which are rare.
 
 As to the Borandians, of whom mention is made so frequently in the
 learned history of the king's garden, my memoirs say, that this race of
 people is entirely unknown to the Russians.
 
 All the southern part of these countries is peopled by numerous hordes
 of Tartars. The ancient Turks came from this part of Tartary to conquer
 these extensive countries, of which they are at present in possession.
 The Calmucs and Monguls are the very Scythians who, under Madies, made
 themselves masters of Upper Asia, and conquered Cyaxares, king of the
 Medes. They are the men, whom Gengis Khan and his sons led afterwards as
 far as Germany, and was termed the Mogul empire under Tamerlane. These
 people afford a lively instance of the vicissitudes which have happened
 to all nations; some of their hordes, so far from being formidable now,
 are become vassals to Russia.
 
 Among these is a nation of Calmucs, dwelling between Siberia and the
 Caspian Sea, where, in the year 1720, there was discovered a
 subterraneous house of stone, with urns, lamps, earrings, an equestrian
 statue of an oriental prince, with a diadem on his head, two women
 seated on thrones, and a roll of manuscripts, which were sent by Peter
 the Great to the academy of inscriptions at Paris, and proved to be
 written in the Thibet language: all these are striking proofs, that the
 liberal arts formerly resided in this now barbarous country, and are
 lasting evidences of the truth of what Peter the Great was wont several
 times to say, viz. that the arts had made the tour of the globe.
 
 The last province is Kamtshatka, the most eastern part of the continent.
 The inhabitants were absolutely void of all religion when they were
 first discovered. The north part of this country likewise affords fine
 furs, with which the inhabitants clothed themselves in winter, though
 they went naked all the summer season. The first discoverers were
 surprised to find in the southern parts men with long beards, while in
 the northern parts, from the country of the Samojedes, as far as the
 mouth of the river Amur, they have no more beards than the Americans.
 Thus, in the empire of Russia, there is a greater number of different
 species, more singularities, and a greater diversity of manners and
 customs, than in any country in the known world.
 
 The first discovery of this country was made by a Cossack officer, who
 went by land from Siberia to Kamtshatka, in 1701, by order of Peter the
 Great, who, notwithstanding his misfortune at Narva, still continued to
 extend his care from one extremity of the continent to the other.
 Afterwards, in 1725, some time before death surprised him, in the midst
 of his great exploits, he sent Captain Bering, a Dane, with express
 orders to find out, if possible, a passage by the sea of Kamtshatka, to
 the coast of America. Bering did not succeed in his first attempt; but
 the empress Anne sent him out again in 1733. M. Spengenberg, captain of
 a ship, his associate in this voyage, set out the first from Kamtshatka,
 but could not put to sea till the year 1739, so much time was taken up
 in getting to the port where they were to embark, in building and
 fitting out the ships, and providing the necessaries. Spengenberg sailed
 as far as the north part of Japan, through a streight, formed by a long
 chain of islands, and returned without having discovered the passage.
 
 In 1741, Bering cruised all over this sea, in company with De Lisle de
 la Croyere, the astronomer, of the same family of L'Isle, which has
 produced such excellent geographers: another captain likewise went upon
 the same discovery. They both made the coast of America, to the
 northward of California. Thus the north-east passage, so long sought
 after, was at length discovered, but there were no refreshments to be
 met with in those barren coasts. Their fresh water failed them, and part
 of the crew perished with the scurvy. They saw the northern bank of
 California for above a hundred miles, and saw some leathern canoes, with
 just such a sort of people in them as the Canadians. All their
 endeavours however proved fruitless: Bering ended his life in an island,
 to which he gave his name. The other captain, happening to be closer in
 with the Californian coast, sent ten of his people on shore, who never
 returned. The captain, after waiting for them in vain, found himself
 obliged to return back to Kamtshatka, and De Lisle died as he was going
 on shore. Such are the disasters that have generally attended every new
 attempt upon the northern seas. But what advantages may yet arise from
 these powerful and dangerous discoveries, time alone can prove.
 
 We have now described all the different provinces that compose the
 Russian dominions, from Finland to the sea of Japan. The largest parts
 of this empire have been all united at different times, as has been the
 case in all other kingdoms in the world. The Scythians, Huns,
 Massagetes, Slavians, Cimbrians, Getes, and Sarmatians, are now subjects
 of the czar. The Russians, properly so called, are the ancient Roxolani
 or Slavi.
 
 Upon reflection, we shall find that most states were formed in the same
 manner. The French are an assemblage of Goths, of Danes called Normands,
 of northern Germans, called Burgundians; of Franks, Allmans, and some
 Romans, mixed with the ancient Celtae. In Rome and Italy there are
 several families descended from the people of the North, but none that
 we know of from the ancient Romans. The supreme pontiff is frequently
 the offspring of a Lombard, a Goth, a Teuton, or a Cimbrian. The
 Spaniards are a race of Arabs, Carthaginians, Jews, Tyrians, Visigoths,
 and Vandals, incorporated with the ancient inhabitants of the country.
 When nations are thus intermixed, it is a long time before they are
 civilized, or even before their language is formed. Some, indeed,
 receive these sooner, others later. Polity and the liberal arts are so
 difficult to establish, and the new raised structure is so often
 destroyed by revolutions, that we may wonder all nations are not so
 barbarous as Tartars.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. II.
 
     Continuation of the description of Russia, population, finances,
     armies, customs, religion: state of Russia before Peter the Great.
 
 
 The more civilized a country is, the better it is peopled. Thus China
 and India are more populous than any other empires, because, after a
 multitude of revolutions, which changed the face of sublunary affairs,
 these two nations made the earliest establishments in civil society: the
 antiquity of their government, which has subsisted upwards of four
 thousand years, supposes, as we have already observed, many essays and
 efforts in preceding ages. The Russians came very late; but the arts
 having been introduced amongst them in their full perfection, it has
 happened, that they have made more progress in fifty years, than any
 other nation had done before them in five hundred. The country is far
 from being populous, in proportion to its extent; but, such as it is, it
 has as great a number of inhabitants as any other state in Christendom.
 From the capitation lists, and the register of merchants, artificers,
 and male peasants, I might safely assert, that Russia, at present,
 contains at least twenty-four millions of male inhabitants: of these
 twenty-four millions, the greatest part are villains or bondmen, as in
 Poland, several provinces of Germany, and formerly throughout all
 Europe. The estate of a gentleman in Russia and Poland is computed, not
 by his increase in money, but by the number of his slaves.
 
 The following is a list, taken in 1747, of all the males who paid the
 capitation or poll-tax:--
 
   Merchants or tradesmen                                        198000

   Others who do not contribute thereto                           26080
 
   Workmen of different trades, whose parents are not known        1000
 
   Others who are not incorporated with the companies of
     tradesmen                                                     4700
 
   Peasants immediately dependent on the crown, about            555000

     mines, and in private manufactories                          24200

   Mourses, Tartars, Mordauts, and others, whether Pagans
     or Christians, employed by the admiralty                      7800
 
   Tartars subject to contribution, called Tepteris,
     Bobilitz, &c.                                                28900
 
   Bondmen to several merchants, and other privileged persons,
     who though not landholders, are allowed to have slaves        9100
 
   Peasants in the lands set apart for the support of the crown  418000

                                                                -------
                                                        Total   6646390
                                                                -------
 
 Here we have a round number of six millions six hundred forty-six
 thousand three hundred and ninety male persons, who pay the poll-tax. In
 this number are included boys and old men, but girls and women are not
 reckoned, nor boys born between the making of one register of the lands
 and another. Now, if we only reckon triple the number of heads subject
 to be taxed, including women and girls, we shall find near twenty
 millions of souls.
 
 To this number we may add the military list, which amounts to three
 hundred and fifty thousand men: besides, neither the nobility nor
 clergy, who are computed at two hundred thousand, are subject to this
 capitation.
 
 Foreigners, of whatever country or profession, are likewise exempt: as
 also the inhabitants of the conquered countries, namely, Livonia,
 Esthonia, Ingria, Carelia, and a part of Finland, the Ukraine, and the
 Don Cossacks, the Calmucks, and other Tartars, Samojedes, the
 Laplanders, the Ostiaks, and all the idolatrous people of Siberia, a
 country of greater extent than China.
 
 By the same calculation, it is impossible that the total of the
 inhabitants of Russia should amount to less than twenty-four millions.
 At this rate, there are eight persons to every square mile. The English
 ambassador, whom I have mentioned before, allows only five; but he
 certainly was not furnished with such faithful memoirs as those with
 which I have been favoured.
 
 Russia therefore is exactly five times less populous than Spain, but
 contains near four times the number of inhabitants: it is almost as
 populous as France or Germany; but, if we consider its vast extent, the
 number of souls is thirty times less.
 
 There is one important remark to be made in regard to this enumeration,
 namely, that out of six million six hundred and forty thousand people
 liable to the poll-tax, there are about nine hundred thousand that
 belong to the Russian clergy, without reckoning either the ecclesiastics
 of the conquered countries, of the Ukraine, or of Siberia.
 
 Therefore, out of seven persons liable to the poll-tax, the clergy have
 one; but, nevertheless, they are far from possessing the seventh part of
 the whole revenues of the state, as is the case in many other kingdoms,
 where they have at least a seventh of all estates; for their peasants
 pay a capitation to the sovereign; and the other taxes of the crown of
 Russia, in which the clergy have no share, are very considerable.
 
 This valuation is very different from that of all other writers, on the
 affairs of Russia; so that foreign ministers, who have transmitted
 memoirs of this state to their courts, have been greatly mistaken. The
 archives of the empire are the only things to be consulted.
 
 It is very probable, that Russia has been better peopled than it is at
 present; before the small-pox, that came from the extremities of Arabia,
 and the great-pox that came from America, had spread over these
 climates, where they have now taken root. The world owes these two
 dreadful scourges, which have depopulated it more than all its wars, the
 one to Mahomet, and the other to Christopher Columbus. The plague, which
 is a native of Africa, seldom approached the countries of the North:
 besides, the people of those countries, from Sarmatia to the Tartars,
 who dwell beyond the great wall, having overspread the world by their
 irruptions, this ancient nursery of the human species must have been
 surprisingly diminished.
 
 In this vast extent of country, there are said to be about seventy-four
 thousand monks, and five thousand nuns, notwithstanding the care taken
 by Peter the Great to reduce their number; a care worthy the legislator
 of an empire where the human race is so remarkably deficient. These
 thirteen thousand persons, thus immured and lost to the state, have, as
 the reader may have observed, seventy-two thousand bondmen to till their
 lands, which is evidently too great a number: there cannot be a stronger
 proof how difficult it is to eradicate abuses of a long standing.
 
 I find, by a list of the revenues of the empire in 1735, that reckoning
 the tribute paid by the Tartars, with all taxes and duties in money, the
 sum total amounted to thirteen millions of rubles, which makes
 sixty-five millions of French livres, exclusive of tributes in kind.
 This moderate sum was at that time sufficient to maintain three hundred
 and thirty-nine thousand five hundred, as well sea as land forces: but
 both the revenues and troops are augmented since that time.
 
 The customs, diets, and manners of the Russians, ever bore a greater
 affinity to those of Asia than to those of Europe: such was the old
 custom of receiving tributes in kind, of defraying the expenses of
 ambassadors on their journeys, and during their residence in the
 country, and of never appearing at church, or in the royal presence with
 a sword; an oriental custom, directly the reverse of that ridiculous and
 barbarous one amongst us, of addressing ourselves to God, to our king,
 to our friends, and to our women, with an offensive weapon, which hangs
 down to the bottom of the leg. The long robe worn on public days, had a
 more noble air than the short habits of the western nations of Europe. A
 vest lined and turned up with fur, with a long scimar, adorned with
 jewels for festival days; and those high turbans, which add to the
 stature, were much more striking to the eye than our perukes and close
 coats, and more suitable to cold climates; but this ancient dress of all
 nations seems to be not so well contrived for war, nor so convenient for
 working people. Most of their other customs were rustic; but we must not
 imagine, that their manners were so barbarous as some writers would have
 us believe. Albert Krants relates a story of an Italian ambassador, whom
 the czar ordered to have his hat nailed to his head, for not pulling it
 off while he was making his speech to him. Others attribute this
 adventure to a Tartar, and others again to a French ambassador.
 
 Olearius pretends, that the czar Michael Theodorowitz, banished the
 marquis of Exideueil, ambassador from Henry IV. of France, into Siberia;
 but it is certain, that this monarch sent no ambassador to Moscow, and
 that there never was a marquis of Exideueil in France. In the same manner
 do travellers speak about the country of Borandia, and of the trade they
 have carried on with the people of Nova Zembla, which is scarcely
 inhabited at all, and the long conversations they have had with some of
 the Samojedes, as if they understood their language. Were the enormous
 compilations of voyages to be cleared of every thing that is not true
 nor useful in them, both the works and the public would be gainers by
 it.
 
 The Russian government resembled that of the Turks, in respect to the
 standing forces, or guards, called Strelitzes, who, like the
 janissaries, sometimes disposed of the crown, and frequently disturbed
 the state as much as they defended it. Their number was about forty
 thousand. Those who were dispersed in the provinces, subsisted by rapine
 and plunder; those in Moscow lived like citizens, followed trades, did
 no duty, and carried their insolence to the greatest excess: in short,
 there was no other way to preserve peace and good order in the kingdom,
 but by breaking them; a very necessary, and at the same time a very
 dangerous step.
 
 The public revenues did not exceed five millions of rubles, or about
 twenty-five millions of French livres. This was sufficient when czar
 Peter came to the crown to maintain the ancient mediocrity, but was not
 a third part of what was necessary to go certain lengths, and to render
 himself and people considerable in Europe: but at the same time many of
 their taxes were paid in kind, according to the Turkish custom, which
 is less burthensome to the people than that of paying their tributes in
 money.
 
 
 OF THE TITLE OF CZAR.
 
 As to the title of czar, it may possibly come from the tzars or tchars
 of the kingdom of Casan. When John, or Ivan Basilides, completed the
 conquest of this kingdom in the sixteenth century, which had been begun
 by his grandfather, who afterwards lost it, he assumed this title, which
 his successors have retained ever since. Before John Basilides, the
 sovereign of Russia, took the title of Welike Knez, i. e. great prince,
 great lord, great chief, which the Christian nations afterwards rendered
 by that of great duke. Czar Michael Theodorowitz, when he received the
 Holstein embassy, took to himself the following titles: 'Great knez, and
 great lord, conservator of all the Russias, prince of Wolodomer, Moscow,
 Novogorod, &c. tzar of Casan, tzar of Astracan, and tzar of Siberia.'
 Tzar was, therefore, a title belonging to these eastern princes; and,
 therefore, it is more probable to have been derived from the tshas of
 Persia, than from the Roman Caesars, whom the Siberian tzars, on the
 banks of the Oby, can hardly be supposed to have ever heard.
 
 No title, however pompous, is of any consequence, if those who bear it
 are not great and powerful themselves. The word emperor, which
 originally signified no more than general of the army, became the title
 of the sovereign of the Roman republic: it is now given to the supreme
 governor of all the Russias, more justly than to any other potentate, if
 we consider the power and extent of his dominions.
 
 
 RELIGION.
 
 The established religion of this country has, ever since the eleventh
 century, been that of the Greek church, so called in opposition to the
 Latin; though there were always a greater number of Mahometan and Pagan
 provinces, than of those inhabited by Christians. Siberia, as far as
 China, was in a state of idolatry; and, in some of the provinces, they
 were utter strangers to all kind of religion.
 
 Perry, the engineer, and baron Strahlemberg, who both resided so many
 years in Russia, tell us, that they found more sincerity and probity
 among the Pagans than the other inhabitants; not that paganism made them
 more virtuous, but their manner of living, which, was that of the
 primitive ages, as they are called, freed them from all the tumultuous
 passions; and, in consequence, they were known for their integrity.
 
 Christianity did not get footing in Russia and the other countries of
 the North, till very late. It is said, that a princess, named Olha,
 first introduced it, about the end of the tenth century, as Clotilda,
 niece to an Arian prince, did among the Franks; the wife of Miceslaus,
 duke of Poland, among the Poles; and the sister of the emperor Henry II.
 among the Hungarians. Women are naturally easily persuaded by the
 ministers of religion, and as easily persuade the other part of mankind.
 
 It is further added, that the princess Olha caused herself to be
 baptized at Constantinople, by the name of Helena; and that, as soon as
 she embraced Christianity, the emperor John Zimisces fell in love with
 her. It is most likely that she was a widow; however, she refused the
 emperor. The example of the princess Olha, or Olga, as she is called,
 did not at first make many proselytes. Her son,[15] who reigned a long
 time, was not of the same way of thinking as his mother, but her
 grandson, Wolodomer, who was born of a concubine, having murdered his
 brother and mounted the throne, sued for the alliance of Basiles,
 emperor of Constantinople, but could obtain it only on condition of
 receiving baptism: and this event, which happened in the year 987, is
 the epocha when the Greek church was first established in Russia.
 Photius, the patriarch, so famous for his immense erudition, his
 disputes with the church of Rome, and for his misfortunes, sent a person
 to baptize Wolodomer, in order to add this part of the world to the
 patriarchal see.[16]
 
 Wolodimer, or Wolodomer, therefore completed the work which his
 grandmother had begun. A Greek was made the first metropolitan, or
 patriarch of Russia; and from this time the Russians adopted an
 alphabet, taken partly from the Greek. This would have been of advantage
 to them, had they not still retained the principles of their own
 language, which is the Sclavonian in every thing, but a few terms
 relating to their liturgy and church government. One of the Greek
 patriarchs, named Jeremiah, having a suit depending before the divan,
 came to Moscow to solicit it; where, after some time, he resigned his
 authority over the Russian churches, and consecrated patriarch, the
 archbishop of Novogorod, named Job. This was in the year 1588, from
 which time the Russian church became as independent as its empire. The
 patriarch of Russia has ever since been consecrated by the Russian
 bishops, and not by the patriarch of Constantinople. He ranked in the
 Greek church next to the patriarch of Jerusalem, but he was in fact the
 only free and powerful patriarch; and, consequently, the only real one.
 Those of Jerusalem, Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria, are mercenary
 chiefs of a church, enslaved by the Turks; and even the patriarchs of
 Jerusalem and Antioch are no longer considered as such, having no more
 credit or influence in Turkey, than the rabbins of the Jewish synagogues
 settled there.
 
 It was from a person who was a patriarch of all the Russias, that Peter
 the Great was descended in a right line. These new prelates soon wanted
 to share the sovereign authority with the czars. They thought it not
 enough that their prince walked bare-headed, once a year before the
 patriarch, leading his horse by the bridle. These external marks of
 respect only served to increase their thirst for rule; a passion which
 proved the source of great troubles in Russia, as well as in other
 countries.
 
 Nicon, a person whom the monks look upon as a saint, and who was
 patriarch in the reign of Alexis, the father of Peter the Great, wanted
 to raise his dignity above that of the throne; for he not only assumed
 the privilege of sitting by the side of the czar in the senate, but
 pretended that neither war nor peace could be made without his consent.
 His authority was so great, that, being supported by his immense wealth,
 and by his intrigues with the clergy and the people, he kept his master
 in a kind of subjection. He had the boldness to excommunicate some
 senators who opposed his excessive insolence; till at last, Alexis,
 finding himself not powerful enough to depose him by his own authority,
 was obliged to convene a synod of all the bishops. There the patriarch
 was accused of having received money from the Poles; and being
 convicted, was deposed, and confined for the remainder of his days in a
 monastery, after which the prelates chose another patriarch in his
 stead.
 
 From the first infancy of Christianity in Russia, there have been
 several sects there, as well as in other countries; for sects are as
 frequently the fruits of ignorance, as of pretended knowledge: but
 Russia is the only Christian state of any considerable extent, in which
 religion has not excited civil wars, though it has felt some occasional
 tumults.
 
 The Raskolnikys, who consist at present of about two thousand males, and
 who are mentioned in the foregoing list,[17] are the most ancient sect
 of any in this country. It was established in the twelfth century, by
 some enthusiasts, who had a superficial knowledge of the New Testament:
 they made use then, and still do, of the old pretence of all sectaries,
 that of following the letter, and accused all other Christians of
 remissness. They would not permit a priest, who had drank brandy, to
 confer baptism; they affirmed, in the words of our Saviour, that there
 is neither a first nor a last, among the faithful; and held, that one of
 the elect might kill himself for the love of his Saviour. According to
 them it is a great sin to repeat the hallelujah three times; and,
 therefore, repeat it only twice. The benediction is to be given only
 with three fingers. In other respects, no society can be more regular,
 or strict in its morals. They live like the quakers, and, like them, do
 not admit any other Christians into their assemblies, which is the
 reason that these have accused them of all the abominations of which the
 heathens accused the primitive Galileans: these latter, the gnostics,
 and with which the Roman catholics have charged the protestants. They
 have been frequently accused of cutting the throat of an infant, and
 drinking its blood; and of mixing together in their private ceremonies,
 without distinction of kindred, age, or even of sex. They have been
 persecuted at times, and then they shut themselves up in their hamlets,
 set fire to their houses, and thrown themselves into the flames. Peter
 took the only method of reclaiming them, which was by letting them live
 in peace.
 
 But to conclude, in all this vast empire, there are but twenty-eight
 episcopal sees; and in Peter's time there were but twenty-two. This
 small number was, perhaps, one of the causes to which the Russian church
 owes its tranquillity. So very circumscribed was the knowledge of the
 clergy, that czar Theodore, brother to Peter the Great, was the first
 who introduced the custom of singing Psalms in churches.
 
 Theodore and Peter, especially the latter, admitted indifferently, into
 their councils and their armies, those of the Greek, the Latin, the
 Lutheran, and the Calvinist communion, leaving every one at liberty to
 serve God after his own conscience, provided he did his duty to the
 state. At that time there was not one Latin church in this great empire
 of two thousand leagues, till Peter established some new manufactures at
 Astracan, when there were about sixty Roman catholic families, under the
 direction of the capuchins; but the jesuits endeavouring to establish
 themselves in his dominions, he drove them out by an edict, published in
 the month of April, 1718. He tolerated the capuchins as an insignificant
 set of monks, but considered the jesuits as dangerous politicians.
 
 The Greek church has at once the honour and satisfaction to see its
 communion extended throughout an empire of two thousand leagues in
 length, while that of Rome is not in possession of half that tract in
 Europe. Those of the Greek communion have, at all times, been
 particularly attentive to maintain an equality between theirs and the
 Latin church; and always upon their guard against the zeal of the see of
 Rome, which they look upon as ambition; because, in fact, that church,
 whose power is very much circumscribed in our hemisphere, and yet
 assumes the title of universal, has always endeavoured to act up to that
 title.
 
 The Jews never made any settlements in Russia, as they have done in most
 of the other states of Europe, from Constantinople to Rome. The Russians
 have carried on their trade by themselves, or by the help of the nations
 settled amongst them. Theirs is the only country of the Greek communion,
 where synagogues are not seen by the side of Christian temples.
 
 
 _Conclusion of the State of_ RUSSIA _before_ PETER _the_ GREAT.
 
 Russia is indebted solely to czar Peter for its great influence in the
 affairs of Europe; being of no consideration in any other reign, since
 it embraced Christianity. Before this period, the Russians made the same
 figure on the Black Sea, that the Normans did afterwards on the coasts
 of the ocean. In the reign of the emperor Heraclius, they fitted out an
 armament of forty thousand small barks; appeared before Constantinople,
 which they besieged, and imposed a tribute on the Greek emperors; but
 the grand knez Wolodimar, being wholly taken up with the care of
 establishing Christianity in his dominions, and wearied out with
 intestine broils in his own family, weakened his dominions by dividing
 them between his children. They almost all fell a prey to the Tartars,
 who held Russia in subjection near two hundred years. At length John
 Basilides freed it from slavery, and enlarged its boundaries: but, after
 his time, it was ruined again by civil wars.
 
 Before the time of Peter the Great, Russia was neither so powerful, so
 well cultivated, so populous, nor so rich as at present. It had no
 possessions in Finland, nor in Livonia; and this latter alone had long
 been worth more than all Siberia. The Cossacks were still unsubjected,
 nor were the people of Astracan reduced to obedience; what little trade
 was carried on, was rather to their disadvantage. The White Sea, the
 Baltic, the Pontus Euxinus, the sea of Azoph, and the Caspian Sea, were
 entirely useless to a nation that had not a single ship, nor even a term
 in their language to express a fleet. If nothing more had been wanting
 but to be superior to the Tartars, and the other nations of the north,
 as far as China, the Russians undoubtedly had that advantage, but they
 were to be brought upon an equality with civilized nations, and to be in
 a condition, one day, of even surpassing several of them. Such an
 undertaking appeared altogether impracticable, inasmuch as they had not
 a single ship at sea, and were absolutely ignorant of military
 discipline by land: nay, the most common manufactures were hardly
 encouraged, and agriculture itself, that _primum mobile_ of trade, was
 neglected. This requires the utmost attention and encouragement on the
 part of a government; and it is to this that the English are indebted,
 for finding in their corn a treasure far superior to their woollen
 manufacture.
 
 This gross neglect of the necessary arts, sufficiently shews that the
 people of Russia had no idea of the polite arts, which become necessary,
 in their turn, when we have cultivated the others. They might indeed,
 have sent some of the natives to gain instruction among foreigners, but
 the difference of languages, manners, and religion, opposed it. Besides,
 there was a law of state and religion, equally sacred and pernicious,
 which prohibited any Russian from going out of his country, and thus
 seemed to devote this people to eternal ignorance. They were in
 possession of the most extensive dominions in the universe, and yet
 every thing was wanted amongst them. At length Peter was born, and
 Russia became a civilized state.
 
 Happily, of all the great lawgivers who have lived in the world, Peter
 is the only one whose history is well known. Those of Theseus and
 Romulus, who did far less than him, and of the founders of all
 well-governed states, are blended with the most absurd fictions: whereas
 here, we have the advantage of written truths, which would pass for
 fictions, were they not so well attested.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. III.
 
     The ancestors of Peter the Great.
 
 
 The family of Peter the Great have been in possession of the throne ever
 since the year 1613. Before that time, Russia had undergone revolutions,
 which had retarded the reformation of her police, and the introduction
 of the liberal arts. This has been the fate of all human societies. No
 kingdom ever experienced more cruel troubles. In the year 1597, the
 tyrant Boris Godonow assassinated Demetrius (or Demetri, as he was
 called), the lawful heir, and usurped the empire. A young monk took the
 name of Demetrius, pretending to be that prince who had escaped from his
 murderers; and with the assistance of the Poles, and a considerable
 party (which every tyrant has against him), he drove out the usurper,
 and seized the crown himself. The imposture was discovered as soon as he
 came to the sovereignty, because the people were not pleased with him;
 and he was murdered. Three other false Demetrius's started up, one after
 another. Such a succession of impostors, supposes a country in the
 utmost distraction. The less men are civilized, the more easily they are
 imposed on. It may readily be conceived, how much these frauds augmented
 the public confusion and misfortunes. The Poles, who had begun the
 revolutions, by setting up the first false Demetrius, were on the point
 of being masters of Russia. The Swedes shared in the spoils on the coast
 of Finland, and laid claim to the crown. The state seemed on the verge
 of utter destruction.
 
 In the midst of these calamities, an assembly, composed of the principal
 boyards, chose for their sovereign a young man of fifteen years of age:
 this happened in 1613, and did not seem a very likely method of putting
 an end to these troubles. This young man was Michael Romanow,[18]
 grandfather to czar Peter, and son to the archbishop of Rotow, surnamed
 Philaretes, and of a nun, and related by the mother's side to the
 ancient czars.
 
 It must be observed, that this archbishop was a powerful nobleman, whom
 the tyrant Boris had obliged to become priest. His wife, Scheremetow,
 was likewise compelled to take the veil; this was the ancient custom of
 the western tyrants of the Latin church, as that of putting out the eyes
 was with the Greek Christians. The tyrant Demetrius made Philaretes
 archbishop of Rostow, and sent him ambassador to Poland, where he was
 detained prisoner by the Poles, who were then at war with the Russians;
 so little was the law of nations known to the different people of these
 times. During his father's confinement, young Romanow was elected czar.
 The archbishop was exchanged against some Polish prisoners; and, at his
 return, his son created him patriarch, and the old man was in fact king,
 under his son's name.
 
 If such a government appears extraordinary to strangers, the marriages
 of czar Michael Romanow, will seem still more so. The Russian princes
 had never intermarried with foreign states since the year 1490, or after
 they became masters of Casan and Astracan; they seem to have followed
 the Asiatic customs in almost every thing, and especially in that of
 marrying only among their own subjects.
 
 This conformity to the ancient customs of Asia, was still more
 conspicuous at the ceremonies observed at the marriage of a czar. A
 number of the most beautiful women in the provinces were sent for to
 court, where they were received by the grand gouvernante of the court,
 who provided apartments for them in her own house, where they all eat
 together. The czar paid them visits, sometimes incognito, and sometimes
 in his real character. The wedding-day was fixed, without its being
 declared on whom the choice had fallen. At the appointed time, the
 happy she was presented with a rich wedding-suit, and other dresses
 were given to the rest of the fair candidates, who then returned home.
 There have been four instances of these marriages.
 
 In this manner was Michael Romanow espoused to Eudocia, the daughter of
 a poor gentleman, named Streschneu. He was employed in ploughing his
 grounds with his servants, when the lords of the bed-chamber came to him
 with presents from the czar, and to acquaint him that his daughter was
 placed on the throne. The name of the princess is still held in the
 highest veneration by the Russians. This custom is greatly different
 from ours, but not the less respectable on that account.
 
 It is necessary to observe, that before Romanow was elected czar, a
 strong party had made choice of prince Ladislaus, son to Sigismund III.
 king of Poland. At the same time, the provinces bordering on Sweden had
 offered the crown to a brother of Gustavus Adolphus: so that Russia was
 in the same situation then in which we have so frequently seen Poland,
 where the right of electing a king has been the source of civil wars.
 But the Russians did not follow the example of the Poles, who entered
 into a compact with the prince whom they elected; notwithstanding they
 had smarted from the oppression of tyrants, yet they voluntarily
 submitted to a young man, without making any conditions with him.
 
 Russia never was an elective kingdom; but the male issue of the ancient
 sovereigns failing, and six czars, or pretenders, having perished
 miserably in the late troubles, there was, as we have observed, a
 necessity for electing a monarch; and this election occasioned fresh
 wars with Poland and Sweden, who maintained, with force of arms, their
 pretended rights to the crown of Russia. The right of governing a nation
 against its own will, can never be long supported. The Poles, on their
 side, after having advanced as far as Moscow, and exercised all the
 ravages in which the military expeditions of those times chiefly
 consisted, concluded a truce for fourteen years. By this truce, Poland
 remained in possession of the duchy of Smolensko, in which the
 Boristhenes has its source. The Swedes also made peace, in virtue of
 which they remained in possession of Ingria, and deprived the Russians
 of all communication with the Baltic Sea, so that this empire was
 separated more than ever from the rest of Europe.
 
 Michael Romanow, after this peace, reigned quietly, without making any
 alteration in the state, either to the improvement or corruption of the
 administration. After his death, which happened in 1645, his son, Alexis
 Michaelowitz (or son of Michael), ascended the throne by hereditary
 right. It may be observed, that the czars were crowned by the patriarch
 of Russia, according to the ceremonies in use at Constantinople, except
 that the patriarch of Russia, was seated on the same ascent with the
 sovereign, and constantly affected an equality highly insulting to the
 supreme power.
 
 
 ALEXIS MICHAELOWITZ.
 
 Alexis was married in the same manner as his father, and from among the
 young women presented, he chose the one who appeared the most amiable in
 his eyes. He married a daughter of the boyard Meloslauski, in 1647; his
 second wife, whom he married in 1671, was of the family of Nariskin, and
 his favourite Morosow was married to another. There cannot be a more
 suitable title found for this favourite than that of vizier, for he
 governed the empire in a despotic manner; and, by his great power,
 excited several commotions among the strelitzes and the populace, as
 frequently happens at Constantinople.
 
 The reign of Alexis was disturbed by bloody insurrections, and by
 domestic and foreign wars. A chief of the Don Cossacks, named
 Stenko-Rasin, endeavoured to make himself king of Astracan, and was for
 a long time very formidable; but, being at length defeated and taken
 prisoner, he ended his life by the hands of the executioner; like all
 those of this stamp, who have nothing to expect but a throne or a
 scaffold. About twelve thousand of his adherents are said to have been
 hanged on the high road to Astracan. In this part of the world, men
 being uninfluenced by morality, were to be governed only by rigour; and
 from this severity, frequently carried on to a degree of cruelty, arose
 slavery, and a secret thirst of revenge.
 
 Alexis had a war with the Poles that proved successful, and terminated
 in a peace, which secured to him the possession of Smolensko, Kiow, and
 the Ukraine: but he was unfortunate against the Swedes, and the
 boundaries of the Russian empire were contracted within a very narrow
 compass on that side of the kingdom.
 
 The Turks were at that time his most formidable enemies: they invaded
 Poland, and threatened the dominions of the czar that bordered upon Crim
 Tartary, the ancient Taurica Chersonesus. In 1671, they took the
 important city of Kaminiek, and all that belonged to Poland in the
 Ukraine. The Cossacks of that country, ever averse to subjection, knew
 not whether they belonged to the Turks, Poland, or Russia. Sultan
 Mahomet IV. who had conquered the Poles, and had just imposed a tribute
 upon them, demanded, with all the haughtiness of an Ottoman victor, that
 the czar should evacuate his possessions in the Ukraine, but received as
 haughty a denial from that prince. Men did not know at that time how to
 disguise their pride, by an outside of civility. The sultan, in his
 letter, styled the sovereign of the Russias only Christian Hospodar, and
 entitled himself 'most gracious majesty, king of the universe.' The czar
 replied in these terms, 'that he scorned to submit to a Mahometan dog,
 and that his scimetar was as good as the grand seignior's sabre.'
 
 Alexis at that time formed a design which seemed to presage the
 influence which the Russian empire would one day obtain in the Christian
 world. He sent ambassadors to the pope, and to almost all the great
 sovereigns in Europe, excepting France (which was in alliance with the
 Turks), in order to establish a league against the Ottoman Porte. His
 ambassadors at the court of Rome succeeded only in not being obliged to
 kiss the pope's toe; and in other courts they met with only unprofitable
 good wishes; the quarrels of the Christian princes between themselves,
 and the jarring interests arising from those quarrels, having constantly
 prevented them from uniting against the common enemy of Christianity.
 
 In the mean time, the Turks threatened to chastise the Poles, who
 refused to pay their tribute: czar Alexis assisted on the side of Crim
 Tartary, and John Sobieski, general of the crown, wiped off his
 country's stain in the blood of the Turks, at the famous battle of
 Choczim,[19] in 1674, which paved his way to the throne. Alexis
 disputed this very throne with him, and proposed to unite his extensive
 dominions to Poland, as the Jagellons had done; but in regard to
 Lithuania, the greatness of his offer was the cause of its being
 rejected. He is said to have been very deserving of the new kingdom, by
 the manner in which he governed his own. He was the first who caused a
 body of laws to be digested in Russia, though imperfect; and introduced
 both linen and silk manufactures, which indeed were not long kept up;
 nevertheless, he had the merit of their first establishment. He peopled
 the deserts about the Wolga and the Kama, with Lithuanian, Polish, and
 Tartarian families, whom he had taken prisoners in his wars: before his
 reign, all prisoners of war were the slaves of those to whose lot they
 fell. Alexis employed them in agriculture: he did his utmost endeavours
 to introduce discipline among his troops. In a word, he was worthy of
 being the father of Peter the Great; but he had no time to perfect what
 he had begun, being snatched away by a sudden death, at the age of
 forty-six, in the beginning of the year 1677, according to our style,
 which is eleven days forwarder than that of Russia.
 
 
 FOEDOR, or THEODORE ALEXIOWITZ.
 
 Upon the death of Alexis, son of Michael, all fell again into confusion.
 He left, by his first marriage, two princes, and six princesses.
 Theodore, the eldest, ascended the throne at fifteen years of age. He
 was a prince of a weak and sickly constitution, but of merit superior to
 his bodily infirmities. His father Alexis had caused him to be
 acknowledged his successor, a year before his death: a conduct observed
 by the kings of France from Hugh Capet down to Lewis the Young, and by
 many other crowned heads.
 
 The second son of Alexis was Iwan, or John, who was still worse treated
 by nature than his brother Theodore, being almost blind and dumb, very
 infirm, and frequently attacked with convulsions. Of six daughters, born
 of this first marriage, the only one who made any figure in Europe was
 the princess Sophia, who was remarkable for her great talents; but
 unhappily still more so for the mischief she intended against Peter the
 Great.
 
 Alexis, by his second marriage with another of his subjects, daughter of
 the boyard Nariskin, had Peter and the princess Nathalia. Peter was born
 the 30th of May (or the 10th of June new stile), in the year 1672, and
 was but four years old when he lost his father. As the children of a
 second marriage were not much regarded in Russia, it was little expected
 that he would one day mount the throne.
 
 It had ever been the character of the family of Romanow to civilize
 their state. It was also that of Theodore. We have already remarked, in
 speaking of Moscow, that this prince encouraged the inhabitants of that
 city to build a great number of stone houses. He likewise enlarged that
 capital, and made several useful regulations in the general police; but,
 by attempting to reform the boyards, he made them all his enemies:
 besides, he was not possessed of sufficient knowledge, vigour, or
 resolution, to venture upon making a general reformation. The war with
 the Turks, or rather with the Crim Tartars, in which he was constantly
 engaged with alternate success, would not permit a prince of his weak
 state of health to attempt so great a work. Theodore, like the rest of
 his predecessors, married one of his own subjects, a native of the
 frontiers of Poland; but having lost her in less than a year after
 their nuptials, he took for his second wife, in 1682, Martha Matweowna,
 daughter of the secretary Nariskin.[20] Some months after this marriage,
 he was seized with the disorder which ended his days, and died without
 leaving any children. As the czars married without regard to birth, they
 might likewise (at least at that time) appoint a successor without
 respect to primogeniture. The dignity of consort and heir to the
 sovereign seemed to be entirely the reward of merit; and, in that
 respect, the custom of this empire was much preferable to the customs of
 more civilized states.
 
 Theodore, before he expired, seeing that his brother Iwan was by his
 natural infirmities incapable of governing, nominated his younger
 brother Peter, heir to the empire of Russia. Peter, who was then only in
 his tenth year, had already given the most promising hopes.
 
 If, on the one hand, the custom of raising a subject to the rank of
 czarina, was favourable to the females, there was another which was no
 less hard upon them; namely, that the daughters of the czars were very
 seldom married, but were most of them obliged to pass their lives in a
 monastery.
 
 The princess Sophia, third daughter of czar Alexis, by his first
 marriage, was possessed of abilities, equally great and dangerous.
 Perceiving that her brother Theodore had not long to live, she did not
 retire to a convent; but finding herself situated between two brothers,
 one of whom was incapable of governing, through his natural inability;
 and the other, on account of his youth, she conceived the design of
 placing herself at the head of the empire. Hence, in the last hours of
 czar Theodore, she attempted to act the part that Pulcheria had formerly
 played with her brother, the emperor Theodosius.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. IV.
 
     JOHN AND PETER.
 
     Horrible Sedition among the Strelitzes.[21]
 
 
 [Sidenote: 1682.]
 
 Czar Theodore's eyes were scarcely closed, when the nomination of a
 prince of only ten years old to the throne, the exclusion of the elder
 brother, and the intrigues of the princess Sophia, their sister, excited
 a most bloody revolt among the strelitzes. Never did the janissaries,
 nor the praetorian guards, exercise more horrible barbarities. The
 insurrection began two days after the interment of Theodore, when they
 all ran to arms in the Kremlin, which is the imperial palace at Moscow.
 There they began with accusing nine of their colonels, for keeping back
 part of their pay. The ministry was obliged to break the colonels, and
 to pay the strelitzes the money they demanded: but this did not satisfy
 them, they insisted upon having these nine officers delivered up to
 them, and condemned them, by a majority of votes, to suffer the Battogs,
 or Knout; the manner of which punishment is as follows:--
 
 The delinquent is stripped naked, and laid flat on his belly, while two
 executioners beat him over the back with switches, or small canes, till
 the judge, who stands by to see the sentence put in execution, says, 'It
 is enough.' The colonels, after being thus treated by their men, were
 obliged to return them thanks, according to the custom of the eastern
 nations; where criminals, after undergoing their punishment, must kiss
 the judge's hand. Besides complying with this custom, the officers gave
 them a sum of money, which was something more than the custom.
 
 While the strelitzes thus began to make themselves formidable, the
 princess Sophia, who secretly encouraged them, in order to lead them by
 degrees from crime to crime, held a meeting at her house, consisting of
 the princesses of the blood, the generals of the army, the boyards, the
 patriarch, the bishops, and even some of the principal merchants; where
 she represented to them, that prince John, by right of birth and merit,
 was entitled to the empire, the reins of which she intended to keep in
 her own hands. At the breaking up of the assembly, she caused a promise
 to be made to the strelitzes, of an augmentation of pay, besides
 considerable presents. Her emissaries were in particular employed to
 stir up the soldiery against the Nariskin family, especially the two
 brothers of the young dowager czarina, the mother of Peter the First.
 These persuaded the strelitzes, that one of the brothers, named John,
 had put on the imperial robes, had seated himself on the throne, and had
 attempted to strangle prince John; adding, moreover, that the late czar
 Theodore had been poisoned by a villain, named Daniel Vongad, a Dutch
 physician. At last Sophia put into their hands a list of forty noblemen,
 whom she stiled enemies to their corps, and to the state, and as such
 worthy of death. These proceedings exactly resembled the proscriptions
 of Sylla, and the Roman triumvirate, which had been revived by
 Christian II. in Denmark and Sweden. This may serve to shew, that such
 cruelties prevail in all countries in times of anarchy and confusion.
 The mutineers began the tragedy with throwing the two knez, or princes,
 Dolgorouki and Matheof, out of the palace-windows; whom the strelitzes
 received upon the points of their spears, then stripped them, and
 dragged their dead bodies into the great square; after this they rushed
 into the palace, where meeting with Athanasius Nariskin, a brother of
 the young czarina, and one of the uncles of czar Peter, they murdered
 him in like manner; then breaking open the door of a neighbouring
 church, where three of the proscribed persons had taken refuge, they
 drag them from the altar, strip them naked, and stab them to death with
 knives.
 
 They were so blinded with their fury, that seeing a young nobleman of
 the family of Soltikoff, a great favourite of theirs, and who was not
 included in the list of the proscribed, and some of them mistaking him
 for John Nariskin, whom they were in search of, they murdered him upon
 the spot; and what plainly shews the manners of those times, after
 having discovered their error, they carried the body of young Soltikoff,
 to his father to bury it; and the wretched parent, far from daring to
 complain, gave them a considerable reward for bringing him the mangled
 body of his son. Being reproached by his wife, his daughters, and the
 widow of the deceased, for his weakness, 'Let us wait for an opportunity
 of being revenged,' said the old man. These words being overheard by
 some of the soldiers, they returned furiously back into the room,
 dragged the aged parent by the hair, and cut his throat at his own door.
 
 Another party of the strelitzes, who were scouring the city in search
 of the Dutch physician, Vongad, met with his son, of whom they inquired
 for his father; the youth trembling, replied, he did not know where he
 was, upon which they immediately dispatched him. Soon after, a German
 physician falling in their way, 'You are a doctor,' said they, 'and if
 you did not poison our master, Theodore, you have poisoned others, and
 therefore merit death;' and thereupon killed him.
 
 At length they found the Dutchman, of whom they were in quest, disguised
 in the garb of a beggar; they instantly drag him before the palace. The
 princesses who loved this worthy man, and placed great confidence in his
 skill, begged the strelitzes to spare him, assuring them that he was a
 very good physician, and had taken all possible care of their brother
 Theodore. The strelitzes made answer, that he not only deserved to die
 as a physician, but also as a sorcerer; and that they had found in his
 house, a great dried toad, and the skin of a serpent. They furthermore
 required to have young Nariskin delivered up to them, whom they had
 searched for in vain for two days: alleging, that he was certainly in
 the palace, and that they would set fire to it, unless he was put into
 their hands. The sister of John Nariskin, and the other princesses,
 terrified by their menaces, went to acquaint their unhappy brother in
 the place of his concealment, with what had passed; upon which the
 patriarch heard his confession, administers the viaticum, and extreme
 unction to him, and then, taking an image of the blessed Virgin, which
 was said to perform miracles, he leads the young man forth by the hand,
 and presents him to the strelitzes, shewing them, at the same time, the
 image of the Virgin. The princesses, who in tears surrounded Nariskin,
 falling upon their knees before the soldiers, besought them, in the name
 of the blessed Virgin, to spare their relation's life; but the inhuman
 wretches tore him from their arms, and dragged him to the foot of the
 stairs, together with the physician Vongad, where they held a kind of
 tribunal among themselves, and condemned them both to be put to the
 torture. One of the soldiers, who could write, drew up a form of
 accusation, and sentenced the two unfortunate princes to be cut in
 pieces; a punishment inflicted in China and Tartary on parricides, and
 called the punishment of ten thousand slices. After having thus used
 Nariskin and Vongad, they exposed their heads, feet, and hands, on the
 iron points of a balustrade.
 
 While this party of the strelitzes were thus glutting their fury in the
 sight of the princesses, the rest massacred every one who was obnoxious
 to them, or suspected by the princess Sophia.
 
 This horrid tragedy concluded with proclaiming the two princes, John and
 Peter, in June, 1682, joint sovereigns, and associating their sister
 Sophia with them, in the quality of co-regent; who then publicly
 approved of all their outrages, gave them rewards, confiscated the
 estates of the proscribed, and bestowed them upon their murderers. She
 even permitted them to erect a monument, with the names of the persons
 they had murdered, as being traitors to their country: and to crown all,
 she published letters-patent, thanking them for their zeal and
 fidelity.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. V.
 
     Administration of the princess Sophia. Extraordinary quarrel about
     religion. A conspiracy.
 
 
 Such were the steps by which the princess Sophia did in effect ascend
 the throne of Russia, though without being declared czarina; and such
 the examples that Peter the First had before his eyes. Sophia enjoyed
 all the honours of a sovereign; her bust was on the public coin; she
 signed all dispatches, held the first place in council, and enjoyed a
 power without control. She was possessed of a great share of
 understanding, and some wit; made verses in the Russian language, and
 both spoke and wrote extremely well. These talents were set off by the
 addition of an agreeable person, and sullied only by her ambition.
 
 She procured a wife for her brother John, in the manner already
 described in several examples. A young lady named Soltikoff, of the
 family with the nobleman of that name who had been assassinated by the
 seditious strelitzes, was sent for from the heart of Siberia, where her
 father commanded a fortress, to be presented to czar John at Moscow. Her
 beauty triumphed over all the intrigues of her rivals, and John was
 married to her in 1684. At every marriage of a czar we seem to read the
 history of Ahasuerus, or that of Theodosius the Younger.
 
 In the midst of the rejoicings on account of this marriage, the
 strelitzes raised a new insurrection, and (who would believe it?) on
 account of religion! of a particular tenet! Had they been mere soldiers,
 they would never have become controvertists, but they were also
 citizens of Moscow. Whosoever has, or assumes a right of speaking in an
 authoritative manner to the populace, may found a sect. This has been
 seen in all ages, and all parts of the world, especially since the
 passion of dogmatizing has become the instrument of ambition, and the
 terror of weak minds.
 
 Russia had experienced some previous disturbances on occasion of a
 dispute, whether the sign of the cross was to be made with three
 fingers, or with two! One Abakum, who was also a priest, had set up some
 new tenets at Moscow, in regard to the Holy Spirit; which according to
 the Scriptures, enlightened all the faithful; as likewise with respect
 to the equality of the primitive Christians, and these words of
 Christ:--'There shall be amongst you neither first nor last.' Several
 citizens and many of the strelitzes, embraced the opinions of Abakum.
 One Raspop[22] was the chief of this party, which became considerable.
 The sectaries, at length, entered (July 16, 1682, new stile) the
 cathedral, where the patriarch and his clergy were officiating; drove
 them out of the church with stones, and seated themselves very devoutly
 in their places, to receive the Holy Spirit. They called the patriarch
 the 'ravenous wolf in the sheepfold;' a title which all sects have
 liberally bestowed on each other. The princess Sophia, and the two
 czars, were immediately made acquainted with these disturbances: and the
 other strelitzes, who were staunch to the good old cause, were given to
 understand, that the czars and the church were in danger. Upon this the
 strelitzes and burghers of the patriarchal party attacked the
 Abakumists: but a stop was put to the carnage, by publishing a
 convocation of a council, which was immediately assembled in a hall of
 the palace. This took up very little time, for they obliged every priest
 they met to attend. The patriarch, and a bishop, disputed against
 Raspop; but at the second syllogism, they began to throw stones at one
 another. The council ended with ordering Raspop, and some of his
 faithful disciples to have their heads struck off; and the sentence was
 executed by the sole order of the three sovereigns, Sophia, John, and
 Peter.
 
 During these troubles, there was a knez, named Chowanskoi, who having
 been instrumental in raising the princess Sophia to the dignity she then
 held, wanted, as a reward for his services, to have a share in the
 administration.
 
 It may be supposed, that he found Sophia not so grateful as he could
 wish; upon which he espoused the cause of religion, and the persecuted
 Raspopians, and stirred up a party among the strelitzes and the people,
 in defence of God's name.
 
 This conspiracy proved a more serious affair than the enthusiastic riot
 of Raspop. An ambitious hypocrite always carries things farther than a
 simple fanatic. Chowanskoi aimed at no less than the imperial dignity;
 and to rid himself of all cause of fear, he resolved to murder the two
 czars, Sophia, the other princesses, and every one who was attached to
 the imperial family. The czars and the princesses were obliged to retire
 to the monastery of the Holy Trinity, within twelve leagues of
 Petersburg.[23] This was, at the same time, a convent, a palace, and a
 fortress, like Mount Cassino,[24] Corhy,[25] Fulda,[26] Kempten,[27]
 and several others belonging to the Latin church. This monastery of the
 Trinity belongs to the monks of St. Basil. It is surrounded by deep
 ditches, and ramparts of brick, on which is planted a numerous
 artillery. The monks are possessed of all the country round for four
 leagues. The imperial family were in full safety there, but more on
 account of the strength, than the sanctity of the place. Here Sophia
 treated with the rebel knez; and having decoyed him half way, caused his
 head to be struck off, together with those of one of his sons, and
 thirty-seven strelitzes who accompanied him.
 
 [Sidenote: 1682.]
 
 The body of strelitzes upon this news, fly to arms, and march to attack
 the convent of Trinity, threatening to destroy every thing that came in
 their way. The imperial family stood upon their defence; the boyards arm
 their vassals, all the gentlemen flocked in, and a bloody civil war
 seemed on the point of beginning. The patriarch somewhat pacified the
 strelitzes, who began to be intimidated with the number of troops that
 were marching towards them on all sides: in short, their fury was
 changed into fear, and their fear into the most abject submission; a
 change common to the multitude. Three thousand seven hundred of this
 corps, followed by their wives and children, with ropes tied about their
 necks, went in procession to the convent of the Trinity, which three
 days before they had threatened to burn to the ground. In this
 condition, these unhappy wretches present themselves before the gate of
 the convent, two by two, one carrying a block and another an axe; and
 prostrating themselves on the ground, waited for their sentence. They
 were pardoned upon their submission, and returned back to Moscow,
 blessing their sovereigns; and still disposed, though unknown to
 themselves, to commit the same crime upon the very first opportunity.
 
 These commotions being subsided, the state resumed an exterior of
 tranquillity; but Sophia still remained possessed of the chief
 authority, leaving John to his incapacity, and keeping Peter in the
 subjection of a ward. In order to strengthen her power, she shared it
 with Prince Basil Galitzin, whom she created generalissimo, minister of
 state, and lord keeper. Galitzin was in every respect superior to any
 person in that distracted court: he was polite, magnificent, full of
 great designs, more learned than any of his countrymen, as having
 received a much better education, and was even master of the Latin
 tongue, which was, at that time, almost entirely unknown in Russia. He
 was of an active and indefatigable spirit, had a genius superior to the
 times he lived in, and capable, had he had leisure and power, as he had
 inclination, to have changed the face of things in Russia. This is the
 eulogium given of him by La Neuville, at that time the Polish envoy in
 Russia; and the encomiums of foreigners are seldom to be suspected.
 
 This minister bridled the insolence of the strelitzes, by distributing
 the most mutinous of that body among the several regiments in the
 Ukraine, in Casan, and Siberia. It was under his administration that the
 Poles, long the rivals of Russia, gave up, in 1686, all pretensions to
 the large provinces of Smolensko and the Ukraine. He was the first who
 sent an embassy to France, in 1687; a country which had, for upwards of
 twenty years, been in the zenith of its glory, by the conquests, new
 establishments, and the magnificence of Lewis XIV. and especially by the
 improvement of the arts, there can be not only external grandeur, but
 solid glory. France had not then entered into any correspondence with
 Russia, or rather was unacquainted with that empire; and the academy of
 inscriptions ordered a medal to be struck to commemorate this embassy,
 as if it had come from the most distant part of the Indies; but
 notwithstanding all this, the ambassador Dolgorouski miscarried in his
 negotiation, and even suffered some gross affronts on account of the
 behaviour of his domestics, whose mistakes it would have been better to
 have overlooked; but the court of Lewis XIV. could not then foresee,
 that France and Russia would one day reckon among the number of their
 advantages, that of being cemented by the closest union.
 
 Russia was now quiet at home, but she was still pent up on the side of
 Sweden, though enlarged towards Poland, her new ally, in continual
 alarms on the side of Crim Tartary, and at variance with China in regard
 to the frontiers.
 
 The most intolerable circumstance for their empire, and which plainly
 shewed, that it had not yet attained to a vigorous and regular
 administration, was, that the khan of the Crim Tartars exacted an annual
 tribute of 6000 rubles, in the nature of that which the Turk had imposed
 on the Poles.
 
 Crim Tartary is the ancient Taurica Chersonesus, formerly so famous by
 the commerce of the Greeks, and still more by their fables, a fruitful
 but barbarous country. It took its name of Crimea, or Crim, from the
 title of its first khans, who took this name before the conquests of the
 sons of Gengis Khan. To free his country from this yoke, and wipe off
 the disgrace of such tribute, the prime minister, Galitzin, marched in
 person (1687, 1688,) into Crim Tartary, at the head of a numerous army.
 These armies were not to be compared to the present troops; they had no
 discipline; there was hardly one regiment completely armed; they had no
 uniform clothing, no regularity: their men indeed were inured to hard
 labour and a scarcity of provisions, but then they carried with them
 such a prodigious quantity of baggage, as far exceeded any thing of the
 kind in our camps, where the greatest luxury prevails. Their vast
 numbers of waggons for carrying ammunition and provisions, in an
 uninhabitable and desert country, greatly retarded the expedition
 against Crim Tartary. The army found itself in the midst of the vast
 deserts, on the river Samara, unprovided with magazines. Here Galitzin
 did what in my opinion, was never done any where else: he employed
 thirty thousand men in building a town on the banks of the Samara, to
 serve as a place for magazines in the ensuing campaign: it was begun in
 one year, and finished in the third month of the following; the houses
 indeed were all wood except two, which were brick; the ramparts were of
 turf, but well lined with artillery; and the whole place was in a
 tolerable state of defence.
 
 This was all that was done of any consequence in this ruinous
 expedition. In the mean while Sophia continued to govern in Moscow,
 while John had only the name of czar; and Peter, now at the age of
 seventeen, had already the courage to aim at real sovereignty. La
 Neuville, the Polish envoy, then resident at Moscow, and who was
 eye-witness to all that passed, pretends that Sophia and Galitzin had
 engaged the new chief of the strelitzes, to sacrifice to them their
 young czar: it appears, at least, that six hundred of these strelitzes
 were to have made themselves masters of his person. The private memoirs
 which have been entrusted to my perusal by the court of Russia, affirm,
 that a scheme had actually been laid to murder Peter the First: the blow
 was on the point of being struck, and Russia for ever deprived of the
 new existence she has since received. The czar was once more obliged to
 take refuge in the convent of the Trinity, the usual asylum of the court
 when threatened by the soldiers. There he assembled the boyards of his
 party, raised a body of forces, treats with the captains of the
 strelitzes, and called in the assistance of certain Germans, who had
 been long settled in Moscow, and were all attached to his person from
 his having already shewn himself the encourager of strangers. Sophia and
 John, who continued at Moscow, used every means to engage the strelitzes
 to remain firm to their interests; but the cause of young Peter, who
 loudly complained of an attempt meditated against himself and his
 mother, prevailed over that of the princess, and of a czar, whose very
 aspect alienated all hearts. All the acomplices were punished with a
 severity to which that country was as much accustomed as to the crimes
 which occasioned it. Some were beheaded after undergoing the punishment
 of the knout or battocks. The chief of the strelitzes was put to death
 in the same manner, and several other suspected persons had their
 tongues cut out. Prince Galitzin escaped with his life, through the
 intercession of one of his relations, who was a favourite of czar Peter;
 but he was stripped of all his riches, which were immense, and banished
 to a place in the neighbourhood of Archangel. La Neuville, who was
 present at the whole of this catastrophe, relates, that the sentence
 pronounced upon Galitzin was in these terms: 'Thou art commanded, by the
 most clement czar, to repair to Karga, a town under the pole, and there
 to continue the remainder of thy days. His majesty, out of his extreme
 goodness, allows thee three pence per day for thy subsistence.'
 
 There is no town under the pole. Karga is in the 62nd degree of
 latitude, and only six degrees and a half further north than Moscow.
 Whoever pronounced this sentence must have been a very bad geographer.
 La Neuville was probably imposed upon by a false account.
 
 1689.] At length the princess Sophia was once more sent back to her
 monastery at Moscow,[28] after having so long held the reins of
 government; and this revolution proved, to a woman of her disposition, a
 sufficient punishment.
 
 From this instant Peter began to reign in reality; his brother John
 having no other share in the government, but that of seeing his name to
 all public acts. He led a retired life, and died in 1696.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. VI.
 
     The reign of Peter the First.--Beginning of the grand reformation.
 
 
 Peter the Great was tall, genteel, well made, with a noble aspect,
 piercing eyes and a robust constitution, fitted for all kinds of
 hardship and bodily exercise. He had a sound understanding, which is the
 basis of all real abilities; and to this was joined an active
 disposition, which prompted him to undertake and execute the greatest
 things. His education was far from being worthy of his genius. The
 princess Sophia was, in a peculiar manner, interested to let him remain
 in ignorance, and to indulge himself in those excesses which youth,
 idleness, custom, and the high rank he held, made but too allowable.
 Nevertheless, he had been lately married, (June 1689) like others of his
 predecessors, to one of his own subjects, the daughter of colonel
 Lapuchin; but, as he was young, and for some time enjoyed none of the
 prerogatives of the crown, but that of indulging his pleasures without
 restraint, the ties of wedlock were not always sufficient to keep him
 within just bounds. The pleasures of the table, in which he indulged
 himself rather too freely, with foreigners, who had been invited to
 Moscow by prince Galitzin, seemed not to presage that he would one day
 become the reformer of his country; however, in spite of bad examples,
 and even the allurements of pleasure, he applied himself to the arts of
 war and government, and which, even then, shewed that he had the seeds
 of greatness in him.
 
 It was still less expected, that a prince, who was subject to such a
 constitutional dread of water, as to subject him to cold sweats, and
 even convulsions, when he was obliged to cross a small river or brook,
 should become one of the best seamen in all the north. In order to
 get the better of nature, he began by jumping into the water,
 notwithstanding the horror he felt at it, till at length this aversion
 was changed into a fondness for that element.[29]
 
 He often blushed at the ignorance in which he had been brought up. He
 learned, almost of himself, without the help of a master, enough of
 German and high Dutch, to be able to write and explain himself tolerably
 well in both those languages. The Germans and Dutch appeared to him as
 the most civilized nations, because the former had already erected, in
 Moscow, some of those arts and manufactures which he was desirous of
 seeing established in his empire, and the latter excelled in the art of
 navigation, which he already began to look upon as the most necessary of
 all others.
 
 Such were the dispositions which Peter cherished, notwithstanding the
 follies of his youth. At the same time, he found himself disturbed by
 factions at home, had the turbulent spirit of the strelitzes to keep
 under, and an almost uninterrupted war to manage against the Crim
 Tartars. For though hostilities had been suspended in 1689, by a truce,
 it had no long continuance.
 
 During this interval, Peter became confirmed in his design of
 introducing the arts into his country.
 
 His father Alexis had, in his lifetime, entertained the same views, but
 he wanted leisure, and a favourable opportunity to carry them into
 execution; he transmitted his genius to his son, who was more
 clear-sighted, more vigorous, and more unshaken by difficulties and
 obstacles.
 
 Alexis had been at a great expense in sending for Bothler,[30] a ship
 builder and sea captain, from Holland, together with a number of
 shipwrights and sailors. These built a large frigate and a yacht upon
 the Wolga, which they navigated down that river to Astracan, where they
 were to be employed in building more vessels, for carrying on an
 advantageous trade with Persia, by the Caspian Sea. Just at this time
 the revolt of Stenko-Rasin broke out, and this rebel destroyed these two
 vessels, which he ought to have preserved for his own sake, and murdered
 the captain; the rest of the crew fled into Persia, from whence they got
 to some settlements belonging to the Dutch East India company. A
 master-builder, who was a good shipwright, staid behind in Russia, where
 he lived a long time in obscurity.
 
 One day, Peter taking a walk at Ishmaelof, a summer-palace built by his
 grandfather, he perceived, among several other rarities, an old English
 shallop, which had lain entirely neglected: upon which he asked
 Timmerman, a German, and his mathematical teacher, how came that little
 boat to be of so different a construction from any he had seen on the
 Moska? Timmerman replied, that it was made to go with sails and oars.
 The young prince wanted instantly to make a trial of it; but it was
 first to be repaired and rigged. Brant, the ship-builder abovementioned,
 was by accident found out at Moscow, where he lived retired; he soon put
 the boat in order, and worked her upon the river Yauza, which washes the
 suburbs of the town.
 
 Peter caused his boat to be removed to a great lake, in the
 neighbourhood of the convent of the Trinity; he likewise made Brant
 build two more frigates, and three yachts, and piloted them himself. A
 considerable time afterwards, viz. in 1694, he made a journey to
 Archangel, and having ordered a small vessel to be built in that port,
 by the same Brant, he embarked therein on the Frozen Sea, which no
 sovereign beside himself had ever beheld. On this occasion, he was
 escorted by a Dutch man of war, under the command of captain Jolson, and
 attended by all the merchant-vessels then in the port of Archangel. He
 had already learned the manner of working a ship; and, notwithstanding
 the pains his courtiers took to imitate their master, he was the only
 one who made a proficiency in it.
 
 He found it no less difficult to raise a well disciplined body of land
 forces, on whom he could depend, than to establish a navy. His first
 essay in navigation, on a lake, previous to his journey to Archangel,
 was looked upon only as the amusements of a young prince of genius; and
 his first attempt to form a body of disciplined troops, likewise
 appeared as nothing more than that of diversion. This happened during
 the regency of the princess Sophia; and, had he been suspected of
 meaning any thing serious by this amusement, it might have been attended
 with fatal consequences to him.
 
 He placed his confidence in a foreigner, the celebrated Le Fort, of a
 noble and ancient family in Piedmont, transplanted near two centuries
 ago to Geneva, where they have filled the most considerable posts in the
 state. He was intended to have been brought up to the trade, to which
 the town is indebted for the figure it now makes; having formerly been
 known only as the seat of religious controversies.
 
 But his genius, which prompted him to the greatest undertakings, engaged
 him to quit his father's house at the age of fourteen; and he served
 four months[31] in quality of a cadet in the citadel of Marseilles; from
 thence he went to Holland, where he served some time as a volunteer, and
 was wounded at the siege of Grave, a strong fortified town on the Meuse,
 which the prince of Orange, afterwards king of England, retook from
 Lewis XIV. in 1674. After this, led by hopes of preferment, wherever he
 could find it, he embarked with a German colonel, named Verstin, who had
 obtained a commission from Peter's father, the czar Alexis, to raise
 soldiers in the Netherlands, and bring them to Archangel. But, when he
 arrived at that port, after a most fatiguing and dangerous navigation,
 the czar Alexis was no more; the government was changed, and Russia in
 confusion. The governor of Archangel suffered Verstin, Le Fort, and his
 whole troop, to remain a long time, in the utmost poverty and distress,
 and even threatened to send them into the extremity of Siberia; upon
 which every man shifted for himself. Le Fort, in want of every thing,
 repaired to Moscow, where he waited upon the Danish resident, named De
 Horn, who made him his secretary: there he learned the Russian language,
 and some time afterwards found means to be introduced to the czar Peter;
 the elder brother, Iwan, not being a person for his purpose. Peter was
 taken with him, and immediately gave him a company of foot. Le Fort had
 seen very little service, he knew but little of letters, not having
 studied any particular art or science; but he had seen a great deal, and
 had a talent of making the most of what he saw. Like the czar, he owed
 every thing to his own genius; he understood the German and Dutch
 languages, which Peter was learning, as those of two nations that might
 be of service in his designs. Every thing conspired to make him
 agreeable to Peter, to whom he strictly attached himself. From being the
 companion of his pleasures, he became his favourite, and confirmed
 himself in that station by his abilities. The czar made him his
 confidant in the most dangerous design that a prince of that country
 could possibly form, namely, that of putting himself in a condition to
 be able one day to break the seditious and barbarous body of forces
 called the strelitzes. It had cost the great sultan or basha Osman his
 life, for attempting to disband the janissaries. Peter, young as he was,
 went to work in a much abler manner than Osman.
 
 He began with forming, at his country-seat at Preobrazinski, a company
 of fifty of his youngest domestics; and some young gentlemen, the sons
 of boyards, were chosen for their officers: but, in order to teach these
 young noblemen a subordination, to which they were wholly unaccustomed,
 he made them pass through all the different military degrees, and
 himself set them the example, by serving first as a drum, then as a
 private soldier, a serjeant, and a lieutenant of the company. Nothing
 was ever more extraordinary, nor more useful, than this conduct. The
 Russians had hitherto made war in the same manner as our ancestors at
 the time of the feudal tenures, when the unexperienced nobles took the
 field at the head of their vassals, undisciplined, and ill armed: a
 barbarous method, sufficient indeed to act against the like armies, but
 of no use against regular troops.
 
 This company, which was formed wholly by Peter himself, soon increased
 in numbers, and became afterwards the regiment of Preobrazinski guards.
 Another regiment, formed on the same plan, became in time the regiment
 of Semeniousky guards.
 
 The czar had already a regiment of five thousand men that could be
 depended upon, trained by general Gordon, a Scotchman, and composed
 almost entirely of foreigners. Le Fort, who had borne arms but a short
 time, but whose capacity was equal to every thing, undertook to raise a
 regiment of twelve thousand men, which he effected: five colonels were
 appointed to serve under him, and he saw himself on a sudden general of
 this little army, which had been raised, as much to oppose the
 strelitzes, as the enemies of the state.
 
 One thing worthy of being remarked,[32] and which fully confutes the
 hasty error of those who pretend that France lost very few of its
 inhabitants by the revocation of the edict of Nantz, is, that one-third
 of his army, which was only called a regiment, consisted of French
 refugees. Le Fort disciplined his new troops, as if he had been all his
 lifetime a soldier.
 
 Peter was desirous of seeing one of those images of war, the mock
 fights, which had lately been introduced in times of peace: a fort was
 erected, which was to be attacked by one part of his new troops, and
 defended by the other. The difference between this fight, and others of
 the like nature, was, that instead of a sham engagement, there was a
 real one, in which some of his men were slain, and a great many
 wounded.[33] Le Fort, who commanded the attack, received a considerable
 wound. These bloody sports were intended to initiate the young troops
 into the service of the field; but it required much labour, and even
 some degree of sufferings to compass this end.
 
 These warlike amusements did not take off the czar's attention to his
 naval project. As he had made Le Fort a general by land, notwithstanding
 his having never borne a command; he now made him admiral, though he had
 never had the direction of a ship, but he knew him deserving both of the
 one and the other. It is true, that he was an admiral without a fleet,
 and a general with only his regiment for an army.
 
 By degrees the czar reformed that great abuse in the army, viz. the
 independence of the boyards, who, in time of war, used to bring into the
 field a multitude of their vassals and peasants: this was exactly the
 ancient government of the Franks, Huns, Goths, and Vandals, who indeed
 subdued the Roman empire in its state of decline, but would have been
 totally destroyed, had they had the warlike disciplined legions of
 ancient Rome to encounter, or such armies as are now brought into the
 field.
 
 Admiral Le Fort was not long, however, before he had something more than
 an empty title. He employed some Dutchmen and Venetians in building a
 number of barcolongos, or kind of long barks, and also two ships of
 about thirty guns each, at the mouth of the Woronitz, which falls into
 the Tanais, or Don: these vessels were to fall down the river, and keep
 in awe the Crim Tartars, with whom hostilities had been renewed.
 
 The czar was now to determine (in 1689) against which of the following
 powers he would declare war, whether against the Turks, the Swedes, or
 the Chinese. But here it will be proper to premise on what terms he then
 stood with China, and which was the first treaty of peace concluded by
 that nation.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. VII.
 
     Congress and Treaty with the Chinese.[34]
 
 
 We must set out by forming a proper idea of the limits of the Chinese
 and Russian empires at this period. When we leave Siberia, properly so
 called, and also far behind us to the south, a hundred hordes of
 Tartars, with white and black Calmucks, and Mahometan and Pagan Monguls,
 we come to the 130th degree of longitude, and the 52d of latitude upon
 the river Amur.[35] To the northward is a great chain of mountains, that
 stretches as far as the Frozen Sea, beyond the polar circle. This
 river, which runs upwards of five hundred leagues,[36] through Siberia
 and Chinese Tartary, falls, after many windings, into the sea of
 Kamtshatka. It is affirmed for a truth, that at its mouth, which opens
 with this sea, there is sometimes caught a monstrous fish, much larger
 than the hippopotamus of the Nile, and that the tooth thereof is the
 finest ivory. It is furthermore said, that this ivory was formerly an
 object of trade; that they used to convey it through Siberia, which is
 the reason why several pieces of it are still found under the ground in
 that country. This is the most probable account of the fossil ivory, of
 which we have elsewhere spoken; for it appears highly chimerical to
 pretend, that there were formerly elephants in Siberia.
 
 This Amur is likewise called the Black River by the Mantechoux Tartars,
 and the Dragon's River by the Chinese.
 
 It was in these countries, so long unknown, that the Russians and
 Chinese contested the limits of their empires.[37] The Russians had some
 forts on the river Amur, about three hundred leagues from the great
 wall. Many hostilities had arisen between these two nations on account
 of these forts: at length both began to understand their interests
 better; the emperor Camhi preferred peace and commerce to an
 unprofitable war, and sent several ambassadors to Niptchou, one of
 those settlements. The ambassadors had ten thousand men in their
 retinue, including their escort: this was Asiatic pomp; but what is very
 remarkable, is, that there was not an example in the annals of the
 empire, of an embassy being sent to another potentate; and what is still
 more singular, that the Chinese had never concluded a treaty of peace
 since the foundation of their monarchy. Though twice conquered by the
 Tartars, who attacked and subjected them, they never made war upon any
 people, excepting a few hordes that were quickly subdued, or as quickly
 left to themselves, without any treaty. So that this nation, so renowned
 for morality, knew nothing of what we call the 'Law of nations;' that is
 to say, of those vague rules of war and peace, of the privileges of
 foreign ministers, of the formalities of treaties, nor of the
 obligations resulting from thence, nor of the disputes concerning
 precedency and point of honour.
 
 But in what language were the Chinese to negotiate with the Russians, in
 the midst of deserts? This difficulty was removed by two jesuits, the
 one a Portuguese, named Pereira, the other a Frenchman, whose name was
 Gerbillon; they set out from Pekin with the Chinese ambassadors, and
 were themselves the real negotiators. They conferred in Latin with a
 German belonging to the Russian embassy, who understood this language.
 The chief of that embassy was Golowin, governor of Siberia, who
 displayed a greater magnificence than the Chinese themselves, and
 thereby gave a high idea of the Russian empire, to a people who thought
 themselves the only powerful nation under the sun.
 
 The two jesuits settled the limits of both empires at the river
 Kerbechi, near the spot where the treaty was concluded. All the country,
 to the southward of this line of partition, was adjudged to the Chinese,
 and the north to the Russians, who only lost a small fort which was
 found to have been built beyond the limits: a peace was agreed to, and
 after some few altercations, both parties swore to observe it, in the
 name of the same God;[38] and in these terms, 'If any of us shall
 entertain the least thought of kindling anew the flames of war, we
 beseech the supreme Lord of all things, and who knows all hearts, to
 punish the traitor with sudden death.'
 
 From this form of treaty, used alike by Chinese and Christians, we may
 infer two important truths: the first, that the Chinese government is
 neither atheistical nor idolatrous, as has been so frequently and
 falsely charged upon it, by contradictory imputations. Secondly, that
 all nations, who cultivate the gift of reason and understanding, do, in
 effect, acknowledge the same God, notwithstanding the particular
 deviations of that reason, through the want of being properly
 instructed.
 
 The treaty was drawn up in Latin, and two copies were made of it. The
 Russian ambassadors set their names the first to the copy that remained
 in their possession, and the Chinese also signed theirs the first,
 agreeable to the custom observed by European nations, when two equal
 powers conclude a treaty with each other. On this occasion was observed
 another custom belonging to the Asiatic nations, and which was indeed,
 that of the earliest ages. The treaty was engraven on two large marble
 pillars, erected on the spot, to determine the boundaries of the two
 empires.
 
 Three years after this, the czar sent Isbrand Ides, a Dane, his
 ambassador to China; and the commerce he then established between the
 two nations, continued with advantage to each, till the rupture between
 them in the year 1722; but since this short interruption, it has been
 revived with redoubled vigour.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. VIII.
 
     Expedition to the Palus Maeotis; conquest of Azoph.--The czar sends
     young gentlemen into foreign countries for improvement.
 
 
 It was not so easy to have peace with the Turks, and indeed, the time
 seemed come for the Russians to rise upon their ruins. The republic of
 Venice, that had long groaned under their yoke, began now to rouse
 itself. The Doge Morosini, the same who had surrendered Candy to the
 Turks, afterwards took from them the Peloponnesus, which conquest got
 him the title of Peloponnesian, an honour which revived the memory of
 the Roman republic. Leopold, emperor of Germany, had proved successful
 against the Ottoman power in Hungary; and the Poles made shift to check
 the incursions of the Crim Tartars.
 
 Peter took advantage of these circumstances, to discipline his troops,
 and to procure himself the empire of the Black Sea. General Gordon
 marched along the Tanais, towards Azoph, with his numerous regiment of
 five thousand men, followed by general Le Fort, with his regiment of
 twelve thousand; by a body of Strelitzes, under the command of Sheremeto
 and Schein, natives of Prussia; by a body of Cossacks, and by a large
 train of artillery: in a word, every thing was ready for this
 expedition.
 
 1694.] This grand army began its march under the command of marshal
 Sheremeto, or Scheremetoff, in the beginning of the summer of 1695, to
 attack the town of Azoph, at the mouth of the Tanais, and at the
 extremity of the Palus Maeotis, now called the Zaback Sea. The czar
 himself was with the army, but only in quality of a volunteer, being
 determined to learn, some time before he took upon him to command.
 During their march, they stormed two forts which the Turks had built on
 the banks of the river.
 
 This expedition was attended with some considerable difficulties. The
 place was well fortified, and defended by a numerous garrison. A number
 of barcolongos, resembling the Turkish saicks, and built by Venetians,
 with two small Dutch ships of war, that were to sail out of the
 Woronitz, could not be got ready soon enough to enter the sea of Azoph.
 All beginnings meet with obstacles. The Russians had never yet made a
 regular siege; and the first attempt did not meet with all the success
 that could be desired.
 
 One Jacob, a native of Dantzic, had the direction of the artillery,
 under the command of general Schein; for as yet they had none but
 foreign officers belonging to the train, and none but foreign engineers
 and pilots. This Jacob had been condemned to the bastinade, or _knout_,
 by Schein, the Russian general. At that time rigorous discipline was
 thought to be the only method of strengthening command; and the Russians
 quietly submitted to it, notwithstanding their natural bent to sedition;
 and after the punishment, did their duty as usual. But the Dane thought
 in a different manner, and resolved to be revenged for the treatment he
 had received, and thereupon nailed up the cannon, deserted to the Turks,
 turned Mahometan, and defended Azoph, with great success, against his
 former masters. This instance shews, that the lenity which is now
 practised in Russia, is much preferable to the former severities; and is
 better calculated to retain those in their duty, who by a good
 education, have a proper sense of honour. It was absolutely necessary at
 that time, to use the utmost rigour towards the common people; but since
 their manners have been changed, the empress Elizabeth[39] has
 completed, by clemency, the work her father begun, by the authority of
 the laws. This lenity has even been carried, by this princess, to a
 degree unexampled, in the history of any nation. She has promised, that,
 during her reign, no person shall be punished with death, and she has
 kept her word. She is the first sovereign who ever shewed so much regard
 for the lives of men. By an institution, equally prudent and humane,
 malefactors are now condemned to serve in the mines, and other public
 works: by which means their very punishments prove of service to the
 state. In other countries, they know only how to put a criminal to
 death, with all the apparatus of execution, without being able to
 prevent the perpetration of crimes. The apprehension of death makes,
 perhaps, less impression on those miscreants, who are, for the most
 part, bred up in idleness, than the fear of punishment and hard labour,
 renewed every day.
 
 To return to the siege of Azoph, which place was now defended by the
 same person who had before directed the attacks against it; the
 Russians, in vain, attempted to take it by storm; and after losing a
 great number of men, were obliged to raise the siege.
 
 Perseverance in his undertakings, was the distinguishing character of
 Peter the Great. In the spring of 1696, he brought a still more
 considerable army before Azoph. About this time died czar John, his
 brother, who though he had not, while living, been the least curb to
 Peter's authority, having enjoyed only the bare title of czar, yet he
 had been some restraint upon him in regard to appearances. The money
 which had been appropriated to the support of John's dignity and
 household, were now applied to the maintenance of the army. This proved
 no small help to a government, whose revenues were not near so great as
 they are at present. Peter wrote to the emperor Leopold, to the
 states-general, and to the elector of Brandenburg, to obtain engineers,
 gunners, and seamen. He likewise took some Calmucks into his pay, whose
 light horse are very useful against the Crim Tartars.
 
 The most agreeable of the czar's successes, was that of his little
 fleet, which was at length completed, and well commanded. It defeated
 the Turkish saicks, sent from Constantinople, and took some of them. The
 siege was carried on regularly by trenches, but not altogether in our
 method; the trenches being three times deeper than ours, with parapets
 as high as ramparts. At length the garrison surrendered, the 28th of
 July, 1696. N. S. without being allowed the honours of war, or to carry
 out with them either arms or ammunition: they were likewise obliged to
 deliver up the renegade, Jacob, to the conquerors.
 
 The czar immediately set about fortifying Azoph, built strong forts to
 protect it, and made a harbour capable of holding large vessels, with a
 design to make himself master of the Streights of Caffa, or the
 Cimmerian Bosphorus, which commands the entrance into the Pontus
 Euxinus, or Black Sea; places famous in ancient times, by the naval
 armaments of Mithridates. He left thirty-two armed saicks before
 Azoph,[40] and made all the necessary preparations for fitting out a
 fleet against the Turks, to consist of nine ships of sixty guns, and of
 forty-one, from thirty to fifty. He obliged his principal nobles, and
 the richer merchants, to contribute towards this armament; and thinking
 that the estates of the clergy ought to help towards the common cause,
 he obliged the patriarch, the bishops, and principal clergy, to pay down
 a sum of ready money to forward this expedition, in honour of their
 country, and the advantage of the Christian faith. The Cossacks were
 employed in building a number of those light boats in use amongst them,
 and which were excellent for the purpose of cruising on the coast of
 Crim Tartary. The Ottoman empire was alarmed at this powerful armament;
 the first that had ever been attempted on the Palus Maeotis. The czar's
 scheme was to drive the Turks and the Tartars for ever out of the
 Taurica Chersonesus, and afterwards to establish a free and easy
 commerce with Persia through Georgia. This is the very trade which the
 Greeks formerly carried on to Colchos, and to this peninsula of Crim
 Tartary, which Peter now seemed on the point of conquering.
 
 Having subdued the Turks and the Tartars, he was willing to accustom his
 people to splendid shows as well as to military labour. He made his
 army to enter into Moscow, under triumphal arches, in the midst of
 superb fire-works, and every thing that could add to the lustre of the
 festival. The soldiers who had fought on board the Venetian saicks
 against the Turks, and who were a distinct corps of themselves, marched
 first. Marshal Sheremeto, the generals Gordon and Schein, admiral Le
 Fort, and the other general officers, all took the precedence of their
 monarch in this procession, who declared he had no rank in the army,
 being desirous to convince the nobility, by his example, that the only
 way to acquire military preferment, was to deserve it.[41]
 
 This triumphal entry seemed somewhat a-kin to those of the ancient
 Romans, in which the conquerors were wont to expose the prisoners they
 had taken, to public view, and sometimes put them to death: in like
 manner, the slaves, taken in this expedition, follow the army; and the
 deserter Jacob, who had betrayed them, was drawn in an open cart, in
 which was a gibbet, to which his body was fastened after he had been
 broke upon the wheel.
 
 On this occasion was struck the first medal in Russia, with this
 remarkable legend, in the language of the country. 'Peter the First,
 august emperor of Muscovy.' On the reverse was the city of Azoph, with
 these words; 'Victorious by Fire and Water.'
 
 Peter felt a sensible concern in the midst of all these successes, that
 his ships and gallies in the sea of Azoph, had been built entirely by
 the hands of foreigners; and wished as earnestly to have a harbour in
 the Baltic Sea, as upon the Pontus Euxinus.
 
 Accordingly, in the month of March 1677, he sent threescore young
 Russians of Le Fort's regiment, into Italy, most of them to Venice, and
 the rest to Leghorn, to instruct themselves in the naval art, and the
 manner of constructing gallies. He likewise sent forty others into
 Holland,[42] to learn the method of building and working large ships:
 and others likewise into Germany, to serve in the land forces, and
 instruct themselves in the military discipline of that nation. At length
 he took a resolution to absent himself for a few years from his own
 dominions, in order to learn how to govern them the better. He had an
 irresistible inclination to improve himself by his own observation and
 practice in the knowledge of naval affairs, and of the several arts
 which he was so desirous to establish in his own country. He proposed to
 travel _incognito_ through Denmark, Brandenburg, Holland, Vienna,
 Venice, and Rome. France and Spain were the only countries he did not
 take into his plan; Spain, because the arts he was in quest of, were too
 much neglected there; and France, because in that kingdom they reigned
 with too much ostentation, and that the parade and state of Lewis XIV.
 which had disgusted so many crowned heads, ill agreed with the private
 manner in which he proposed to travel. Moreover, he was in alliance
 with most of the powers, whose dominions he intended to visit, except
 those of France and Rome. He likewise remembered, with some degree of
 resentment, the little respect shewn by Lewis XIV. to his embassy in
 1687, which had proved more famous than successful; and lastly he
 already began to espouse the cause of Augustus, elector of Saxony, with
 whom the prince of Conti had lately entered into a competition for the
 crown of Poland.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. IX.
 
     Travels of Peter the Great.
 
 
 [Sidenote: 1697.]
 
 Having thus determined to visit the several countries and courts
 above-mentioned in a private character, he put himself into the retinue
 of three ambassadors, in the same manner as he had before mingled in the
 train of his generals at his triumphant entry into Moscow.
 
 [43] The three ambassadors were, general Le Fort, the boyard Alexis
 Gollowin, commissary-general of war, and governor of Siberia, the same
 who signed the perpetual treaty of peace with the plenipotentiaries
 of China, on the frontiers of that empire; and Wonitzin, diak, or
 secretary of state, who had been long employed in foreign courts. Four
 principal secretaries, twelve gentlemen, two pages for each ambassador,
 a company of fifty guards, with their officers, all of the regiment
 of Preobrazinski, composed the chief retinue of this embassy, which
 consisted in the whole of two hundred persons; and the czar, reserving
 to himself only one valet de chambre, a servant in livery, and a dwarf,
 mingled with the crowd. It was a thing unparalleled in history, for a
 king of five-and-twenty years of age, to quit his dominions, in order
 to learn the art of governing. His victory over the Turks and Tartars,
 the splendour of his triumphant entry into Moscow, the number of foreign
 troops attached to his service, the death of his brother John, his
 co-partner in the empire, and the confinement of the princess Sophia to
 a cloister, and above all the universal respect shewn to his person,
 seemed to assure him the tranquillity of his kingdom during his absence.
 He intrusted the regency in the hands of the boyard Strechnef, and the
 knez or prince Romadonowski, who were to deliberate with the rest of the
 boyards in cases of importance.
 
 Two troops raised by general Gordon remained behind in Moscow, to keep
 every thing quiet in that capital. Those strelitzes, who were thought
 likely to create a disturbance, were distributed in the frontiers of
 Crim Tartary, to preserve the conquest of Azoph, and to check the
 incursions of the Tartars. Having provided against every incident, he
 gave a free scope to his passion and desire of improvement.
 
 As this journey proved the cause, or at least the pretext, of the bloody
 war, which so long traversed, but in the end promoted, all the designs
 of the czar; which drove Augustus, king of Poland, from the throne;
 placed that crown on the head of Stanislaus, and then stript him of it;
 which made Charles XII. king of Sweden, the first of conquerors for nine
 years, and the most unfortunate of kings for nine more; it is necessary,
 in order to enter into a detail of these events, to take a view of the
 state of Europe at that time.
 
 Sultan Mustapha II. sat at that time on the Ottoman throne; the weakness
 of whose administration would not permit him to make any great efforts,
 either against Leopold, emperor of Germany, whose arms were successful
 in Hungary, nor against the czar, who had lately taken Azoph from him,
 and threatened to make himself master of the Pontus Euxinus; nor even
 against the Venetians, who had made themselves masters of all the
 Peloponnesus.
 
 John Sobieski, king of Poland, for ever famous by the victory of
 Chocksim, and the deliverance of Vienna, died the 17th of June, 1696,
 and the possession of that crown was in dispute between Augustus,
 elector of Saxony, who obtained it, and Armond, prince of Conti, who had
 only the honour of being elected.
 
 1697.] Sweden had lately lost, but without regret, Charles XI. her
 sovereign, who was the first king who had ever been really absolute in
 that country, and who was the father of a prince still more so, and with
 whom all despotic power ceased. He left the crown to his son Charles
 XII. a youth of only fifteen years of age. This was in all appearance a
 conjuncture the most favourable for the czar's design; he had it in his
 power to extend his dominions on the Gulf of Finland, and on the side of
 Livonia. But he did not think it enough to harass the Turks on the Black
 Sea; the settlements on the Palus Maeotis, and the borders of the Caspian
 Sea, were not sufficient to answer his schemes of navigation, commerce,
 and power. Besides, glory, which is the darling object of every
 reformer, was to be found neither in Persia, nor in Turkey, but in our
 parts of Europe, where great talents are rendered immortal. In a word,
 Peter did not aim at introducing either the Persian or Turkish manners
 among his subjects.
 
 Germany, then at war both with the Turks and with the French, and united
 with Spain, England, and Holland, against the single power of Lewis XIV.
 was on the point of concluding peace, and the plenipotentiaries were
 already met at the castle of Ryswick, in the neighbourhood of the Hague.
 
 It was during this situation of affairs, that Peter and his ambassador
 began their journey in the month of April, 1697, by the way of Great
 Novogorod: from thence they travelled through Esthonia and Livonia,
 provinces formerly disputed by the Russians, Swedes, and Poles, and
 which the Swedes at last acquired by superiority of arms.
 
 The fertility of Livonia, and the situation of its capital, Riga, were
 temptations to the czar, to possess himself of that country. He
 expressed a curiosity to see the fortifications of the citadel. But
 count D'Alberg, governor of Riga, taking umbrage at this request,
 refused him the satisfaction he desired, and affected to treat the
 embassy with contempt. This behaviour did not at all contribute to cool
 the inclination the czar might have, to make himself one day master of
 those provinces.
 
 From Livonia they proceeded to Brandenburg-Prussia, part of which had
 been inhabited by the ancient Vandals; Polish Prussia had been included
 in European Sarmatia. Brandenburg-Prussia was a poor country and badly
 peopled; but its elector, who afterwards took the name of king,
 displayed a magnificence on this occasion, equally new and destructive
 to his dominions. He piqued himself upon receiving this embassy in his
 city of Konigsberg, with all the pomp of royalty. The most sumptuous
 presents were made on both sides. The contrast between the French dress
 which the court of Berlin affected, and the long Asiatic robes of the
 Russians, with their caps buttoned up with pearls and diamonds, and
 their scimitars hanging at their belts, produced a singular effect. The
 czar was dressed after the German fashion. The prince of Georgia, who
 accompanied him, was clad in a Persian habit, which displayed a
 different magnificence. This is the same who was taken prisoner
 afterwards at the battle of Narva, and died in Sweden.
 
 Peter despised all this ostentation; it was to have been wished that he
 had shewn an equal contempt for the pleasures of the table, in which the
 Germans, at that time, placed their chiefest glory. It was at one of
 those entertainments,[44] then too much in fashion, and which are alike
 fatal to health and morality, that he drew his sword upon his favourite,
 Le Fort; but he expressed as much contrition for this sudden sally of
 passion, as Alexander did for the murder of Clytus; he asked pardon of
 Le Fort, saying, that he wanted to reform his subjects, and could not
 yet reform himself. General Le Fort, in his manuscript praises the czar
 more for this goodness of heart, than he blames him for his excess of
 passion.
 
 The ambassadors then went through Pomerania and Berlin; and, from
 thence, one part took its way through Magdeburg, and the other by
 Hamburg, a city which already began to be considerable by its extensive
 commerce, but not so rich and populous as it has become since. From
 thence they directed their route towards Minden, crossed Westphalia, and
 at length, by the way of Cleves, arrived at Amsterdam.
 
 The czar reached this city fifteen days before the ambassadors. At his
 first coming, he lodged in a house belonging to the East India company;
 but soon afterwards he took a small apartment in the dock-yard,
 belonging to the admiralty. He then put on the habit of a Dutch skipper,
 and in that dress went to the village of Saardam, a place where a great
 many more ships were built at that times, than at present. This village
 is as large, as populous, and as rich, and much neater, than many
 opulent towns. The czar greatly admired the multitude of people who were
 constantly employed there, the order and regularity of their times of
 working, the prodigious dispatch with which they built and fitted out
 ships, the incredible number of warehouses, and machines, for the
 greater ease and security of labour. The czar began with purchasing a
 bark, to which he made a mast with his own hands; after that, he worked
 upon all the different parts in the construction of a vessel, living in
 the same manner as the workmen at Saardam, dressing and eating the same
 as them, and working in the forges, the rope-walks, and in the several
 mills, which are in prodigious numbers in that village, for sawing
 timber, extracting oil, making paper, and wire-drawing. He caused
 himself to be enrolled in the list of carpenters, by the name of Peter
 Michaelhoff, and was commonly called Peter Bas, or Master Peter: the
 workmen were at first confounded at having a crowned head for a
 fellow-labourer, but soon became familiarized to the sight.
 
 While he was thus handling the compass and the axe at Saardam, a
 confirmation was brought him of the division in Poland, and of the
 double nomination of the elector Augustus, and the prince of Conti. The
 carpenter of Saardam immediately promised king Augustus to assist him
 with thirty thousand men; and, from his work-loft, issued out orders to
 his army that was assembled in the Ukraine against the Turks.
 
 11th Aug. 1697.] His troops gained a victory over the Tartars near
 Azoph, and a few months afterwards took from them the city of Or, or
 Orkapi, which we call Precop.[45] As to himself, he still continued
 improving in different arts: he went frequently from Saardam to
 Amsterdam, to hear the lectures of the celebrated anatomist, Ruysch; and
 made himself master of several operations in surgery, which, in case of
 necessity, might be of use both to himself and his officers. He went
 through a course of natural philosophy, in the house of the burgomaster
 Witzen, a person for ever estimable for his patriotic virtue, and the
 noble use he made of his immense riches, which he distributed like a
 citizen of the world, sending men of abilities, at a great expense, to
 all parts of the globe, in search of whatever was most rare and
 valuable, and fitting out vessels at his own charge to make new
 discoveries.
 
 Peter Bas gave a truce to his labours for a short time, but it was only
 to pay a private visit at Utrecht, and at the Hague, to William, king of
 England, and stadtholder of the United Provinces. General Le Fort was
 the only one admitted to the private conference of the two monarchs.
 Peter assisted afterwards at the public entry of his ambassadors, and at
 their audience: they presented, in his name, to the deputy of the
 states, six hundred of the most beautiful sables that could be procured;
 and the states, over and above the customary presents on these
 occasions, of a gold chain and a medal, gave them three magnificent
 coaches. They received the first visits of all the plenipotentiaries who
 were at the congress of Ryswick, excepting those of France, to whom they
 had not notified their arrival, not only because the czar espoused the
 cause of Augustus against the prince of Conti, but also because king
 William, whose friendship he was desirous of cultivating, was averse to
 a peace with France.
 
 At his return to Amsterdam he resumed his former occupations, and
 completed with his own hands, a ship of sixty guns, that he had begun
 himself, and sent her to Archangel; which was the only port he had at
 that time on the ocean.
 
 He not only engaged in his service several French refugees, Swiss, and
 Germans; but he also sent all sorts of artists over to Moscow, and he
 previously made a trial of their several abilities himself. There were
 few trades or arts which he did not perfectly well understand, in their
 minutest branches: he took a particular pleasure in correcting with his
 own hands, the geographical maps, which at that time laid down at hazard
 the positions of the towns and rivers in his vast dominions, then very
 little known. There is still preserved, a map, on which he marked out,
 with his own hand, his projected communication of the Caspian and Black
 Seas, the execution of which he had given in charge to Mr. Brekel, a
 German engineer. The junction of these two seas was indeed a less
 difficult enterprise than that of the Ocean and Mediterranean, which was
 effected in France; but the very idea of joining the sea of Azoph with
 the Caspian, astonished the imagination at that time: but new
 establishments in that country became the object of his attention, in
 proportion as his successes begat new hopes.
 
 His troops, commanded by general Schein and prince Dolgorowski, had
 lately gained a victory over the Tartars near Azoph, and likewise over a
 body of janissaries sent by sultan Mustapha to their assistance. (July
 1696.) This success served to make him more respected, even by those who
 blamed him, as a sovereign, for having quitted his dominions, to turn
 workman at Amsterdam. They now saw, that the affairs of the monarch did
 not suffer by the labours of the philosopher, the traveller, and the
 artificer.
 
 He remained at Amsterdam, constantly employed in his usual occupations
 of shipbuilding, engineering, geography, and the practice of natural
 philosophy, till the middle of January 1698, and then he set out for
 England, but still as one of the retinue of his ambassadors.
 
 King William sent his own yacht to meet him, and two ships of war as
 convoy. In England he observed the same manner of living as at Amsterdam
 and Saardam; he took an apartment near the king's dockyard, at Deptford,
 where he applied himself wholly to gain instruction. The Dutch
 builders had only taught him their method, and the practical part of
 shipbuilding. In England he found the art better explained; for there
 they work according to mathematical proportion. He soon made himself so
 perfect in this science, that he was able to give lessons to others. He
 began to build a ship according to the English method of construction,
 and it proved a prime sailor. The art of watchmaking, which was already
 brought to perfection in London, next attracted his attention, and he
 made himself complete master of the whole theory. Captain Perry, the
 engineer, who followed him from London to Russia, says, that from the
 casting of cannon, to the spinning of ropes, there was not any one
 branch of trade belonging to a ship that he did not minutely observe,
 and even put his hand to, as often as he came into the places where
 those trades were carried on.
 
 In order to cultivate his friendship, he was allowed to engage several
 English artificers into his service, as he had done in Holland; but,
 over and above artificers, he engaged likewise some mathematicians,
 which he would not so easily have found in Amsterdam. Ferguson, a
 Scotchman, an excellent geometrician, entered into his service, and was
 the first person who brought arithmetic into use in the exchequer in
 Russia, where before that time, they made use only of the Tartarian
 method of reckoning, with balls strung upon a wire; a method which
 supplied the place of writing, but was very perplexing and imperfect,
 because, after the calculation, there was no method of proving it, in
 order to discover any error. The Indian ciphers, which are now in use,
 were not introduced among us till the ninth century, by Arabs; and they
 did not make their way into the Russian empire till one thousand years
 afterwards. Such has been the fate of the arts, to make their progress
 slowly round the globe. He took with him two young students from a
 mathematical school,[46] and this was the beginning of the marine
 academy, founded afterwards by Peter the Great. He observed and
 calculated eclipses with Ferguson. Perry, the engineer, though greatly
 discontented at not being sufficiently rewarded, acknowledges, that
 Peter made himself a proficient in astronomy; that he perfectly well
 understood the motions of the heavenly bodies, as well as the laws of
 gravitation, by which they are directed. This force, now so evidently
 demonstrated, and before the time of the great Newton so little known,
 by which all the planets gravitate towards each other, and which retain
 them in their orbits, was already become familiar to a sovereign of
 Russia, while other countries amused themselves with imaginary vertices,
 and, in Galileo's nation, one set of ignorant persons ordered others, as
 ignorant, to believe the earth to be immoveable.
 
 Perry set out in order to effect a communication between rivers, to
 build bridges, and construct sluices. The czar's plan was to open a
 communication by means of canals between the Ocean, the Caspian, and the
 Black Seas.
 
 We must not forget to observe, that a set of English merchants, with the
 marquis of Caermarthen[47] at their head, gave Peter fifteen thousand
 pounds sterling, for the permission of vending tobacco in Russia. The
 patriarch, by a mistaken severity, had interdicted this branch of trade;
 for the Russian church forbid smoking, as an unclean and sinful action.
 Peter, who knew better things, and who, amongst his many projected
 changes, meditated a reformation of the church, introduced this
 commodity of trade into his dominions.
 
 Before Peter left England, he was entertained by king William with a
 spectacle worthy such a guest: this was a mock sea-fight. Little was it
 then imagined, that the czar would one day fight a real battle on this
 element against the Swedes, and gain naval victories in the Baltic. In
 fine, William made him a present of the vessel in which he used to go
 over to Holland, called the Royal Transport, a beautiful yacht, and
 magnificently adorned. In this vessel Peter returned to Holland the
 latter end of 1698, taking with him three captains of ships of war, five
 and twenty captains of merchant ships, forty lieutenants, thirty pilots,
 as many surgeons, two hundred and fifty gunners, and upwards of three
 hundred artificers. This little colony of persons skilful in all
 branches, sailed from Holland to Archangel, on board the Royal
 Transport, and from thence were distributed into all the different
 places where their services were necessary. Those who had been engaged
 at Amsterdam went by the way of Narva, which then belonged to the
 Swedes.
 
 While he was thus transplanting the arts and manufacture of England and
 Holland into his own country, the officers, whom he had sent to Rome,
 and other places in Italy, had likewise engaged some artists in his
 service. General Sheremeto, who was at the head of his embassy to Italy,
 took the tour of Rome, Naples, Venice, and Malta, while the czar
 proceeded to Vienna with his other ambassadors. He had now only to view
 the military discipline of the Germans, after having seen the English
 fleets, and the dock-yards of Holland. Politics had likewise as great a
 share in this journey as the desire of instruction. The emperor was his
 natural ally against the Turks. Peter had a private audience of Leopold,
 and the two monarchs conferred standing, to avoid the trouble of
 ceremony.
 
 There happened nothing worthy remark during his stay at Vienna, except
 the celebration of the ancient feast of the landlord and landlady, which
 had been disused for a considerable time, and which Leopold thought
 proper to revive on the czar's account. This feast, which by the Germans
 is called Wurtchafft, is celebrated in the following manner:--
 
 The emperor is landlord and the empress landlady, the king of the
 Romans, the archdukes and the archduchesses are generally their
 assistants: they entertain people of all nations as their guests, who
 come dressed after the most ancient fashion of their respective
 countries: those who are invited to the feast, draw lots for tickets, on
 each of which is written the name of the nation, and the character or
 person they are to represent. One perhaps draws a ticket for a Chinese
 mandarin; another for a Tartarian mirza; a third a Persian satrap; and a
 fourth for a Roman senator; a princess may, by her ticket, be a
 gardener's wife, or a milk-maid; a prince a peasant, or a common
 soldier. Dances are composed suitable to all those characters, and the
 landlord and landlady with their family wait at table. Such was the
 ancient institution; but on this occasion[48] Joseph, king of the
 Romans, and the countess of Traun, represented the ancient Egyptians.
 The archduke Charles, and the countess of Walstein, were dressed like
 Flemings in the time of Charles the Fifth. The archduchess Mary
 Elizabeth and count Traun were in the habits of Tartars; the archduchess
 Josephina and the count of Workslaw were habited like Persians, and the
 archduchess Mariamne and prince Maximilian of Hanover in the character
 of North Holland peasants. Peter appeared in the dress of a Friesland
 boor, and all who spoke to him addressed him in that character, at the
 same time talking to him of the great czar of Muscovy. These are
 trifling particulars; but whatever revives the remembrance of ancient
 manners and customs, is in some degree worthy of being recorded.
 
 Peter was ready to set out from Vienna, in order to proceed to Venice,
 to complete his tour of instruction, when he received the news of a
 rebellion, which had lately broke out in his dominions.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. X.
 
     A conspiracy punished.--The corps of strelitzes abolished,
     alterations in customs, manners, church, and state.
 
 
 Czar Peter, when he left his dominions to set out on his travels, had
 provided against every incident, even that of rebellion. But the great
 and serviceable things he had done for his country, proved the very
 cause of this rebellion.
 
 Certain old boyards, to whom the ancient customs were still dear, and
 some priests, to whom the new ones appeared little better than
 sacrilege, began these disturbances, and the old faction of the princess
 Sophia took this opportunity to rouse itself anew. It is said, that one
 of her sisters, who was confined to the same monastery, contributed not
 a little to excite these seditions. Care was taken to spread abroad the
 danger to be feared from the introduction of foreigners to instruct the
 nation. In short, who would believe, that[49] the permission which the
 czar had given to import tobacco into his empire, contrary to the
 inclination of the clergy, was one of the chief motives of the
 insurrection? Superstition, the scourge of every country, yet the
 darling of the multitude, spread itself from the common people to the
 strelitzes, who had been scattered on the frontiers of Lithuania: they
 assembled in a body, and marched towards Moscow, with the intent to
 place the princess Sophia on the throne, and for ever to prevent the
 return of a czar who had violated the established customs,[50] by
 presuming to travel for instruction among foreigners. The forces
 commanded by Schein and Gordon, who were much better disciplined than
 the strelitzes, met them fifteen leagues from Moscow, gave them battle,
 and entirely defeated them: but this advantage, gained by a foreign
 general over the ancient militia, among whom were several of the
 burghers of Moscow, contributed still more to irritate the people.
 
 To quell these tumults, the czar sets out privately from Vienna, passes
 through Poland, has a private interview with Augustus, concerts measures
 with that prince for extending the Russian dominions on the side of the
 Baltic, and at length arrived at Moscow, where he surprised every one
 with his presence: he then confers rewards on the troops who had
 defeated the strelitzes, (Sept. 1698,) of whom the prisons were now
 full. If the crimes of these unhappy wretches were great, their
 punishment was no less so. Their leaders, with several of their officers
 and priests, were condemned to death; some were broken upon the
 wheel,[51] and two women were buried alive; upwards of two thousand of
 the strelitzes were executed, part of whom were hung round about the
 walls of the city, and others put to death in different manners, and
 their dead bodies remained exposed for two days in the high roads,[52]
 particularly about the monastery where the princesses Sophia and Eudocia
 resided.[53] Monuments of stone were erected, on which their crimes and
 punishments were set forth. A great number of them who had wives and
 children at Moscow, were dispersed with their families into Siberia, the
 kingdom of Astracan, and the country of Azoph. This punishment was at
 least of service to the state, as they helped to cultivate and people a
 large tract of waste land.
 
 Perhaps, if the czar had not found it absolutely necessary to make such
 terrible examples, he might have employed part of those strelitzes whom
 he put to death, upon the public works; whereas they were now lost both
 to him and the state: the lives of men ought to be held in great
 estimation, especially in a country where the increase of inhabitants
 ought to have been the principal care of the legislature: but he thought
 it necessary to terrify and break the spirit of the nation by
 executions, and the parade attending them. The entire corps of the
 strelitzes, whose number not one of his predecessors had even dared to
 think of diminishing, was broke for ever, and their very name abolished.
 This change was effected without any resistance, because matters had
 been properly prepared beforehand. The Turkish sultan, Osman, as I have
 already remarked, was deposed and murdered in the same century, only for
 giving the janissaries room to suspect that he intended to lessen their
 number. Peter had better success, because he had taken better measures.
 
 Of this powerful and numerous body of the strelitzes, he left only two
 feeble regiments, from whom there could no longer be any danger; and yet
 these still retaining their old spirit of mutiny, revolted again in
 Astracan, in the year 1705, but were quickly suppressed.
 
 But while we are relating Peter's severity in this affair of state, let
 us not forget to commemorate the more than equal humanity he shewed some
 time afterwards, when he lost his favourite Le Fort, who was snatched
 away by an untimely fate, March 12, N. S. 1699, at the age of 46. He
 paid him the same funeral honours as are bestowed on the greatest
 sovereigns, and assisted himself in the procession, carrying a pike in
 his hand, and marching after the captains, in the rank of a lieutenant,
 which he held in the deceased general's regiment, hereby setting an
 example to his nobles, of the respect due to merit and the military
 rank.
 
 After the death of Le Fort, it appeared plainly, that the changes in the
 state were not owing to that general, but to the czar himself. Peter had
 indeed been confirmed in his design by his several conversations with Le
 Fort; but he had formed and executed them all without his assistance.
 
 As soon as he had suppressed the strelitzes, he established regular
 regiments on the German model, who were all clothed in a short and
 commodious uniform, in the room of those long and troublesome coats,
 which they used to wear before; and, at the same time, their exercise
 was likewise more regular.
 
 The regiment of Preobrazinski guards was already formed; it had taken
 its name from the first company of fifty men, whom the czar had trained
 up in his younger days, in his retreat at Preobrazinski, at the time
 when his sister Sophia governed the state, and the other regiment of
 guards was also established.
 
 As he had himself passed through the lowest degrees in the army, he was
 resolved that the sons of his boyards and great men, should serve as
 common soldiers before they were made officers. He sent some of the
 young nobility on board of his fleet at Woronitz and Azoph, where he
 obliged them to serve their apprenticeship as common seamen. No one
 dared to dispute the commands of a master who had himself set the
 example. The English and Dutch he had brought over with him were
 employed in equipping this fleet for sea, in constructing sluices, and
 building docks, for careening the ships, and to resume the great work of
 joining the Tanais, or Don, and the Wolga, which had been dropped by
 Brekel, the German. And now he began to set about his projected
 reformations in the council of state, in the revenue, in the church, and
 even in society itself.
 
 The affairs of the revenue had been hitherto administered much in the
 same manner as in Turkey. Each boyard paid a stipulated sum for his
 lands, which he raised upon the peasants, his vassals; the czar
 appointed certain burghers and burgomasters to be his receivers, who
 were not powerful enough to claim the right of paying only such sums as
 they thought proper into the public treasury. This new administration of
 the finances, was what cost him the most trouble: he was obliged to try
 several methods before he could fix upon a proper one.
 
 The reformation of the church, which in all other countries is looked
 upon as so dangerous and difficult an attempt, was not so to him. The
 patriarchs had at times opposed the authority of the crown, as well as
 the strelitzes; Nicon with insolence, Joachin, one of his successors, in
 an artful manner.
 
 The bishops had arrogated the power of life and death, a prerogative
 directly contrary to the spirit of religion, and the subordination of
 government. This assumed power, which had been of long standing, was now
 taken from them. The patriarch Adrian, dying at the close of this
 century, Peter declared that there should for the future be no other.
 
 This dignity then was entirely suppressed, and the great income
 belonging thereto was united to the public revenue, which stood in need
 of this addition. Although the czar did not set himself up as the head
 of the Russian church, as the kings of Great Britain have done in regard
 to the church of England; yet he was, in fact, absolute master over it,
 because the synods did not dare either to disobey the commands of a
 despotic sovereign, or to dispute with a prince who had more knowledge
 than themselves.
 
 We need only to cast an eye on the preamble to the edict, concerning his
 ecclesiastical regulations, issued in 1721, to be convinced that he
 acted at once as master and legislator: 'We should deem ourselves guilty
 of ingratitude to the Most High, if, after having reformed the military
 and civil orders, we neglect the spiritual, &c. For this cause,
 following the example of the most ancient kings, who have been famed for
 piety, we have taken upon us to make certain wholesome regulations,
 touching the clergy.' It is true, he convened a synod for carrying into
 execution his ecclesiastical decrees, but the members of this synod, at
 entering upon their office, were to take an oath, the form of which had
 been drawn up and signed by himself. This was an oath of submission and
 obedience, and was conceived in the following terms: 'I swear to be a
 faithful and obedient servant and subject to my true and natural
 sovereign, and to the august successors whom it shall please him to
 nominate, in virtue of the incontestable right of which he is possessed:
 I acknowledge him to be the supreme judge of this spiritual college: I
 swear by the all-seeing God, that I understand and mean this oath in the
 full force and sense, which the words convey to those who read or hear
 it.' This oath is much stronger than that of the supremacy in England.
 The Russian monarch was not, indeed, one of the fathers of the synod,
 but he dictated their laws; and, though he did not touch the holy
 censer, he directed the hands that held it.
 
 Previous to this great work, he thought, that in a state like his, which
 stood in need of being peopled, the celibacy of the monks was contrary
 to nature, and to the public good. It was the ancient custom of the
 Russian church, for secular priests to marry at least once in their
 lives: they were even obliged so to do: and formerly they ceased to be
 priests as soon as they lost their wives. But that a multitude of young
 people of both sexes should make a vow of living useless in a cloister,
 and at the expense of others, appeared to him a dangerous institution.
 He, therefore, ordered that no one should be admitted to a monastic
 life, till they were fifty years old, a time of life very rarely subject
 to a temptation of this kind; and he forbid any person to be admitted,
 at any age soever, who was actually in possession of any public employ.
 
 This regulation has been repealed since his death, because the
 government has thought proper to shew more complaisance to the
 monasteries: but the patriarchal dignity has never been revived, and its
 great revenues are now appropriated to the payment of the troops.
 
 These alterations at first excited some murmurings. A certain priest
 wrote, to prove that Peter was antichrist, because he would not admit of
 a patriarch; and the art of printing, which the czar encouraged in his
 kingdom, was made use of to publish libels against him: but, on the
 other hand, there was another priest who started up to prove that Peter
 could not be antichrist, because the number 666 was not to be found in
 his name, and that he had not the sign of the Beast. All complaints,
 however, were soon quieted. Peter, in fact, gave much more to the church
 than he took from it; for he made the clergy, by degrees, more regular
 and more learned. He founded three colleges at Moscow, where they teach
 the languages, and where those who are designed for the priesthood are
 obliged to study.
 
 One of the most necessary reforms was the suppression, or at least the
 mitigation of the Three Lents, an ancient superstition of the Greek
 church, and as prejudicial with respect to those who are employed in
 public works, and especially to soldiers, as was the old Jewish
 superstition of not fighting on the sabbath-day. Accordingly the czar
 dispensed with his workmen and soldiers at least, observing these lents,
 in which, though they were not permitted to eat, they were accustomed to
 get drunk. He likewise dispensed with their observance of meagre days;
 the chaplains of the fleet and army were obliged to set the example,
 which they did without much reluctance.
 
 The calendar, another important object. Formerly, in all the countries
 of the world, the chiefs of religion had the care of regulating the
 year, not only on account of the feasts to be observed, but because, in
 ancient times, the priests were the only persons who understood
 astronomy.
 
 The year began with the Russians on the 1st of September. Peter ordered,
 that it should for the future commence the first day of January, as
 among the other nations of Europe. This alteration was to take place in
 the year 1700, at the beginning of the century, which he celebrated by a
 jubilee, and other grand solemnities. It was a matter of surprise, to
 the common people, how the czar should be able to change the course of
 the sun. Some obstinate persons, persuaded that God had created the
 world in September, continued their old style: but the alteration took
 place in all the public offices, in the whole court of chancery, and in
 a little time throughout the whole empire. Peter did not adopt the
 Gregorian calendar, because it had been rejected by the English
 mathematicians; but which must, nevertheless, be one day received in all
 countries.
 
 Ever since the 5th century, the time when letters first came into use
 amongst them, they had been accustomed to write upon long rolls, made
 either of the bark of trees, or of parchment, and afterwards of paper;
 and the czar was obliged to publish an edict, ordering every one, for
 the future, to write after our manner.
 
 The reformation now became general. Their marriages were made formerly
 after the same manner as in Turkey and Persia, where the bridegroom does
 not see his bride till the contract is signed, and they can no longer go
 from their words. This custom may do well enough among those people,
 where polygamy prevails, and where the women are always shut up; but it
 is a very bad one in countries where a man is confined to one wife, and
 where divorces are seldom allowed.
 
 The czar was willing to accustom his people to the manners and customs
 of the nations which he had visited in his travels, and from whence he
 had taken the masters who were now instructing them.
 
 It appeared necessary that the Russians should not be dressed in a
 different manner from those who were teaching them the arts and
 sciences; because the aversion to strangers, which is but too natural to
 mankind, is not a little kept up by a difference of dress. The full
 dress, which at that time partook of the fashions of the Poles, the
 Tartars, and the ancient Hungarians, was, as we have elsewhere observed,
 very noble; but the dress of the burghers and common people resembled
 those jackets plaited round the waist, which are still given to the poor
 children in some of the French hospitals.[54] In general, the robe was
 formerly the dress of all nations, as being a garment that required the
 least trouble and art; and, for the same reason, the beard was suffered
 to grow. The czar met with but little difficulty in introducing our mode
 of dress, and the custom of shaving among his courtiers; but the people
 were more obstinate, he found himself obliged to lay a tax on long coats
 and beards. Patterns of close-bodied coats were hung up in public
 places; and whoever refused to pay the tax were obliged to suffer their
 robes and their beards to be curtailed: all this was done in a jocular
 manner, and this air of pleasantry prevented seditions.
 
 It has ever been the aim of all legislators to render mankind more
 sociable; but it is not sufficient to effect this end, that they live
 together in towns, there must be a mutual intercourse of civility. This
 intercourse sweetens all the bitterness of life. The czar, therefore,
 introduced those assemblies which the Italians call _ridotti_. To these
 assemblies he invited all the ladies of his court, with their daughters;
 and they were to appear dressed after the fashions of the southern
 nations of Europe. He was even himself at the pains of drawing up
 rules for all the little decorums to be observed at these social
 entertainments. Thus, even to good breeding among his subjects, all was
 his own work, and that of time.
 
 To make his people relish these innovations the better, he abolished the
 word _golut_, _slave_, always made use of by the Russians when they
 addressed their czar, or presented any petition to him; and ordered,
 that, for the future, they should make use of the word _raab_, which
 signifies _subject_. This alteration in no wise diminished the obedience
 due to the sovereign, and yet was the most ready means of conciliating
 their affections. Every month produced some new change or institution.
 He carried his attention even to the ordering painted posts to be set up
 in the road between Moscow and Woronitz, to serve as mile stones at the
 distance of every verst; that is to say, every seven hundred paces, and
 had a kind of caravanseras, or public inns, built at the end of every
 twentieth verst.
 
 While he was thus extending his cares to the common people, to the
 merchants, and to the traveller, he thought proper to make an addition
 to the pomp and splendour of his own court; for though he hated pomp or
 show in his own person, he thought it necessary in those about him; he
 therefore instituted the order of St. Andrew,[55] in imitation of the
 several orders with which all the courts of Europe abound. Golowin, who
 succeeded Le Fort in the dignity of high admiral, was the first knight
 of this order. It was esteemed a high reward to have the honour of being
 admitted a member. It was a kind of badge that entitled the person who
 bore it to the respect of the people. This mark of honour costs nothing
 to the sovereign, and flatters the self-love of a subject, without
 rendering him too powerful.
 
 These many useful innovations were received with applause by the wiser
 part of the nation; and the murmurings and complaints of those who
 adhered to the ancient customs were drowned in the acclamations of men
 of sound judgment.
 
 While Peter was thus beginning a new creation in the interior part of
 his state, he concluded an advantageous truce with the Turks, which gave
 him the liberty to extend his territories on another side. Mustapha the
 Second, who had been defeated by prince Eugene, at the battle of Zeuta,
 in 1697, stripped of the Morea by the Venetians, and unable to defend
 Azoph, was obliged to make peace with his victorious enemies, which
 peace was concluded at Carlowitz, (Jan. 26, 1699,) between Peterwaradin
 and Salankamon, places made famous by his defeats. Temeswaer was made
 the boundary of the German possessions, and of the Ottoman dominions.
 Kaminieck was restored to the Poles; the Morea, and some towns in
 Dalmatia, which had been taken by the Venetians, remained in their hands
 for some time; and Peter the First continued in possession of Casaph,
 and of a few forts built in its neighbourhood.
 
 It was not possible for the czar to extend his dominions on the side of
 Turkey, without drawing upon him the forces of that empire, before
 divided, but now united. His naval projects were too vast for the Palus
 Maeotis, and the settlements on the Caspian Sea would not admit of a
 fleet of men of war: he therefore turned his views towards the Baltic
 Sea, but without relinquishing those in regard to the Tanais and Wolga.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XI.
 
     War with Sweden.--The battle of Narva.
 
 
 [Sidenote: 1700.]
 
 A grand scene was now opened on the frontiers of Sweden. One of the
 principal causes of all the revolutions which happened from Ingria, as
 far as Dresden, and which laid waste so many countries for the space of
 eighteen years, was the abuse of the supreme power, by Charles XI. king
 of Sweden, father of Charles XII. This is a fact which cannot be too
 often repeated, as it concerns every crowned head, and the subjects of
 every nation. Almost all Livonia, with the whole of Esthonia, had been
 ceded by the Poles to Charles XI. king of Sweden, who succeeded Charles
 X. exactly at the time of the treaty of Oliva. It was ceded in the
 customary manner, with a reservation of rights and privileges. Charles
 XI. shewing little regard to these privileges, John Reinhold Patkul, a
 gentleman of Livonia, came to Stockholm in 1692, at the head of six
 deputies from the province, and laid their complaints at the foot of the
 throne, in respectful, but strong terms.[56] Instead of an answer, the
 deputies were ordered to be imprisoned, and Patkul was condemned to lose
 his honour and his life. But he lost neither, for he made his escape to
 the country of Vaud, in Switzerland, where he remained some time; when
 he afterwards was informed, that Augustus, elector of Saxony, had
 promised, at his accession to the throne of Poland, to recover the
 provinces that had been wrested from that kingdom; he hastened to
 Dresden, to represent to that prince, how easily he might make himself
 master of Livonia, and revenge upon a king, only seventeen years of age,
 the losses that Poland had sustained by his ancestors.
 
 At this very time czar Peter entertained thoughts of seizing upon Ingria
 and Carelia. These provinces had formerly belonged to the Russians, but
 the Swedes had made themselves masters of them by force of arms, in the
 time of the false Demetriuses, and had retained the possession of them
 by treaties: another war and new treaties might restore them again to
 Russia. Patkul went from Dresden to Moscow, and, by exciting up the two
 monarchs to avenge his private causes, he cemented a close union between
 them, and directed their preparations for invading all the places
 situated to the east and south of Finland.
 
 Just at this period, the new king of Denmark, Frederick IV. entered into
 an alliance with the czar and the king of Poland, against Charles, the
 young king of Sweden, who seemed in no condition to withstand their
 united forces. Patkul had the satisfaction of besieging the Swedes in
 Riga, the capital of Livonia, and directing the attack in quality of
 major-general.
 
 The czar marched near eighty thousand men into Ingria. It is true, that,
 in this numerous army, he had not more than twelve thousand good
 soldiers, being those he had disciplined himself; namely, the two
 regiments of guards, and some few others, the rest being a badly armed
 militia, with some Cossacks, and Circassian Tartars; but he carried
 with him a train of a hundred and forty-five pieces of cannon. He laid
 siege to Narva, a small town in Ingria, that had a very commodious
 harbour, and it was generally thought the place would prove an easy
 conquest.
 
 Sept.] It is known to all Europe, how Charles XII. when not quite
 eighteen years of age, made head against all his enemies, and attacked
 them one after another; he entered Denmark, put an end to the war in
 that kingdom in less than six weeks, sent succours to Riga, obliged the
 enemy to raise the siege, and marched against the Russians encamped
 before Narva, through the midst of ice and snow, in the month of
 November.
 
 The czar, who looked upon Narva as already in his possession, was gone
 to Novogorod, (Nov. 18,) and had taken with him his favourite,
 Menzikoff, then a lieutenant in the company of bombardiers, of the
 Preobrazinski regiment, and afterwards raised to the rank of
 field-marshal and prince; a man whose singular fortunes entitle him to
 be spoken of more at large in another place.
 
 Peter left the command of the army, with his instructions for the siege,
 with the prince of Croi; whose family came from Flanders, and who had
 lately entered into the czar's service.[57] Prince Dolgorouki acted as
 commissary of the army. The jealousy between these two chiefs, and the
 absence of the czar, were partly the occasion of the unparalleled defeat
 at Narva.
 
 Charles XII. having landed at Pernau, in Livonia, with his troops, in
 the month of October advanced northward to Revel, where he defeated an
 advanced body of Russians. He continued his march, and meeting with
 another body, routed that likewise. The runaways returned to the camp
 before Narva, which they filled with consternation. The month of
 November was now far advanced; Narva, though unskilfully besieged, was
 on the point of surrendering. The young king of Sweden had not at that
 time above nine thousand men with him, and could bring only six pieces
 of cannon to oppose to a hundred and forty-five, with which the Russian
 intrenchments were defended. All the relations of that time, and all
 historians without exception, concur in making the Russian army then
 before Narva amount to eighty thousand men. The memoirs with which I
 have been furnished say sixty thousand; be that as it may, it is
 certain, that Charles had not quite nine thousand; and that this battle
 was one of those which have proved, that the greatest victories have
 been frequently gained by inferior numbers, ever since the famed one of
 Arbela.[58]
 
 Nov. 30.] Charles did not hesitate one moment to attack with his small
 troop this army, so greatly superior; and, taking advantage of a violent
 wind, and a great storm of snow, which blew directly in the faces of the
 Russians, he attacked their intrenchments under cover of some pieces of
 cannon, which he had posted advantageously for the purpose. The Russians
 had not time to form themselves in the midst of that cloud of snow, that
 beat full in their faces, and astonished by the discharge of cannon,
 that they could not see, and never imagined how small a number they had
 to oppose.
 
 The duke de Croi attempted to give his orders, but prince Dolgorouki
 would not receive them. The Russian officers rose upon the German
 officers; the duke's secretary, with Colonel Lyon, and several others,
 were murdered. Every one abandoned his post; and tumult, confusion, and
 a panic of terror, spread through the whole army. The Swedish troops had
 nothing more to do, but to cut in pieces those who were flying. Some
 threw themselves into the river Narva, where great numbers were drowned;
 others threw down their arms, and fell upon their knees before the
 conquering Swedes.
 
 The duke de Croi, general Alland, and the rest of the general officers,
 dreading the Russians more than the Swedes, went in a body and
 surrendered themselves prisoners to count Steinbock. The king of Sweden
 now made himself master of all the artillery. Thirty thousand of the
 vanquished enemy laid down their arms at his feet, and filed off
 bare-headed and disarmed before him. Prince Dolgorouki, and all the
 Russian generals, came and surrendered themselves, as well as the
 Germans, but did not know till after they had surrendered, that they had
 been conquered by eight thousand men. Amongst the prisoners, was the son
 of a king of Georgia, whom Charles sent to Stockholm: his name was
 Mittelesky Czarovits, or czar's son, an additional proof that the title
 of czar, or tzar, had not its original from the Roman Caesars.
 
 Charles XII. did not lose more than one thousand two hundred men in this
 battle. The czar's journal, which has been sent me from Petersburg,
 says, that including those who died at the siege of Narva, and in the
 battle, and those who were drowned in their flight, the Russians lost no
 more than six thousand men. Want of discipline, and a panic that seized
 the army, did all the work of that fatal day. The number of those made
 prisoners of war, was four times greater than that of the conquerors;
 and if we may believe Norberg,[59] count Piper, who was afterwards taken
 prisoner by the Russians, reproached them, that the number of their
 people made prisoners in the battle, exceeded by eight times the number
 of the whole Swedish army. If this is truth, the Swedes must have made
 upwards of seventy-two thousand prisoners. This shews how seldom writers
 are well informed of particular circumstances. One thing, however,
 equally incontestable and extraordinary, is, that the king of Sweden
 permitted one half of the Russian soldiers to retire back, after having
 disarmed them, and the other half to repass the river, with their arms;
 by this unaccountable presumption, restoring to the czar troops that,
 being afterwards well disciplined, became invincible.[60]
 
 Charles had all the advantages that could result from a complete
 victory. Immense magazines, transports loaded with provisions, posts
 evacuated or taken, and the whole country at the mercy of the Swedish
 army, were consequences of the fortune of this day. Narva was now
 relieved, the shattered remains of the Russian army did not shew
 themselves; the whole country as far as Pleskow lay open; the czar
 seemed bereft of all resource for carrying on the war; and the king of
 Sweden, victor in less than twelve months over the monarchs of Denmark,
 Poland, and Russia, was looked upon as the first prince in Europe, at
 an age when other princes hardly presume to aspire at reputation. But
 the unshaken constancy that made a part of Peter's character, prevented
 him from being discouraged in any of his projects.
 
 A Russian bishop composed a prayer to St. Nicholas,[61] on account of
 this defeat, which was publicly read in all the churches throughout
 Russia. This composition shews the spirit of the times, and the
 inexpressible ignorance from which Peter delivered his country. Amongst
 other things, it says, that the furious and terrible Swedes were
 sorcerers; and complains that St. Nicholas had entirely abandoned his
 Russians. The prelates of that country would blush to write such stuff
 at present; and, without any offence to the holy St. Nicholas, the
 people soon perceived that Peter was the most proper person to be
 applied to, to retrieve their losses.

     Resources after the battle of Narva. That disaster entirely
     repaired. Peter gains a victory near the same place. The person who
     was afterwards empress made prisoner at the storming of a town.
     Peter's successes. His triumph at Moscow.[62]
 
     The years 1701 and 1703.
 
 
 The czar having, as has been already observed, quitted his army before
 Narva, in the end of November, 1700, in order to go and concert matters
 with the king of Poland, received the news of the victory gained by the
 Swedes, as he was on his way. His constancy in all emergencies was equal
 to the intrepidity and valour of Charles. He deferred the conference
 with Augustus, and hastened to repair the disordered state of his
 affairs. The scattered troops rendezvoused at Great Novogorod, and from
 thence marched to Pleskow, on the lake Peipus.
 
 It was not a little matter to be able to stand upon the defensive, after
 so severe a check: 'I know very well,' said Peter, 'that the Swedes will
 have the advantage of us for some time, but they will teach us at length
 to conquer them.'
 
 1701.] Having provided for the present emergency, and ordered recruits
 to be raised on every side, he sent to Moscow to cast new cannon, his
 own having been all taken before Narva. There being a scarcity of metal,
 he took all the bells of the churches, and of the religious houses in
 Moscow. This action did not savour much of superstition, but at the same
 time it was no mark of impiety. With those bells he made one hundred
 large cannon, one hundred and forty-three field-pieces, from three to
 six pounders, besides mortars and howitzers, which were all sent to
 Pleskow. In other countries the sovereign orders, and others execute;
 but here the czar was obliged to see every thing done himself. While he
 was hastening these preparations, he entered into a negotiation with the
 king of Denmark, who engaged to furnish him with three regiments of
 foot, and three of cavalry; an engagement which that monarch could not
 fulfil.
 
 As soon as this treaty was signed, he hurried to the theatre of war. He
 had an interview with king Augustus, at Birzen, (Feb. 27.) on the
 frontiers of Courland and Lithuania. His object was, to confirm that
 prince in his resolution of maintaining the war against Charles XII. and
 at the same time to engage the Polish Diet to enter into the quarrel. It
 is well known, that a king of Poland is no more than the head person in
 a republic. The czar had the advantage of being always obeyed; but the
 kings of Poland, and England, at present the king of Sweden, are all
 obliged to treat with their subjects.[63] Patkul and a few Poles in the
 interest of their monarch, assisted at these conferences. Peter promised
 to aid them with subsidies, and an army of twenty-five thousand men.
 Livonia was to be restored to Poland, in case the diet would concur with
 their king, and assist in recovering this province: the diet hearkened
 more to their fears, than to the czar's proposals. The Poles were
 apprehensive of having their liberties restrained by the Saxons and
 Russians, and were still more afraid of Charles XII. It was therefore
 agreed by the majority, not to serve their king, and not to fight.
 
 The partisans of Augustus grew enraged against the contrary faction, and
 a civil war was lighted up in the kingdom; because their monarch had an
 intention to restore to it a considerable province.
 
 Feb.] Peter then had only an impotent ally in king Augustus, and feeble
 succours in the Saxon troops; and the terror which Charles XII. inspired
 on every side, reduced Peter to the necessity of depending entirely upon
 his own strength.
 
 March 1.] After travelling with the greatest expedition from Moscow to
 Courland, to confer with Augustus: he posted back from Courland to
 Moscow, to forward the accomplishment of his promises. He actually
 dispatched Prince Repnin, with four thousand men, to Riga, on the banks
 of the Duna, where the Saxon troops were intrenched.
 
 July.] The general consternation was now increased; for Charles, passing
 the Duna in spite of all the Saxons, who were advantageously posted on
 the opposite side, gained a complete victory over them; and then,
 without waiting a moment, he made himself master of Courland, advanced
 into Lithuania, and by his presence encouraged the Polish faction that
 opposed Augustus.
 
 Peter, notwithstanding all this, still pursued his designs. General
 Patkul, who had been the soul of the conference at Birzen, and who had
 engaged in his service, procured him some German officers, disciplined
 his troops, and supplied the place of general Le Fort: the czar ordered
 relays of horses to be provided for all the officers, and even for the
 German, Livonian, and Polish soldiers, who came to serve in his armies.
 He likewise inspected in person into every particular relating to their
 arms, their clothing, and subsistence.
 
 On the confines of Livonia and Esthonia, and to the eastward of the
 province of Novogorod, lies the great lake Peipus, which receives the
 waters of the river Velika, from out of the middle of Livonia, and gives
 rise in its northern part to the river Naiova, that washes the walls of
 the town of Narva, near which the Swedes gained their famous victory.
 This lake is upwards of thirty leagues in length, and from twelve to
 fifteen in breadth. It was necessary to keep a fleet there, to prevent
 the Swedish ships from insulting the province of Novogorod; to be ready
 to make a descent upon their coasts, and above all, to be a nursery for
 seamen. Peter employed the greatest part of the year 1701, in building
 on this lake an hundred half gallies, to carry about fifty men each; and
 other armed barks were fitted out on the lake Ladoga. He directed all
 these operations in person, and set his new sailors to work: those who
 had been employed in 1697, at the Palus Maeotis were then stationed near
 the Baltic. He frequently quitted those occupations to go to Moscow, and
 the rest of the provinces, in order to enforce the observance of the
 late customs he had introduced, or to establish new ones.
 
 Those princes who have employed the leisure moments of peace in raising
 public works, have acquired to themselves a name: but that Peter, just
 after his misfortune at Narva, should apply himself to the junction of
 the Baltic, Caspian, and the Black seas, by canals, has crowned him with
 more real glory than the most signal victory. It was in the year 1702,
 that he began to dig that deep canal, intended to join the Tanais and
 the Wolga. Other communications were likewise to be made, by means of
 lakes between the Tanais and the Duna; whose waters empty themselves
 into the Baltic, in the neighbourhood of Riga. But this latter project
 seemed to be still at a great distance, as Peter was far from having
 Riga in his possession.
 
 While Charles was laying all Poland waste, Peter caused to be brought
 from that kingdom, and from Saxony, a number of shepherds, with their
 flocks, in order to have wool fit for making good cloth; he likewise
 erected manufactories of linen and paper: gave orders for collecting a
 number of artificers; such as smiths, braziers, armourers, and
 founders, and the mines of Siberia were ransacked for ore. Thus was he
 continually labouring for the embellishment and defence of his
 dominions.
 
 Charles pursued the course of his victories, and left a sufficient body
 of troops, as he imagined, on the frontiers of the czar's dominions, to
 secure all the possessions of Sweden. He had already formed a design to
 dethrone Augustus, and afterwards to pursue the czar with his victorious
 army to the very gates of Moscow.
 
 There happened several slight engagements in the course of this year,
 between the Russians and Swedes, in which the latter did not always
 prove superior; and even in those where they had the advantage, the
 Russians improved in the art of war. In short, in little more than
 twelve months after the battle of Narva, the czar's troops were so well
 disciplined, that they defeated one of the best generals belonging to
 the king of Sweden.
 
 Peter was then at Pleskow, from whence he detached numerous bodies of
 troops, on all sides, to attack the Swedes; who were now defeated by a
 native of Russia, and not a foreigner. His general, Sheremeto, by a
 skilful manoeuvre, beat up the quarters of the Swedish general,
 Slipenbak, in several places, near Derpt, on the frontiers of Livonia;
 and at last obtained a victory over that officer himself. (Jan. 11,
 1702.) And now, for the first time, the Russians took from the Swedes
 four of their colours; which was thought a considerable number.
 
 May.] The lakes Peipus and Ladoga were for some time afterwards the
 theatres of sea-fights between the Russians and Swedes; in which the
 latter had the same advantages as by land: namely, that of discipline
 and long practice; but the Russians had some few successes with their
 half gallies, at the lake Peipus, and the field-marshal Sheremeto took a
 Swedish frigate.
 
 By means of this lake, the czar kept Livonia and Esthonia in continual
 alarms; his gallies frequently landed several regiments in those
 provinces; who reimbarked whenever they failed of success, or else
 pursued their advantage: the Swedes were twice beaten in the
 neighbourhood of Derpt, (June, July,) while they were victorious every
 where else.
 
 In all these actions the Russians were always superior in number; for
 this reason, Charles XII. who was so successful in every other place,
 gave himself little concern about these trifling advantages gained by
 the czar: but he should have considered, that these numerous forces of
 his rival were every day growing more accustomed to the business of
 fighting, and might soon become formidable to himself.
 
 While both parties were thus engaged, by sea and land, in Livonia,
 Ingria, and Esthonia, the czar is informed that a Swedish fleet had set
 sail, in order to destroy Archangel; upon which he immediately marched
 thither, and every one was astonished to hear of him on the coasts of
 the Frozen Sea, when he was thought to be at Moscow. He put the town
 into a posture of defence, prevented the intended descent, drew the plan
 of a citadel, called the New Dwina, laid the first stone, and then
 returned to Moscow, and from thence to the seat of war.
 
 Charles made some alliances in Poland; but the Russians, on their side,
 made a progress in Ingria and Livonia. Marshal Sheremeto marched to meet
 the Swedish army, under the command of Slipenbak, gave that general
 battle near the little river Embac, and defeated him, taking sixteen
 colours, and twenty pieces of cannon. Norberg places this action on the
 first of December, 1701; but the journal of Peter the Great, fixes it on
 the nineteenth of July, 1702.
 
 6th Aug.] After this advantage, the Russian general marched onwards,
 laid the whole country under contributions, and takes the little town of
 Marienburg, on the confines of Ingria and Livonia. There are several
 towns of this name in the north of Europe; but this, though it no longer
 exists, is more celebrated in history than all the others, by the
 adventure of the empress Catherine.
 
 This little town, having surrendered at discretion, the Swedes, who
 defended it, either through mistake or design, set fire to the magazine.
 The Russians, incensed at this, destroyed the town, and carried away all
 the inhabitants. Among the prisoners was a young woman, a native of
 Livonia, who had been brought up in the house of a Lutheran minister of
 that place, named Gluck, and who afterwards became the sovereign of
 those who had taken her captive, and who governed Russia by the name of
 the empress Catherine.
 
 There had been many instances before this, of private women being raised
 to the throne; nothing was more common in Russia, and in all Asiatic
 kingdoms, than for crowned heads to marry their own subjects; but that a
 poor stranger, who had been taken prisoner in the storming of a town,
 should become the absolute sovereign of that very empire, whither she
 was led captive, is an instance which fortune never produced before nor
 since in the annals of the world.
 
 The Russian arms proved equally successful in Ingria: for their half
 gallies on the lake Ladoga compelled the Swedish fleet to retire to
 Wibourg,[64] a town at the other extremity of this great lake, from
 whence they could see the siege of the fortress of Notebourg, which was
 then carrying on by general Sheremeto. This was an undertaking of much
 greater importance than was imagined at that time, as it might open a
 communication with the Baltic Sea, the constant aim of Peter the Great.
 
 Notebourg was a strong fortified town, built on an island in the lake
 Ladoga, which it entirely commands, and by that means, whoever is in
 possession of it, must be masters of that part of the river Neva, which
 falls into the sea not far from thence. The Russians bombarded the town
 night and day, from the 18th of September to the 12th October; and at
 length gave a general assault by three breaches. The Swedish garrison
 was reduced to a hundred men only capable of defending the place; and,
 what is very astonishing, they did defend it, and obtain, even in the
 breach, an honourable capitulation: moreover, colonel Slipenbak, who
 commanded there, would not surrender the town, but on condition of being
 permitted to send for two Swedish officers from the nearest post, to
 examine the breaches (Oct. 16.), in order to be witnesses for him to the
 king his master, that eighty-three men, who were all then left of the
 garrison capable of bearing arms, besides one hundred and fifty sick and
 wounded, did not surrender to a whole army, till it was impossible for
 them to fight longer, or to preserve the place. This circumstance alone
 shews what sort of an enemy the czar had to contend with, and the
 necessity there was of all his great efforts and military discipline. He
 distributed gold medals among his officers on this occasion, and gave
 rewards to all the private men; except a few, whom he punished for
 running away during the assault. Their comrades spit in their faces, and
 afterwards shot them to death; thus adding ignominy to punishment.
 
 Notebourg was repaired, and its name changed to that of Shlusselburg, or
 the City of the Key; that place being the key of Ingria and Finland. The
 first governor was that Menzikoff, whom we have already mentioned, and
 who was become an excellent officer, and had merited this honour by his
 gallant behaviour during the siege. His example served as an
 encouragement to all who have merit without being distinguished by
 birth.
 
 After this campaign of 1702, the czar resolved that Sheremeto, and the
 officers who had signalized themselves, should make a triumphal entry
 into Moscow. (Dec. 17.) All the prisoners taken in this campaign marched
 in the train of the victors, who had the Swedish colours and standards
 carried before them, together with the flag of the Swedish frigate taken
 on the lake Peipus. Peter assisted in the preparations for this
 triumphal pomp, as he had shared in the great actions it celebrated.
 
 These shows naturally inspired emulation, otherwise they would have been
 no more than idle ostentation. Charles despised every thing of this
 kind, and, after the battle of Narva, held his enemies, their efforts,
 and their triumphs, in equal contempt.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XIII.
 
     Reformation at Moscow.--Further successes.--Founding of
     Petersburg.--The czar takes Narva, &c.
 
 
 The short stay which the czar made at Moscow, in the beginning of the
 winter 1703, was employed in seeing all his new regulations put into
 execution, and in improving the civil as well as the military
 government. Even his very amusements were calculated to inspire his
 subjects with a taste for the new manner of living he had introduced
 amongst them. In this view, he invited all the boyards, and principal
 ladies of Moscow, to the marriage of one of his sisters, at which every
 one was required to appear dressed after the ancient fashion. A dinner
 was served up just in the same manner as those in the sixteenth
 century.[65] By an old superstitious custom, no one was to light a fire
 on the wedding-day, even in the coldest season. This custom was
 rigorously observed upon this occasion. The Russians formerly never
 drank wine, but only mead and brandy; no other liquors were permitted on
 this day, and, when the guests made complaints, he replied, in a joking
 manner, 'This was a custom with your ancestors, and old customs are
 always the best.' This raillery contributed greatly to the reformation
 of those who preferred past times to the present, at least it put a stop
 to their murmurings; and there are several nations that stand in need of
 the like example.
 
 A still more useful establishment than any of the rest, was that of a
 printing-press, for Russian and Latin types; the implements of which
 were all brought from Holland. They began by printing translations in
 the Russian language of several books of morality and polite literature.
 Ferguson founded schools for geometry, astronomy, and navigation.
 
 Another foundation, no less necessary, was that of a large hospital; not
 one of those houses which encourage idleness, and perpetuate the misery
 of the people, but such as the czar had seen at Amsterdam, where old
 persons and children are employed at work, and where every one within
 the walls is made useful in some way or other.
 
 He established several manufactories; and, as soon he had put in motion
 all those arts to which he gave birth in Moscow, he hastened to
 Woronitz, to give directions for building two ships, of eighty guns
 each, with long cradles, or caserns, fitted to the ribs of the vessel,
 to buoy her up, and carry her safely over the shoals and banks of sand
 that lay about Azoph; an ingenious contrivance, similar to that used by
 the Dutch in Holland, to get their large ships over the Pampus.
 
 Having made all the necessary preparations against the Turks, he turned
 his attention, in the next place, against the Swedes. He went to visit
 the ships that were building at Olonitz (March 30, 1703.), a town
 between the lakes Ladago and Onega, where he had established a foundry
 for making all kinds of arms; and, when every thing bore a military
 aspect, at Moscow flourished all the arts of peace. A spring of mineral
 waters, which has been lately discovered near Olonitz, has added to the
 reputation of that place. From thence he proceeded to Shlusselburg,
 which he fortified.
 
 We have already observed, that Peter was determined to pass regularly
 through all the military degrees: he had served as lieutenant of
 bombardiers, under prince Menzikoff, before that favourite was made
 governor of Shlusselburg, and he now took the rank of captain, and
 served under marshal Sheremeto.
 
 There was an important fortress near the lake Ladoga, and not far from
 the river Neva, named Nyantz, or Nya.[66] It was necessary to make
 himself master of this place, in order to secure his conquest, and
 favour his other designs. He therefore undertook to transport a number
 of small barks, filled with soldiers, and to drive off the Swedish
 vessels that were bringing supplies, while Sheremeto had the care of the
 trenches. (May 22.) The citadel surrendered, and two Swedish vessels
 arrived, too late to assist the besieged, being both attacked and taken
 by the czar. His journal says, that, as a reward for his service, 'The
 captain of bombardiers was created knight of the order of St. Andrew by
 admiral Golowin, the first knight of that order.'
 
 After the taking of the fort of Nya, he resolved upon building the city
 of Petersburg, at the mouth of the Neva, upon the gulf of Finland.
 
 The affairs of king Augustus were in a desperate way; the excessive
 victories of the Swedes in Poland had emboldened his enemies in the
 opposition; and even his friends had obliged him to dismiss a body of
 twenty thousand Russians, that the czar had sent him to reinforce his
 army. They thought, by this sacrifice, to deprive the malcontents of all
 pretext for joining the king of Sweden: but enemies are disarmed by
 force, a show of weakness serving only to make them more insolent. These
 twenty thousand men, that had been disciplined by Patkul, proved of
 infinite service in Livonia and Ingria, while Augustus was losing his
 dominions. This reinforcement, and, above all, the possession of Nya,
 enabled the czar to found his new capital.
 
 It was in this barren and marshy spot of ground, which has communication
 with the main land only by one way, that Peter laid the foundation of
 Petersburg, in the sixtieth degree of latitude, and the forty-fourth and
 a half of longitude. The ruins of some of the bastions of Nya was made
 use of for the first stones of the foundation.[67] They began by
 building a small fort upon one of the islands, which is now in the
 centre of the city. The Swedes beheld, without apprehension, a
 settlement in the midst of a morass, and inaccessible to vessels of
 burden; but, in a very short time, they saw the fortifications advanced,
 a town raised, and the little island of Cronstadt, situated over against
 it, changed, in 1704, into an impregnable fortress, under the cannon of
 which even the largest fleets may ride in safety.
 
 These works, which seemed to require a time of profound peace, were
 carried on in the very bosom of war; workmen of every sort were called
 together, from Moscow, Astracan, Casan, and the Ukraine, to assist in
 building the new city. Neither the difficulties of the ground, that was
 to be rendered firm, and raised, the distance of the necessary
 materials, the unforeseen obstacles, which are for ever starting up in
 all great undertakings; nor, lastly, the epidemical disorder, which
 carried off a prodigious number of the workmen, could discourage the
 royal founder; and, in the space of five months, a new city rose from
 the ground. It is true, indeed, it was little better than a cluster of
 huts, with only two brick houses, surrounded by ramparts; but this was
 all that was then necessary. Time and perseverance accomplished the
 rest. In less than five months, after the founding of Petersburg, a
 Dutch ship came to trade there, (Nov.) the captain of which was
 handsomely rewarded, and the Dutch soon found the way to Petersburg.
 
 While Peter was directing the establishment of this colony, he took care
 to provide every day for its safety, by making himself master of the
 neighbouring posts. A Swedish colonel, named Croniort, had taken post on
 the river Sestra, and thence threatened the rising city. Peter, without
 delay, marched against him with his two regiments of guards, defeated
 him, (July 8.) and obliged him to repass the river. Having thus put his
 town in safety, he repaired to Olonitz,(Sep.) to give directions for
 building a number of small vessels, and afterwards returned to
 Petersburg, on board a frigate that had been built by his direction,
 taking with him six transport vessels, for present use, till the others
 could be got ready. Even at this juncture he did not forget his ally,
 the king of Poland, but sent him (Nov.) a reinforcement of twelve
 thousand foot, and a subsidy in money of three hundred thousand rubles,
 which make about one million five hundred thousand French livres.[68] It
 has been remarked, that his annual revenue did not exceed then five
 million rubles; a sum, which the expense of his fleets, of his armies,
 and of his new establishments, seemed more than sufficient to exhaust.
 He had, at almost one and the same time, fortified Novogorod,
 Pleskow, Kiow, Smolensko, Azoph, Archangel, and founded a capital.
 Notwithstanding all which, he had still a sufficiency left to assist his
 ally with men and money. Cornelius le Bruine, a Dutchman, who was on his
 travels, and at that time in Russia, and with whom he frequently
 conversed very freely, as indeed he did with all strangers, says, that
 the czar himself assured him, that he had still three hundred thousand
 rubles remaining in his coffers, after all the expenses of the war were
 defrayed.
 
 In order to put his infant city of Petersburg out of danger of insult,
 he went in person to sound the depth of water thereabouts, fixed upon a
 place for building the fort of Cronstadt; and, after making the model of
 it in wood with his own hands, he employed prince Menzikoff to put it in
 execution. From thence he went to pass the winter at Moscow, (Nov. 5.)
 in order to establish, by degrees, the several alterations he had made
 in the laws, manners, and customs of Russia. He regulated the finances,
 and put them upon a new footing. He expedited the works that were
 carrying on in the Woronitz, at Azoph, and in a harbour which he had
 caused to be made on the Palus Maeotis, under the fort of Taganrock.
 
 Jan. 1704.] The Ottoman Porte, alarmed at these preparations, sent an
 embassy to the czar, complaining thereof: to which he returned for
 answer that he was master in his own dominions, as well as the grand
 seignior was in Turkey, and that it was no infringement of the peace to
 render the Russian power respectable on the Euxine Sea.
 
 March 30.] Upon his return to Petersburg, finding his new citadel of
 Cronstadt, which had been founded in the bosom of the sea, completely
 finished, he furnished it with the necessary artillery. But, in order to
 settle himself firmly in Ingria, and entirely to repair the disgrace he
 had suffered before Narva, he esteemed it necessary to take that city.
 While he was making preparations for the siege, a small fleet appeared
 on the lake of Peipus, to oppose his designs. The Russian half galleys
 went out to meet them, gave them battle, and took the whole squadron,
 which had on board ninety-eight pieces of cannon. After this victory,
 the czar lays siege to Narva both by sea and land, (April.) and, which
 was most extraordinary, he lays siege to the city of Derpt in Esthonia
 at the same time.
 
 Who would have imagined, that there was a university in Derpt? Gustavus
 Adolphus had founded one there, but it did not render that city more
 famous, Derpt being only known by these two sieges. Peter was
 incessantly going from the one to the other, forwarding the attacks, and
 directing all the operations. The Swedish general Slipenbak was in the
 neighbourhood of Derpt, with a body of two thousand five hundred men.
 
 The besiegers expected every instant when he would throw succours into
 the place; but Peter, on this occasion, had recourse to a stratagem
 worthy of more frequent imitation: he ordered two regiments of foot, and
 one of horse, to be clothed in the same uniform, and to carry the same
 standards and colours as the Swedes: these sham Swedes attack the
 trenches, (June 27.) and the Russians pretend to be put to flight; the
 garrison, deceived by appearances, make a sally; upon which the mock
 combatants join their forces and fall upon the Swedes, one half of whom
 were left dead upon the place, and the rest made shift to get back to
 the town. Slipenbak arrives soon after with succours to relieve it, but
 is totally defeated. At length Derpt was obliged to capitulate, (July
 23.) just as the czar was preparing every thing for a general assault.
 
 At the same time Peter met with a considerable check, on the side of his
 new city of Petersburg; but this did not prevent him either from going
 on with the works of that place, or from vigorously prosecuting the
 siege of Narva. It has already been observed, that he sent a
 reinforcement of troops and money to king Augustus, when his enemies
 were driving him from his throne; but both these aids proved useless.
 The Russians having joined the Lithuanians in the interest of Augustus,
 were totally defeated in Courland by the Swedish general Levenhaupt:
 (July 31.) and had the victors directed their efforts towards Livonia,
 Esthonia, and Ingria, they might have destroyed the czar's new works,
 and baffled all the fruits of his great undertakings. Peter was every
 day sapping the breast-work of Sweden, while Charles seemed to neglect
 all resistance, for the pursuit of a less advantageous, though a more
 brilliant fame.
 
 On the 13th of July, 1704, only a single Swedish colonel, at the head of
 his detachment, obliged the Polish nobility to nominate a new king, on
 the field of election, called Kolo, near the city of Warsaw. The
 cardinal-primate of the kingdom, and several bishops, submitted to a
 Lutheran prince, notwithstanding the menaces and excommunications of the
 supreme pontiff: in short, every thing gave way to force. All the world
 knows in what manner Stanislaus Leczinsky was elected king, and how
 Charles XII. obliged the greatest part of Poland to acknowledge him.
 
 Peter, however, would not abandon the dethroned king, but redoubled his
 assistance, in proportion to the necessities of his ally; and, while his
 enemy was making kings, he beat the Swedish generals one after another
 in Esthonia and Ingria; from thence he passed to the siege of Narva, and
 gave several vigorous assaults to the town. There were three bastions,
 famous at least for their names, called Victory, Honour, and Glory. The
 czar carried them all three sword-in-hand. The besiegers forced their
 way into the town, where they pillaged and exercised all those cruelties
 which were but too customary at that time, between the Swedes and
 Russians.
 
 August 20.] Peter, on this occasion, gave an example that ought to have
 gained him the affections of all his new subjects: he ran every where in
 person, to put a stop to the pillage and slaughter, rescues several
 women out of the clutches of the brutal soldiery, and, after having,
 with his own hand, killed two of those ruffians who had refused to obey
 his orders, he enters the town-house, whither the citizens had ran in
 crowds for shelter, and laying his sword, yet reeking with blood, upon
 the table--'This sword,' said he, 'is not stained with the blood of your
 fellow citizens, but with that of my own soldiers, which I have spilt to
 save your lives'.

     victories of the king of Sweden.[69]
 
 
 [Sidenote: 1704.]
 
 Peter being now master of all Ingria, conferred the government of that
 province upon Menzikoff; and at the same time gave him the title of
 prince, and the rank of major-general. Pride and prejudice might, in
 other countries, find means to gainsay, that a pastry cook's boy should
 be raised to be a general and governor, and to princely dignity; but
 Peter had already accustomed his subjects to see, without surprise,
 every thing given to merit, and nothing to mere nobility. Menzikoff, by
 a lucky accident, had, while a boy, been taken from his original
 obscurity, and placed in the czar's family,[70] where he learnt several
 languages, and acquired a knowledge of public affairs, both in the
 cabinet and field; and having found means to ingratiate himself with his
 master, he afterwards knew how to render himself necessary. He greatly
 forwarded the works at Petersburg, of which he had the direction;
 several brick and stone houses were already built, with an arsenal and
 magazines; the fortifications were completed, but the palaces were not
 built till some time afterwards.
 
 Peter was scarcely settled in Narva, when he offered fresh succours to
 the dethroned king of Poland; he promised him a body of troops over and
 above the twelve thousand men he had already sent him, and actually
 dispatched general Repnin (Aug. 19.) from the frontiers of Lithuania,
 with six thousand horse, and the same number of foot. All this while he
 did not lose sight of his colony of Petersburg: the buildings went on
 very fast; his navy encreased daily; several ships and frigates were on
 the stocks at Olmutz; these he took care to see finished, and brought
 them himself into the harbour of Petersburg.
 
 Oct. 11.] Each time he returned to Moscow, was distinguished by
 triumphal entries. In this manner did he revisit it this year, from
 whence he made only one excursion, to be present at the launching of his
 first ship of eighty guns upon the Woronitz, (Dec. 30.) of which ship he
 himself had drawn the dimensions the preceding year.
 
 May, 1705.] As soon as the campaign could be opened in Poland, he
 hastened to the army, which he had sent to the assistance of Augustus,
 on the frontiers of that kingdom; but, while he was thus supporting his
 ally, a Swedish fleet put to sea, to destroy Petersburg, and the
 fortress of Cronslot, as yet hardly finished. This fleet consisted of
 twenty-two ships of war, from fifty-four to sixty-four guns each,
 besides six frigates, two bomb-ketches, and two fire-ships. The troops
 that were sent on this expedition, made a descent on the little island
 of Kotin; but a Russian colonel, named Tolbogwin, who commanded a
 regiment there, ordered his soldiers to lie down flat on their bellies,
 while the Swedes were coming on shore, and then suddenly rising up, they
 threw in so brisk and well directed a fire, that the Swedes were put
 into confusion, and forced to retreat with the utmost precipitation to
 their ships, leaving behind them all their dead, and upwards of three
 hundred prisoners. (June 7.)
 
 However, their fleet still continued hovering about the coast, and
 threatened Petersburg. They made another descent, and were repulsed as
 before (June 25.): a body of land-forces were also advancing from
 Wiburn,[71] under the command of the Swedish general Meidel, and took
 their route by Shlusselburg: this was the most considerable attempt that
 Charles had yet made upon those territories, which Peter had either
 conquered or new formed. The Swedes were every where repulsed, and
 Petersburg remained in security.
 
 Peter, on the other hand, advanced towards Courland, with a design to
 penetrate as far as Riga. His plan was to make himself master of
 Livonia, while Charles XII. was busied in reducing the Poles entirely
 under the obedience of the new king he had given them. The czar was
 still at Wilnaw in Lithuania, and his general Sheremeto was approaching
 towards Mittau, the capital of Courland; but there he was met by general
 Levenhaupt, already famous by several victories, and a pitched battle
 was fought between the two armies at a place called Gemavershoff, or
 Gemavers.
 
 In all those actions where experience and discipline decide the day, the
 Swedes, though inferior in number, had the advantage. The Russians were
 totally defeated, (June 28.) and lost their artillery. Peter,
 notwithstanding the loss of three battles, viz. at Gemavers, at
 Jacobstadt, and at Narva, always retrieved his losses, and even
 converted them to his advantage.
 
 After the battle of Gemavers, he marched his army into Courland; came
 before Mittau, made himself master of the town, and afterwards laid
 siege to the citadel, which he took by capitulation.
 
 Sept. 14, 1705.] The Russian troops at that time had the character of
 distinguishing their successes by rapine and pillage; a custom of too
 great antiquity in all nations. But Peter, at the taking of Narva, had
 made such alterations in this custom, that the Russian soldiers
 appointed to guard the vaults where the grand dukes of Courland were
 buried, in the castle of Mittau, perceiving that the bodies had been
 taken out of their tombs, and stripped of their ornaments, refused to
 take possession of their post, till a Swedish colonel had been first
 sent for to inspect the condition of the place; who gave them a
 certificate that this outrage had been committed by the Swedes
 themselves.
 
 A rumour which was spread throughout the whole empire, that the czar had
 been totally defeated at the battle of Gemavers, proved of greater
 prejudice to his affairs, than even the loss of that battle. The
 remainder of the ancient strelitzes in garrison at Astracan, emboldened
 by this false report, mutinied, and murdered the governor of the town.
 Peter was obliged to send marshal Sheremeto with a body of forces to
 quell the insurrection, and punish the mutineers.
 
 Every thing seemed now to conspire against the czar; the success and
 valour of Charles XII.; the misfortunes of Augustus; the forced
 neutrality of Denmark; the insurrection of the ancient strelitzes; the
 murmurs of a people, sensible of the restraint, but not of the utility
 of the late reform; the discontent of the grandees, who found themselves
 subjected to military discipline; and, lastly, the exhausted state of
 the finances, were sufficient to have discouraged any prince except
 Peter: but he did not despond, even for an instant. He soon quelled the
 revolt, and having provided for the safety of Ingria, and secured the
 possession of the citadel of Mittau, in spite of the victorious
 Levenhaupt, who had not troops enough to oppose him; he found himself at
 liberty to march an army through Samojitia and Lithuania.
 
 He now shared with Charles XII. the glory of giving laws to Poland. He
 advanced as far as Tikoczin: where he had an interview for the second
 time with king Augustus; when he endeavoured to comfort him under his
 misfortunes, promising to revenge his cause, and, at the same time, made
 him a present of some colours, which Menzikoff had taken from the troops
 of his rival. The two monarchs afterwards went together to Grodno, the
 capital of Lithuania, where they staid till the 15th of December. At
 their parting, Peter presented him both men and money, and then,
 according to his usual custom, went to pass some part of the winter at
 Moscow, (30 Dec.) to encourage the arts and sciences there, and to
 enforce his new laws there, after having made a very difficult and
 laborious campaign.

     While Peter is strengthening his conquests, and improving the police
     of his dominion, his enemy Charles XII. gains several battles: gives
     laws to Poland and Saxony, and to Augustus, notwithstanding a
     victory gained by the Russians.--Augustus resigns the crown, and
     delivers up Patkul, the czar's ambassador.--Murder of Patkul, who is
     sentenced to be broke upon the wheel.
 
 
 [Sidenote: 1706.]
 
 Peter was hardly returned to Moscow, when he heard that Charles XII.
 after being every where victorious, was advancing towards Grodno, to
 attack the Russian troops. King Augustus had been obliged to fly from
 Grodno, and retire with precipitation towards Saxony, with four
 regiments of Russian dragoons; a step which both weakened and
 discouraged the army of his protector. Peter found all the advances to
 Grodno occupied by the Swedes, and his troops dispersed.
 
 While he was with the greatest difficulty assembling his troops in
 Lithuania, the famous Schullemburg, who was the last support Augustus
 had left, and who afterwards gained so much glory by the defence of
 Corfu against the Turks, was advancing on the side of Great Poland, with
 about twelve thousand Saxons, and six thousand Russians, taken from the
 body troops with which the czar had entrusted that unfortunate prince.
 Schullemburg expected with just reason, that he should be able to prop
 the sinking fortunes of Augustus; he perceived that Charles XII. was
 employed in Lithuania, and that there was only a body of ten thousand
 Swedes under general Renschild to interrupt his march; he therefore
 advanced with confidence as far as the frontiers of Silesia; which is
 the passage out of Saxony into Upper Poland. When he came near the
 village of Fraustadt, on the frontiers of that kingdom, he met marshal
 Renschild, who was advancing to give him battle.
 
 Whatever care I take to avoid repeating what has been already mentioned
 in the history of Charles XII., I am obliged in this place to take
 notice once more, that there was in the Saxon army a French regiment,
 that had been taken prisoners at the famous battle of Hochsted (or
 Blenheim) and obliged to serve in the Saxon troops. My memoirs say, that
 this regiment had the charge of the artillery, and add, that the French,
 struck with the fame and reputation of Charles XII., and discontented
 with the Saxon service, laid down their arms as soon as they came in
 sight of the enemy (Feb.), and desired to be taken into the Swedish
 army, in which they continued to the end of the war. This defection was
 as the beginning, or signal of a total overthrow to the Russian army, of
 which no more than three battalions were saved, and almost every man of
 these was wounded; and as no quarter was granted, the remainder was cut
 in pieces.
 
 Norberg, the chaplain, pretends, that the Swedish word at this battle
 was, 'In the name of God,' and that of the Russians, 'Kill all;' but it
 was the Swedes who killed all in God's name. The czar himself declares,
 in one of his manifestoes,[72] that a number of Russians, Cossacks, and
 Calmucks, that had been made prisoners, were murdered in cool blood
 three days after that battle. The irregular troops on both sides had
 accustomed their generals to these cruelties, than which greater were
 never committed in the most barbarous times. I had the honour to hear
 king Stanislaus himself say, that in one of those engagements which were
 so frequent in Poland, a Russian officer who had formerly been one of
 his friends, came to put himself under his protection, after the defeat
 of the corps he commanded; and that the Swedish general Steinbock shot
 him dead with a pistol, while he held him in his arms.
 
 This was the fourth battle the Russians had lost against the Swedes,
 without reckoning the other victories of Charles XII. in Poland. The
 czar's troops that were in Grodno, ran the risk of suffering a still
 greater disgrace, by being surrounded on all sides; but he fortunately
 found means to get them together, and even to strengthen them with new
 reinforcements. But necessitated at once to provide for the safety of
 this army, and the security of his conquests in Ingria, he ordered
 prince Menzikoff to march with the army under his command eastward, and
 from thence southward as far as Kiow.
 
 While his men were upon their march, he repairs to Shlusselburg, from
 thence to Narva, and to his colony of Petersburg (August), and puts
 those places in a posture of defence. From the Baltic he flies to the
 banks of the Boristhenes, to enter into Poland by the way of Kiow,
 making it still his chief care to render those victories of Charles,
 which he had not been able to prevent, of as little advantage to the
 victor as possible. At this very time he meditated a new conquest;
 namely, that of Wibourg, the capital of Carelia, situated on the gulf of
 Finland. He went in person to lay siege to this place, but for this time
 it withstood the power of his arms; succours arrived in season, and he
 was obliged to raise the siege. (Oct.) His rival, Charles XII. did not,
 in fact, make any conquests, though he gained so many battles: he was
 at that time in pursuit of king Augustus in Saxony, being always more
 intent upon humbling that prince, and crushing him beneath the weight of
 his superior power and reputation, than upon recovering Ingria, that had
 been wrested from him by a vanquished enemy.
 
 He spread terror through all Upper Poland, Silesia, and Saxony. King
 Augustus's whole family, his mother, his wife, his son, and the
 principal nobility of the country, were retired into the heart of the
 empire. Augustus now sued for peace, choosing rather to trust himself to
 the mercy of his conqueror, than in the arms of his protector. He
 entered into a treaty which deprived him of the crown of Poland, and
 covered him at the same time with ignominy. This was a private treaty,
 and was to be concealed from the czar's generals, with whom he had taken
 refuge in Poland, while Charles XII. was giving laws in Leipsic, and
 acting as absolute master throughout his electorate.
 
 His plenipotentiaries had already signed the fatal treaty (Sept. 14.),
 by which he not only divested himself of the crown of Poland, but
 promised never more to assume the title of king; at the same time he
 recognized Stanislaus, renounced his alliance with the czar his
 benefactor; and, to complete his humiliation, engaged to deliver up to
 Charles XII. John Reinold Patkul, the czar's ambassador and general in
 the Russian service, who was then actually fighting in his cause. He had
 some time before ordered Patkul to be arrested upon false suspicions,
 contrary to the law of nations; and now, in direct violation of these
 laws, he delivered him up to the enemy. It had been better for him to
 have died sword-in-hand, than to have concluded such a treaty; a treaty,
 which not only robbed him of his crown, and of his reputation, but
 likewise endangered his liberty, because he was at that time in the
 power of prince Menzikoff in Posnania, and the few Saxons that he had
 with him, were paid by the Russians.
 
 Prince Menzikoff was opposed in that district by a Swedish army,
 reinforced with a strong party of Poles, in the interest of the new king
 Stanislaus, under the command of general Meyerfeld; and not knowing that
 Augustus had engaged in a treaty with the enemies of Russia, had
 proposed to attack them, and Augustus did not dare to refuse. The battle
 was fought near Calish (Oct. 19.), in the palatinate belonging to
 Stanislaus; this was the first pitched battle the Russians had gained
 against the Swedes. Prince Menzikoff had all the glory of the action,
 four thousand of the enemy were left dead on the field, and two thousand
 five hundred and ninety-eight were made prisoners.
 
 It is difficult to comprehend how Augustus could be prevailed on, after
 this battle, to ratify a treaty which deprived him of all the fruits of
 his victory. But Charles was still triumphant in Saxony, where his
 very name spread terror. The success of the Russians appeared so
 inconsiderable, and the Polish party against Augustus was so strong,
 and, in fine, that monarch was so ill-advised, that he signed the fatal
 convention. Neither did he stop here: he wrote to his envoy Finkstein a
 letter, that was, if possible, more shameful than the treaty itself; for
 therein he asked pardon for having obtained a victory, 'protesting, that
 the battle had been fought against his will; that the Russians and the
 Poles, his adherents, had obliged him to it; that he had, with a view of
 preventing it, actually made some movements to abandon Menzikoff; that
 Meyerfeld might have beaten him, had he made the most of that
 opportunity; that he was ready to restore all the Swedish prisoners, or
 to break with the Russians; and that, in fine, he would give the king of
 Sweden all possible satisfaction,' for having dared to beat his troops.
 
 This whole affair, unparalleled and inconceivable as it is, is,
 nevertheless, strictly true. When we reflect, that, with all this
 weakness, Augustus was one of the bravest princes in Europe, we may
 plainly perceive, that the loss or preservation, the rise or decline of
 empires, are entirely owing to fortitude of mind.
 
 Two other circumstances concurred to complete the disgrace of the king
 of Poland elector of Saxony, and heighten the abuse which Charles XII.
 made of his good fortune; the first was his obliging Augustus to write a
 letter of congratulation to the new king Stanislaus on his election: the
 second was terrible, he even compelled Augustus to deliver up Patkul,
 the czar's ambassador and general.[73] It is sufficiently known to all
 Europe, that this minister was afterwards broke alive upon the wheel at
 Casimir, in the month of September, 1707. Norberg, the chaplain,
 confesses that the orders for his execution were all written in
 Charles's own hand.
 
 There is not a civilian in all Europe, nay even the vilest slave, but
 must feel the whole horror of this barbarous injustice. The first crime
 of this unfortunate man was, the having made an humble representation of
 the rights and privileges of his country, at the head of six Livonian
 gentlemen, who were sent as deputies from the whole province: having
 been condemned to die for fulfilling the first of duties, that of
 serving his country agreeable to her laws. This iniquitous sentence put
 him in full possession of a right, which all mankind derive from nature,
 that of choosing his country. Being afterwards made ambassador to one of
 the greatest monarchs in the universe, his person thereby became sacred.
 On this occasion the law of force violated that of nature and nations.
 In former ages cruelties of this kind were hidden in the blaze of
 success, but now they sully the glory of a conqueror.

 [Sidenote: 1707.]
 
 Charles XII. enjoyed the fruits of his good fortune in Altranstadt near
 Leipsic, whither the Protestant princes of the German empire repaired in
 droves to pay homage to him, and implore his protection. He received
 ambassadors from almost all the potentates in Europe. The emperor Joseph
 implicitly followed his directions. Peter then perceiving that king
 Augustus had renounced his protection and his own crown, and that a part
 of the Polish nation had acknowledged Stanislaus, listened to the
 proposals made him by Yolkova, of choosing a third king.
 
 A diet was held at Lublin, in which several of the palatines were
 proposed; and among others, Prince Ragotski was put upon the list; that
 prince, who was so long kept in prison, when young, by the emperor
 Leopold, and who afterwards when he procured his liberty, was his
 competitor for the throne of Hungary.
 
 This negotiation was pushed very far, and Poland was on the point of
 having three kings at one time. Prince Ragotski not succeeding, Peter
 thought to bestow the crown on Siniauski, grand general of the republic;
 a person of great power and interest, and head of a third party, that
 would neither acknowledge the dethroned king, nor the person elected by
 the opposed party.
 
 In the midst of these troubles, there was a talk of peace, as is
 customary on the like occasions. Besseval the French envoy in Saxony
 interposed, in order to bring about a reconciliation between the czar
 and the king of Sweden. It was thought at that time by the court of
 France, that Charles, having no longer either the Russians or Poles to
 fight against, might turn his arms against the emperor Joseph, with whom
 he was not on very good terms, and on whom he had imposed several laws
 during his stay in Saxony. But Charles made answer, that he would treat
 with the czar in Moscow. It was on this occasion that Peter said, 'My
 brother Charles wants to act the Alexander, but he shall not find a
 Darius in me.'
 
 The Russians however were still in Poland, and were in the city of
 Warsaw, while the king whom Charles XII. had set over the Poles was
 hardly acknowledged by that nation. In the mean time, Charles was
 enriching his army with the spoils of Saxony.
 
 Aug. 22.] At length he began his march from Altranstadt, at the head of
 an army of forty-five thousand men; a force which it seemed impossible
 for the czar to withstand, seeing he had been entirely defeated by eight
 thousand only at Narva.
 
 Aug. 27.] It was in passing by the walls of Dresden, that Charles made
 that very extraordinary visit to king Augustus, which, as Norberg says,
 'will strike posterity with admiration.' It was running an unaccountable
 risk, to put himself in the power of a prince whom he had deprived of
 his kingdom. From thence he continued his march through Silesia, and
 re-entered Poland.
 
 This country has been entirely ravaged by war, ruined by factions, and
 was a prey to every kind of calamity. Charles continued advancing with
 his army through the province of Muscovia, and chose the most difficult
 ways he could take. The inhabitants, who had taken shelter in the
 morasses, resolved to make him at least pay for his passage. Six
 thousand peasants dispatched an old man of their body to speak to him:
 this man who was of a very extraordinary figure, clad in white, and
 armed with two carabines, made a speech to Charles; but as the standers
 by did not well understand what he said, they, without any further
 ceremony, dispatched him in his harangue, and before their king's face.
 The peasants, in a rage, immediately withdrew, and took up arms. All who
 could be found were seized, and obliged to hang one another; the last
 was compelled to put the rope about his neck himself, and to be his own
 executioner. All their houses were burnt to the ground. This fact is
 attested by Norberg, who was an eye-witness, and therefore cannot be
 contradicted, as it cannot be related without inspiring horror.
 
 1708, Feb. 6.] Charles being arrived within a few leagues of Grodno in
 Lithuania, is informed of the czar's being there in person with a body
 of troops; upon which, without staying to deliberate, he takes only
 eight hundred of his guards, and sets out for Grodno. A German officer,
 named Mulfels, who commanded a body of troops, posted at one of the
 gates of the town, making no doubt, when he saw Charles, but that he was
 followed by his whole army, instead of disputing the passage with him,
 leaves it open, and takes to flight. The alarm is now spread through the
 whole town; every one imagines the whole Swedish army already entered;
 the few Russians who made any resistance, are cut in pieces by the
 Swedish guards; and all the officers assure the czar, that the
 victorious army had made itself master of the place. Hereupon Peter
 retreats behind the ramparts, and Charles plants a guard of thirty men
 at the very gate through which the czar had just before entered.
 
 In this confusion some of the Jesuits, whose college had been taken to
 accommodate the king of Sweden, as being the handsomest structure in the
 place, went by night to the czar, and for this time told the whole
 truth. Upon this, Peter immediately returns into the town, and forces
 the Swedish guards. An engagement ensues in the streets and public
 places; but, at length, the whole Swedish army appearing in sight, the
 czar is obliged to yield to superior numbers, and leaves the town in the
 hands of the victor, who made all Poland tremble.
 
 Charles had augmented his forces in Livonia and Finland, and Peter had
 every thing to fear, not only for his conquests on this side, together
 with those in Lithuania, but also for his ancient territories, and even
 for the city of Moscow itself. He was obliged then to provide at once
 for the safety of all these different places, at such a distance from
 each other. Charles could not make any rapid conquest to the eastward of
 Lithuania in the depth of winter, and in a marshy country, subject to
 epidemical disorders, which had been spread by poverty and famine, from
 Warsaw, as far as Minski. Peter posted his troops so as to command the
 passes of the rivers, (April 8.) guarded all the important posts, and
 did every thing in his power to impede the marches of his enemy, and
 afterwards hastened to put things in a proper situation at Petersburg.
 
 Though Charles was lording it in Poland, he took nothing from the czar;
 but Peter, by the use he made of his new fleet, by landing his troops in
 Finland, by the taking and dismantling the town of Borgau, (May 22.) and
 by seizing a great booty, was procuring many real and great advantages
 to himself, and distressing his enemy.
 
 Charles, after being detained a long time in Lithuania, by continual
 rains, at length reached the little river of Berezine, some few leagues
 from the Boristhenes. Nothing could withstand his activity: he threw a
 bridge over the river in sight of the Russians; beat a detachment that
 guarded the passage, and got to Holozin on the river Bibitsch, where the
 czar had posted a considerable body of troops to check the impetuous
 progress of his rival. The little river of Bibitsch is only a small
 brook in dry weather; but at this time it was swelled by the rains to a
 deep and rapid stream. On the other side was a morass, behind which the
 Russians had thrown up an intrenchment for above a quarter of a league,
 defended by a large and deep ditch, and covered by a parapet, lined with
 artillery. Nine regiments of horse, and eleven of foot, were
 advantageously posted in these lines, so that the passage of the river
 seemed impracticable.
 
 The Swedes, according to the custom of war, got ready their pontoons,
 and erected batteries to favour their passage; but Charles, whose
 impatience to engage would not let him brook the least delay, did not
 wait till the pontoons were ready. Marshal Schwerin, who served a long
 time under him, has assured me several times, that one day that they
 were to come to action, observing his generals to be very busy in
 concerting the necessary dispositions, said tartly to them, 'When will
 you have done with this trifling?' and immediately advanced in person at
 the head of his guards, which he did particularly on this memorable day.
 
 He flung himself into the river, followed by his regiment of guards.
 Their numbers broke the impetuosity of the current, but the water was as
 high as their shoulders, and they could make no use of their firelocks.
 Had the artillery of the parapet been but tolerably well served, or had
 the infantry but levelled their pieces in a proper manner, not a single
 Swede would have escaped.
 
 July 25.] The king, after wading the river, passed the morass on foot.
 As soon as the army had surmounted these obstacles within sight of the
 Russians, they drew up in order of battle, and attacked the enemies
 intrenchments seven different times, and it was not till the seventh
 attack that the Russians gave way. By the accounts of their own
 historians, the Swedes took but twelve field-pieces, and twenty-four
 mortars.
 
 It was therefore evident, that the czar had at length succeeded in
 disciplining his troops, and this victory of Holozin, while it covered
 Charles XII. with glory, might have made him sensible of the many
 dangers he must have to encounter in adventuring into such distant
 countries, where his army could march only in small bodies, through
 woods, morasses, and where he would be obliged to fight out every step
 of his way; but the Swedes, being accustomed to carry all before them,
 dreaded neither danger nor fatigue.[74]

     Charles XII. crosses the Boristhenes, penetrates into the Ukraine,
     but concerts his measures badly.--One of his armies is defeated by
     Peter the Great: he loses his supply of provisions and ammunition:
     advances forward through a desert country: his adventures in the
     Ukraine.
 
 
 [Sidenote: 1708.]
 
 At last Charles arrives on the borders of the Boristhenes, at a small
 town called Mohilow. This was the important spot where it was to be
 determined, whether he should direct his march eastward, towards Moscow;
 or southwards, towards the Ukraine. His own army, his friends, his
 enemies, all expected that he would direct his course immediately for
 the capital of Russia. Which ever way he took, Peter was following him
 from Smolensko with a strong army; no one expected that he would turn
 towards the Ukraine. He was induced to take this strange resolution by
 Mazeppa, hetman of the Cossacks, who, being an old man of seventy and
 without children, ought to have thought only of ending his days in
 peace: gratitude should have bound him to the czar, to whom he was
 indebted for his present dignity; but whether he had any real cause of
 complaint against that prince, or that he was dazzled with the lustre of
 Charles's exploits, or whether, in time, he thought to make himself
 independent, he betrayed his benefactor, and privately espoused the
 interests of the king of Sweden, flattering himself with the hopes of
 engaging his whole nation in a rebellion with himself.
 
 Charles made not the least doubt of subduing the Russian empire, as soon
 as his troops should be joined by so warlike a people as the Cossacks.
 Mazeppa was to furnish him with what provisions, ammunition, and
 artillery, he should want; besides these powerful succours, he was to be
 joined by an army of sixteen or seventeen thousand men, out of Livonia,
 under the command of general Levenhaupt, who was to bring with him a
 prodigious quantity of warlike stores and provisions. Charles was not at
 the trouble of reflecting, whether the czar was within reach of
 attacking the army, and depriving him of these necessary supplies. He
 never informed himself whether Mazeppa was in a condition to observe his
 promises; if that Cossack had credit enough to change the disposition of
 a whole nation, who are generally guided only by their own opinion; or
 whether his army was provided with sufficient resources in case of an
 accident; but imagined, if Mazeppa should prove deficient in abilities
 or fidelity, he could trust in his own valour and good fortune. The
 Swedish army then advanced beyond the Boristhenes towards the Desna; it
 was between these two rivers, that he expected to meet with Mazeppa. His
 march was attended with many difficulties and dangers, on account of the
 badness of the road, and the many parties of Russians that were hovering
 about these regions.
 
 Sept. 11.] Menzikoff, at the head of some horse and foot, attacked the
 king's advanced guard, threw them into disorder, and killed a number of
 his men. He lost a great number of his own, indeed, but that did not
 discourage him. Charles immediately hastened to the field of battle, and
 with some difficulty repulsed the Russians, at the hazard of his own
 life, by engaging a party of dragoons, by whom he was surrounded. All
 this while Mazeppa did not appear, and provisions began to grow scarce.
 The Swedish soldiers, seeing their king share in all their dangers,
 fatigues, and wants, were not dispirited; but though they admired his
 courage, they could not refrain from murmuring at his conduct.
 
 The orders which the king had sent to Levenhaupt to march forward with
 all haste, to join him with the necessary supplies, were not delivered
 by twelve days so soon as they should have been. This was a long delay
 as circumstances then stood. However, Levenhaupt at length began his
 march; Peter suffered him to pass the Boristhenes, but as soon as his
 army was got between that river and the lesser ones, which empty
 themselves into it, he crossed over after him, and attacked him with his
 united forces, which had followed in different corps at equal distances
 from one another. This battle was fought between the Boristhenes and the
 Sossa.[75]
 
 Prince Menzikoff was upon his return with the same body of horse, with
 which he had lately engaged Charles XII. General Baur followed him, and
 the czar himself headed the flower of his army. The Swedes imagined they
 had to deal with an army of forty thousand men, and the same was
 believed for a long time on the faith of their relation; but my late
 memoirs inform me, that Peter had only twenty thousand men in this day's
 engagement, a number not much superior to that of the enemy: but his
 vigour, his patience, his unwearied perseverance, together with that of
 his troops, animated by his presence, decided the fate, not of that day
 only, but of three successive days, during which the fight was renewed
 at different times.
 
 They made their first attack upon the rear of the Swedish army, near the
 village of Lesnau, from whence this battle borrows its name. This first
 shock was bloody, without proving decisive. Levenhaupt retreated into a
 wood, and thereby saved his baggage. (Oct. 7.) The next morning, when
 the Swedes were to be driven from this wood, the fight was still more
 bloody, and more to the advantage of the Russians. Here it was that the
 czar, seeing his troops in disorder, cried out to fire upon the
 runaways, and even upon himself, if they saw him turn back. The Swedes
 were repulsed, but not thrown into confusion.
 
 At length a reinforcement of four thousand dragoons arriving, he fell
 upon the Swedes a third time; who retreated to a small town called
 Prospock, where they were again attacked; they then marched towards the
 Desna, the Russians still pursuing them: yet they were never broken,
 but lost upwards of eight thousand men, seventeen pieces of cannon, and
 forty-four colours: the czar took fifty-six officers and near nine
 hundred private men prisoners; and the great convoy of provisions and
 ammunition that were going to Charles's army, fell into the hands of the
 conqueror.
 
 This was the first time that the czar in person gained a pitched battle,
 against an enemy who had distinguished himself by so many victories over
 his troops: he was employed in a general thanksgiving for his success,
 when he received advice that general Apraxin had lately gained an
 advantage over the enemy in Ingria, (Sept. 17,) some leagues from Narva,
 an advantage less considerable indeed than that of Lesnau; but this
 concurrence of fortunate events greatly raised the hopes and courage of
 his troops.
 
 Charles XII. heard of these unfortunate tidings just as he was ready to
 pass the Desna, in the Ukraine. Mazeppa at length joined him; but
 instead of twenty thousand men, and an immense quantity of provisions,
 which he was to have brought with him, he came with only two regiments,
 and appeared rather like a fugitive applying for assistance, than a
 prince, who was bringing powerful succours to his ally. This Cossack had
 indeed begun his march with near fifteen or sixteen thousand of his
 people, whom he had told, at their first setting out, that they were
 going against the king of Sweden; that they would have the glory of
 stopping that hero on his march, and that he would hold himself
 eternally obliged to them for so great a service.
 
 But when they came within a few leagues of the Desna, he made them
 acquainted with his real design. These brave people received his
 declaration with disdain: they refused to betray a monarch, against
 whom they had no cause of complaint, for the sake of a Swede, who had
 invaded their country with an armed force, and who, after leaving it,
 would be no longer able to defend them, but must abandon them to the
 mercy of the incensed Russians, and of the Poles, once their masters,
 and always their enemies: they accordingly returned home, and gave
 advice to the czar of the defection of their chief: Mazeppa found
 himself left with only two regiments, the officers of which were in his
 own pay.
 
 He was still master of some strong posts in the Ukraine, and in
 particular of Bathurin, the place of his residence, looked upon as the
 capital of the country of the Cossacks: it is situated near some forests
 on the Desna, at a great distance from the place where Peter had
 defeated general Levenhaupt. There were always some Russian regiments
 quartered in these districts. Prince Menzikoff was detached from the
 czar's army, and got thither by round-about marches. Charles could not
 secure all the passes; he did not even know them all, and had neglected
 to make himself master of the important post of Starowdoub, which leads
 directly to the Bathurin, across seven or eight leagues of forest,
 through which the Desna directs its course. His enemy had always the
 advantage of him, by being better acquainted with the country.
 
 Menzikoff and prince Galitzin, who had accompanied him, easily made
 their passage good, and presented themselves before the town of
 Bathurin, (Nov. 14,) which surrendered almost without resistance, was
 plundered, and reduced to ashes. The Russians made themselves masters of
 a large magazine destined for the use of the king of Sweden, and of all
 Mazeppa's treasures. The Cossacks chose another hetman, named
 Skoropasky, who was approved by the czar, who being willing to impress a
 due sense of the enormous crime of treason on the minds of the people,
 by a striking example of justice, the archbishop of Kiow, and two other
 prelates, were ordered to excommunicate Mazeppa publicly, (Nov. 22,)
 after which he was hanged in effigy, and some of his accomplices were
 broken upon the wheel.
 
 In the meanwhile, Charles XII. still at the head of about twenty-five or
 twenty-seven thousand Swedes, who were reinforced by the remains of
 Levenhaupt's army, and the addition of between two or three thousand
 men, whom Mazeppa had brought with him, and still infatuated with the
 same notion of making all the Ukraine declare for him, passed the Desna
 at some distance from Bathurin, and near the Boristhenes, in spite of
 the czar's troops which surrounded him on all sides; part of whom
 followed close in the rear, while another part lined the opposite side
 of the river to oppose his passage.
 
 He continued his march through a desert country, where he met with
 nothing but burned or ruined villages. The cold began to set in at the
 beginning of December so extremely sharp, that in one of his marches
 near two thousand of his men perished before his eyes: the czar's troops
 did not suffer near so much, being better supplied; whereas the king of
 Sweden's army, being almost naked, was necessarily more exposed to the
 inclemency of the weather.
 
 In this deplorable situation, count Piper, chancellor of Sweden, who
 never gave his master other than good advice, conjured him to halt, and
 pass at least the severest part of the winter in a small town of the
 Ukraine, called Romna, where he might intrench himself, and get some
 provisions by the help of Mazeppa; but Charles replied, that--He was not
 a person to shut himself up in a town. Piper then intreated him to
 re-pass the Desna and the Boristhenes, to return back into Poland, to
 put his troops into winter quarters, of which they stood so much in
 need, to make use of the Polish cavalry, which was absolutely necessary;
 to support the king he had nominated, and to keep in awe the partisans
 of Augustus, who began already to bestir themselves. Charles answered
 him again--That this would be flying before the czar, that the season
 would grow milder, and that he must reduce the Ukraine, and march on to
 Moscow.[76]
 
 January, 1709.] Both armies remained some weeks inactive, on account of
 the intenseness of the cold, in the month of January, 1709; but as soon
 as the men were able to make use of their arms, Charles attacked all the
 small posts that he found in his way; he was obliged to send parties on
 every side in search of provisions; that is to say, to scour the country
 twenty leagues round, and rob all the peasants of their necessary
 subsistence. Peter, without hurrying himself, kept a strict eye upon all
 his motions, and suffered the Swedish army to dwindle away by degrees.
 
 It is impossible for the reader to follow the Swedes in their march
 through these countries: several of the rivers which they crossed are
 not to be found in the maps: we must not suppose, that geographers are
 as well acquainted with these countries, as we are with Italy, France,
 and Germany: geography is, of all the arts, that which still stands the
 most need of improvement, and ambition has hitherto been at more pains
 to desolate the face of the globe, than to give a description of it.
 
 We must content ourselves then with knowing, that Charles traversed the
 whole Ukraine in the month of February, burning the villages wherever he
 came, or meeting with others that had been laid in ashes by the
 Russians. He advancing south-east, came to those sandy deserts, bordered
 by mountains that separate the Nogay Tartars from the Don Cossacks. To
 the eastward of those mountains are the altars of Alexander. Charles was
 now on the other side of the Ukraine, in the road that the Tartars take
 to Russia; and when he was got there, he was obliged to return back
 again to procure subsistence: the inhabitants, having retired with all
 their cattle into their dens and lurking-places, would sometimes defend
 their subsistence against the soldiers, who came to deprive them of it.
 Such of these poor wretches, who could be found, were put to death,
 agreeably to what are falsely called, the rules of war. I cannot here
 forbear transcribing a few lines from Norberg.[77] 'As an instance,'
 says he, 'of the king's regard to justice, I shall insert a note, which
 he wrote with his own hand to colonel Heilmen.
 
     'Colonel,
 
     'I am very well pleased that you have taken those peasants, who
     carried off a Swedish soldier; as soon as they are convicted of the
     crime, let them be punished with death, according to the exigency of
     the case.
 
                    'Charles; and lower down, Budis.'
 
 Such are the sentiments of justice and humanity shewn by a king's
 confessor; but, had the peasants of the Ukraine had it in their power
 to hang up some of those regimented peasants of East Gothland, who
 thought themselves entitled to come so far to plunder them, their wives,
 and families, of their subsistence, would not the confessors and
 chaplains of these Ukrainers have had equal reason to applaud their
 justice?
 
 Mazeppa had for a considerable time, been in treaty with the
 Zaporavians, who dwell about the two shores of the Boristhenes, and of
 whom part inhabit the islands on that river. It is this division that
 forms the nation, of whom mention has already been made in the first
 chapter of this history, and who have neither wives nor families, and
 subsist entirely by rapine. During the winter they heap up provisions in
 their islands, which they afterwards go and sell in the summer, in the
 little town of Pultowa; the rest dwell in small hamlets, to the right
 and left of this river. All together choose a particular hetman, and
 this hetman is subordinate to him of the Ukraine. The person, at that
 time at the head of the Zaporavians, came to meet Mazeppa; and these two
 barbarians had an interview, at which each of them had a horse's tail,
 and a club borne before him, as ensigns of honour.
 
 To shew what this hetman of the Zaporavians and his people were, I think
 it not unworthy of history, to relate the manner in which this treaty
 was concluded. Mazeppa gave a great feast to the hetman of the
 Zaporavians, and his principal officers, who were all served in plate.
 As soon as these chiefs had made themselves drunk with brandy, they took
 an oath (without stirring from table) upon the Evangelists, to supply
 Charles with men and provisions; after which they carried off all the
 plate and other table-furniture. Mazeppa's steward ran after them, and
 remonstrated, that such behaviour ill-suited with the doctrine of the
 Gospels, on which they had so lately sworn. Some of Mazeppa's domestics
 were for taking the plate away from them by force; but the Zaporavians
 went in a body to complain to Mazeppa, of the unparalleled affront
 offered to such brave fellows, and demanded to have the steward
 delivered up to them, that they might punish him according to law. This
 was accordingly complied with, and the Zaporavians, according to law,
 tossed this poor man from one to another like a ball, and afterwards
 plunged a knife to his heart.
 
 Such were the new allies that Charles XII. was obliged to receive; part
 of whom he formed into a regiment of two thousand men; the remainder
 marched in separate bodies against the Cossacks and Calmucks of the
 czar's party, that were stationed about that district.
 
 The little town of Pultowa, with which those Zaporavians carry on a
 trade, was filled with provisions, and might have served Charles for a
 place of arms. It is situated on the river Worsklaw, near a chain of
 mountains, which command it on the north side. To the eastward is a vast
 desert. The western part is the most fruitful, and the best peopled. The
 Worsklaw empties itself into the Boristhenes, about fifteen leagues
 lower down; from Pultowa, one may go northward, through the defiles,
 which communicate with the road to Moscow, a passage used by the
 Tartars. It is very difficult of access, and the precautions taken by
 the czar had rendered it almost impervious; but nothing appeared
 impossible to Charles, and he depended upon marching to Moscow, as soon
 as he had made himself master of Pultowa: with this view he laid siege
 to that town in the beginning of May.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XVIII.
 
     Battle of Pultowa.
 
 
 Here it was that Peter expected him; he had disposed the several
 divisions of his army at convenient distances for joining each other,
 and marching all together against the besiegers: he had visited the
 countries which surround the Ukraine; namely the duchy of Severia,
 watered by the Desna, already made famous by his victory: the country of
 Bolcho, in which the Occa has its source; the deserts and mountains
 leading to the Palus Maeotis; and lately he had been in the neighbourhood
 of Azoph, where he caused that harbour to be cleansed, new ships to be
 built, and the citadel of Taganroc to be repaired. Thus did he employ
 the time that passed between the battles of Lesnau and Pultowa, in
 preparing for the defence of his dominions. As soon as he heard the
 Swedes had laid siege to the town, he mustered all his forces; the
 horse, dragoons, infantry, Cossacks, and Calmucks, advanced from
 different quarters. His army was well provided with necessaries of every
 kind; large cannon, field pieces, ammunition of all sorts, provisions,
 and even medicines for the sick: this was another degree of superiority
 which he had acquired over his rival.
 
 On the 15th day of June, 1709, he appeared before Pultowa, with an army
 of about sixty thousand effective men; the river Worsklaw was between
 him and Charles. The besiegers were encamped on the north-west side of
 that river, the Russians on the south-east.
 
 Peter ascends the river above the town, fixes his barges, marches over
 with his army, and draws a long line of intrenchments, (July 3.) which
 were begun and completed in one night, in the face of the enemy. Charles
 might then judge, whether the person, whom he had so much despised, and
 whom he thought of dethroning at Moscow, understood the art of war. This
 disposition being made, Peter posted his cavalry between two woods, and
 covered it with several redoubts, lined with artillery. Having thus
 taken all the necessary measures, (July 6.) he went to reconnoitre the
 enemy's camp, in order to form the attack.
 
 This battle was to decide the fate of Russia, Poland, and Sweden, and of
 two monarchs, on whom the eyes of all Europe were fixed. The greatest
 part of those nations, who were attentive to these important concerns,
 were equally ignorant of the place where these two princes were, and of
 their situation: but knowing that Charles XII. had set out from Saxony,
 at the head of a victorious army, and that he was driving his enemy
 every where before him, they no longer doubted that he would at length
 entirely crush him; and that, as he had already given laws to Denmark,
 Poland, and Germany, he would now dictate conditions of peace in the
 Kremlin of Moscow, and make a new czar, after having already made a new
 king of Poland. I have seen letters from several public ministers to
 their respective courts, confirming this general opinion.
 
 The risk was far from being equal between these two great rivals. If
 Charles lost a life, which he had so often and wantonly exposed, there
 would after all have been but one hero less in the world. The provinces
 of the Ukraine, the frontiers of Lithuania, and of Russia, would then
 rest from their calamities, and a stop would be put to the general
 devastation which had so long been their scourge. Poland would,
 together with her tranquillity, recover her lawful prince, who had been
 lately reconciled to the czar, his benefactor; and Sweden, though
 exhausted of men and money, might find motives of consolation under her
 heavy losses.
 
 But, if the czar perished, those immense labours, which had been of such
 utility to mankind, would be buried with him, and the most extensive
 empire in the world would again relapse into the chaos from whence it
 had been so lately taken.
 
 There had already been some skirmishes between the detached parties of
 the Swedes and Russians, under the walls of the town. In one of these
 rencounters, (June 27.) Charles had been wounded by a musket-ball, which
 had shattered the bones of his foot: he underwent several painful
 operations, which he bore with his usual fortitude, and had been
 confined to his bed for several days. In this condition he was informed,
 that Peter intended to give him battle; his notions of honour would not
 suffer him to wait to be attacked in his intrenchments. Accordingly he
 gave orders for quitting them, and was carried himself in a litter.
 Peter the Great acknowledges, that the Swedes attacked the redoubts,
 lined with artillery, that covered his cavalry, with such obstinate
 valour, that, notwithstanding the strongest resistance, supported by a
 continual fire, the enemy made themselves masters of two redoubts. Some
 writers say, that when the Swedish infantry found themselves in
 possession of the two redoubts, they thought the day their own, and
 began to cry out--Victory. The chaplain, Norberg, who was at some great
 distance from the field of battle, amongst the baggage (which was indeed
 his proper place) pretends, that this was a calumny; but, whether the
 Swedes cried victory or not, it is certain they were not victorious. The
 fire from the other redoubts was kept up without ceasing, and the
 resistance made by the Russians, in every part, was as firm as the
 attack of their enemies was vigorous. They did not make one irregular
 movement; the czar drew up his army without the intrenchments in
 excellent order, and with surprising dispatch.
 
 The battle now became general. Peter acted as major-general; Baur
 commanded the right wing, Menzikoff the left, and Sheremeto the centre.
 The action lasted about two hours: Charles, with a pistol in his hand,
 went from rank to rank, carried in a litter, on the shoulders of his
 drabans; one of which was killed by a cannon-ball, and at the same time
 the litter was shattered in pieces. He then ordered his men to carry him
 upon their pikes; for it would have been difficult, in so smart an
 action, let Norberg say as he pleases, to find a fresh litter ready
 made. Peter received several shots through his clothes and his hat; both
 princes were continually in the midst of the fire, during the whole
 action. At length, after two hours desperate engagement, the Swedes were
 taken on all sides, and fell into confusion; so that Charles was obliged
 to fly before him, whom he had hitherto held in so much contempt. This
 very hero, who could not mount his saddle during the battle, now fled
 for his life on horseback; necessity lent him strength in his retreat:
 he suffered the most excruciating pain, which was increased by the
 mortifying reflection of being vanquished without resource. The Russians
 reckoned nine thousand two hundred and twenty-four Swedes left dead on
 the field of battle, and between two and three thousand made prisoners
 in the action, the chief of which was cavalry.
 
 Charles XII. fled with the greatest precipitation, attended by the
 remains of his brave army, a few field-pieces, and a very small quantity
 of provisions and ammunition. He directed his march southward, towards
 the Boristhenes, between the two rivers Workslaw and Psol, or Sol, in
 the country of the Zaporavians. Beyond the Boristhenes, are vast
 deserts, which lead to the frontiers of Turkey. Norberg affirms, that
 the victors durst not pursue Charles; and yet he acknowledges, that
 prince Menzikoff appeared on the neighbouring heights, (July 12.) with
 ten thousand horse, and a considerable train of artillery, while the
 king was passing the Boristhenes.
 
 Fourteen thousand Swedes surrendered themselves prisoners of war to
 these ten thousand Russians; and Levenhaupt, who commanded them, signed
 the fatal capitulation, by which he gave up those Zaporavians who had
 engaged in the service of his master, and were then in the fugitive
 army. The chief persons taken prisoners in the battle, and by the
 capitulation, were count Piper, the first minister, with two secretaries
 of state, and two of the cabinet; field-marshal Renschild, the generals
 Levenhaupt, Slipenbak, Rozen, Stakelber, Creutz, and Hamilton, with
 three general aides-de-camp, the auditor-general of the army,
 fifty-nine staff-officers, five colonels, among whom was the prince of
 Wirtemberg; sixteen thousand nine hundred and forty-two private men and
 non-commissioned officers: in short, reckoning the king's own domestics,
 and others, the conqueror had no less than eighteen thousand seven
 hundred and forty-six prisoners in his power: to whom, if we add nine
 thousand two hundred and twenty-four slain in battle, and nearly two
 thousand that passed the Boristhenes with Charles, it appears, plainly,
 that he had, on that memorable day, no less than twenty-seven thousand
 effective men under his command.[78]
 
 Charles had begun his march from Saxony with forty-five thousand men,
 Levenhaupt had brought upwards of sixteen thousand out of Livonia, and
 yet scarce a handful of men was left of all this powerful army; of a
 numerous train of artillery, part lost in his marches, and part buried
 in the morasses; he had now remaining only eighteen brass cannon, two
 howitzers, and twelve mortars; and, with inconsiderable force, he had
 undertaken the siege of Pultowa, and had attacked an army provided with
 a formidable artillery. Therefore he is, with justice, accused of having
 shewn more courage than prudence, after his leaving Germany. On the side
 of the Russians, there were no more than fifty-two officers and one
 thousand two hundred and ninety-three private men killed; an undeniable
 proof, that the disposition of the Russian troops was better than those
 of Charles, and that their fire was infinitely superior to that of the
 Swedes.
 
 We find, in the memoirs of a foreign minister to the court of Russia,
 that Peter, being informed of Charles's design to take refuge in Turkey,
 wrote a friendly letter to him, intreating him not to take so desperate
 a resolution, but rather to trust himself in his hands, than in those
 of the natural enemy of all Christian princes. He gave him, at the same
 time, his word of honour, not to detain him prisoner, but to terminate
 all their differences by a reasonable peace. This letter was sent by an
 express as far as the river Bug, which separates the deserts of the
 Ukraine from the grand seignior's dominions. As the messenger did not
 reach that place till Charles had entered Turkey, he brought back the
 letter to his master. The same minister adds further, that he had this
 account from the very person who was charged with the letter.[79] This
 anecdote is not altogether improbable; but I do not meet with it either
 in Peter's journals, or in any of the papers entrusted to my care. What
 is of greater importance, in relation to this battle, was its being the
 only one, of the many that have stained the earth with blood, that,
 instead of producing only destruction, has proved beneficial to mankind,
 by enabling the czar to civilize so considerable a part of the world.
 
 There have been fought more than two hundred pitched battles in Europe,
 since the commencement of this century to the present year. The most
 signal, and the most bloody victories, have produced no other
 consequences than the reduction of a few provinces ceded afterwards by
 treaties, and retaken again by other battles. Armies of a hundred
 thousand men have frequently engaged each other in the field; but the
 greatest efforts have been attended with only slight and momentary
 successes; the most trivial causes have been productive of the greatest
 effects. There is no instance, in modern history, of any war that has
 compensated, by even a better good, for the many evils it has
 occasioned: but, from the battle of Pultowa, the greatest empire under
 the sun has derived its present happiness and prosperity.

     among the Turks.--Augustus, whom he had dethroned, recovers his
     dominions.--Conquests of Peter the Great.
 
 
 [Sidenote: 1709.]
 
 The chief prisoners of rank were now presented to the conqueror, who
 ordered their swords to be returned, and invited them to dinner. It is a
 well known fact, that, on drinking to the officers, he said, 'To the
 health of my masters in the art of war.' However, most of his masters,
 particularly the subaltern officers, and all the private men, were soon
 afterwards sent into Siberia. There was no cartel established here for
 exchange of prisoners between the Russians and Swedes; the czar, indeed,
 had proposed one before the siege of Pultowa, but Charles rejected the
 offer, and his troops were in every thing the victims of his inflexible
 pride.
 
 It was this unseasonable obstinacy that occasioned all the misfortunes
 of this prince in Turkey, and a series of adventures, more becoming a
 hero of romance than a wise or prudent king; for, as soon as he arrived
 at Bender, he was advised to write to the grand-vizier, as is the custom
 among the Turks; but this he thought would be demeaning himself too far.
 The like obstinacy embroiled him with all the ministers of the Porte,
 one after another, in short, he knew not how to accommodate himself
 either to times or circumstances.[80]
 
 The first news of the battle of Pultowa produced a general revolution in
 minds and affairs in Poland, Saxony, Sweden, and Silesia. Charles, while
 all powerful in those parts, had obliged the emperor Joseph to take a
 hundred and five churches from the catholics in favour of the Silesians
 of the confession of Augsburg. The catholics then no sooner received
 news of the defeat of Charles, than they repossessed themselves of all
 the Lutheran temples. The Saxons now thought of nothing but being
 revenged for the extortions of a conqueror, who had robbed them,
 according to their own account, of twenty-three millions of crowns.
 
 The king of Poland, their elector, immediately protested against the
 abdication that had been extorted from him, and being now reconciled to
 the czar (Aug. 3.), he left no stone unturned to reascend the Polish
 throne. Sweden, overwhelmed with consternation, thought her king for a
 long time dead, and in this uncertainty the senate knew not what to
 resolve.
 
 Peter in the mean time determined to make the best use of his victory,
 and therefore dispatched marshal Sheremeto with an army into Livonia, on
 the frontiers of which province that general had so often distinguished
 himself. Prince Menzikoff was sent in haste with a numerous body of
 cavalry to second the few troops left in Poland, to encourage the nobles
 who were in the interest of Augustus to drive out his competitor, who
 was now considered in no better light than a rebel, and to disperse a
 body of Swedes and troops that were still left in that kingdom under the
 command of general Crassau.
 
 The czar soon after sets out in person, marches through the province of
 Kiow, and the palatinates of Chelm and Upper Volhinia, and at length
 arrives at Lublin, where he concerts measures with the general of
 Lithuania. He then reviews the crown troops, who all take the oath of
 allegiance to king Augustus, from thence he proceeds to Warsaw, and at
 Thera enjoyed the most glorious of all triumphs (Sept. 18.), that of
 receiving the thanks of a king, whom he had reinstated in his dominions.
 There it was that he concluded a treaty against Sweden, with the kings
 of Denmark, Poland, and Prussia (Oct. 7.): in which he was resolved to
 recover from Charles all the conquests of Gustavus Adolphus. Peter
 revived the ancient pretensions of the czars to Livonia, Ingria,
 Carelia, and part of Finland; Denmark laid claim to Scania, and the king
 of Prussia to Pomerania.
 
 Thus had Charles XII. by his unsuccessful valour, shook the noble
 edifice that had been erected by the prosperous bravery of his ancestor
 Gustavus Adolphus. The Polish nobility came in on all sides to renew
 their oaths to their king, or to ask pardon for having deserted him; and
 almost the whole kingdom acknowledged Peter for its protector.
 
 To the victorious arms of the czar, to these new treaties, and to this
 sudden revolution, Stanislaus had nothing to oppose but a voluntary
 resignation: he published a writing called Universale, in which he
 declares himself ready to resign the crown, if the republic required
 it.
 
 Peter, having concerted all the necessary measures with the king of
 Poland, and ratified the treaty with Denmark, set out directly to finish
 his negotiation with the king of Prussia. It was not then usual for
 sovereign princes to perform the function of their own ambassadors.
 Peter was the first who introduced this custom, which has been followed
 by very few. The elector of Brandenburg, the first king of Prussia, had
 a conference with the czar at Marienverder, a small town situated in the
 western part of Pomerania, and built by the old Teutonic knights, and
 included in the limits of Prussia, lately erected into a kingdom. This
 country indeed was poor, and of a small extent; but its new king,
 whenever he travelled, displayed the utmost magnificence; with great
 splendour he had received czar Peter at his first passing through his
 dominions, when that prince quitted his empire to go in search of
 instruction among strangers. But he received the conqueror of Charles
 XII. in a still more pompous manner. (Oct. 20.) Peter for this time
 concluded only a defensive treaty with him, which afterwards, however,
 completed the ruin of Sweden.
 
 Not an instant of time was lost. Peter, having proceeded with the
 greatest dispatch in his negotiations, which elsewhere are wont to take
 up so much time, goes and joins his army, then before Riga, the capital
 of Livonia; he began by bombarding the place (Nov. 21.), and fired off
 the three first bombs himself; then changed the siege into a blockade;
 and, when well assured that Riga could not escape him, he repaired to
 his city of Petersburg, to inspect and forward the works carrying on
 there, the new buildings, and finishing of his fleet; and having laid
 the keel of a ship of fifty-four guns, (Dec. 3.) with his own hands, he
 returned to Moscow. Here he amused himself with assisting in the
 preparations for the triumphal entry, which he exhibited in the capital.
 He directed every thing relating to that festival, and was himself the
 principal contriver and architect.
 
 He opened the year 1710 with this solemnity, so necessary to his
 subjects, whom it inspired with notions of grandeur, and was highly
 pleasing to every one who had been fearful of seeing those enter their
 walls as conquerors, over whom they now triumphed. Seven magnificent
 arches were erected, under which passed in triumph, the artillery,
 standards, and colours, taken from the enemy, with their officers,
 generals, and ministers, who had been taken prisoners, all on foot,
 amidst the ringing of bells, the sound of trumpets, the discharge of a
 hundred pieces of cannon, and the acclamations of an innumerable
 concourse of people, whose voices rent the air as soon as the cannon
 ceased firing. The procession was closed by the victorious army, with
 the generals at its head; and Peter, who marched in his rank of
 major-general. At each triumphal arch stood the deputies of the several
 orders of the state; and at the last was a chosen band of young
 gentlemen, the sons of boyards, clad in Roman habits, who presented a
 crown of laurels to their victorious monarch.
 
 This public festival was followed by another ceremony, which proved no
 less satisfactory than the former. In the year 1708 happened an accident
 the more disagreeable to Peter, as his arms were at that time
 unsuccessful. Mattheof, his ambassador to the court of London, having
 had his audience of leave of queen Anne, was arrested for debt, at the
 suit of some English merchants, and carried before a justice of peace to
 give security for the monies he owed there. The merchants insisted that
 the laws of commerce ought to prevail before the privileges of foreign
 ministers; the czar's ambassador, and with him all the public ministers,
 protested against this proceeding, alleging, that their persons ought to
 be always inviolable. The czar wrote to queen Anne, demanding
 satisfaction for the insult offered him in the person of his ambassador.
 
 But the queen had it not in her power to gratify him; because, by the
 laws of England, tradesmen were allowed to prosecute their debtors,
 and there was no law that excepted public ministers from such
 prosecution.[81] The murder of Patkul, the czar's ambassador, who had
 been executed the year before by the order of Charles XII. had
 encouraged the English to shew so little regard to a character which had
 been so cruelly profaned. The other public ministers who were then at
 the court of London, were obliged to be bound for the czar's ambassador;
 and at length all the queen could do in his favour, was to prevail on
 her parliament to pass an act, by which no one for the future could
 arrest an ambassador for debt; but after the battle of Pultowa, the
 English court thought proper to give satisfaction to the czar.
 
 The queen made by a formal embassy an excuse for what had passed. Mr.
 Whitworth,[82] the person charged with this commission, began his
 harangue with the following words.--(Feb. 16.) 'Most high and mighty
 emperor.' He told the czar that the person who had presumed to arrest
 his ambassador, had been imprisoned and rendered infamous. There was no
 truth in all this, but it was sufficient that he said so, and the title
 of emperor, which the queen had not given Peter before the battle of
 Pultowa, shewed the consideration he had now acquired in Europe.
 
 This title had been already granted him in Holland, not only by those
 who had been his fellow-workmen in the dock-yards at Saardam, and seemed
 to interest themselves most in his glory, but likewise by the principal
 persons in the state, who unanimously styled him emperor, and made
 public rejoicings for his victory, even in the presence of the Swedish
 minister.
 
 The universal reputation which he had acquired by his victory of
 Pultowa, was still further increased by his not suffering a moment to
 pass without making some advantages of it. In the first place, he laid
 siege to Elbing, a Hans town of Regal Prussia in Poland, where the
 Swedes had still a garrison. The Russians scaled the walls, entered the
 town, and the garrison surrendered prisoners of war. (Mar. 11.) This was
 one of the largest magazines belonging to Charles XII. The conquerors
 found therein one hundred and eighty-three brass cannon, and one hundred
 and fifty-seven mortars. Immediately after the reduction of Elbing,
 Peter re-marched from Moscow to Petersburg (April 2.); as soon as he
 arrived at this latter place, he took shipping under his new fortress of
 Cronslot, coasted along the shore of Carelia, and notwithstanding a
 violent storm, brought his fleet safely before Wiburg, the capital of
 Carelia in Finland; while his land-forces advanced over the frozen
 morasses, and in a short time the capital of Livonia beheld itself
 closely blockaded (June 23.): and after a breach was made in the walls,
 Wiburg surrendered, and the garrison, consisting of four thousand men,
 capitulated, but did not receive the honours of war, being made
 prisoners notwithstanding the capitulation. Peter charged the enemy with
 several infractions of this kind, and promised to set these troops at
 liberty, as soon as he should receive satisfaction from the Swedes, for
 his complaints. On this occasion the king of Sweden was to be consulted,
 who continued as inflexible as ever; and those soldiers, whom, by a
 little concession, he might have delivered from their confinement,
 remained in captivity. Thus did king William III. in 1695, arrest
 marshal Boufflers, notwithstanding the capitulation of Namur. There have
 been several instances of such violations of treaties, but it is to be
 wished there never had been any.
 
 After the taking of this capital, the blockade of Riga was soon changed
 into a regular siege, and pushed with vigour. They were obliged to break
 the ice on the river Dwina, which waters the walls of the city. An
 epidemical disorder, which had raged some time in those parts, now got
 amongst the besiegers, and carried off nine thousand; nevertheless, the
 siege was not in the least slackened; it lasted a considerable time, but
 at length the garrison capitulated (July 15.): and were allowed the
 honours of war; but it was stipulated by the capitulation, that all the
 Livonian officers and soldiers should enter into the Russian service, as
 natives of a country that had been dismembered from that empire, and
 usurped by the ancestors of Charles XII. But the Livonians were restored
 to the privileges of which his father had stripped them, and all the
 officers entered into the czar's service: this was the most noble
 satisfaction that Peter could take for the murder of his ambassador,
 Patkul, a Livonian, who had been put to death, for defending those
 privileges. The garrison consisted of near five thousand men. A short
 time afterwards the citadel of Pennamund was taken, and the besiegers
 found in the town and fort above eight hundred pieces of artillery of
 different kinds.
 
 Nothing was now wanting, to make Peter entirely master of the province
 of Carelia, but the possession of the strong town of Kexholm, built on
 an island in the lake of Ladoga, and deemed impregnable; it was
 bombarded soon after, and surrendered in a short time. (Sep. 19.) The
 island of Oesel in the sea, bordering upon the north of Livonia, was
 subdued with the same rapidity. (Sep. 23.)
 
 On the side of Esthonia, a province of Livonia, towards the north, and
 on the gulf of Finland, are the towns of Pernau and Revel: by the
 reduction of these Peter completed the conquest of all Livonia. Pernau
 surrendered after a siege of a few days (Aug. 25.), and Revel
 capitulated (Sep. 10.) without waiting to have a single cannon fired
 against it; but the besieged found means to escape out of the hands of
 the conquerors, at the very time that they were surrendering themselves
 prisoners of war: for some Swedish ships, having anchored in the road,
 under favour of the night, the garrison and most of the citizens
 embarked on board, and when the besiegers entered the town, they were
 surprised to find it deserted. When Charles XII. gained the victory of
 Narva little did he expect that his troops would one day be driven to
 use such artifices.
 
 In Poland, Stanislaus finding his party entirely ruined, had taken
 refuge in Pomerania, which still belonged to Charles XII. Augustus
 resumed the government, and it was difficult to decide who had acquired
 most glory, Charles in dethroning him, or Peter in restoring him to his
 crown.
 
 The subjects of the king of Sweden were still more unfortunate than that
 monarch himself. The contagious distemper, which had made such havock
 over Livonia, passed from thence into Sweden, where, in the city of
 Stockholm, it carried off thirty thousand persons: it likewise desolated
 the provinces, already thinned of their inhabitants; for during the
 space of ten years successively, most of the able-bodied men had quitted
 their country to follow their master, and perished in foreign climes.
 
 Charles's ill fortune pursued him also in Pomerania: his army had
 retired thither from Poland, to the number of eleven thousand; the czar,
 the kings of Denmark and Prussia, the elector of Hanover, and the duke
 of Holstein, joined together to render this army useless, and to compel
 general Crassau, who commanded it, to submit to neutrality. The regency
 of Stockholm, hearing no news of their king, and distracted by the
 mortality that raged in that city, were glad to sign this neutrality,
 which seemed to deliver one of its provinces at least from the horrors
 of war. The emperor of Germany favoured this extraordinary convention,
 by which it was stipulated, that the Swedish army then in Pomerania
 should not march from thence to assist their monarch in any other part
 of the world; nay, it was furthermore resolved in the German empire, to
 raise an army to enforce the execution of this unparalleled convention.
 The reason of this was, that the emperor of Germany, who was then at war
 with France, was in hopes to engage the Swedish army to enter into his
 service. This whole negotiation was carried on while Peter was subduing
 Livonia, Esthonia, and Carelia.
 
 Charles XII. who was all this time at Bender, putting every spring in
 motion to engage the divan to declare war against the czar, received
 this news as one of the severest blows his untoward fortune had dealt
 him: he could not brook, that his senate at Stockholm should pretend to
 tie up the hands of his army, and it was on this occasion that he wrote
 them word, he would send one of his boots to govern them.
 
 The Danes, in the mean time, were making preparations to invade Sweden;
 so that every nation in Europe was now engaged in war, Spain, Portugal,
 Italy, France, Germany, Holland, and England, were contending for the
 dominions left by Charles II. of Spain; and the whole North was up in
 arms against Charles XII. There wanted only a quarrel with the Ottoman
 empire, for every village in Europe to be exposed to the ravages of war.
 This quarrel happened soon afterwards, when Peter had attained to the
 summit of his glory, and precisely for that reason.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XX.
 
     Campaign of Pruth.
 
 
 Sultan Achmet III. declared war against Peter I. not from any regard to
 the king of Sweden, but, as may readily be supposed, merely from a view
 to his own interest. The Khan of the Crim Tartars could not without
 dread, behold a neighbour so powerful as Peter I. The Porte had, for
 some time, taken umbrage at the number of ships which this prince had on
 the Palus Maeotis, and in the Black Sea, at his fortifying the city of
 Azoph, and at the flourishing state of the harbour of Taganroc, already
 become famous; and, lastly, at his great series of successes, and at the
 ambition which success never fails to augment.
 
 It is neither true, nor even probable, that the Porte should have begun
 the war against the czar, on the Palus Maeotis, for no other reason than
 because a Swedish ship had taken a bark on the Baltic, on board of which
 was found a letter from a minister, whose name has never been mentioned.
 Norberg tells us, that this letter contained a plan for the conquest of
 the Turkish empire; that it was carried to Charles XII. who was then in
 Turkey, and was by him sent to the divan; and that immediately after the
 receipt of this letter, war was declared. But this story carries the
 mark of fiction with it. It was the remonstrances of the khan of
 Tartary, who was more uneasy about the neighbourhood of Azoph, than the
 Turkish divan, that induced this latter to give orders for taking the
 field.[83]
 
 It was in the month of August, and before the czar had completed the
 reduction of Livonia, when Achmet III. resolved to declare war against
 him. The Turks, at that time, could hardly have had the news of the
 taking of Riga; and, therefore, the proposal of restoring to the king of
 Sweden the value in money, of the effects he had lost at the battle of
 Pultowa, would have been the most absurd thing imaginable, if not
 exceeded by that of demolishing Petersburg. The behaviour of Charles
 XII. at Bender, was sufficiently romantic; but the conduct of the
 Turkish divan would have been much more so, if we suppose it to have
 made any demands of this kind.
 
 Nov. 1710.] The khan of Tartary, who was the principal instigator of
 this war, paid Charles a visit in his retreat at Bender. They were
 connected by the same interests, inasmuch as Europe makes part of the
 frontiers of Little Tartary. Charles and the khan were the two greatest
 sufferers by the successes of the czar; but the khan did not command the
 forces of the grand seignior. He was like one of the feudatory princes
 of Germany, who served in the armies of the empire with their own
 troops, and were subject to the authority of the emperor's generals for
 the time being.
 
 Nov. 29, 1710.] The first step taken by the divan, was to arrest
 Tolstoy, the czar's ambassador at the Porte, in the streets of
 Constantinople, together with thirty of his domestics, who, with their
 master, were all confined in the prison of the Seven Towers. This
 barbarous custom, at which even savages would blush, is owing to the
 Turks having always a number of foreign ministers residing amongst them
 from other courts, whereas they never send any in return. They look upon
 the ambassadors of Christian princes in no other light than as merchants
 or consuls; and, having naturally as great a contempt for Christians as
 they have for Jews, they seldom condescend to observe the laws of
 nations, in respect to them, unless forced to it; at least, they have
 hitherto persisted in this barbarous pride.
 
 The famous vizier, Achmet Couprougli, the same who took the island of
 Candia, under Mahomet IV., insulted the son of the French ambassador,
 and even carried his brutality so far as to strike him, and afterwards
 to confine him in prison, without Lewis XIV., proud and lofty as he was,
 daring to resent it, otherwise than by sending another minister to the
 Porte. The Christian princes, who are so remarkably delicate on the
 point of honour amongst themselves, and have even made it a part of the
 law of nations, seem to be utterly insensible on this head in regard to
 the Turks.
 
 Never did a crowned head suffer greater affronts in the persons of his
 ministers, than czar Peter. In the space of a few years, his
 ambassador at the court of London was thrown into jail for debt, his
 plenipotentiary at the courts of Poland and Saxony was broke upon the
 wheel, by order of the king of Sweden; and now his minister at the
 Ottoman Porte was seized and thrown into a dungeon at Constantinople,
 like a common felon.[84]
 
 We have already observed, in the first part of this history, that he
 received satisfaction from queen Anne, of England, for the insult
 offered to his ambassador at London. The horrible affront he suffered,
 in the person of Patkul, was washed away in the blood of the Swedes
 slain at the battle of Pultowa; but fortune permitted the violation of
 the law of nations by the Turks to pass unpunished.
 
 Jan. 1711.] The czar now found himself obliged to quit the theatre of
 war in the west, and march towards the frontiers of Turkey. He began by
 causing ten regiments, which he had in Poland, to advance towards
 Moldavia.[85] He then ordered marshal Sheremeto to set out from Livonia,
 with his body of forces; and, leaving prince Menzikoff at the head of
 affairs at Petersburg, he returned to Moscow, to give orders for opening
 the ensuing campaign.
 
 Jan. 18.] He now establishes a senate of regency: the regiment of guards
 begin their march, he issues orders for all the young nobility to follow
 him to the field, to learn the art of war, and places some of them in
 the station of cadets, and others in that of subaltern officers. Admiral
 Apraxin goes to Azoph to take the command by sea and land. These several
 measures being taken, the czar publishes an ordonnance in Moscow for
 acknowledging a new empress. This was the person who had been taken
 prisoner in Marienburg, in the year 1702. Peter had, in 1696, repudiated
 his wife Eudoxia Lopoukin (or Lapouchin) by whom he had two children.
 The laws of his church allow of no divorces; but, had they not, Peter
 would have enacted a new law to permit them.
 
 The fair captive of Marienburg, who had taken the name of Catherine, had
 a soul superior to her sex and her misfortunes. She rendered herself so
 agreeable to the czar, that this prince would have her always near his
 person. She accompanied him in all his excursions, and most fatiguing
 campaigns: sharing in his toils, and softening his uneasiness by her
 natural gaiety, and the great attention she shewed to oblige him on all
 occasions, and the indifference she expressed for the luxury, dress, and
 other indulgences, of which the generality of her sex are, in other
 countries, wont to make real necessities. She frequently softened the
 passionate temper of the czar, and, by making him more clement and
 merciful, rendered him more truly great. In a word, she became so
 necessary to him, that he married her privately, in 1707. He had already
 two daughters by her, and the following year she bore him a third, who
 was afterwards married to the duke of Holstein.[86]
 
 March 17, 1711.] The czar made this private marriage known the very day
 he set out with her to try the fortune of his arms against the Turks.
 The several dispositions he had made seemed to promise a successful
 issue. The hetman of the Cossacks was to keep the Tartars in awe, who
 had already began to commit ravages in the Ukraine. The main body of
 the Russian army was advancing towards Niester, and another body of
 troops, under prince Galitzin, were in full march through Poland. Every
 thing went on favourably at the beginning: for Galitzin having met with
 a numerous body of Tartars near Kiow, who had been joined by some
 Cossacks and some Poles of king Stanislaus' party, as also a few Swedes,
 he defeated them entirely, and killed near five thousand men. These
 Tartars had, in their march through the open country, made about ten
 thousand prisoners. It has been the custom of the Tartars, time
 immemorial, to carry with them a much greater number of cords than
 scimitars, in order to bind the unhappy wretches they surprise. The
 captives were all set free, and those who had made them prisoners were
 put to the sword. The whole Russian army, if it had been assembled
 together, would have amounted to sixty thousand men. It was to have been
 farther augmented by the troops belonging to the king of Poland. This
 prince, who owed every thing to the czar, came to pay him a visit at
 Jaroslaw, on the river Sana, the 3d of June, 1714, and promised him
 powerful succours. War was now declared against the Turks, in the name
 of these two monarchs: but the Polish diet, not willing to break with
 the Ottoman Porte, refused to ratify the engagement their king had
 entered into. It was the fate of the czar to have, in the king of
 Poland, an ally who could never be of any service to him. He entertained
 the same hopes of assistance from the princes of Moldavia and Walachia,
 and was, in the like manner, disappointed.
 
 These two provinces ought to have taken this opportunity to shake off
 the Turkish yoke. These countries were those of the ancient Daci, who,
 together with the Gepidi, with whom they were intermixed, did, for a
 long time, disturb the Roman empire. They were at length subdued by the
 emperor Trajan, and Constantine the First made them embrace the
 Christian religion. Dacia was one of the provinces of the eastern
 empire; but shortly after these very people contributed to the ruin of
 that of the west, by serving under the Odoacers and Theodorics.
 
 They afterwards continued to be subject to the Greek empire; and when
 the Turks made themselves masters of Constantinople, were governed and
 oppressed by particular princes; at length they were totally subjected
 by the Padisha, or Turkish emperor, who now granted them an investiture.
 The Hospodar, or Waiwod, chosen by the Ottoman Porte to govern these
 provinces, is always a Christian of the Greek church. The Turks, by this
 choice, give a proof of their toleration, while our ignorant declaimers
 are accusing them of persecution. The prince, nominated by the Porte, is
 tributary to, or rather farms these countries of the grand seignior;
 this dignity being always conferred on the best bidder, or him who makes
 the greatest presents to the vizier, in like manner as the Greek
 patriarch, at Constantinople. Sometimes this government is bestowed on a
 dragoman, that is to say, the interpreter to the divan. These provinces
 are seldom under the government of the same Waiwod, the Porte choosing
 to divide them, in order to be more sure of retaining them in
 subjection. Demetrius Cantemir was at this time Waiwod of Moldavia. This
 prince was said to be descended from Tamerlane, because Tamerlane's true
 name was Timur, and Timur was a Tartarian khan; and so, from the name
 Tamurkan, say they, came the family of Cantemir.
 
 Bassaraba Brancovan had been invested with the principality of
 Walachia, but had not found any genealogist to deduce his pedigree from
 the Tartarian conqueror. Cantemir thought the time now come to shake off
 the Turkish yoke, and render himself independent by means of the czar's
 protection. In this view he acted in the very same manner with Peter as
 Mazeppa had done with Charles XII. He even engaged Bassaraba for the
 present to join him in the conspiracy, of which he hoped to reap all the
 benefit himself: his plan being to make himself master of both
 provinces. The bishop of Jerusalem, who was at that time at Walachia,
 was the soul of this conspiracy. Cantemir promised the czar to furnish
 him with men and provisions, as Mazeppa did the king of Sweden, and kept
 his word no better than he had done.
 
 General Sheremeto advanced towards Jassi, the capital of Moldavia, to
 inspect and occasionally assist the execution of these great projects.
 Cantemir came thither to meet him, and was received with all the honours
 due to a prince: but he acted as a prince in no one circumstance, but
 that of publishing a manifesto against the Turkish empire. The hospodar
 of Walachia, who soon discovered the ambitious views of his colleague,
 quitted his party, and returned to his duty. The bishop of Jerusalem
 dreading, with reason, the punishment due to his perfidy, fled and
 concealed himself: the people of Walachia and Moldavia continued
 faithful to the Ottoman Porte, and those, who were to have furnished
 provisions for the Russian army, carried them to the Turks.
 
 The vizier, Baltagi Mahomet had already crossed the Danube, at the head
 of one hundred thousand men, and was advancing towards Jassi, along the
 banks of the river Pruth (formerly the Hierasus), which falls into the
 Danube, and which is nearly the boundary of Moldavia and Bessarabia. He
 then dispatched count Poniatowsky,[87] a Polish gentleman, attached to
 the fortunes of the king of Sweden, to desire that prince to make him a
 visit, and see his army. Charles, whose pride always got the better of
 his interest, would not consent to this proposal: he insisted that the
 grand vizier should make him the first visit, in his asylum near Bender.
 When Poniatowsky returned to the Ottoman camp, and endeavoured to excuse
 this refusal of his master, the vizier, turning to the khan of the
 Tartars, said, 'This is the very behaviour I expected from this proud
 pagan.' This mutual pride, which never fails of alienating the minds of
 those in power from each other, did no service to the king of Sweden's
 affairs; and indeed that prince might have easily perceived, from the
 beginning, that the Turks were not acting for his interest, but for
 their own.
 
 While the Turkish army was passing the Danube, the czar advanced by the
 frontiers of Poland, and passed the Boristhenes, in order to relieve
 marshal Sheremeto, who was then on the banks of the Pruth, to the
 southward of Jassi, and in danger of being daily surrounded by an army
 of ten thousand Turks, and an army of Tartars. Peter, before he passed
 the Boristhenes, was in doubt whether he should expose his beloved
 Catherine to these dangers, which seemed to increase every day; but
 Catherine, on her side, looked upon this solicitude of the czar, for her
 ease and safety, as an affront offered to her love and courage; and
 pressed her consort so strongly on this head, that he found himself
 under a necessity to consent that she should pass the river with him.
 The army beheld her with eyes of joy and admiration, marching on
 horseback at the head of the troops, for she rarely made use of a
 carriage. After passing the Boristhenes, they had a tract of desert
 country to pass through, and then to cross the Bog, and afterwards the
 river Tiras, now called the Niester, and then another desert to
 traverse, before they came to the banks of the Pruth. Catherine, during
 this fatiguing march, animated the whole army by her cheerfulness and
 affability. She sent refreshments to such of the officers who were sick,
 and extended her care even to the meanest soldier.
 
 July 4, 1711.] At length the czar brought his army in sight of Jassi.
 Here he was to establish his magazine. Bassaraba, the hospodar of
 Walachia, who had again embraced the interest of the Ottoman Porte, but
 still, in appearance, continued a friend to the czar, proposed to that
 prince to make peace with the Turks, although he had received no
 commission from the grand vizier for that purpose. His deceit, however,
 was soon discovered; and the czar contented himself with demanding only
 provisions for his army, which Bassaraba neither could nor would
 furnish. It was very difficult to procure any supplies from Poland; and
 these, which prince Cantemir had promised, and which he vainly hoped to
 procure from Walachia, could not be brought from thence. These
 disappointments rendered the situation of the Russian army very
 disagreeable; and, as an addition to their afflictions, they were
 infested with an immense swarm of grasshoppers, that covered the face of
 the whole country, and devoured, or spoiled, every thing where they
 alighted. They were likewise frequently in want of water during their
 march through sandy deserts, and beneath a scorching sun: what little
 they could procure, they were obliged to have brought in vessels to the
 camp, from a considerable distance.
 
 During this dangerous and fatiguing march, the czar, by a singular
 fatality, found himself in the neighbourhood of his rival and
 competitor, Charles; Bender not being above twenty-five leagues from the
 place where the Russian army was encamped, near Jassi. Some parties of
 Cossacks made excursions even to the place of that unfortunate monarch's
 retreat; but the Crim Tartars, who hovered round that part of the
 country, sufficiently secured him from any attempt that might be made to
 seize his person; and Charles waited in his camp with impatience, and
 did not fear the issue of the war.
 
 Peter, as soon as he had established some magazines, marched in haste
 with his army to the right of the river Pruth. His essential object was
 to prevent the Turks, who were posted to the left, and towards the head
 of the river, from crossing it, and marching towards him. This effected,
 he would then be master of Moldavia and Walachia: with this view, he
 dispatched general Janus, with the vanguard of the army, to oppose the
 passage of the Turks; but the general did not arrive till they had
 already began to cross the river upon their bridges; upon which he was
 obliged to retreat, and his infantry was closely pursued by the Turks,
 till the czar came up in person to his assistance.
 
 The grand vizier now marched directly along the river towards the czar.
 The two armies were very unequal in point of numbers: that of the Turks,
 which had been reinforced by the Tartarian troops, consisted of nearly
 two hundred and fifty thousand men, while that of the Russians hardly
 amounted to thirty-five thousand. There was indeed a considerable body
 of troops, headed by general Renne, on their march from the other side
 of the Moldavian mountains; but the Turks had cut off all communication
 with those parts.
 
 The czar's army now began to be in want of provisions, nor could,
 without the greatest difficulty, procure water, though encamped at a
 very small distance from the river; being exposed to a furious discharge
 from the batteries, which the grand vizier had caused to be erected on
 the left side of the river, under the care of a body of troops, that
 kept up a constant fire against the Russians. By this relation, which is
 strictly circumstantial and true, it appears that Baltagi Mahomet, the
 Turkish vizier, far from being the pusillanimous, or weak commander,
 which the Swedes have represented him, gave proofs, on this occasion,
 that he perfectly well understood his business. The passing the Pruth in
 the sight of the enemy, obliging him to retreat, and harassing him in
 that retreat; the cutting off all communication between the czar's army,
 and a body of cavalry that was marching to reinforce it; the hemming in
 this army, without the least probability of a retreat; and the cutting
 off all supplies of water and provisions, by keeping it constantly under
 the check of the batteries on the opposite side of the river, were
 manoeuvres that in no ways bespoke the unexperienced or indolent
 general.
 
 Peter now saw himself in a situation even worse than that to which he
 had reduced his rival, Charles XII. at Pultowa; being, like him,
 surrounded by a superior army, and in greater want of provisions; and,
 like him, having confided in the promises of a prince, too powerful to
 be bound by those promises, he resolved upon a retreat; and endeavoured
 to return towards Jassi, in order to choose a more advantageous
 situation for his camp.
 
 July 20, 1711.] He accordingly decamped under favour of the night; but
 his army had scarcely begun its march, when, at break of day, the Turks
 fell upon his rear: but the Preobrazinski regiment turning about, and
 standing firm, did, for a considerable time, check the fury of their
 onset. The Russians then formed themselves, and made a line of
 intrenchments with their waggons and baggage. The same day (July 21.)
 the Turks returned again to the attack, with the whole body of their
 army; and, as a proof that the Russians knew how to defend themselves,
 let what will be alleged to the contrary, they also made head against
 this very superior force for a considerable time, killed a great number
 of their enemies, who in vain endeavoured to break in upon them.
 
 There were in the Ottoman army two officers belonging to the king of
 Sweden, namely, count Poniatowsky and the count of Sparre, who had the
 command of a body of Cossacks in that prince's interest. My papers
 inform me, that these two generals advised the grand vizier to avoid
 coming to action with the Russians, and content himself with depriving
 them of supplies of water and provisions, which would oblige them either
 to surrender prisoners of war, or to perish with famine. Other memoirs
 pretend, on the contrary, that these officers would have persuaded
 Mahomet to fall upon this feeble and half-starved army, in a weak and
 distressed condition, and put all to the sword. The first of these seems
 to be the most prudent and circumspect; but the second is more agreeable
 to the character of generals who had been trained up under Charles XII.
 
 The real fact is, that the grand vizier fell upon the rear of the
 Russian army, at the dawn of day, which was thrown into confusion, and
 there remained only a line of four hundred men to confront the Turks.
 This small body formed itself with amazing quickness, under the orders
 of a German general, named Alard, who, to his immortal honour, made such
 rapid and excellent dispositions on this occasion, that the Russians
 withstood, for upwards of three hours, the repeated attack of the whole
 Ottoman army, without losing a foot of ground.
 
 The czar now found himself amply repaid for the immense pains he had
 taken to inure his troops to strict discipline. At the battle of Narva,
 sixty thousand men were defeated by only eight thousand, because the
 former were undisciplined; and here we behold a rear-guard, consisting
 of only eight thousand Russians, sustaining the efforts of one hundred
 and fifty thousand Turks, killing seven thousand of them, and obliging
 the rest to return back.
 
 After this sharp engagement, both armies intrenched themselves for that
 night: but the Russians still continued enclosed, and deprived of all
 provisions, even water; for notwithstanding they were so near the river
 Pruth, yet they did not dare approach its banks; for as soon as any
 parties were sent out to find water, a body of Turks, posted on the
 opposite shore, drove them back by a furious discharge from their
 cannon, loaded with chain shot: and the body of the Turkish army, which
 had attacked that of the czar the day before, continued to play upon
 them from another quarter, with the whole force of their artillery.
 
 The Russian army appeared now to be lost beyond resource, by its
 position, by the inequality of numbers, and by the want of provisions.
 The skirmishes on both sides were frequent and bloody: the Russian
 cavalry being almost all dismounted, could no longer be of any service,
 unless by fighting on foot: in a word, the situation of affairs was
 desperate. It was out of their power to retreat, they had nothing left
 but to gain a complete victory; to perish to the last man, or to be made
 slaves by the infidels.
 
 All the accounts and memoirs of those times unanimously agree, that the
 czar, divided within himself, whether or not he should expose his wife,
 his army, his empire, and the fruits of all his labours, to almost
 inevitable destruction; retired to his tent, oppressed with grief, and
 seized with violent convulsions, to which he was naturally subject, and
 which the present desperate situation of his affairs brought upon him
 with redoubled violence. In this condition he remained alone in his
 tent, having given positive orders, that no one should be admitted to be
 a witness to the distraction of his mind. But Catherine, hearing of his
 disorders, forced her way in to him; and, on this occasion, Peter found
 how happy it was for him that he had permitted his wife to accompany him
 in this expedition.
 
 A wife, who, like her, had faced death in its most horrible shapes, and
 had exposed her person, like the meanest soldier, to the fire of the
 Turkish artillery, had an undoubted right to speak to her husband, and
 to be heard. The czar accordingly listened to what she had to say, and
 in the end suffered himself to be persuaded to try and send to the
 vizier with proposals of peace.
 
 It has been a custom, from time immemorial, throughout the East, that
 when any people apply for an audience of the sovereign, or his
 representative, they must not presume to approach them without a
 present. On this occasion, therefore, Catherine mustered the few jewels
 that she had brought with her, on this military tour, in which no
 magnificence or luxury were admitted; to these she added two black
 foxes' skins, and what ready money she could collect; the latter was
 designed for a present to the kiaia. She made choice herself of an
 officer, on whose fidelity and understanding she thought she could
 depend, who, accompanied with two servants, was to carry the presents to
 the grand vizier, and afterwards to deliver the money intended for the
 kiaia into his own hand. This officer was likewise charged with a letter
 from marshal Sheremeto to the grand vizier. The memoirs of czar Peter
 mentions this letter, but they take no notice of the other particulars
 of Catherine's conduct in this business; however, they are sufficiently
 confirmed by the declaration issued by Peter himself, in 1723, when he
 caused Catherine to be crowned empress, wherein we find these
 words:--'She has been of the greatest assistance to us in all our
 dangers, and particularly in the battle of Pruth, when our army was
 reduced to twenty-two thousand men.' If the czar had then indeed no more
 men capable of bearing arms, the service which Catherine did him, on
 that occasion, was fully equivalent to the honours and dignities
 conferred upon her. The MS. journal of Peter the Great observes, that on
 the day of the bloody battle (on the 20th July), he had thirty-one
 thousand five hundred and fifty-four foot, and six thousand six hundred
 and ninety-two horse, the latter almost all dismounted; he must then
 have lost sixteen thousand two hundred and forty-six men in that
 engagement. The same memoirs affirm, the loss sustained by the Turks
 greatly exceeded that of the Russians; for as the former rushed upon the
 czar's troops pell-mell, and without observing any order, hardly a
 single fire of the latter missed its effect. If this is fact, the affair
 of the 20th and 21st of July, was one of the most bloody that had been
 known for many ages.
 
 We must either suspect Peter the Great of having been mistaken, in his
 declaration at the crowning of the empress, when he acknowledges 'his
 obligations to her of having saved his army, which was reduced to
 twenty-two thousand men,' or accuse him of a falsity in his journal,
 wherein he says, that the day on which the above battle was fought, his
 army, exclusive of the succours he expected from the other side the
 Moldavian mountains, amounted to thirty-one thousand five hundred and
 fifty-four foot, and six thousand six hundred and ninety-two horse.
 According to this calculation, the battle of Pruth must have been by far
 more terrible than the historians or memorials have represented on
 either side. There must certainly be some mistake here, which is no
 uncommon thing in the relation of campaigns, especially when the writer
 enters into a minute detail of circumstances. The surest method,
 therefore, on these occasions, is to confine ourselves to the principal
 events, the victory and the defeat; as we can very seldom know, with any
 degree of certainty, the exact loss on either side.
 
 But however here the Russian army might be reduced in point of numbers,
 there were still hopes that the grand vizier, deceived by their vigorous
 and obstinate resistance, might be induced to grant them peace, upon
 such terms as might be honourable to his master's arms, and at the same
 time not absolutely disgraceful to those of the czar. It was the great
 merit of Catherine to have perceived this possibility, at a time when
 her consort and his generals expected nothing less than inevitable
 destruction.
 
 Norberg, in his History of Charles XII. quotes a letter, sent by the
 czar to the grand vizier, in which he expresses himself thus:--'If,
 contrary to my intentions, I have been so unhappy as to incur the
 displeasure of his highness, I am ready to make reparation for any cause
 of complaint he may have against me; I conjure you, most noble general,
 to prevent the further effusion of blood; give orders, I beseech you, to
 put a stop to the dreadful fire of your artillery, and accept the
 hostage I herewith send you.'
 
 This letter carries all the marks of falsity with it, as do indeed most
 of the random pieces of Norberg: it is dated 11th July, N. S. whereas no
 letter was sent to Baltagi Mahomet till the 21st, N. S. neither was it
 the czar who wrote to the vizier, but his general Sheremeto: there were
 no such expressions made use of as--'if the czar has had the misfortune
 to incur the displeasure of his highness;' such terms being suitable
 only to a subject, who implores the pardon of his sovereign, whom he has
 offended. There was no mention made of any hostage, nor was any one
 sent. The letter was carried by an officer, in the midst of a furious
 cannonade on both sides. Sheremeto, in his letter, only reminded the
 vizier of certain overtures of peace that the Porte had made at the
 beginning of the campaign, through the mediation of the Dutch and
 English ministers, and by which the divan demanded that the fort and
 harbour of Taganroc should be given up, which were the real subjects of
 the war.
 
 21st July, 1711.] Some hours elapsed before the messenger received an
 answer from the grand vizier, and it was apprehended that he had either
 been killed by the enemy's cannon, or that they detained him prisoner. A
 second courier was therefore dispatched, with duplicates of the former
 letters, and a council of war was immediately held, at which Catherine
 was present. At this council ten general officers signed the following
 resolution:--
 
 'Resolved, If the enemy will not accept the conditions proposed, and
 should insist upon our laying down our arms, and surrendering at
 discretion, that all the ministers and general officers are unanimously
 of opinion, to cut their way through the enemy sword in hand.'
 
 In consequence of this resolution, a line of intrenchments was thrown
 round the baggage, and the Russians marched some few paces out of their
 camp, towards the enemy, when the grand vizier caused a suspension of
 arms to be proclaimed between the two armies.
 
 All the writers of the Swedish party have treated the grand vizier as a
 cowardly and infamous wretch, who had been bribed to sell the honour of
 his master's arms. In the same manner have several authors accused count
 Piper of receiving money from the duke of Marlborough, to persuade the
 king of Sweden to continue the war against the czar; and have laid to
 the charge of the French minister, that he purchased the peace of
 Seville for a stipulated sum. Such accusations ought never to be
 advanced but on very strong proofs. It is very seldom that a minister
 will stoop to such meannesses, which are always discovered, sooner or
 later, by those who have been entrusted with the payment of the money,
 or by the public registers, which never lie. A minister of state stands
 as a public object to the eyes of all Europe. His credit and influence
 depend wholly upon his character, and he is always sufficiently rich to
 be above the temptation of becoming a traitor.
 
 The place of viceroy of the Turkish empire is so illustrious, and the
 profits annexed to it, in time of war, so immense, there was such a
 profusion of every thing necessary, and even luxurious, in the camp of
 Baltagi Mahomet, and, on the other hand, so much poverty and distress in
 that of the czar, that surely the grand vizier was rather in a condition
 to give than to receive. The trifling present of a woman, who had
 nothing to send but a few skins and some jewels, in compliance with the
 established custom of all courts, or rather those in particular of the
 East, can never be considered in the light of a bribe. The frank and
 open conduct of Baltagi Mahomet seems at once to give the lie to the
 black accusations with which so many writers have stained their
 relations. Vice chancellor Shaffiroff paid the vizier a public visit in
 his tent: every thing was transacted in the most open manner, on both
 sides; and indeed it could not be otherwise. The very first article of
 the negotiation was entered upon in the presence of a person wholly
 devoted to the king of Sweden, a domestic of count Poniatowsky, who was
 himself one of that monarch's generals. This man served as an
 interpreter, and the several articles were publicly reduced to writing
 by the vizier's chief secretary, Hummer Effendi. Moreover, count
 Poniatowsky was there in person. The present sent to the kiaia was
 offered probably in form, and every thing was transacted agreeable to
 the oriental customs. Other presents were made by the Turks in return;
 so that there was not the least appearance of treachery or contrivance.
 The motives which determined the vizier to consent to the proposals
 offered him, were, first that the body of troops under the command of
 general Renne, on the borders of the river Sireth, in Moldavia, had
 already crossed three rivers, and were actually in the neighbourhood of
 the Danube, where Renne had already made himself master of the town and
 castle of Brahila, defended by a numerous garrison, under the command of
 a basha. Secondly, the czar had likewise another body of troops
 advancing through the frontiers of Poland; and, lastly, it is more than
 probable that the vizier was not fully acquainted with the extreme
 scarcity that was felt in the Russian camp. One enemy seldom furnishes
 another with an exact account of his provisions and ammunition; on the
 contrary, either side are accustomed rather to make a parade of plenty,
 even at a time when they are in the greatest necessity. There can be no
 artifices practised to gain intelligence of the true state of an
 adversary's affairs, by means of spies, between the Turks and the
 Russians. The difference of their dress, of their religion, and of their
 language, will not permit it. They are, moreover, strangers to that
 desertion which prevails in most of our armies; and, consequently, the
 grand vizier could not be supposed to know the desperate condition to
 which the czar's army was reduced.
 
 Baltagi, who was not fond of war, and who, nevertheless, had conducted
 this very well, thought that his expedition would be sufficiently
 successful, if he put his master in possession of the towns and harbours
 which made the subject of the war, stopt the progress of the victorious
 army under Renne, and obliged that general to quit the banks of the
 Danube, and return back into Russia, and for ever shut the entrance of
 the Palus Maeotis, the Cimmerian Bosphorus, and the Black Sea, against an
 enterprising prince; and, lastly, if he avoided taking these certain
 advantages, on the hazard of a new battle (in which, after all, despair
 might have got the better of superiority of numbers). The preceding day
 only he had beheld his janissaries repulsed with loss; and there wanted
 not examples of many victories having been gained by the weaker over the
 strong. Such then were Mahomet's reasons for accepting the proposals of
 peace. His conduct, however, did not merit the approbation of Charles's
 officers, who served in the Turkish army, nor of the khan of Tartary. It
 was the interest of the latter, and his followers, to reject all terms
 of accommodation which would deprive them of the opportunity of ravaging
 the frontiers of Russia and Poland. Charles XII. desired to be revenged
 on his rival, the czar: but the general, and the first minister of the
 Ottoman empire, was neither influenced by the private thirst of revenge,
 which animated the Christian monarch, nor by the desire of booty, which
 actuated the Tartar chief.
 
 As soon as the suspension of arms was agreed to, and signed, the
 Russians purchased of the Turks the provisions, of which they stood in
 need. The articles of the peace were not signed at that time, as is
 related by La Motraye, and which Norberg has copied from him. The
 vizier, among other conditions, demanded that the czar should promise
 not to interfere any more in the Polish affairs. This was a point
 particularly insisted upon by count Poniatowsky; but it was, in fact,
 the interest of the Ottoman crown, that the kingdom of Poland should
 continue in its then defenceless and divided state; accordingly this
 demand was reduced to that of the Russian troops evacuating the
 frontiers of Poland. The khan of Tartary, on his side, demanded a
 tribute of forty thousand sequins. This point, after being long debated,
 was at length given up.
 
 The grand vizier insisted a long time, that prince Cantemir should be
 delivered up to him, as Patkul had been to the king of Sweden. Cantemir
 was exactly in the same situation as Mazeppa had been. The czar caused
 that hetman to be arraigned and tried for his defection, and afterwards
 to be executed in effigy. The Turks were not acquainted with the nature
 of such proceeding; they knew nothing of trials for contumacy, nor of
 public condemnations. The affixing a sentence on any person, and
 executing him in effigy, were the more unusual amongst them, as their
 law forbids the representation of any human likeness whatever. The
 vizier in vain insisted on Cantemir's being delivered up; Peter
 peremptorily refused to comply, and wrote the following letter with his
 own hand, to his vice-chancellor Shaffiroff.
 
 'I can resign to the Turks all the country, as far as Curtzka, because I
 have hopes of being able to recover it again; but I will, by no means,
 violate my faith, which, once forfeited, can never be retrieved. I have
 nothing I can properly call my own, but my honour. If I give up that, I
 cease to be longer a king.'
 
 At length the treaty was concluded, and signed, at a village called
 Falksen, on the river Pruth. Among other things, it was stipulated, that
 Azoph, and the territories belonging thereto, should be restored,
 together with all the ammunition and artillery that were in the place,
 before the czar made himself master thereof, in 1696. That the harbour
 of Taganroc, in the Zabach Sea, should be demolished, as also that of
 Samara, on the river of the same name; and several other fortresses.
 There was likewise another article added, respecting the king of Sweden,
 which article alone, sufficiently shews the little regard the vizier had
 for that prince; for it was therein stipulated, that the czar should not
 molest Charles, in his return to his dominions, and that afterwards the
 czar and he might make peace with the other, if they were so inclined.
 
 It is pretty evident by the wording of this extraordinary article, that
 Baltagi Mahomet had not forgot the haughty manner in which Charles XII.
 had behaved to him a short time before, and it is not unlikely that this
 very behaviour of the king of Sweden might have been one inducement with
 Mahomet to comply so readily with his rival's proposals for peace.
 Charles's glory depended wholly on the ruin of the czar: but we are
 seldom inclinable to exalt those who express a contempt for us: however,
 this prince, who refused the vizier a visit in his camp, on his
 invitation, when it was certainly his interest to have been upon good
 terms with him, now came thither in haste and unasked, when the work
 which put an end to all his hopes was on the point of being concluded.
 The vizier did not go to meet him in person, but contented himself with
 sending two of his bashas, nor would he stir out of his tent, till
 Charles was within a few paces of him.
 
 This interview passed, as every one knows, in mutual reproaches. Several
 historians have thought, that the answer which the vizier made to the
 king of Sweden, when that prince reproached him with not making the czar
 prisoner, when he might have done it so easily, was the reply of a weak
 man. 'If I had taken him prisoner,' said Mahomet, 'who would there be
 to govern his dominions?'
 
 It is very easy, however, to comprehend, that this was the answer of a
 man who was piqued with resentment, and these words which he
 added--'For it is not proper that every crowned head should quit his
 dominions'--sufficiently shewed that he intended to mortify the refugee
 of Bender.
 
 Charles gained nothing by his journey, but the pleasure of tearing the
 vizier's robe with his spurs; while that officer, who was in a condition
 to make him repent this splenetic insult, seemed not to notice it, in
 which he was certainly greatly superior to Charles. If any thing could
 have made that monarch sensible, in the midst of his life, how easily
 fortune can put greatness to the blush, it would have been the
 reflection, that at the battle of Pultowa, a pastry-cook's boy had
 obliged his whole army to surrender at discretion; and in this of Pruth
 a wood-cutter was the arbiter of his fate, and that of his rival the
 czar: for the vizier, Baltagi Mahomet, had been a cutter of wood in the
 grand seignior's seraglio, as his name implied; and, far from being
 ashamed of that title, he gloried in it: so much do the manners of the
 eastern people differ from ours.
 
 When the news of this treaty reached Constantinople, the grand seignior
 was so well pleased, that he ordered public rejoicings to be made for a
 whole week, and Mahomet, the kiaia, or lieutenant-general, who brought
 the tidings to the divan, was instantly raised to the dignity of boujouk
 imraour, or master of the horse: a certain proof that the sultan did not
 think himself ill served by his vizier.
 
 Norberg seems to have known very little of the Turkish government, when
 he says, that 'the grand seignior was obliged to keep fair with Baltagi
 Mahomet, that vizier having rendered himself formidable.' The
 janissaries indeed have often rendered themselves formidable to their
 sultans; but there is not one example of a vizier, who has not been
 easily sacrificed to the will or orders of his sovereign, and Mahomet
 was in no condition to support himself by his own power. Besides,
 Norberg manifestly contradicts himself, by affirming in the same page,
 that the janissaries were irritated against Mahomet, and that the sultan
 stood in dread of his power.
 
 The king of Sweden was now reduced to the necessity of forming cabals in
 the Ottoman court; and a monarch, who had so lately made kings by his
 own power, was now seen waiting for audience, and offering memorials and
 petitions which were refused.
 
 Charles ran through all the ambages of intrigue, like a subject who
 endeavours to make a minister suspected by his master. In this manner he
 acted against Mahomet, and against those who succeeded him. At one time
 he addressed himself to the sultana Valide by means of a Jewess, who had
 admission into the seraglio; at another, he employed one of the eunuchs
 for the same purpose. At length he had recourse to a man who was to
 mingle among the grand seignior's guards, and, by counterfeiting a
 person out of his senses, to attract the attention of the sultan, and by
 that means deliver into his own hand a memorial from Charles. From all
 these various schemes, the king of Sweden drew only the mortification of
 seeing himself deprived of his thaim; that is to say, of the daily
 pension which the Porte of its generosity had assigned him for his
 subsistence, and which amounted to about one thousand five hundred
 French livres.[88] The grand vizier, instead of remitting this
 allowance to him as usual, sent him an order, in the form of a friendly
 advice, to quit the grand seignior's dominions.
 
 Charles, however, was absolutely determined not to depart, still
 flattering himself with the vain hope, that he should once more re-enter
 Poland and Russia with a powerful army of Turks. Every one knows what
 was the issue of his inflexible boldness in the year 1714, and how he
 engaged an army of janissaries, Spahis, and Tartars, with only himself,
 his secretaries, his valet de chambre, cook, and stable men; that he was
 taken prisoner in that country, where he had been treated with the
 greatest hospitality; and that he at length got back to his own kingdom
 in the disguise of a courier, after having lived five years in Turkey:
 from all which it remains to be acknowledged, that if there was reason
 in the conduct of this extraordinary prince, it was a reason of a very
 different nature to that of other men.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XXI.
 
     Conclusion of the Affairs of Pruth.
 
 
 It is necessary in this place to repeat an event already related in the
 History of Charles XII. It happened during the suspension of arms which
 preceded the treaty of Pruth, that two Tartarian soldiers surprised and
 took prisoners two Italian officers belonging to the czar's army, and
 sold them to an officer of the Turkish janissaries. The vizier being
 informed of this breach of public faith, punished the two Tartars with
 death. How are we to reconcile this severe delicacy with the violation
 of the law of nations in the person of Tolstoy, the czar's ambassador,
 whom this very vizier caused to be arrested in the streets of
 Constantinople, and afterwards imprisoned in the castle of the Seven
 Towers? There is always some reason for the contradictions we find in
 the actions of mankind. Baltagi Mahomet was incensed against the khan of
 Tartary, for having opposed the peace he had lately made, and was
 resolved to shew that chieftain that he was his master.
 
 The treaty was no sooner concluded, than the czar quitted the borders of
 the Pruth, and returned towards his own dominions, followed by a body of
 eight thousand Turks, whom the vizier had sent as an army of observation
 to watch the motions of the Russian army during its march, and also to
 serve as an escort or safeguard to them against the wandering Tartars
 which infested those parts.
 
 Peter instantly set about accomplishing the treaty, by demolishing the
 fortresses of Samara and Kamienska; but the restoring of Azoph, and the
 demolition of the port of Taganroc, met with some difficulties in the
 execution. According to the terms of the treaty it was necessary to
 distinguish the artillery and ammunition which belonged to the Turks in
 Azoph before that place was taken by the czar, from those which had been
 sent thither after it fell into his hands. The governor of the place
 spun out this affair to a tedious length, at which the Porte was greatly
 incensed, and not without reason: the sultan was impatient to receive
 the keys of Azoph. The vizier promised they should be sent from time to
 time, but the governor always found means to delay the delivery of them.
 Baltagi Mahomet lost the good graces of his master, and with them his
 place. The khan of Tartary and his other enemies made such good use of
 their interest with the sultan, that the grand vizier was deposed,
 several bashas were disgraced at the same time; but the grand seignior,
 well convinced of this minister's fidelity, did not deprive him either
 of his life or estate, but only sent him to Mytilene to take on him the
 command of that island. This simple removal from the helm of affairs
 (Nov. 1711,), and the continuing to him his fortunes, and above all the
 giving him the command in Mytilene, sufficiently contradicts all that
 Norberg has advanced, to induce us to believe that this vizier had been
 corrupted with the czar's money.
 
 Norberg asserts furthermore, that the Bostangi basha, who came to divest
 him of his office, and to acquaint him of the grand seignior's sentence,
 declared him at the same time, 'a traitor, one who had disobeyed the
 orders of his sovereign lord, had sold himself to the enemy for money,
 and was found guilty of not having taken proper care of the interests of
 the king of Sweden.' In the first place, this kind of declarations are
 not at all in use in Turkey: the orders of the grand seignior always
 being issued privately, and executed with secresy. Secondly, if the
 vizier had been declared a traitor, a rebel, and a corrupted person,
 crimes of this nature would have been instantly punished with death in a
 country where they are never forgiven. Lastly, if he was punishable for
 not having sufficiently attended to the interests of the king of Sweden,
 it is evident that this prince must have had such a degree of influence
 at the Ottoman Porte, as to have made the other ministers to tremble,
 who would consequently have endeavoured to gain his good graces;
 whereas, on the contrary, the basha Jussuf, aga of the janissaries, who
 succeeded Mahomet Baltagi as grand vizier, had the same sentiments as
 his predecessor, in relation to Charles's conduct, and was so far from
 doing him any service that he thought of nothing but how to get rid of
 so dangerous a guest; and when count Poniatowsky, the companion and
 confidant of that monarch, went to compliment the vizier on his new
 dignity, the latter spoke to him thus. 'Pagan, I forewarn thee, that if
 ever I find thee hatching any intrigues, I will, upon the first notice,
 cause thee to be thrown into the sea with a stone about thy neck.'
 
 This compliment count Poniatowsky himself relates in the memoirs which
 he drew up at my request, and is a sufficient proof of the little
 influence his master had in the Turkish court. All that Norberg has
 related touching the affairs of that empire, appear to come from
 a prejudiced person, and one who was very ill informed of the
 circumstances he pretends to write about. And we may count among the
 errors of a party-spirit and political falsehoods, every thing which
 this writer advances unsupported by proofs, concerning the pretended
 corruption of a grand vizier, that is, of a person who had the disposal
 of upwards of sixty millions per annum, without being subject to the
 least account.[89] I have now before me the letter which count
 Poniatowsky wrote to King Stanislaus immediately after the signing the
 treaty of Pruth, in which he upbraids Baltagi Mahomet with the slight he
 shewed to the king of Sweden, his dislike to the war, and the
 unsteadiness of his temper; but never once hints the least charge of
 corruption: for he knew too well what the place of grand vizier was, to
 entertain an idea, that the czar was capable of setting a price upon the
 infidelity of the second person in the Ottoman empire.
 
 Schaffirow and Sheremeto, who remained at Constantinople as hostages on
 the part of the czar for his performance of the treaty, were not used in
 the manner they would have been if known to have purchased this peace,
 and to have joined with the vizier in deceiving his master. They were
 left to go at liberty about the city, escorted by two companies of
 janissaries.
 
 The czar's ambassador Tolstoy having been released from his confinement
 in the Seven Towers, immediately upon the signing of the treaty of
 Pruth, the Dutch and English ministers interposed with the new vizier to
 see the several articles of that treaty put into execution.
 
 Azoph was at length restored to the Turks, and the fortresses mentioned
 in the treaty were demolished according to stipulation. And now the
 Ottoman Porte, though very little inclinable to interfere in the
 differences between Christian princes, could not without vanity behold
 himself made arbitrator between Russia, Poland, and the king of Sweden;
 and insisted that the czar should withdraw his troops out of Poland, and
 deliver the Turkish empire from so dangerous a neighbour; and, desirous
 that the Christian princes might continually be at war with each other,
 wished for nothing so much as to send Charles home to his own dominions,
 but all this while had not the least intention of furnishing him with an
 army. The Tartars were still for war, as an artificer is willing to
 seize every opportunity to exercise his calling. The janissaries
 likewise wished to be called into the field, but more out of hatred
 against the Christians, their naturally restless disposition, and from a
 fondness for rapine and licentiousness, than from any other motives.
 Nevertheless, the English and Dutch ministers managed their negotiations
 so well, that they prevailed over the opposite party: the treaty of
 Pruth was confirmed, but with the addition of a new article, by which it
 was stipulated that the czar should withdraw his forces from Poland
 within three months, and that the sultan should immediately send Charles
 XII. out of his dominions.
 
 We may judge from this new treaty whether the king of Sweden had that
 interest at the Porte which some writers would have us to believe. He
 was evidently sacrificed on this occasion by the new vizier, basha
 Jussuf, as he had been before by Baltagi Mahomet. The historians of his
 party could find no other expedient to colour over this fresh affront,
 but that of accusing Jussuf of having been bribed like his predecessor.
 Such repeated imputations, unsupported by any proofs, are rather the
 clamours of an impotent cabal, than the testimonies of history; but
 faction, when driven to acknowledge facts, will ever be endeavouring to
 alter circumstances and motives; and, unhappily, it is thus that all the
 histories of our times will be handed down to posterity so altered, that
 they will be unable to distinguish truth from falsehoods.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XXII.
 
     Marriage of the czarowitz.--The marriage of Peter and Catherine
     publicly solemnized.--Catherine finds her brother.
 
 
 This unsuccessful campaign of Pruth proved more hurtful to the czar than
 ever the battle of Narva was; for after that defeat he had found means
 not only to retrieve his losses, but also to wrest Ingria out of the
 hands of Charles XII.; but by the treaty of Falksten, in which he
 consented to give up to the sultan his forts and harbours on the Palus
 Maeotis, he for ever lost his projected superiority in the Black Sea.
 He had besides an infinite deal of work on his hands; his new
 establishments in Russia were to be perfected, he had to prosecute his
 victories over the Swedes, to settle king Augustus firmly on the Polish
 throne, and to manage affairs properly with the several powers with whom
 he was in alliance; but the fatigues he had undergone having impaired
 his health, he was obliged to go to Carlsbad[90] to drink the waters of
 that place. While he was there he gave orders for his troops to enter
 Pomerania, who blockaded Stralsund, and took five other towns in the
 neighbourhood.
 
 Pomerania is the most northern province of Germany, bounded on the east
 by Prussia and Poland, on the west by Brandenburg, on the south by
 Mecklenburg, and on the north by the Baltic Sea. It has changed masters
 almost every century: Gustavus Adolphus got possession of it in his
 famous thirty years war, and it was afterwards solemnly ceded to the
 crown of Sweden by the treaty of Westphalia: with a reservation of the
 little bishopric of Camin, and a few other small towns lying in Upper
 Pomerania. The whole of this province properly belongs to the elector of
 Brandenburg, in virtue of a family compact made with the dukes of
 Pomerania, whose family being extinct in 1637, consequently by the laws
 of the empire the house of Brandenburg had an undoubted right to the
 succession; but necessity, the first of all laws, occasioned this family
 compact to be set aside by the treaty of Osnaburg; after which, almost
 the whole of Pomerania fell to the lot of the victorious Swedes.
 
 The czar's intention was to wrest from Sweden all the provinces that
 crown was possessed of in Germany; and, in order to accomplish his
 design, he found it necessary to enter into a confederacy with the
 electors of Hanover and Brandenburg, and the king of Denmark. Peter drew
 up the several articles of the treaty he projected with these powers,
 and also a complete plan of the necessary operations for rendering him
 master of Pomerania.
 
 In the meanwhile he went to Torgau, to be present at the nuptials of his
 son the czarowitz Alexis with the princess of Wolfenbuttel (Oct. 23,
 1711.), sister to the consort of Charles VI. emperor of Germany;
 nuptials which, in the end, proved fatal to his own peace of mind, and
 to the lives of the unfortunate pair.
 
 The czarowitz was born of the first marriage of Peter the Great to
 Eudocia Lapoukin, to whom he was espoused in 1689: she was at that time
 shut up in the monastery of Susdal; their son Alexis Petrowitz, who was
 born the 1st of March, 1690, was now in his twenty-second year: this
 prince was not then at all known in Europe; a minister, whose memoirs of
 the court of Russia have been printed, says in a letter he writes to his
 master, dated August 25, 1711, that 'this prince was tall and well made,
 resembled his father greatly, was of an excellent disposition, very
 pious, had read the Bible five times over, took great delight in the
 ancient Greek historians, appeared to have a very quick apprehension and
 understanding, was well acquainted with the mathematics, the art of war,
 navigation, and hydraulics; that he understood the German language, and
 was then learning the French, but that his father would never suffer him
 to go through a regular course of study.'
 
 This character is very different from that which the czar himself gives
 of his son some time afterwards, in which we shall see with how much
 grief he reproaches him with faults directly opposite to those good
 qualities, for which this minister seems so much to admire him.
 
 We must leave posterity, therefore, to determine between the testimony
 of a stranger, who may have formed too slight a judgment, and the
 declaration of a parent, who thought himself under a necessity of
 sacrificing the dictates of nature to the good of his people. If the
 minister was no better acquainted with the disposition of Alexis than he
 seems to have been with his outward form, his evidence will have but
 little weight; for he describes this prince as tall and well made,
 whereas the memoirs sent me from Petersburg say, that he was neither the
 one nor the other.
 
 His mother-in-law, Catherine, was not present at his nuptials; for
 though she was already looked upon as czarina, yet she had not been
 publicly acknowledged as such: and moreover, as she had only the title
 of highness given her at the czar's court, her rank was not sufficiently
 settled to admit of her signing the contract, or to appear at the
 ceremony in a station befitting the consort of Peter the Great. She
 therefore remained at Thorn in Polish Prussia. Soon after the nuptials
 were celebrated, the czar sent the new-married couple away to
 Wolfenbuttel (Jan. 9, 1712), and brought back the czarina to Petersburg
 with that dispatch and privacy which he observed in all his journies.
 
 Feb. 19, 1712.] Having now disposed of his son, he publicly solemnized
 his own nuptials with Catherine, which had been declared in private
 before. This ceremony was performed with as much magnificence as could
 be expected in a city but yet in its infancy, and from a revenue
 exhausted by the late destructive war against the Turks, and that which
 he was still engaged in against the king of Sweden. The czar gave orders
 for, and assisted himself in, all the preparations for the ceremony,
 according to the usual custom; and Catherine was now publicly declared
 czarina, in reward for having saved her husband and his whole army.
 
 The acclamations with which this declaration was received at Petersburg
 were sincere: the applauses which subjects confer on the actions of a
 despotic sovereign are generally suspected; but on this occasion they
 were confirmed by the united voice of all the thinking part of Europe,
 who beheld with pleasure, on the one hand, the heir of a vast monarchy
 with no other glory than that of his birth, married to a petty princess;
 and, on the other hand, a powerful conqueror, and a law-giver, publicly
 sharing his bed and his throne with a stranger and a captive, who had
 nothing to recommend her but her merit: and this approbation became more
 general as the minds of men grew more enlightened by that sound
 philosophy, which has made so great a progress in our understandings
 within these last forty years: a philosophy, equally sublime and
 discerning, which teaches us to pay only the exterior respect to
 greatness and authority, while we reserve our esteem and veneration for
 shining talents and meritorious services.
 
 And here I think myself under an obligation to relate what I have met
 touching this marriage in the dispatches of count Bassewitz, aulic
 counsellor at Vienna, and long time minister from Holstein at the court
 of Russia; a person of great merit, and whose memory is still held in
 the highest esteem in Germany. In some of his letters he speaks thus:
 'The czarina had not only been the main instrument of procuring the czar
 that reputation which he enjoyed, but was likewise essentially necessary
 in the preservation of his life. This prince was unhappily subject to
 violent convulsion fits, which were thought to be the effects of poison
 which had been given him while he was young. Catherine alone had found
 the secret of alleviating his sufferings by an unwearied assiduity and
 attention to whatever she thought would please him, and made it the
 whole study of her life to preserve a health so valuable to the kingdom
 and to herself, insomuch, that the czar finding he could not live
 without her, made her the companion of his throne and bed.' I here only
 repeat the express words of the writer himself.
 
 Fortune, which has furnished us with many extraordinary scenes in this
 part of the world, and who had raised Catherine from the lowest abyss of
 misery and distress to the pinnacle of human grandeur, wrought another
 extraordinary incident in her favour some few years after her marriage
 with the czar, and which I find thus related in a curious manuscript of
 a person who was at that time in the czar's service, and who speaks of
 it as a thing to which he was eye-witness.
 
 An envoy from king Augustus to the court of Peter the Great, being on
 his return home through Courland, and having put up at an inn by the
 way, heard the voice of a person who seemed in great distress, and whom
 the people of the house were treating in that insulting manner which is
 but too common on such occasions: the stranger, with a tone of
 resentment, made answer, that they would not dare to use him thus, if he
 could but once get to the speech of the czar, at whose court he had
 perhaps more powerful protectors than they imagined.
 
 The envoy, upon hearing this, had a curiosity to ask the man some
 questions, and, from certain answers he let fall, and a close
 examination of his face, he thought he found in him some resemblance of
 the empress Catherine; and, when he came to Dresden, he could not
 forbear writing to one of his friends at Petersburg concerning it. This
 letter, by accident, came to the czar's hands, who immediately sent an
 order to prince Repnin, then governor of Riga, to endeavour to find out
 the person mentioned in the letter. Prince Repnin immediately dispatched
 a messenger to Mittau, in Courland, who, on inquiry, found out the man,
 and learned that his name was Charles Scavronsky; that he was the son of
 a Lithuanian gentleman, who had been killed in the wars of Poland, and
 had left two children then in the cradle, a boy and a girl, who had
 neither of them received any other education than that which simple
 nature gives to those who are abandoned by the world. Scavronsky, who
 had been parted from his sister while they were both infants, knew
 nothing further of her than that she had been taken prisoner in
 Marienburg, in the year 1704, and supposed her to be still in the
 household of prince Menzikoff, where he imagined she might have made
 some little fortune.
 
 Prince Repnin, agreeable to the particular orders he had received from
 the czar, caused Scavronsky to be seized, and conducted to Riga, under
 pretence of some crime laid to his charge; and, to give a better colour
 to the matter, at his arrival there, a sham information was drawn up
 against him, and he was soon after sent from thence to Petersburg, under
 a strong guard, with orders to treat him well upon the road.
 
 When he came to that capital, he was carried to the house of an officer
 of the emperor's palace, named Shepleff, who, having been previously
 instructed in the part he was to play, drew several circumstances from
 the young man in relation to his condition; and, after some time, told
 him, that although the information, which had been sent up from Riga
 against him, was of a very serious nature, yet he would have justice
 done him; but that it would be necessary to present a petition to his
 majesty for that purpose; that one should accordingly be drawn up in his
 name, and that he (Shepleff) would find means that he should deliver it
 into the czar's own hands.
 
 The next day the czar came to dine with Shepleff, at his own house, who
 presented Scavronsky to him; when his majesty, after asking him
 abundance of questions was convinced, by the natural answers he gave,
 that he was really the czarina's brother; they had both lived in
 Livonia, when young, and the czar found every thing that Scavronsky said
 to him, in relation to his family affairs, tally exactly with what his
 wife had told him concerning her brother, and the misfortunes which had
 befallen her and her brother in the earlier part of their lives.
 
 The czar, now satisfied of the truth, proposed the next day to the
 empress to go and dine with him at Shepleff's; and, when dinner was
 over, he gave orders that the man, whom he had examined the day before,
 should be brought in again. Accordingly he was introduced, dressed in
 the same clothes he had wore while on his journey to Riga; the czar not
 being willing that he should appear in any other garb than what his
 unhappy circumstances had accustomed him to.
 
 He interrogated him again, in the presence of his wife; and the MS.
 adds, that, at the end, he turned about to the empress, and said these
 very words:--'This man is your brother; come hither, Charles, and kiss
 the hand of the empress, and embrace your sister.'
 
 The author of this narrative adds further, that the empress fainted away
 with surprise; and that, when she came to herself again, the czar said,
 'There is nothing in this but what is very natural. This gentlemen is my
 brother in-law; if he has merit, we will make something of him; if he
 has not, we must leave him as he is.'
 
 I am of opinion, that this speech shews as much greatness as simplicity,
 and a greatness not very common. My author says, that Scavronsky
 remained a considerable time at Shepleff's house; that the czar assigned
 him a handsome pension, but that he led a very retired life. He carries
 his relation of this adventure no farther, as he made use of it only to
 disclose the secret of Catherine's brother: but we know, from other
 authorities, that this gentleman was afterwards created a count; that he
 married a young lady of quality, by whom he had two daughters, who were
 married to two of the principal noblemen in Russia. I leave to those,
 who may be better informed of the particulars, to distinguish what is
 fact in this relation, from what may have been added; and shall only
 say, that the author does not seem to have told this story out of a
 fondness for entertaining his readers with the marvellous, since his
 papers were not intended to be published. He is writing freely to a
 friend, about a thing of which he says he was an eye-witness. He may
 have been mistaken in some circumstances, but the fact itself has all
 the appearance of truth; for if this gentleman had known that his sister
 was raised to so great dignity and power, he would not certainly have
 remained so many years without having made himself known to her. And
 this discovery, however extraordinary it may seem, is certainly not more
 so than the exaltation of Catherine herself; and both the one and the
 other are striking proofs of the force of destiny, and may teach us to
 be cautious how we treat as fabulous several events of antiquity, which
 perhaps are less contradictory to the common order of things, than the
 adventures of this empress.
 
 The rejoicings made by the czar Peter for his own marriage, and that of
 his son, were not of the nature of those transient amusements which
 exhaust the public treasure, and are presently lost in oblivion. He
 completed his grand foundry for cannon, and finished the admiralty
 buildings. The highways were repaired, several ships built, and others
 put upon the stocks; new canals were dug, and the finishing hand put to
 the grand warehouses, and other public buildings, and the trade of
 Petersburg began to assume a flourishing face. He issued an ordinance
 for removing the senate from Moscow to Petersburg, which was executed in
 the month of April, 1712. By this step he made his new city the capital
 of the empire, and early he employed a number of Swedish prisoners in
 beautifying this city, whose foundation had been laid upon their defeat.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XXIII.
 
     Taking of Stetin.--Descent upon Finland.--Event of the year 1712.
 
 
 Peter, now seeing himself happy in his own family, and in his state, and
 successful in his war against Charles XII. and in the several
 negotiations which he had entered into with other powers, who were
 resolved to assist him in driving out the Swedes from the continent, and
 cooping them up for ever within the narrow isthmus of Scandinavia, began
 to turn his views entirely towards the north-west coasts of Europe, not
 laying aside all thoughts of the Palus Maeotis, or Black Sea. The keys of
 Azoph, which had been so long withheld from the basha, who was to have
 taken possession of that place for the sultan, his master, were now
 given up; and, notwithstanding all the endeavours of the king of Sweden,
 the intrigues of his friends at the Ottoman Porte, and even some menaces
 of a new war on the part of the Turks, both that nation and the Russian
 empire continued at peace.
 
 Charles XII. still obstinate in his resolution not to depart from
 Bender, tamely submitted his hopes and fortunes to the caprice of a
 grand vizier; while the czar was threatening all his provinces, arming
 against him the king of Denmark, and the elector of Hanover, and had
 almost persuaded the king of Prussia, and even the Poles and Saxons, to
 declare openly for him.
 
 Charles, ever of the same inflexible disposition, behaved in the like
 manner towards his enemies, who now seemed united to overwhelm him, as
 he had done in all his transactions with the Ottoman Porte; and, from
 his lurking-place in the deserts of Bessarabia, defied the czar, the
 kings of Poland, Denmark, and Prussia, the elector of Hanover (soon
 afterwards king of England), and the emperor of Germany, whom he had so
 greatly offended, when he was traversing Silesia with his victorious
 troops, and who now shewed his resentment, by abandoning him to his ill
 fortune, and refused to take under his protection any of those
 countries, which as yet belonged to the Swedes in Germany.
 
 1712.] It would have been no difficult matter for him to have broken the
 league which was forming against him, would he have consented to cede
 Stetin, in Pomerania, to Frederick (the first) king of Prussia, and
 elector of Brandenburg, who had a lawful claim thereto; but Charles did
 not then look upon Prussia as a power of any consequence: and indeed
 neither he, nor any other person, could at that time foresee, that this
 petty kingdom, and the electorate of Brandenburg, either of which were
 little better than deserts, would one day become formidable. Charles
 therefore would not listen to any proposal of accommodation, but
 determined rather to stake all than to give up any thing, sent orders to
 the regency of Stockholm, to make all possible resistance, both by sea
 and land: and these orders were obeyed, notwithstanding that his
 dominions were almost exhausted of men and money. The senate of
 Stockholm fitted out a fleet of thirteen ships of the line, and every
 person capable of bearing arms came voluntarily to offer their service:
 in a word, the inflexible courage and pride of Charles seemed to be
 infused into all his subjects, who were almost as unfortunate as their
 master.
 
 It can hardly be supposed, that Charles's conduct was formed upon any
 regular plan. He had still a powerful party in Poland, which assisted by
 the Crim Tartars, might indeed have desolated that wretched country, but
 could not have replaced Stanislaus on the throne; and his hope of
 engaging the Ottoman Porte to espouse his cause, or convincing the divan
 that it was their interest to send ten or twelve thousand men to the
 assistance of his friends, under pretence that the czar was supporting
 his ally, Augustus, in Poland, was vain and chimerical.
 
 Sep. 1712.] Nevertheless, he continued still at Bender, to wait the
 issue of these vain projects, while the Russians, Danes, and Saxons,
 were overrunning Pomerania. Peter took his wife with him on this
 expedition. The king of Denmark had already made himself master of
 Stade, a sea-port town in the duchy of Bremen, and the united forces of
 Russia, Saxony, and Denmark, were already before Stralsund.
 
 Oct. 1712.] And now king Stanislaus, seeing the deplorable state of so
 many provinces, the impossibility of his recovering the crown of Poland,
 and the universal confusion occasioned by the inflexibility of Charles,
 called a meeting of the Swedish generals, who were covering Pomerania
 with an army of eleven thousand men, as the last resource they had left
 in those provinces.
 
 When they were assembled, he proposed to them to make their terms with
 king Augustus, offering himself to be the victim of this reconciliation.
 On this occasion, he made the following speech to them, in the French
 language, which he afterwards left in writing, and which was signed by
 nine general officers, amongst whom happened to be one Patkul,
 cousin-german to the unfortunate Patkul, who lost his life on the wheel,
 by the order of Charles XII.
 
 'Having been hitherto the instrument of procuring glory to the Swedish
 arms, I cannot think of proving the cause of their ruin. I therefore
 declare myself ready to sacrifice the crown, and my personal interests,
 to the preservation of the sacred person of their king, as I can see no
 other method of releasing him from the place where he now is.'
 
 Having made this declaration (which is here given in his own words), he
 prepared to set out for Turkey, in hopes of being able to soften the
 inflexible temper of his benefactor, by the sacrifice he had made for
 him. His ill fortune would have it, that he arrived in Bessarabia at the
 very time that Charles, after having given his word to the sultan, that
 he would depart from Bender, and having received the necessary
 remittances for his journey, and an escort for his person, took the mad
 resolution to continue there, and opposed a whole army of Turks and
 Tartars, with only his own domestics. The former, though they might
 easily have killed him, contented themselves with taking him prisoner.
 At this very juncture, Stanislaus arriving, was seized himself; so that
 two Christian kings were prisoners at one time in Turkey.
 
 At this time, when all Europe was in commotion, and that France had just
 terminated a war equally fatal against one part thereof, in order to
 settle the grandson of Lewis XIV. on the throne of Spain, England gave
 peace to France, and the victory gained by Marshal Villars at Denain in
 Flanders, saved that state from its other enemies. France had been, for
 upwards of a century, the ally of Sweden, and it was the interest of the
 former, that its ally should not be stript of his possessions in
 Germany. Charles, unhappily, was at such a distance from his dominions,
 that he did not even know what was transacting in France.
 
 The regency of Stockholm, by a desperate effort, ventured to demand a
 sum of money from the French court, at a time when its finances were at
 so low an ebb, that Lewis XIV. had hardly money enough to pay his
 household servants. Count Sparre was sent with a commission to
 negotiate this loan, in which it was not to be supposed he would
 succeed. However, on his arrival at Versailles, he represented to the
 marquis de Torci the inability of the regency to pay the little army
 which Charles had still remaining in Pomerania, and which was ready to
 break up and dispute of itself on account of the long arrears due to the
 men; and that France was on the point of beholding the only ally she had
 left, deprived of those provinces which were so necessary to preserve
 the balance of power; that indeed his master, Charles, had not been
 altogether so attentive to the interests of France in the course of his
 conquests as might have been expected, but that the magnanimity of Lewis
 XIV. was at least equal to the misfortunes of his royal brother and
 ally. The French minister, in answer to this speech, so effectually set
 forth the incapacity of his court to furnish the requested succours,
 that count Sparre despaired of success.
 
 It so happened, however, that a private individual did that which Sparre
 had lost all hopes of obtaining. There was at that time in Paris, a
 banker, named Samuel Bernard, who had accumulated an immense fortune by
 making remittances for the government to foreign countries, and other
 private contracts. This man was intoxicated with a species of pride very
 rarely to be met with from people of his profession. He was immoderately
 fond of every thing that made an eclat, and knew very well, that one
 time or another the government would repay with interest those who
 hazarded their fortune to supply its exigencies. Count Sparre went one
 day to dine with him, and took care to flatter his foible so well, that
 before they rose from table the banker put six hundred thousand
 livres[91] into his hand; and then immediately waiting on the marquis
 de Torci, he said to him--'I have lent the crown of Sweden six hundred
 thousand livres in your name, which you must repay me when you are
 able.'
 
 Count Steinbock, who at that time commanded Charles's army in Pomerania,
 little expected so seasonable a supply; and seeing his troops ready to
 mutiny, to whom he had nothing to give but promises, and that the storm
 was gathering fast upon him, and being, moreover, apprehensive of being
 surrounded by the three different armies of Russia, Denmark, and Saxony,
 desired a cessation of arms, on the supposition that Stanislaus'
 abdication would soften the obstinacy of Charles, and that the only way
 left him to save the forces under his command, was by spinning out the
 time in negotiations. He therefore dispatched a courier to Bender, to
 represent to the king of Sweden the desperate state of his finances and
 affairs, and the situation of the army, and to acquaint him that he had
 under these circumstances, found himself necessitated to apply for a
 cessation of arms, which he should think himself very happy to obtain.
 The courier had not been dispatched above three days, and Stanislaus was
 not yet set out on his journey to Bender, when Steinbock received the
 six hundred thousand livres from the French banker above-mentioned; a
 sum, which was at that time an immense treasure in a country so
 desolated. Thus unexpectedly reinforced with money, which is the grand
 panacea for all disorders of state, Steinbock found means to revive the
 drooping spirits of his soldiery; he supplied them with all they wanted,
 raised new recruits, and in a short time saw himself at the head of
 twelve thousand men, and dropping his former intention of procuring a
 suspension of arms, he sought only for an opportunity of engaging the
 enemy.
 
 This was the same Steinbock, who in the year 1710, after the defeat of
 Pultowa, had revenged the Swedes on the Danes by the eruption he made
 into Scania, where he marched against and engaged them with only a few
 militia, whom he had hastily gathered together, with their arms slung
 round them with ropes, and totally defeated the enemy. He was, like all
 the other generals of Charles XII. active and enterprising; but his
 valour was sullied by his brutality: as an instance of which, it will be
 sufficient to relate, that having, after an engagement with the
 Russians, given orders to kill all the prisoners, and perceiving a
 Polish officer in the service of the czar, who had caught hold on king
 Stanislaus' stirrup, then on horseback, in order to save his life, he,
 Steinbock, shot him dead with his pistol in that prince's arms, as has
 been already mentioned in the life of Charles XII. and king Stanislaus
 has declared to the author of this History, that had he not been
 withheld by his respect and gratitude to the king of Sweden, he should
 immediately have shot Steinbock dead upon the spot.
 
 Dec. 9, 1712.] General Steinbock now marched by the way of Wismar to
 meet the combined forces of the Russians, Danes, and Saxons, and soon
 found himself near the Danish and Saxon army, which was advanced before
 that of the Russians about the distance of three leagues. The czar sent
 three couriers, one after another, to the king of Denmark, beseeching
 him to wait his coming up, and thereby avoid the danger which threatened
 him, if he attempted to engage the Swedes with an equality of force; but
 the Danish monarch, not willing to share with any one the honour of a
 victory which he thought sure, advanced to meet the Swedish general,
 whom he attacked near a place called Gadebusch. This day's affair gave a
 further proof of the natural enmity that subsisted between the Swedes
 and Danes. The officers of these two nations fought with most
 unparalleled inveteracy against each other, and neither side would
 desist till death terminated the dispute.
 
 Steinbock gained a complete victory before the Russian army could come
 up to the assistance of the Danes, and the next day received an order
 from his master, Charles, to lay aside all thoughts of a suspension of
 arms, who, at the same time, upbraided him for having entertained an
 idea so injurious to his honour, and for which he told him he could make
 no reparation, but by conquering or perishing. Steinbock had happily
 obviated the orders and the reproach by the victory he had gained.
 
 But this victory was like that which had formerly brought such a
 transient consolation to king Augustus, when in the torrent of his
 misfortunes he gained the battle of Calish against the Swedes, who were
 conquerors in every other place, and which only served to aggravate his
 situation, as this of Gadebusch only procrastinated the ruin of
 Steinbock and his army.
 
 When the king of Sweden received the news of Steinbock's success, he
 looked upon his affairs as retrieved, and even flattered himself with
 hopes to engage the Ottoman Porte to declare for him, who at that time
 seemed disposed to come to a new rupture with the czar: full of these
 fond imaginations, he sent orders to general Steinbock to fall upon
 Poland, being still ready to believe, upon the least shadow of success,
 that the day of Narva, and those in which he gave laws to his enemies,
 were again returned. But unhappily he too soon found these flattering
 hopes utterly blasted by the affair of Bender, and his own captivity
 amongst the Turks.
 
 The whole fruits of the victory at Gadebusch were confined to the
 surprising in the night-time, and reducing to ashes, the town of Altena,
 inhabited by traders and manufacturers, a place wholly defenceless, and
 which, not having been in arms, ought, by all the laws of war and
 nations, to have been spared; however, it was utterly destroyed, several
 of the inhabitants perished in the flames, others escaped with their
 lives, but naked, and a number of old men, women, and children, perished
 with the cold and fatigue they suffered, at the gates of Hamburg. Such
 has too often been the fate of several thousands of men for the quarrels
 of two only; and this cruel advantage was the only one gained by
 Steinbock; for the Russians, Danes, and Saxons pursued him so closely,
 that he was obliged to beg for an asylum in Toningen, a fortress in the
 duchy of Holstein, for himself and army.
 
 This duchy was at that time subjected to the most cruel ravages of any
 part of the North, and its sovereign was the most miserable of all
 princes. He was nephew to Charles XII. and it was on his father's
 account, who had married Charles's sister, that that monarch carried his
 arms even into the heart of Copenhagen, before the battle of Narva, and
 for whom he likewise made the treaty of Travendahl, by which the dukes
 of Holstein were restored to their rights.
 
 This country was in part the cradle of the Cimbri, and of the old
 Normans, who overrun the province of Neustria, in France, and conquered
 all England, Naples, and Sicily; and yet, at this present time, no
 state pretends less to make conquests than this part of the ancient
 Cimbrica Chersonesus, which consists only of two petty duchies; namely,
 that of Sleswic, belonging in common to the king of Denmark and the duke
 of Holstein, and that of Gottorp, appertaining to the duke alone.
 Sleswic is a sovereign principality; Holstein is a branch of the German
 empire, called the Roman empire.
 
 The king of Denmark, and the duke of Holstein-Gottorp, were of the same
 family; but the duke, nephew to Charles XII. and presumptive heir to his
 crown, was the natural enemy of the king of Denmark, who had endeavoured
 to crush him in the very cradle. One of his father's brothers, who was
 bishop of Lubec, and administrator of the dominions of his unfortunate
 ward, now beheld himself in the midst of the Swedish army, whom he durst
 not succour, and those of Russia, Denmark, and Saxony, that threatened
 his country with daily destruction. Nevertheless, he thought himself
 obliged to try to save Charles's army, if he could do it without
 irritating the king of Denmark, who had made himself master of his
 country, which he exhausted, by raising continual contributions.
 
 This bishop and administrator was entirely governed by the famous baron
 Gortz, the most artful and enterprising man of his age, endowed with a
 genius amazingly penetrating, and fruitful in every resource: with
 talents equal to the boldest and most arduous attempts; he was as
 insinuating in his negotiations as he was hardy in his projects; he had
 the art of pleasing and persuading in the highest degree, and knew how
 to captivate all hearts by the vivacity of his genius, after he had won
 them by the softness of his eloquence. He afterwards gained the same
 ascendant over Charles XII. which he had then over the bishop; and all
 the world knows, that he paid with his life the honour he had of
 governing the most ungovernable and obstinate prince that ever sat upon
 a throne.
 
 Gortz had a private conference with general Steinbock,[92] at which he
 promised to deliver him up the fortress of Toningen,[93] without
 exposing the bishop administrator, his master, to any danger: and, at
 the same time, gave the strongest assurances to the king of Denmark,
 that he would defend the place to the uttermost. In this manner are
 almost all negotiations carried on, affairs of state being of a very
 different nature from those of private persons; the honour of ministers
 consisting wholly in success, and those of private persons in the
 observance of their promises.
 
 General Steinbock presented himself before Toningen: the commandant
 refused to open the gates to him, and by this means put it out of the
 king of Denmark's power to allege any cause of complaint against the
 bishop administrator; but Gortz causes an order to be given in the name
 of the young duke, a minor, to suffer the Swedish army to enter the
 town. The secretary of the cabinet, named Stamke, signs this order in
 the name of the duke of Holstein: by this means Gortz preserves the
 honour of an infant who had not as yet any power to issue orders; and he
 at once serves the king of Sweden, to whom he was desirous to make his
 court, and the bishop administrator his master, who appeared not to have
 consented to the admission of the Swedish troops. The governor of
 Toningen, who was easily gained, delivered up the town to the Swedes,
 and Gortz excused himself as well as he could to the king of Denmark, by
 protesting that the whole had been transacted without his consent.
 
 The Swedes retired partly within the walls, and partly under the cannon
 of the town: but this did not save them: for general Steinbock was
 obliged to surrender himself prisoner of war, together with his whole
 army, to the number of eleven thousand men, in the same manner as about
 sixteen thousand of their countrymen had done at the battle of Pultowa.
 
 By this convention it was agreed, that Steinbock with his officers and
 men might be ransomed or exchanged. The price for the general's ransom
 was fixed at eight thousand German crowns;[94] a very trifling sum, but
 which Steinbock however was not able to raise; so that he remained a
 prisoner in Copenhagen till the day of his death.
 
 The territories of Holstein now remained at the mercy of the incensed
 conqueror. The young duke became the object of the king of Denmark's
 vengeance, and was fated to pay for the abuse which Gortz had made of
 his name: thus did the ill fortune of Charles XII. fall upon all his
 family.
 
 Gortz perceiving his projects thus dissipated, and being still resolved
 to act a distinguished part in the general confusion of affairs,
 recalled to mind a scheme which he had formed to establish a neutrality
 in the Swedish territories in Germany.
 
 The king of Denmark was ready to take possession of Toningen; George,
 elector of Hanover, was about to seize Bremen and Verden, with the city
 of Stade; the new-made king of Prussia, Frederick William, cast his
 views upon Stetin, and czar Peter was preparing to make himself master
 of Finland; and all the territories of Charles XII. those of Sweden
 excepted, were going to become the spoils of those who wanted to share
 them. How then could so many different interests be rendered compatible
 with a neutrality? Gortz entered into negotiation at one and the same
 time with all the several princes who had any views in this partition;
 he continued night and day passing from one province to the other; he
 engaged the governor of Bremen and Verden to put those two duchies into
 the hands of the elector of Hanover by way of sequestration, so that the
 Danes should not take possession of them for themselves: he prevailed
 with the king of Prussia to accept jointly with the duke of Holstein, of
 the sequestration of Stetin and Wismar, in consideration of which, the
 king of Denmark was to act nothing against Holstein, and was not to
 enter Toningen. It was most certainly a strange way of serving Charles
 XII. to put his towns into the hands of those who might choose if they
 would ever restore them; but Gortz, by delivering these places to them
 as pledges, bound them to a neutrality, at least for some time; and he
 was in hopes to be able afterwards to bring Hanover and Brandenburg to
 declare for Sweden: he prevailed on the king of Prussia whose ruined
 dominions stood in need of peace, to enter into his views, and in short
 he found means to render himself necessary to all these princes, and
 disposed of the possessions of Charles XII. like a guardian, who gives
 up one part of his ward's estate to preserve the other, and of a ward
 incapable of managing his affairs himself; and all this without any
 regular authority or commission, or other warrant for his conduct, than
 full powers given him by the bishop of Lubec, who had no authority to
 grant such powers from Charles himself.
 
 Such was the baron de Gortz, and such his actions, which have not
 hitherto been sufficiently known. There have been instances of an
 Oxenstiern, a Richlieu, and an Alberoni, influencing the affairs of all
 parts of Europe; but that the privy counsellor of a bishop of Lubec
 should do the same as they, without his conduct being avowed by any one,
 is a thing hitherto unheard of.
 
 June, 1713.] Nevertheless he succeeded to his wishes in the beginning;
 for he made a treaty with the king of Prussia, by which that monarch
 engaged, on condition of keeping Stetin in sequestration, to preserve
 the rest of Pomerania for Charles XII. In virtue of this treaty, Gortz
 made a proposal to the governor of Pomerania, Meyerfeld, to give up the
 fortress of Stetin to the king of Prussia for the sake of peace,
 thinking that the Swedish governor of Stetin would prove as easy to be
 persuaded as the Holsteiner who had the command of Toningen; but the
 officers of Charles XII. were not accustomed to obey such orders.
 Meyerfeld made answer, that no one should enter Stetin but over his dead
 body and the ruins of the place, and immediately sent notice to his
 master of the strange proposal. The messenger at his arrival found
 Charles prisoner at Demirtash, in consequence of his adventure at
 Bender, and it was doubtful, at that time, whether he would not remain
 all his life in confinement in Turkey, or else be banished to some of
 the islands in the Archipelago, or some part of Asia under the dominion
 of the Ottoman Porte. However Charles from his prison sent the same
 orders to Meyerfeld, as he had before done to Steinbock; namely, rather
 to perish than to submit to his enemies, and even commanded him to take
 his inflexibility for his example.
 
 Gortz, finding that the governor of Stetin had broke in upon his
 measures, and would neither hearken to a neutrality nor a sequestration,
 took it into his head, not only to sequester the town of Stetin of his
 own authority, but also the city of Stralsund, and found means to make
 the same kind of treaty (June, 1713,) with the king of Poland, elector
 of Saxony, for that place, which he had done with the elector of
 Brandenburg for Stetin. He clearly saw how impossible it would be for
 the Swedes to keep possession of those places without either men or
 money, while their king was a captive in Turkey, and he thought himself
 sure of turning aside the scourge of war from the North by means of
 these sequestrations. The king of Denmark himself at length gave into
 the projects of Gortz: the latter had gained an entire ascendant over
 prince Menzikoff, the czar's general and favourite, whom he had
 persuaded that the duchy of Holstein must be ceded to his master, and
 flattered the czar with the prospect of opening a canal from Holstein
 into the Baltic Sea; an enterprise perfectly conformable to the
 inclination and views of this royal founder: and, above all, he laboured
 to insinuate to him, that he might obtain a new increase of power, by
 condescending to become one of the powers of the empire, which would
 entitle him to a vote in the diet of Ratisbon, a right that he might
 afterwards for ever maintain by that of arms.
 
 In a word, no one could put on more different appearances, adapt himself
 to more opposite interests, or act a more complicated part, than did
 this skilful negotiator; he even went so far as to engage prince
 Menzikoff to ruin the very town of Stetin, which he was endeavouring to
 save; and in which, at length, to his misfortune, he succeeded but too
 well.
 
 When the king of Prussia saw a Russian army before Stetin, he found that
 place would be lost to him, and remain in the possession of the czar.
 This was just what Gortz expected and waited for. Prince Menzikoff was
 in want of money; Gortz got the king of Prussia to lend him four hundred
 thousand crowns: he afterwards sent a message to the governor of the
 place, to know of him--whether he would rather choose to see Stetin in
 ashes, and under the dominion of Russia, or to trust it in the hands of
 the king of Prussia, who would engage to restore it to the king, his
 master?--The commandant at length suffered himself to be persuaded, and
 gave up the place, which Menzikoff entered; and, in consideration of the
 four hundred thousand crowns, delivered it afterwards, together with all
 the territories thereto adjoining, into the hands of the king of
 Prussia, who, for form's sake, left therein two battalions of the troops
 of Holstein, and has never since restored that part of Pomerania.
 
 From this period, the second king of Prussia, successor to a weak and
 prodigal father, laid the foundation of that greatness, to which his
 state has since arrived by military discipline and economy.
 
 The baron de Gortz, who put so many springs in motion, could not,
 however, succeed in prevailing on the Danes to spare the duchy of
 Holstein, or forbear taking possession of Toningen. He failed in what
 appeared to have been his first object, though he succeeded in all his
 other views, and particularly in that of making himself the most
 important personage of the North, which, indeed, was his principal
 object.
 
 The elector of Hanover then had secured to himself Bremen and Verden, of
 which Charles XII. was now stripped. The Saxon army was before Wismar
 (Sept. 1715); Stetin was in the hands of the king of Prussia; the
 Russians were ready to lay siege to Stralsund, in conjunction with the
 Saxons; and these latter had already landed in the island of Rugen, and
 the czar, in the midst of the numberless negotiations on all sides,
 while others were disputing about neutralities and partitions, makes a
 descent upon Finland. After having himself pointed the artillery against
 Stralsund, he left the rest to the care of his allies and prince
 Menzikoff, and, embarking in the month of May, on the Baltic Sea, on
 board a ship of fifty guns, which he himself caused to be built at
 Petersburg, he sailed for the coast of Finland, followed by a fleet of
 ninety-two whole, and one hundred and ten half-gallies, having on board
 near sixteen thousand troops. He made his descent at Elsingford, (May
 22. N. S. 1713.) the most southern part of that cold and barren country,
 lying in 61 degrees north latitude; and, notwithstanding the numberless
 difficulties he had to encounter, succeeded in his design. He caused a
 feint attack to be made on one side of the harbour, while he landed his
 troops on the other, and took possession of the town. He then made
 himself master of Abo, Borgo, and the whole coast. The Swedes now seemed
 not to have one resource left; for it was at this very time, that their
 army, under the command of general Steinbock, was obliged to surrender
 prisoners of war at Toningen.
 
 These repeated disasters which befel Charles, were, as we have already
 shewn, followed by the loss of Bremen, Verden, Stetin, and a part of
 Pomerania; and that prince himself, with his ally and friend,
 Stanislaus, were afterwards both prisoners in Turkey: nevertheless, he
 was not to be undeceived in the flattering notion he had entertained of
 returning to Poland, at the head of an Ottoman army, replacing
 Stanislaus on the throne, and once again making his enemies tremble.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XXIV.
 
     Successes of Peter the Great.--Return of Charles XII. into his own
     dominions.
 
 
 [Sidenote: 1713.]
 
 Peter, while he was following the course of his conquests, completed the
 establishment of his navy, brought twelve thousand families to settle in
 Petersburg, kept all his allies firm to his person and fortunes, not
 withstanding they had all different interests and opposite views; and
 with his fleet kept in awe all the sea-ports of Sweden, on the gulfs of
 Finland and Bothnia.
 
 Prince Galitzin, one of his land-generals, whom he had formed himself,
 as he had done all his other officers, advanced from Elsingford, where
 the czar had made his descent, into the midst of the country, near the
 village of Tavasthus, which was a post that commanded the gulf of
 Bothnia, and was defended by a few Swedish regiments, and about eight
 thousand militia. In this situation, a battle was unavoidable, (Mar. 13,
 1714.) the event of which proved favourable to the Russians, who
 entirely routed the whole Swedish army, and penetrated as far as Vaza,
 so that they were now masters of about eighty leagues of country.
 
 The Swedes were still in possession of a fleet, with which they kept the
 sea. Peter had, for a considerable time, waited with impatience for an
 opportunity of establishing the reputation of his new marine.
 Accordingly he set out from Petersburg, and having got together a fleet
 of sixteen ships of the line, and one hundred and eighty galleys, fit
 for working among the rocks and shoals that surround the island of
 Aland, and the other islands in the Baltic Sea, bordering upon the
 Swedish coast, he fell in with the fleet of that nation near their own
 shores. This armament greatly exceeded his in the largeness of the
 ships, but was inferior in the number of galleys, and more proper for
 engaging in the open sea, than among rocks, or near the shore. The
 advantage the czar had in this respect was entirely owing to himself: he
 served in the rank of rear-admiral on board his own fleet, and received
 all the necessary orders from admiral Apraxin. Peter resolved to make
 himself master of the island of Aland, which lies only twelve leagues
 off the Swedish coast; and, though obliged to pass full in view of the
 enemy's fleet, he effected this bold and hazardous enterprise. His
 galleys forced a passage through the enemy, whose cannon did not fire
 low enough to hurt them, and entered Aland; but as that coast is almost
 surrounded with rocks, the czar caused eighty small galleys to be
 transported by men over a point of land, and launched into the sea, at a
 place called Hango, where his large ships were at anchor. Erenschild,
 the Swedish rear-admiral, thinking that he might easily take or sink all
 these galleys, stood in shore, in order to reconnoitre their situation,
 but was received with so brisk a fire from the Russian fleet, that most
 of his men were killed or wounded; and all the galleys and praams he had
 brought with him were taken, together with his own ship. (Aug. 8.) The
 admiral himself endeavoured to escape in a boat, but being wounded, was
 obliged to surrender himself prisoner, and was brought on board the
 galley where the czar was, navigating it himself. The scattered remains
 of the Swedish fleet made the best of their way home; and the news of
 this accident threw all Stockholm into confusion, which now began to
 tremble for its own safety.
 
 Much about the same time, colonel Scouvalow Neuschlof attacked the only
 remaining fortress on the western side of Finland, and made himself
 master of it, after a most obstinate resistance on the part of the
 besieged.
 
 This affair of Aland was, next to that of Pultowa, the most glorious
 that had ever befallen the arms of Peter the Great, who now saw himself
 master of Finland, the government of which he committed to prince
 Galitzin, and returned to Petersburg (Sept. 15.), victorious over the
 whole naval force of Sweden, and more than ever respected by his allies;
 the stormy season now approaching, not permitting him to remain longer
 with his ships in the Finlandish and Bothnic seas. His good fortune also
 brought him back to his capital, just as the czarina was brought to bed
 of a princess, who died, however, about a year afterwards. He then
 instituted the order of St. Catherine, in honour of his consort,[95] and
 celebrated the birth of his daughter by a triumphal entry, which was of
 all the festivals to which he had accustomed his subjects, that which
 they held in the greatest esteem. This ceremony was ushered in by
 bringing nine Swedish galleys, and seven praams filled with prisoners,
 and rear-admiral Erenschild's own ship, into the harbour of Cronstadt.
 
 The cannon, colours, and standards, taken in the expedition to Finland,
 and which had come home in the Russian admiral's ship, were brought on
 this occasion to Petersburg, and entered that metropolis in order of
 battle. A triumphal arch, which the czar had caused to be erected, and
 which, as usual, was made from a model of his own, was decorated with
 the insignia of his conquests. Under this arch the victors marched in
 procession, with admiral Apraxin, at their head; then followed the czar
 in quality of rear-admiral, and the other officers according to their
 several ranks. They were all presented one after another to the
 vice-admiral Rodamonoski, who, at this ceremony represented the
 sovereign. This temporary vice-emperor distributed gold medals amongst
 all the officers, and others of silver to the soldiers and sailors. The
 Swedish prisoners likewise passed under the triumphal arch, and admiral
 Erenschild followed immediately after the czar, his conqueror. When they
 came to the place where the vice-czar was seated on his throne, admiral
 Apraxin presented to him rear-admiral Peter, who demanded to be made
 vice-admiral, in reward for his services. It was then put to the vote,
 if his request should be granted; and it may easily be conceived that he
 had the majority on his side.
 
 After this ceremony was over, which filled every heart with joy, and
 inspired every mind with emulation, with a love for his country, and a
 thirst of fame, the czar made the following speech to those present: a
 speech which deserves to be transmitted to the latest posterity.
 
 'Countrymen and friends! what man is there among you, who could have
 thought, twenty years ago, that we should one day fight together on the
 Baltic Sea, in ships built by our own hands; and that we should
 establish settlements in countries conquered by our own labours and
 valour?--Greece is said to have been the ancient seat of the arts and
 sciences: they afterwards took up their abode in Italy, from whence they
 spread themselves through every part of Europe. It is now our turn to
 call them ours, if you will second my designs, by joining study to
 obedience. The arts circulate in this globe, as the blood does in the
 human body; and perhaps they may establish their empire amongst us, on
 their return back to Greece, their mother country; and I even venture to
 hope, that we may one day put the most civilized nations to the blush,
 by our noble labours and the solid glory resulting therefrom.'
 
 Here is the true substance of this speech, so every way worthy of a
 great founder, and which has lost its chief beauties in this, and every
 other translation; but the principal merit of this eloquent harangue is,
 its having been spoken by a victorious monarch, at once the founder and
 lawgiver of his empire.
 
 The old boyards listened to this speech with greater regret for the
 abolition of their ancient customs, than admiration of their master's
 glory; but the young ones could not hear him without tears of joy.
 
 The splendour of these times were further heightened by the return of
 the Russian ambassadors from Constantinople, (Sept. 15, 1714.) with a
 confirmation of the peace with the Turks: an ambassador sent by Sha
 Hussein from Persia, had arrived some time before with a present to the
 czar of an elephant and five lions. He received, at the same time, an
 ambassador from Mahomet Babadir, khan of the Usbeck Tartars, requesting
 his protection against another tribe of Tartars; so that both
 extremities of Asia and Europe seemed to join to offer him homage, and
 add to his glory.
 
 The regency of Stockholm, driven to despair by the desperate situation
 of their affairs, and the absence of their sovereign, who seemed to have
 abandoned his dominions, had come to a resolution no more to consult him
 in relation to their proceedings; and, immediately after the victory the
 czar gained over their navy, they sent to the conqueror to demand a
 passport, for an officer charged with proposals of peace. The passport
 was sent; but, just as the person appointed to carry on the negotiation
 was on the point of setting out, the princess Ulrica Eleonora, sister to
 Charles XII. received advice from the king her brother, that he was
 preparing, at length, to quit Turkey, and return home to fight his own
 battles. Upon this news the regency did not dare to send the negotiator
 (whom they had already privately named) to the czar; and, therefore,
 resolved to support their ill-fortune till the arrival of Charles to
 retrieve it.
 
 In effect, Charles, after a stay of five years and some months in
 Turkey, set out from that kingdom in the latter end of October, 1714.
 Every one knows that he observed the same singularity in his journey,
 which characterized all the actions of his life. He arrived at Stralsund
 the 22d of November following. As soon as he got there, baron de Gortz
 came to pay his court to him; and, though he had been the instrument of
 one part of his misfortunes, yet he justified his conduct with so much
 art, and filled the imagination of Charles with such flattering hopes,
 that he gained his confidence, as he had already done that of
 every other minister and prince with whom he had entered into any
 negotiations. In short, he made him believe, that means might be found
 to draw off the czar's allies, and thereby procure an honourable peace,
 or at least to carry on the war upon an equal footing; and from this
 time Gortz gained a greater ascendancy over the mind of the king of
 Sweden than ever count Piper had.
 
 The first thing which Charles did after his arrival at Stralsund was to
 demand a supply of money from the citizens of Stockholm, who readily
 parted with what little they had left, as not being able to refuse any
 thing to a king, who asked only to bestow, who lived as hard as the
 meanest soldier, and exposed his life equally in defence of his country.
 His misfortunes, his captivity, his return to his dominions, so long
 deprived of his presence, were arguments which prepossessed alike his
 own subjects and foreigners in his favour, who could not forbear at once
 to blame and admire, to compassionate and to assist him. His reputation
 was of a kind totally differing from that of Peter the Great: it
 consisted not in cherishing the arts and sciences, in enacting laws, in
 establishing a form of government, nor in introducing commerce among his
 subjects; it was confined entirely to his own person. He placed his
 chief merit in a valour superior to what is commonly called courage. He
 defended his dominions with a greatness of soul equal to that valour,
 and aimed only to inspire other nations with awe and respect for him:
 hence he had more partizans than allies.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XXV.
 
     State of Europe at the return of Charles XII. Siege of Stralsund.
 
 
 When Charles XII. returned to his dominions in the year 1714, he found
 the state of affairs in Europe very different from that in which he had
 left them. Queen Anne of England was dead, after having made peace with
 France. Lewis XIV. had secured the monarchy of Spain for his grandson
 the duke of Anjou, and had obliged the emperor Charles VI. and the Dutch
 to agree to a peace, which their situation rendered necessary to them;
 so that the affairs of Europe had put on altogether a new face.
 
 Those of the north had undergone a still greater change. Peter was
 become sole arbiter in that part of the world: the elector of Hanover,
 who had been called to fill the British throne, had views of extending
 his territories in Germany, at the expense of Sweden, who had never had
 any possessions in that country, but since the reign of the great
 Gustavus. The king of Denmark aimed at recovering Scania, the best
 province of Sweden, which had formerly belonged to the Danes. The king
 of Prussia, as heir to the dukes of Pomerania, laid claim to a part of
 that province. On the other hand, the Holstein family, oppressed by the
 king of Denmark, and the duke of Mecklenburg, almost at open war with
 his subjects, were suing to Peter the Great to take them under his
 protection. The king of Poland, elector of Saxony, was desirous to have
 the duchy of Courland annexed to Poland; so that, from the Elbe to the
 Baltic Sea, Peter the First was considered as the support of the several
 crowned heads, as Charles XII. had been their greatest terror.
 
 Many negotiations were set on foot after the return of Charles to his
 dominions, but nothing had been done. That prince thought he could raise
 a sufficient number of ships of war and privateers, to put a stop to the
 rising power of the czar by sea; with respect to the land war, he
 depended upon his own valour; and Gortz, who was on a sudden become his
 prime minister, persuaded him, that he might find means to defray the
 expense, by coining copper money, to be taken at ninety-six times less
 than its real value, a thing unparalleled in the histories of any state;
 but in the month of April, 1715, the first Swedish privateers that put
 to sea were taken by the czar's men of war, and a Russian army marched
 into the heart of Pomerania.
 
 The Prussians, Danes, and Saxons, now sat down with their united forces
 before Stralsund, and Charles XII. beheld himself returned from his
 confinement at Demirtash and Demirtoca on the Black Sea, only to be more
 closely pent up on the borders of the Baltic.
 
 We have already shewn, in the history of this extraordinary man, with
 what haughty and unembarrassed resolution he braved the united forces of
 his enemies in Stralsund; and shall therefore, in this place, only add a
 single circumstance, which, though trivial, may serve to shew the
 peculiarity of his character. The greatest part of his officers having
 been either killed or wounded during the siege, the duty fell hard upon
 the few who were left. Baron de Reichel, a colonel, having sustained a
 long engagement upon the ramparts, and being tired out by repeated
 watchings and fatigues, had thrown himself upon a bench to take a little
 repose; when he was called up to mount guard again upon the ramparts. As
 he was dragging himself along, hardly able to stand, and cursing the
 obstinacy of the king his master, who subjected all those about him to
 such insufferable and fruitless fatigues, Charles happened to overhear
 him. Upon which, stripping off his own cloak, he spread it on the ground
 before him, saying, 'My dear Reichel, you are quite spent; come, I have
 had an hour's sleep, which has refreshed me, I'll take the guard for
 you, while you finish your nap, and will wake you when I think it is
 time;' and so saying, he wrapt the colonel up in his cloak; and,
 notwithstanding all his resistance, obliged him to lie down to sleep,
 and mounted the guard himself.
 
 It was during this siege that the elector of Hanover, lately made king
 of England, purchased of the king of Denmark the province of Bremen and
 Verden, with the city of Stade, (Oct. 1715.) which the Danes had taken
 from Charles XII. This purchase cost king George eight hundred thousand
 German crowns. In this manner were the dominions of Charles bartered
 away, while he defended the city of Stralsund, inch by inch, till at
 length nothing was left of it but a heap of ruins, which his officers
 compelled him to leave; (Dec. 1713.) and, when he was in a place of
 safety, general Ducker delivered up those ruins to the king of Prussia.
 
 Some time afterwards, Ducker, being presented to Charles, that monarch
 reproached him with having capitulated with his enemies; when Ducker
 replied, 'I had too great a regard for your majesty's honour, to
 continue to defend a place which you was obliged to leave.' However the
 Prussians continued in possession of it no longer than the year 1721,
 when they gave it up at the general peace.
 
 During the siege of Stralsund, Charles received another mortification,
 which would have been still more severe, if his heart had been as
 sensible to the emotions of friendship, as it was to those of fame and
 honour. His prime minister, count Piper, a man famous throughout all
 Europe, and of unshaken fidelity to his prince (notwithstanding the
 assertions of certain rash persons, or the authority of a mistaken
 writer): this Piper, I say, had been the victim of his master's ambition
 ever since the battle of Pultowa. As there was as that time no cartel
 for the exchange of prisoners subsisting between the Russians and
 Swedes, he had remained in confinement at Moscow; and though he had not
 been sent into Siberia, as the other prisoners were, yet his situation
 was greatly to be pitied. The czar's finances at that time were not
 managed with so much fidelity as they ought to be, and his many new
 establishments required an expense which he could with difficulty
 answer. In particular, he owed a considerable sum of money to the Dutch,
 on account of two of their merchant-ships which had been burnt on the
 coast of Finland, in the descent the czar had made on that country.
 Peter pretended that the Swedes were to make good the damage, and wanted
 to engage count Piper to charge himself with this debt: accordingly he
 was sent for from Moscow to Petersburg, and his liberty was offered him,
 in case he could draw upon Sweden letters of exchange to the amount of
 sixty thousand crowns. It is said he actually did draw bills for this
 sum upon his wife at Stockholm, but that she being unable or unwilling
 to take them up, they were returned, and the king of Sweden never gave
 himself the least concern about paying the money. Be this as it may,
 count Piper was closely confined in the castle of Schlusselburg, where
 he died the year after, at the age of seventy. His remains were sent to
 the king of Sweden, who gave them a magnificent burial; a vain and
 melancholy return to an old servant, for a life of suffering, and so
 deplorable an end!
 
 Peter was satisfied with having got possession of Livonia, Esthonia,
 Carelia, and Ingria, which he looked upon as his own provinces, and to
 which he had, moreover, added almost all Finland, which served as a kind
 of pledge, in case his enemies should conclude a peace. He had married
 one of his nieces to Charles Leopold, duke of Mecklenburg, in the month
 of April of the same year, (1715.) so that all the sovereigns of the
 north were now either his allies or his creatures. In Poland, he kept
 the enemies of king Augustus in awe; one of his armies, consisting of
 about eight thousand men, having, without any loss, quelled several of
 those confederacies, which are so frequent in that country of liberty
 and anarchy: on the other hand, the Turks, by strictly observing their
 treaties, left him at full liberty to exert his power, and execute his
 schemes in their utmost extent.
 
 In this flourishing situation of his affairs, scarcely a day passed
 without being distinguished by new establishments, either in the navy,
 the army, or the legislature: he himself composed a military code for
 the infantry.
 
 Nov. 8.] He likewise founded a naval academy at Petersburg; dispatched
 Lange to China and Siberia, with a commission of trade; set
 mathematicians to work, in drawing charts of the whole empire; built a
 summer's palace at Petershoff; and at the same time built forts on the
 banks of the Irtish, stopped the incursions and ravages of the
 Bukari[96] on the one side, and, on the other, suppressed the Tartars of
 Kouban.
 
 1715.] His prosperity seemed now to be at its zenith, by the empress
 Catherine's being delivered of a son, and an heir to his dominions being
 given him, in a prince born to the czarowitz Alexis; but the joy for
 these happy events, which fell out within a few days of each other, was
 soon damped by the death of the empress's son; and the sequel of this
 history will shew us, that the fate of the czarowitz was too
 unfortunate, for the birth of a son to this prince to be looked upon as
 a happiness.
 
 The delivery of the czarina put a stop for some time to her
 accompanying, as usual, her royal consort in all his expeditions by sea
 and land; but, as soon as she was up again, she followed him to new

     New travels of the czar.
 
 
 Wismar was at this time besieged by the czar's allies. This town, which
 belonged of right to the duke of Mecklenburg, is situated on the Baltic,
 about seven leagues distant from Lubec, and might have rivalled that
 city in its extensive trade, being once one of the most considerable of
 the Hans Towns, and the duke of Mecklenburg exercised therein a full
 power of protection, rather than of sovereignty. This was one of the
 German territories yet remaining to the Swedes, in virtue of the peace
 of Westphalia: but it was now obliged to share the same fate with
 Stralsund. The allies of the czar pushed the siege with the greatest
 vigour, in order to make themselves masters of it before that prince's
 troops should arrive; but Peter himself coming before the place in
 person, after the capitulation, (Feb. 1716,) which had been made without
 his privacy, made the garrison prisoners of war. He was not a little
 incensed, that his allies should have left the king of Denmark in
 possession of a town which was the right of a prince, who had married
 his niece; and his resentment on this occasion (which that artful
 minister, de Gortz, soon after turned to his own advantage) laid the
 first foundation of the peace, which he meditated to bring about between
 the czar and Charles XII.
 
 Gortz took the first opportunity to insinuate to the czar, that Sweden
 was sufficiently humbled, and that he should be careful not to suffer
 Denmark and Prussia to become too powerful. The czar joined in opinion
 with him, and as he had entered into the war, merely from motives of
 policy, whilst Charles carried it on wholly on the principles of a
 warrior; he, from that instant, slackened in his operations against the
 Swedes, and Charles, every where unfortunate in Germany, determined to
 risk one of those desperate strokes which success only can justify, and
 carried the war into Norway.
 
 In the meantime, Peter was desirous to make a second tour through
 Europe. He had undertaken his first, as a person who travelled for
 instruction in the arts and sciences: but this second he made as a
 prince, who wanted to dive into the secrets of the several courts. He
 took the czarina with him to Copenhagen, Lubec, Schwerin, and Nystadt.
 He had an interview with the king of Prussia at the little town of
 Aversburg, from thence he and the empress went to Hamburg, and to
 Altena, which had been burned by the Swedes, and which they caused to be
 rebuilt. Descending the Elbe as far as Stade, they passed through
 Bremen, where the magistrates prepared a firework and illuminations for
 them, which formed, in a hundred different places, these words--'Our
 deliverer is come amongst us.' At length he arrived once more at
 Amsterdam, (Dec. 17, 1716,) and visited the little hut at Saardam, where
 he had first learned the art of ship-building, about eighteen years
 before, and found his old dwelling converted into a handsome and
 commodious house, which is still to be seen, and goes by the name of the
 Prince's House.
 
 It may easily be conceived, with what a kind of idolatry he was received
 by a trading and seafaring set of people, whose companion he had
 heretofore been, and who thought they saw in the conqueror of Pultowa, a
 pupil who had learned from them to gain naval victories; and had, after
 their example, established trade and navigation in his own dominions. In
 a word, they looked upon him as a fellow-citizen, who had been raised to
 the imperial dignity.
 
 The life, the travels, the actions of Peter the Great, as well as of his
 rival, Charles of Sweden, exhibit a surprising contrast to the manners
 which prevail amongst us, and which are, perhaps, rather too delicate;
 and this may be one reason, that the history of these two famous men so
 much excites our curiosity.
 
 The czarina had been left behind at Schwerin indisposed, being greatly
 advanced in her pregnancy; nevertheless, as soon as she was able to
 travel, she set out to join the czar in Holland, but was taken in labour
 at Wesel, and there delivered of a prince, (Jan. 14, 1717,) who lived
 but one day. It is not customary with us for a lying-in-woman to stir
 abroad for some time; but the czarina set out, and arrived at Amsterdam
 in ten days after her labour. She was very desirous to see the little
 cabin her husband had lived and worked in. Accordingly, she and the czar
 went together, without any state or attendance, excepting only two
 servants, and dined at the house of a rich ship-builder of Saardam,
 whose name was Kalf, and who was one of the first who had traded to
 Petersburg. His son had lately arrived from France, whither Peter was
 going. The czar and czarina took great pleasure in hearing an adventure
 of this young man, which I should not mention here, only as it may serve
 to shew the great difference between the manners of that country and
 ours.
 
 Old Kalf, who had sent this son of his to Paris, to learn the French
 tongue, was desirous that he should live in a genteel manner during his
 stay there; and accordingly had ordered him to lay aside the plain garb
 which the inhabitants of Saardam are in general accustomed to wear, and
 to provide himself with fashionable clothes at Paris, and to live, in a
 manner, rather suitable to his fortune than his education; being
 sufficiently well acquainted with his son's disposition to know, that
 this indulgence would have no bad effect on his natural frugality and
 sobriety.
 
 As a calf is in the French language called veau, our young traveller,
 when he arrived at Paris, took the name of De Veau. He lived in a
 splendid manner, spent his money freely, and made several genteel
 connexions. Nothing is more common at Paris, than to bestow, without
 reserve, the title of count and marquis, whether a person has any claim
 to it or not, or even if he is barely a gentleman. This absurd practice
 has been allowed by the government, in order that, by thus confounding
 all ranks, and consequently humbling the nobility, there might be less
 danger of civil wars, which, in former times, were so frequent and
 destructive to the peace of the state. In a word, the title of marquis
 and count, with possessions equivalent to that dignity, are like those
 of knight, without being of any order; or abbe, without any church
 preferment; of no consequence, and not looked upon by the sensible part
 of the nation.
 
 Young Mr. Kalf was always called the count de Veau by his acquaintance
 and his own servants: he frequently made one in the parties of the
 princesses; he played at the duchess of Berri's, and few strangers were
 treated with greater marks of distinction, or had more general
 invitations among polite company. A young nobleman, who had been always
 one of his companions in these parties, promised to pay him a visit at
 Saardam, and was as good as his word: when he arrived at the village, he
 inquired for the house of count Kalf; when, being shewn into a
 carpenter's work-shop, he there saw his former gay companion, the young
 count, dressed in a jacket and trowsers, after the Dutch fashion, with
 an axe in his hand, at the head of his father's workmen. Here he was
 received by his friend, in that plain manner to which he had been
 accustomed from his birth, and from which he never deviated. The
 sensible reader will forgive this little digression, as it is a satire
 on vanity, and a panegyric on true manners.
 
 The czar continued three months in Holland, during which he passed his
 time in matters of a more serious nature than the adventure just
 related. Since the treaties of Nimeguen, Ryswic, and Utrecht, the Hague
 had preserved the reputation of being the centre of negotiations in
 Europe. This little city, or rather village, the most pleasant of any in
 the North, is chiefly inhabited by foreign ministers, and by travellers,
 who come for instruction to this great school. They were, at that time,
 laying the foundation of a great revolution in Europe. The czar, having
 gotten intelligence of the approaching storm, prolonged his stay in the
 Low Countries, that he might be nearer at hand, to observe the
 machinations going forward, both in the North and South, and prepare
 himself for the part which it might be necessary for him to act therein.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XXVII.
 
     Continuation of the Travels of Peter the Great.--Conspiracy of baron
     Gortz.--Reception of the czar in France.
 
 
 He plainly saw that his allies were jealous of his power, and found that
 there is often more trouble with friends than with enemies.
 
 Mecklenburg was one of the principal subjects of those divisions, which
 almost always subsist between neighbouring princes, who share in
 conquests. Peter was not willing that the Danes should take possession
 of Wismar for themselves, and still less that they should demolish the
 fortifications, and yet they did both the one and the other.
 
 He openly protected the duke of Mecklenburg, who had married his niece,
 and whom he regarded like a son-in-law, against the nobility of the
 country, and the king of England as openly protected these latter. On
 the other hand, he was greatly discontented with the king of Poland, or
 rather with his minister, count Flemming, who wanted to throw off that
 dependance on the czar, which necessity and gratitude had imposed.
 
 The courts of England, Poland, Denmark, Holstein, Mecklenburg, and
 Brandenburg, were severally agitated with intrigues and cabals.
 
 Towards the end of the year 1716, and beginning of 1717, Gortz, who, as
 Bassewitz tells us in his Memoirs, was weary of having only the title of
 counsellor of Holstein, and being only private plenipotentiary to
 Charles XII. was the chief promoter of these intrigues, with which he
 intended to disturb the peace of all Europe. His design was to bring
 Charles XII. and the czar together, not only with a view to finish the
 war between them, but to unite them in friendship, to replace Stanislaus
 on the crown of Poland, and to wrest Bremen and Verden out of the hands
 of George I., king of England, and even to drive that prince from the
 English throne, in order to put it out of his power to appropriate to
 himself any part of the spoils of Charles XII.
 
 There was at the same time a minister of his own character, who had
 formed a design to overturn the two kingdoms of England and France: this
 was cardinal Alberoni, who had more power at that time in Spain, than
 Gortz had in Sweden, and was of as bold and enterprising a spirit as
 himself, but much more powerful, as being at the head of affairs in a
 kingdom infinitely more rich, and never paid his creatures and
 dependants in copper money.
 
 Gortz, from the borders of the Baltic Sea, soon formed a connexion with
 Alberoni in Spain. The cardinal and he both held a correspondence with
 all the wandering English who were in the interest of the house of
 Stuart. Gortz made visits to every place where he thought he was likely
 to find any enemies of king George, and went successively to Germany,
 Holland, Flanders, and Lorrain, and at length came to Paris, about the
 end of the year 1716. Cardinal Alberoni began, by remitting to him in
 Paris a million of French livres, in order (to use the cardinal's
 expression) to set fire to the train.
 
 Gortz proposed, that Charles XII. should yield up several places to the
 czar, in order to be in a condition to recover all the others from his
 enemies, and that he might be at liberty to make a descent in Scotland,
 while the partisans of the Stuart family should make an effectual rising
 in England: after their former vain attempts to effect these views, it
 was necessary to deprive the king of England of his chief support, which
 at that time was the regent of France. It was certainly very
 extraordinary, to see France in league with England, against the
 grandson of Lewis XIV., whom she herself had placed on the throne of
 Spain, at the expence of her blood and treasure, notwithstanding the
 strong confederacy formed to oppose him; but it must be considered, that
 every thing was now out of its natural order, and the interests of the
 regent not those of the kingdom. Alberoni, at that time, was carrying on
 a confederacy in France against this very regent.[97] And the
 foundations of this grand project were laid almost as soon as the plan
 itself had been formed. Gortz was the first who was let into the secret,
 and was to have made a journey into Italy in disguise, to hold a
 conference with the pretender, in the neighbourhood of Rome; from
 thence he was to have hastened to the Hague, to have an interview with
 the czar, and then to have settled every thing with the king of Sweden.
 
 The author of this History is particularly well informed of every
 circumstance here advanced, for baron Gortz proposed to him to accompany
 him in these journies; and, notwithstanding he was very young at that
 time, he was one of the first witnesses to a great part of these
 intrigues.
 
 Gortz returned from Holland in the latter part of 1716, furnished with
 bills of exchange from cardinal Alberoni, and letters plenipotentiary
 from Charles XII. It is incontestable that the Jacobite party were to
 have made a rising in England, while Charles, in his return from Norway,
 was to make a descent in the north of Scotland. This prince, who had not
 been able to preserve his own dominions on the continent, was now going
 to invade and overrun those of his neighbours, and just escaped from his
 prison in Turkey, and from amidst the ruins of his own city of
 Stralsund, Europe might have beheld him placing the crown of Great
 Britain on the head of James III. in London, as he had before done that
 of Poland on Stanislaus at Warsaw.
 
 The czar, who was acquainted with a part of Gortz's projects, waited for
 the unfolding of the rest, without entering into any of his plans, or
 indeed knowing them all. He was as fond of great and extraordinary
 enterprises as Charles XII., Gortz, or Alberoni; but then it was as the
 founder of a state, a lawgiver, and a sound politician; and perhaps
 Alberoni, Gortz, and even Charles himself, were rather men of restless
 souls, who sought after great adventures, than persons of solid
 understanding, who took their measures with a just precaution; or
 perhaps, after all, their ill successes may have subjected them to the
 charge of rashness and imprudence.
 
 During Gortz's stay at the Hague, the czar did not see him, as it would
 have given too much umbrage to his friends the states-general, who were
 in close alliance with, and attached to, the party of the king of
 England; and even his ministers visited him only in private, and with
 great precaution, having orders from their master to hear all he had to
 offer, and to flatter him with hopes, without entering into any
 engagement, or making use of his (the czar's) name in their conferences.
 But, notwithstanding all these precautions, those who understood the
 nature of affairs, plainly saw by his inactivity, when he might have
 made a descent upon Scania with the joint fleets of Russia and Denmark,
 by his visible coolness towards his allies, and the little regard he
 paid to their complaints, and lastly, by this journey of his, that there
 was a great change in affairs, which would very soon manifest itself.
 
 In the month of January, 1717, a Swedish packet-boat, which was carrying
 letters over to Holland, being forced by a storm upon the coast of
 Norway, put into harbour there. The letters were seized, and those of
 baron de Gortz and some other public ministers being opened, furnished
 sufficient evidence of the projected revolution. The court of Denmark
 communicated these letters to the English ministry, who gave orders for
 arresting the Swedish minister, Gillembourg, then at the court of
 London, and seizing his papers; upon examining which they discovered
 part of his correspondence with the Jacobites.
 
 Feb. 1717.] King George immediately wrote to the states-general,
 requiring them to cause the person of baron Gortz to be arrested,
 agreeable to the treaty of union subsisting between England and that
 republic for their mutual security. But this minister, who had his
 creatures and emissaries in every part, was quickly informed of this
 order; upon which he instantly quitted the Hague, and was got as far as
 Arnheim, a town on the frontiers, when the officers and guards, who were
 in pursuit of him, and who are seldom accustomed to use such diligence
 in that country, came up with and took him, together with all his
 papers: he was strictly confined and severely treated; the secretary
 Stank, the person who had counterfeited the sign manual of the young
 duke of Holstein, in the affair of Toningen, experienced still harsher
 usage. In fine, the count of Gillembourg, the Swedish envoy to the court
 of Great Britain, and the baron de Gortz, minister plenipotentiary from
 Charles XII. were examined like criminals, the one at London, and the
 other at Arnheim, while all the foreign ministers exclaimed against this
 violation of the law of nations.
 
 This privilege, which is much more insisted upon than understood, and
 whose limits and extent have never yet been fixed, has, in almost every
 age, received violent attacks. Several ministers have been driven from
 the courts where they resided in a public character, and even their
 persons have been more than once seized upon, but this was the first
 instance of foreign ministers being interrogated at the bar of a court
 of justice, as if they were natives of the country. The court of London
 and the states-general laid aside all rules upon seeing the dangers
 which menaced the house of Hanover; but, in fact, this danger, when once
 discovered, ceased to be any longer danger, at least at that juncture.
 
 The historian Norberg must have been very ill informed, and have had a
 very indifferent knowledge of men and things, or at least have been
 strangely blinded by partiality, or under severe restrictions from his
 own court, to endeavour to persuade his readers, that the king of Sweden
 had not a very great share in this plot.
 
 The affront offered to his ministers fixed Charles more than ever in his
 resolution to try every means to dethrone the king of England. But here
 he found it necessary, once in his life time, to make use of
 dissimulation. He disowned his ministers and their proceedings, both to
 the regent of France and the states-general; from the former of whom he
 evicted a subsidy, and with the latter it was for his interest to
 keep fair. He did not, however, give the king of England so much
 satisfaction, and his ministers, Gortz and Gillembourg, were kept six
 months in confinement, and this repeated insult animated in him the
 desire of revenge.
 
 Peter, in the midst of all these alarms and jealousies, kept himself
 quiet, waiting with patience the event of all from time; and having
 established such good order throughout his vast dominions, as that he
 had nothing to fear, either at home or from abroad, he resolved to make
 a journey to France. Unhappily he did not understand the French
 language, by which means he was deprived of the greatest advantage he
 might have reaped from his journey; but he thought there might be
 something there worthy observation, and he had a mind to be a nearer
 witness of the terms on which the regent stood with the king of England,
 and whether that prince was staunch to his alliance.
 
 Peter the Great was received in France as such a monarch ought to be.
 Marshal Tesse was sent to meet him, with a number of the principal
 lords of the court, a company of guards and the king's coaches; but he,
 according to his usual custom, travelled with such expedition, that he
 was at Gournay when the equipages arrived at Elbeuf. Entertainments were
 made for him in every place on the road where he chose to partake of
 them. On his arrival he was received in the Louvre, where the royal
 apartments were prepared for him, and others for the princes Kourakin
 and Dolgorouki, the vice-chancellor Shaffiroff, the ambassador Tolstoy,
 the same who had suffered in his person that notorious violation of the
 laws of nations in Turkey, and for the rest of his retinue. Orders were
 given for lodging and entertaining him in the most splendid and
 sumptuous manner: but Peter, who was come only to see what might be of
 use to him, and not to suffer these ceremonious triflings, which were a
 restraint upon his natural plainness, and consumed a time that was
 precious to him, went the same night to take up his lodgings at the
 other end of the city in the hotel of Lesdiguiere, belonging to marshal
 Villeroi, where he was entertained at the king's expense in the same
 manner as he would have been at the Louvre. The next day (May 8, 1717.)
 the regent of France went to make him a visit in the before mentioned
 hotel, and the day afterwards the young king, then an infant, was sent
 to him under the care of his governor, the marshal de Villeroi, whose
 father had been governor to Lewis XIV. On this occasion, they, by a
 polite artifice, spared the czar the troublesome restraint of returning
 this visit immediately after receiving it, by allowing an interview of
 two days for him to receive the respects of the several corporations of
 the city; the second night he went to visit the king: the household were
 all under arms, and they brought the young king quite to the door of
 the czar's coach. Peter, surprised and uneasy at the prodigious
 concourse of people assembled about the infant monarch, took him in his
 arms, and carried him in that manner for some time.
 
 Certain ministers, of more cunning than understanding, have pretended in
 their writings, that marshal de Villeroi wanted to make the young king
 of France take the upper hand on this occasion, and that the czar made
 use of this stratagem to overturn the ceremonial under the appearance of
 good nature and tenderness; but this notion is equally false and absurd.
 The natural good breeding of the French court, and the respect due to
 the person of Peter the Great, would not permit a thought of turning the
 honours intended him into an affront. The ceremonial consisted in doing
 every thing for a great monarch and a great man, that he himself could
 have desired, if he had given any attention to matters of this kind. The
 journeys of the emperor Charles IV. Sigismund, and Charles V. to France,
 were by no means comparable, in point of splendour, to this of Peter the
 Great. They visited this kingdom only from motives of political
 interest, and at a time when the arts and sciences, as yet in their
 infancy, could not render the era of their journey so memorable: but
 when Peter the Great, on his going to dine with the duke d'Antin, in the
 palace of Petitbourg, about three leagues out of Paris, saw his own
 picture, which had been drawn for the occasion, brought on a sudden, and
 placed in a room where he was, he then found that no people in the world
 knew so well how to receive such a guest as the French.
 
 He was still more surprised, when, on going to see them strike the
 medals in the long gallery of the Louvre, where all the king's artists
 are so handsomely lodged; a medal, which they were then striking,
 happening to fall to the ground, the czar stooped hastily down to take
 it up, when he beheld his own head engraved thereon, and on the reverse
 a Fame standing with one foot upon a globe, and underneath these words
 from Virgil--'Vires acquirit eundo;' an allusion equally delicate and
 noble, and elegantly adapted to his travels and his fame. Several of
 these medals in gold were presented to him, and to all those who
 attended him. Wherever he went to view the works of any artists, they
 laid the master-pieces of their performances at his feet, which they
 besought him to accept. In a word, when he visited the manufactories of
 the Gobelins, the workshop of the king's statuaries, painters,
 goldsmiths, jewellers, or mathematical instrument-makers, whatever
 seemed to strike his attention at any of those places, were always
 offered him in the king's name.
 
 Peter, who was a mechanic, an artist, and a geometrician, went to visit
 the academy of sciences, who received him with an exhibition of every
 thing they had most valuable and curious; but they had nothing so
 curious as himself. He corrected, with his own hand, several
 geographical errors in the charts of his own dominions, and especially
 in those of the Caspian Sea. Lastly, he condescended to become one of
 the members of that academy, and afterwards continued a correspondence
 in experiments and discoveries with those among whom he had enrolled
 himself as a simple brother. If we would find examples of such
 travellers as Peter, we must go back to the times of a Pythagoras and an
 Anacharsis, and even they did not quit the command of a mighty empire,
 to go in search of instruction.
 
 And here we cannot forbear recalling to the mind of the reader the
 transport with which Peter the Great was seized on viewing the monument
 of cardinal Richelieu. Regardless of the beauties of the sculpture,
 which is a master-piece of its kind, he only admired the image of a
 minister who had rendered himself so famous throughout Europe by
 disturbing its peace, and restored to France that glory which she had
 lost after the death of Henry IV. It is well known, that, embracing the
 statue with rapture, he burst forth into this exclamation--'Great man! I
 would have bestowed one half of my empire on thee, to have taught me to
 govern the other.' And now, before he quitted France, he was desirous to
 see the famous madame de Maintenon, whom he knew to be, in fact, the
 widow of Lewis XIV. and who was now drawing very near her end; and his
 curiosity was the more excited by the kind of conformity he found
 between his own marriage and that of Lewis; though with this difference
 between the king of France and him, that he had publickly married an
 heroine, whereas Lewis XIV. had only privately enjoyed an amiable wife.
 
 The czarina did not accompany her husband in this journey: he was
 apprehensive that the excess of ceremony would be troublesome to her, as
 well as the curiosity of a court little capable of distinguishing the
 true merit of a woman, who had braved death by the side of her husband
 both by sea and land, from the banks of the Pruth to the coast of
 Finland.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XXVIII.
 
     Of the return of the czar to his dominions.--Of his politics and
     occupations.
 
 
 The behaviour of the Sorbonne to Peter, when he went to visit the
 mausoleum of cardinal Richelieu, deserves to be treated of by itself.
 
 Some doctors of this university were desirous to have the honour of
 bringing about a union between the Greek and Latin churches. Those who
 are acquainted with antiquity need not be told, that the Christian
 religion was first introduced into the west by the Asiatic Greeks: that
 it was born in the east, and that the first fathers, the first councils,
 the first liturgies, and the first rites, were all from the east; that
 there is not a single title or office in the hierarchy, but was in
 Greek, and thereby plainly shews the same from whence they are all
 derived to us. Upon the division of the Roman empire, it was next to
 impossible, but that sooner or later there must be two religions as well
 as two empires, and that the same schism should arise between the
 eastern and western Christians, as between the followers of Osman and
 the Persians.
 
 It is this schism which certain doctors of the Sorbonne thought to crush
 all at once by means of a memorial which they presented to Peter the
 Great, and effect what Pope Leo XI. and his successors had in vain
 laboured for many ages to bring about, by legates, councils, and even
 money. These doctors should have known, that Peter the Great, who was
 the head of the Russian church, was not likely to acknowledge the pope's
 authority. They expatiated in their memorial on the liberties of the
 Gallican church, which the czar gave himself no concern about. They
 asserted that the popes ought to be subject to the councils, and that a
 papal decree is not an article of faith: but their representations were
 in vain; all they got by their pains, was to make the pope their enemy
 by such free declarations, at the same time that they pleased neither
 the czar nor the Russian church.
 
 There were, in this plan of union, certain political views, which the
 good fathers did not understand, and some points of controversy which
 they pretended to understand, and which each party explained as they
 thought proper. It was concerning the Holy Ghost, which, according to
 the Latin church, proceeds from the Father and Son, and which, at
 present, according to the Greeks, proceeds from the Father through the
 Son, after having, for a considerable time, proceeded from the Father
 only: on this occasion they quoted a passage in St. Epiphanius, where it
 is said, 'That the Holy Ghost is neither brother to the Son, nor
 grandson to the Father.'
 
 But Peter, when he left Paris, had other business to mind, than that of
 clearing up passages in St. Epiphanius. Nevertheless, he received the
 memorial of the Sorbonne with his accustomed affability. That learned
 body wrote to some of the Russian bishops, who returned a polite answer,
 though the major part of them were offended at the proposed union. It
 was in order to remove any apprehensions of such a union, that Peter,
 some time afterwards, namely, in 1718, when he had driven the jesuits
 out of his dominions, instituted the ceremony of a burlesque conclave.
 
 He had at his court an old fool, named Jotof, who had learned him to
 write, and who thought he had, by that trivial service, merited the
 highest honours and most important posts: Peter, who sometimes softened
 the toils of government, by indulging his people in amusements, which
 befitted a nation as yet not entirely reformed by his labours, promised
 his writing-master, to bestow on him one of the highest dignities in the
 world; accordingly, he appointed him knez papa, or supreme pontiff, with
 an appointment of two thousand crowns, and assigned him a house to live
 in, in the Tartarian quarter at Petersburg. He was installed by a number
 of buffoons, with great ceremony, and four fellows who stammered were
 appointed to harangue him on the accession. He created a number of
 cardinals, and marched in procession at their head, and the whole sacred
 college was made drunk with brandy. After the death of this Jotof, an
 officer, named Buturlin, was made Pope: this ceremony has been thrice
 renewed at Moscow and Petersburg, the ridiculousness of which, though it
 appeared of no moment, yet has by its ridiculousness confirmed the
 people in their aversion to a church, which pretended to the supreme
 power, and whose church had anathematized so many crowned heads. In this
 manner did the czar revenge the cause of twenty emperors of Germany, ten
 kings of France, and a number of other sovereigns; and this was all the
 advantage the Sorbonne gained from its impolitic attempt to unite the
 Latin and Greek churches.
 
 The czar's journey to France proved of more utility to his kingdom, by
 bringing about a connexion with a trading and industrious people, than
 could have arisen from the projected union between two rival churches;
 one of which will always maintain its ancient independence, and the
 other its new superiority.
 
 Peter carried several artificers with him out of France, in the same
 manner as he had done out of England; for every nation, which he
 visited, thought it an honour to assist him in his design of
 introducing the arts and sciences into his new-formed state, and to be
 instrumental in this species of new creation.
 
 In this expedition, he drew up a sketch of a treaty of commerce with
 France, and which he put into the hands of his ministers at Holland, as
 soon as he returned thither, but it was not signed by the French
 ambassador, Chateauneuf, till the 15th August, 1717, at the Hague. This
 treaty not only related to trade, but likewise to bringing about peace
 in the North. The king of France and the elector of Brandenburg accepted
 of the office of mediators, which Peter offered them. This was
 sufficient to give the king of England to understand, that the czar was
 not well pleased with him, and crowned the hopes of baron Gortz, who
 from that time, left nothing undone to bring about a union between
 Charles and Peter, to stir up new enemies against George I. and to
 assist cardinal Alberoni in his schemes in every part of Europe. Gortz
 now paid and received visits publicly from the czar's ministers at the
 Hague, to whom he declared, that he was invested with full power from
 the court of Sweden to conclude a peace.
 
 The czar suffered Gortz to dispose all his batteries, without assisting
 therein himself, and was prepared either to make peace with the king of
 Sweden, or to carry on the war, and continued still in alliance with the
 kings of Denmark, Poland, and Russia, and in appearance with the elector
 of Hanover.
 
 It was evident, that he had no fixed design, but that of profiting of
 conjunctures and circumstances, and that his main object was to complete
 the general establishments he had set on foot. He well knew, that
 the negotiations and interests of princes, their leagues, their
 friendships, their jealousies, and their enmities, were subject to
 change with each revolving year, and that frequently not the smallest
 traces remain of the greatest efforts in politics. A simple manufactory,
 well established, is often of more real advantage to a state than twenty
 treaties.
 
 Peter having joined the czarina, who was waiting for him in Holland,
 continued his travels with her. They crossed Westphalia, and arrived at
 Berlin in a private manner. The new king of Prussia was as much an enemy
 to ceremonious vanities, and the pomp of a court, as Peter himself; and
 it was an instructive lesson to the etiquette of Vienna and Spain, the
 punctilio of Italy, and the politesse of the French court, to see a
 king, who only made use of a wooden elbow-chair, who went always in the
 dress of a common soldier, and who had banished from his table, not only
 all the luxuries, but even the more moderate indulgences of life.
 
 The czar and czarina observed the same plain manner of living; and had
 Charles been with them, the world might have beheld four crowned heads,
 with less pomp and state about them than a German bishop, or a cardinal
 of Rome. Never were luxury and effeminacy opposed by such noble
 examples.
 
 It cannot be denied, that if one of our fellow-subjects had, from mere
 curiosity, made the fifth part of the journeys that Peter I. did for the
 good of his kingdom, he would have been considered as an extraordinary
 person, and one who challenged our consideration. From Berlin he went to
 Dantzic, still accompanied by his wife, and from thence to Mittau, where
 he protected his niece, the duchess of Courland, lately become a widow.
 He visited all the places he had conquered, made several new and useful
 regulations in Petersburg; he then goes to Moscow, where he rebuilds the
 houses of several persons that had fallen to ruin; from thence he
 transports himself to Czaritsin, on the river Wolga, to stop the
 incursions of the Cuban Tartars, constructs lines of communication from
 the Wolga to the Don, and erects forts at certain distances, between the
 two rivers. At the same time he caused the military code, which he had
 lately composed, to be printed, and erected a court of justice, to
 examine into the conduct of his ministers, and to retrieve the disorders
 in his finances; he pardons several who were found guilty, and punishes
 others. Among the latter was the great prince Menzikoff himself, who
 stood in need of the royal clemency. But a sentence more severe, which
 he thought himself obliged to utter against his own son, filled with
 bitterness those days, which were, in other respects, covered with so
 much glory.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XXIX.
 
     Proceedings against prince Alexis Petrowitz.
 
 
 Peter the Great, at the age of seventeen, had married, in the year 1689,
 Eudocia Theodora, or Theodorouna Lapoukin. Bred up in the prejudices of
 her country, and incapable of surmounting them like her husband, the
 greatest opposition he met with in erecting his empire, and forming his
 people, came from her: she was, as is too common to her sex, a slave to
 superstition; every new and useful alteration she looked upon as a
 species of sacrilege; and every foreigner, whom the czar employed to
 execute his great designs, appeared to her no better than as corruptors
 and innovators.
 
 Her open and public complaints gave encouragement to the factious, and
 those who were the advocates for ancient customs and manners. Her
 conduct, in other respects, by no means made amends for such heavy
 imperfections. The czar was at length obliged to repudiate her in 1696,
 and shut her up in a convent at Susdal, where they obliged her to take
 the veil under the name of Helena.
 
 The son, whom he had by her in 1690, was born unhappily with the
 disposition of his mother, and that disposition received additional
 strength from his very first education. My memoirs say, that he was
 entrusted to the care of superstitious men, who ruined his understanding
 for ever. 'Twas in vain that they hoped to correct these first
 impressions, by giving him foreign preceptors; their very quality of
 being foreigners disgusted him. He was not born destitute of genius; he
 spoke and wrote German well; he had a tolerable notion of designing, and
 understood something of mathematics: but these very memoirs affirm, that
 the reading of ecclesiastical books was the ruin of him. The young
 Alexis imagined he saw in these books a condemnation of every thing
 which his father had done. There were some priests at the head of the
 malcontents, and by the priests he suffered himself to be governed.
 
 They persuaded him that the whole nation looked with horror upon the
 enterprises of Peter; that the frequent illnesses of the czar promised
 but a short life; and that his son could not hope to please the nation,
 but by testifying his aversion for all changes of custom. These murmurs,
 and these counsels, did not break out into an open faction or
 conspiracy, but every thing seemed to tend that way, and the tempers of
 the people were inflamed.
 
 Peter's marriage with Catherine in 1707, and the children which he had
 by her, began to sour the disposition of the young prince. Peter tried
 every method to reclaim him: he even placed him at the head of the
 regency for a year; he sent him to travel; he married him in 1711, at
 the end of the campaign of Pruth, to the princess of Brunswick. This
 marriage was attended with great misfortunes. Alexis, now twenty years
 old, gave himself up to the debauchery of youth, and that boorishness of
 ancient manners he so much delighted in. These irregularities almost
 brutalized him. His wife, despised, ill-treated, wanting even
 necessaries, and deprived of all comforts, languished away in
 disappointment, and died at last of grief, the first of November, 1715.
 
 She left the prince Alexis one son; and according to the natural order,
 this son was one day to become heir to the empire. Peter perceived with
 sorrow, that when he should be no more, all his labours were likely to
 be destroyed by those of his own blood. After the death of the princess,
 he wrote a letter to his son, equally tender and resolute: it finished
 with these words: 'I will still wait a little time, to see if you will
 correct yourself; if not, know that I will cut you off from the
 succession, as we lop off a useless member. Don't imagine, that I mean
 only to intimidate you; don't rely upon the title of being my only son;
 for if I spare not my own life for my country, and the good of my
 people, how shall I spare you? I will rather choose to leave my kingdom
 to a foreigner who deserves it, than to my own son, who makes himself
 unworthy of it.'
 
 This is the letter of a father, but it is still more the letter of a
 legislator; it shews us, besides, that the order of succession was not
 invariably established in Russia, as in other kingdoms, by those
 fundamental laws which take away from fathers the right of disinheriting
 their children; and the czar believed he had an undoubted prerogative to
 dispose of an empire which he had founded.
 
 At this very time the empress Catherine was brought to bed of a prince,
 who died afterwards in 1719. Whether this news sunk the courage of
 Alexis, or whether it was imprudence or bad counsel, he wrote to his
 father, that he renounced the crown, and all hopes of reigning. 'I take
 God to witness,' says he, 'and I swear by my soul that I will never
 pretend to the succession. I put my children into your hands, and I
 desire only a provision for life.'
 
 The czar wrote him a second letter, as follows:[98]--'You speak of the
 succession, as if I stood in need of your consent in the disposal
 thereof. I reproached you with the aversion you have shewn to all kind
 of business, and signified to you, that I was highly dissatisfied with
 your conduct in general; but to these particulars you have given me no
 answer. Paternal exhortations make no impression on you, wherefore I
 resolved to write you this once for the last time. If you despise the
 advice I give you while I am alive, what regard will you pay to them
 after my death? But though you had the inclination at present to be true
 to your promises, yet a corrupt priesthood will be able to turn you at
 pleasure, and force you to falsify them. They have no dependance but
 upon you. You have no sense of gratitude towards him who gave you your
 being. Have you ever assisted him in toils and labours since you arrived
 at the age of maturity? Do you not censure and condemn, nay, even affect
 to hold in detestation, whatever I do for the good of my people? In a
 word, I have reason to conclude, that if you survive me, you will
 overturn every thing that I have done. Take your choice, either
 endeavour to make yourself worthy of the throne, or embrace a monastic
 state. I expect your answer, either in writing, or by word of mouth,
 otherwise I shall treat you as a common malefactor.'
 
 This letter was very severe, and it was easy for the prince to have
 replied, that he would alter his conduct; instead of which, he only
 returned a short answer to his father, desiring permission to turn
 monk.[100]
 
 This resolution appeared altogether unnatural; and it may furnish matter
 of surprise, that the czar should think of travelling, and leaving a son
 at home so obstinate and ill-affected; but, at the same time, his doing
 so, is next to a proof, that he thought he had no reason to apprehend a
 conspiracy from that son.
 
 The czar, before he set out for Germany and France, went to pay his son
 a visit. The prince, who was at that time ill, or at least feigned
 himself so, received his father in his bed, where he protested, with the
 most solemn oaths, that he was ready to retire into a cloister. The czar
 gave him six months to consider of it, and then set out on his travels
 with the czarina.
 
 No sooner was he arrived at Copenhagen, than he heard (what he might
 reasonably expect) that the czarowitz conversed only with factions and
 evil-minded persons, who strove to feed his discontent. Upon this the
 czar wrote to him, that he had to choose between a throne and a convent;
 and that, if he had any thoughts of succeeding him, he must immediately
 set out and join him at Copenhagen.
 
 But the confidants of the prince remonstrating to him how dangerous it
 would be to trust himself in a place where he could have no friends to
 advise him, and where he would be exposed to the anger of an incensed
 father, and the machinations of a revengeful step-mother; he, under
 pretence of going to join his father at Copenhagen, took the road to
 Vienna, and threw himself under the protection of the emperor Charles
 VI. his brother-in-law, intending to remain at his court till the death
 of the czar.
 
 This adventure of the czarowitz was nearly the same as that of Lewis XI.
 of France, who, when he was dauphin, quitted the court of his father
 Charles VII. and took refuge with the duke of Burgundy; but the dauphin
 was much more culpable than Alexis, inasmuch as he married in direct
 opposition to his father's will, raised an army against him, and threw
 himself into the arms of a prince, who was Charles's declared enemy, and
 refused to hearken to the repeated remonstances of his father, to return
 back to his court.
 
 The czarowitz, on the contrary, had married only in compliance with his
 father's orders, had never rebelled against him, nor raised an army, nor
 taken refuge in the dominions of an enemy, and returned to throw himself
 at his feet, upon the very first letter he received from him; for, as
 soon as Peter knew that his son had been at Vienna, and had afterwards
 retired to Tyrol, and from thence to Naples, which, at that time,
 belonged to the emperor, he dispatched Romanzoff, a captain of his
 guards, and the privy-counsellor Tolstoy, with a letter written with his
 own hand, and dated at Spa, the 21st of July, N. S. 1717. They found the
 prince at Naples, in the castle of St. Elme, and delivered to him his
 father's letter, which was as follows:--
 
 'I now write to you for the last time, to acquaint you, that you must
 instantly comply with my orders, which will be communicated to you by
 Tolstoy and Romanzoff. If you obey, I give you my sacred word and
 promise, that I will not punish you; and that, if you will return home,
 I will love you more than ever; but, if you do not, I, as your father,
 and in virtue of the authority which God has given me over you, denounce
 against you my eternal curse; and, as your sovereign, declare to you,
 that I will find means to punish your disobedience, in which I trust God
 himself will assist me, and espouse the just cause of an injured parent
 and king.
 
 'For the rest, remember that I have never laid any restraint upon you.
 Was I obliged to leave you at liberty to choose your way of life? Had I
 not the power in my own hands to oblige you to conform to my will? I had
 only to command, and make myself obeyed.'
 
 The viceroy of Naples found it no difficult matter to persuade the
 czarowitz to return to his father. This is an incontestable proof that
 the emperor had no intention to enter into any engagements with the
 prince, that might give umbrage to his father. Alexis therefore returned
 with the envoys, bringing with him his mistress, Aphrosyne, who had been
 the companion of his elopement.
 
 We may consider the czarowitz as an ill-advised young man, who had gone
 to Vienna and to Naples, instead of going to Copenhagen, agreeable to
 the orders of his father and sovereign. Had he been guilty of no other
 crime than this, which is common enough with young and giddy persons, it
 was certainly very excusable. The prince determined to return to his
 father, on the faith of his having taken God to witness, that he not
 only would pardon him, but that he would love him better than ever. But
 it appears by the instructions given to the two envoys who went to fetch
 him, and even by the czar's own letter, that his father required him to
 declare the persons who had been his counsellors, and also to fulfil
 the oath he had made of renouncing the succession.
 
 It seemed difficult to reconcile this exclusion of the czarowitz from
 the succession, with the other part of the oath, by which the czar had
 bound himself in his letter, namely that of loving his son better than
 ever. Perhaps divided between paternal love, and the justice he owed to
 himself and people, as a sovereign, he might limit the renewal of his
 affection to his son in a convent, instead of to that son on a throne:
 perhaps, likewise, he was in hopes to reduce him to reason, and to
 render him worthy of the succession at last, by making him sensible of
 the loss of a crown which he had forfeited by his own indiscretion. In a
 circumstance so uncommon, so intricate, and so afflicting, it may be
 easily supposed that the minds of both father and son were under equal
 perturbation, and hardly consistent with themselves.
 
 The prince arrived at Moscow on the 13th of February, N. S. 1717; and
 the same day went to throw himself at his father's feet, who was
 returned to the city from his travels. They had a long conference
 together, and a report was immediately spread through the city, that the
 prince and his father were reconciled, and that all past transactions
 were buried in oblivion. But the next day, orders were issued for the
 regiments of guards to be under arms at break of day, and for all the
 czar's ministers, boyards, and counsellors, to repair to the great hall
 of the castle; as also for the prelates, together with two monks of St.
 Basile, professors of divinity, to assemble in the cathedral, at the
 tolling of the great bell. The unhappy prince was then conducted to the
 great castle like a prisoner, and being come in his father's presence,
 threw himself in tears at his feet, and presented a writing, containing
 a confession of his faults, declaring himself unworthy of the
 succession, and imploring only that his life might be spared.[101]
 
 The czar, raising up his son, withdrew with him into a private room,
 where he put many questions to him, declaring to him at the same time,
 that if he concealed any one circumstance relating to his elopement, his
 life should answer for it. The prince was then brought back to the great
 hall, where the council was assembled, and the czar's declaration, which
 had been previously prepared, was there publicly read in his
 presence.[102]
 
 In this piece the czar reproaches his son with all those faults we have
 before related, namely, his little application to study, his connexions
 with the favourers of the ancient customs and manners of the country,
 and his ill-behaviour to his wife.--'He has even violated the conjugal
 faith,' saith the czar in his manifesto, 'by giving his affection to a
 prostitute of the most servile and low condition, during the life-time
 of his lawful spouse.' It is certain that Peter himself had repudiated
 his own wife in favour of a captive, but that captive was a person of
 exemplary merit, and the czar had just cause for discontent against his
 wife, who was at the same time his subject. The czarowitz, on the
 contrary, had abandoned his princess for a young woman, hardly known to
 any one, and who had no other merit but that of personal charms. So far
 there appears some errors of a young man, which a parent ought to
 reprimand in secret, and which he might have pardoned.
 
 The czar, in his manifesto, next reproaches his son with his flight to
 Vienna, and his having put himself under the emperor's protection; and
 adds, that he had calumniated his father, by telling the emperor that he
 was persecuted by him; and that he had compelled him to renounce the
 succession; and, lastly, that he had made intercession with the emperor
 to assist him with an armed force.
 
 Here it immediately occurs, that the emperor could not, with any
 propriety, have entered into a war with the czar on such an occasion;
 nor could he have interposed otherwise between an incensed father and a
 disobedient son, than by his good offices to promote a reconciliation.
 Accordingly we find, that Charles VI. contented himself with giving a
 temporary asylum to the fugitive prince, and readily sent him back on
 the first requisition of the czar, in consequence of being informed of
 the place his son had chosen for his retreat.
 
 Peter adds, in this terrible piece, that Alexis had persuaded the
 emperor, that he went in danger of his life, if he returned back to
 Russia. Surely it was in some measure justifying these complaints of the
 prince, to condemn him to death at his return, and especially after so
 solemn a promise to pardon him; but we shall see, in the course of this
 history, the cause which afterwards moved the czar to denounce this
 ever-memorable sentence. For the present let us turn our eyes upon an
 absolute prince, pleading against his son before an august assembly.--
 
 'In this manner,' says he, 'has our son returned; and although, by his
 withdrawing himself and raising calumnies against us, he has deserved to
 be punished with death, yet, out of our paternal affection, we pardon
 his crimes; but, considering his unworthiness, and the series of his
 irregular conduct, we cannot in conscience leave him the succession to
 the throne of Russia; foreseeing that, by his vicious courses, he would,
 after our decease, entirely destroy the glory of our nation, and the
 safety of our dominions, which we have recovered from the enemy.
 
 'Now, as we should pity our states and our faithful subjects, if, by
 such a successor, we should throw them back into a much worse condition
 than ever they were yet; so, by the paternal authority, and, in quality
 of sovereign prince, in consideration of the safety of our dominions, we
 do deprive our said son Alexis, for his crimes and unworthiness, of the
 succession after us to our throne of Russia, even though there should
 not remain one single person of our family after us.
 
 'And we do constitute and declare successor to the said throne after us,
 our second son, Peter,[103] though yet very young, having no successor
 that is older.
 
 'We lay upon our said son Alexis our paternal curse, if ever at any time
 he pretends to, or reclaims, the said succession.
 
 'And we desire our faithful subjects, whether ecclesiastics or seculars,
 of all ranks and conditions, and the whole Russian nation, in conformity
 to this constitution and our will, to acknowledge and consider our son
 Peter, appointed by us to succeed, as lawful successor, and agreeably to
 this our constitution, to confirm the whole by oath before the holy
 altar, upon the holy gospel, kissing the cross.
 
 'And all those who shall ever at any time oppose this our will, and who,
 from this day forward, shall dare to consider our son Alexis as
 successor, or assist him for that purpose, declare them traitors to us
 and our country. And we have ordered that these presents shall be every
 where published and promulgated, to the end that no person may pretend
 ignorance.'
 
 It would seem that this declaration had been prepared beforehand for the
 occasion, or that it had been drawn up with astonishing dispatch: for
 the czarowitz did not return to Moscow till the 13th of February, and
 his renunciation in favour of the empress Catherine's son is dated the
 14th.
 
 The prince on his part signed his renunciation, whereby he acknowledges
 his exclusion to be just, as having merited it by his own fault and
 unworthiness; 'And I do hereby swear,' adds he, 'in presence of God
 Almighty in the Holy Trinity, to submit in all things to my father's
 will,' &c.
 
 These instruments being signed, the czar went in procession to the
 cathedral, where they were read a second time, when the whole body of
 clergy signed their approbation with their seals at the bottom, to a
 copy prepared for that purpose.[104] No prince was ever disinherited in
 so authentic a manner. There are many states in which an act of this
 kind would be of no validity; but in Russia, as in ancient Rome, every
 father has a power of depriving his son of his succession, and this
 power was still stronger in a sovereign than in a private subject, and
 especially in such a sovereign as Peter.
 
 But, nevertheless, it was to be apprehended, that those who had
 encouraged the prince in his opposition to his father's will, and had
 advised him to withdraw himself from his court, might one day endeavour
 to set aside a renunciation which had been procured by force, and
 restore to the eldest son that crown which had been violently snatched
 from him to place on the head of a younger brother by a second marriage.
 In this case it was easy to foresee a civil war, and a total subversion
 of all the great and useful projects which Peter had so much laboured to
 establish; and therefore the present matter in question was to determine
 between the welfare of near eighteen millions of souls (which was nearly
 the number which the empire of Russia contained at that time), and the
 interest of a single person incapable of governing. Hence it became
 necessary to find out those who were disaffected, and accordingly the
 czar a second time threatened his son with the most fatal consequences
 if he concealed any thing: and the prince was obliged to undergo a
 judicial examination by his father, and afterwards by the commissioners
 appointed for that purpose.
 
 One principal article of the charge brought against him, and that which
 served chiefly to his condemnation, was, a letter from one Beyer, the
 emperor's resident at the court of Russia, dated at Petersburg, after
 the flight of the prince. This letter makes mention of a mutiny in the
 Russian army then assembled at Mecklenburg, and that several officers
 talked of clapping up Catherine and her son in the prison where the late
 empress, whom Peter had repudiated, was then confined, and of placing
 the czarowitz on the throne, as soon as he could be found out and
 brought back. These idle projects fell to the ground of themselves, and
 there was not the least appearance that Alexis had ever countenanced
 them. The whole was only a piece of news related by a foreigner; the
 letter itself was not directed to the prince, and he had only a copy
 thereof transmitted him while at Vienna.
 
 But a charge of a more grievous nature appeared against him, namely, the
 heads of a letter written with his own hand, and which he had sent,
 while at the court of Vienna, to the senators and prelates of Russia, in
 which were the following very strong assertions:--'The continual
 ill-treatment which I have suffered without having deserved it, have at
 length obliged me to consult my peace and safety by flight. I have
 narrowly escaped being confined in a convent, by those who have already
 served my mother in the same manner. I am now under the protection of a
 great prince, and I beseech you not to abandon me in this conjuncture.'
 
 The expression, _in this conjuncture_, which might be construed into a
 seditious meaning, appeared to have been blotted out, and then inserted
 again by his own hand, and afterwards blotted out a second time; which
 shewed it to be the action of a young man disturbed in his mind,
 following the dictates of his resentment, and repenting of it at the
 very instant. There were only the copies of these letters found: they
 were never sent to the persons they were designed for, the court of
 Vienna having taken care to stop them; a convincing proof that the
 emperor never intended to break with the czar, or to assist the son to
 take up arms against his father.
 
 Several witnesses were brought to confront the prince, and one of them,
 named Afanassief, deposed, that he had formerly heard him speak these
 words,--'I shall mention something to the bishops, who will mention it
 again to the lower clergy, and they to the parish priests, and the crown
 will be placed on my head whether I will or not.'
 
 His own mistress, Aphrosyne, was likewise brought to give evidence
 against him. The charge, however, was not well supported in all its
 parts; there did not appear to have been any regular plan formed, any
 chain of intrigues, or any thing like a conspiration or combination, nor
 the least shadow of preparation for a change in the government. The
 whole affair was that of a son, of a depraved and factious disposition,
 who thought himself injured by his father, who fled from him, and who
 wished for his death; but this son was heir to the greatest monarchy in
 our hemisphere, and in his situation and place he could not be guilty of
 trivial faults.
 
 After the accusations of his mistress, another witness was brought
 against him, in relation to the former czarina his mother, and the
 princess Mary his sister. He was charged with having consulted the
 former in regard to his flight, and of having mentioned it to the
 princess Mary. The bishop of Rostow, who was the confidant of all three,
 having been seized, deposed, that the two princesses, who were then shut
 up in a convent, had expressed their wishes for a revolution in affairs
 that might restore them their liberty, and had even encouraged the
 prince, by their advice, to withdraw himself out of the kingdom. The
 more natural their resentment was, the more it was to be apprehended. We
 shall see, at the end of this chapter, what kind of a person the bishop
 of Rostow was, and what had been his conduct.
 
 The czarowitz at first denied several facts of this nature which were
 alleged against him, and by this very behaviour subjected himself to the
 punishment of death, with which his father had threatened him in case he
 did not make an open and sincere confession.
 
 At last, however, he acknowledged several disrespectful expressions
 against his father, which were laid to his charge, but excused himself
 by saying, he had been hurried away by passion and drink.
 
 The czar himself drew up several new interrogations. The fourth ran as
 follows:--
 
 'When you found by Beyer's letter that there was a mutiny among the
 troops in Mecklenburg, you seemed pleased with it; you must certainly
 have had some reason for it; and I imagine you would have joined the
 rebels even during my life-time?'
 
 This was interrogating the prince on the subject of his private
 thoughts, which, though they might be revealed to a father, who may, by
 his advice, correct them, yet might they also with justice be concealed
 from a judge, who decides only upon acknowledged facts. The private
 sentiments of a man's heart have nothing to do in a criminal process,
 and the prince was at liberty either to deny them or disguise them, in
 such manner as he should think best for his own safety, as being under
 no obligation to lay open his heart, and yet we find him returning the
 following answer: 'If the rebels had called upon me during your
 life-time, I do verily believe I should have joined them, supposing I
 had found them sufficiently strong.'
 
 It is hardly conceivable that he could have made this reply of himself,
 and it would be full as extraordinary, at least according to the custom
 in our part of the world, to condemn a person for confessing that he
 might have thought in a certain manner in a conjuncture that never
 happened.
 
 To this strange confession of his private thoughts, which had till then
 been concealed in the bottom of his heart, they added proofs that could
 hardly be admitted as such in a court of justice in any other country.
 
 The prince, sinking under his misfortunes, and almost deprived of his
 senses, studied within himself, with all the ingenuity of fear, for
 whatever could most effectually serve for his destruction; and at length
 acknowledged, that in private confession to the archpriest James, he had
 wished his father dead; and that his confessor made answer, 'God will
 pardon you this wish: we all wish the same.'
 
 The canons of our church do not admit of proofs resulting from private
 confession, inasmuch as they are held inviolable secrets between God and
 the penitent: and both the Greek and Latin churches are agreed, that
 this intimate and secret correspondence between a sinner and the Deity
 are beyond the cognizance of a temporal court of justice. But here the
 welfare of a kingdom and a king were concerned. The archpriest, being
 put to the torture, confirmed all that the prince had revealed; and this
 trial furnished the unprecedented instance of a confessor accused by his
 penitent, and that penitent by his own mistress. To this may be added
 another singular circumstance, namely, the archbishop of Rezan having
 been involved in several accusations on account of having spoken too
 favourably of the young czarowitz in one of his sermons, at the time
 that his father's resentment first broke out against him; that weak
 prince declared, in his answer to one of the interrogations, that he had
 depended on the assistance of that prelate, at the same time that he was
 at the head of the ecclesiastical court, which the czar had consulted in
 relation to this criminal process against his son, as we shall see in
 the course of this chapter.
 
 There is another remark to be made in this extraordinary trial, which we
 find so very lamely related in the absurd History of Peter the Great, by
 the pretended bojar Nestersuranoy, and that is the following:
 
 Among other answers which the czarowitz Alexis made to the first
 question put to him by his father, he acknowledges, that while he was at
 Vienna, finding that he could not be admitted to see the emperor, he
 applied himself to count Schonborn, the high chamberlain, who told him,
 the emperor would not abandon him, and that as soon as occasion should
 offer, by the death of his father, that he would assist him to recover
 the throne by force of arms. 'Upon which,' adds the prince, 'I made him
 the following answer: "This is what I by no means desire: if the emperor
 will only grant me his protection for the present, I ask no more."' This
 deposition is plain, natural, and carries with it strong marks of the
 truth; for it would have been the height of madness to have asked the
 emperor for an armed force to dethrone his father, and no one would have
 ventured to have made such an absurd proposal, either to the emperor,
 prince Eugene, or to the council. This deposition bears date in the
 month of February, and four months afterwards, namely, after the 1st of
 July, and towards the latter end of the proceedings against the
 czarowitz, that prince is made to say, in the last answers he delivered
 in writing:--
 
 'Being unwilling to imitate my father in any thing, I endeavoured to
 secure myself the succession by any means whatever, _excepting such as
 were just_. I attempted to get it by a foreign assistance; and, had I
 succeeded, and that the emperor had fulfilled _what he had promised me_,
 to replace me on the throne of Russia even by force of arms, I would
 have left nothing undone to have got possession of it. For instance, if
 the emperor had demanded of me, in return for his services, a body of my
 own troops to fight for him against any power whatever, that might be in
 arms against him, or a large sum of money to defray the charges of a
 war, I should have readily granted every thing he asked, and should have
 gratified his ministers and generals with magnificent presents. I would
 at my own expense have maintained the auxiliary troops he might have
 furnished to put me in possession of the crown; and, in a word, I should
 have thought nothing too much to have accomplished my ends.'
 
 This answer seems greatly strained, and appears as if the unhappy
 deponent was exerting his utmost efforts to appear more culpable than he
 really was; nay, he seems to have spoken absolutely contrary to truth in
 a capital point. He says the emperor had promised to procure him the
 crown by force of arms. This is absolutely false: Schonborn had given
 him hopes that, after the death of his father, the emperor might assist
 him to recover his birth-right; but the emperor himself never made him
 any promise. And lastly, the matter in question was not if he should
 take arms against his father, but if he should succeed him after his
 death?
 
 By this last deposition he declares what he believes he should have
 done, had he been obliged to dispute his birth-right, which he had not
 formally renounced till after his journey to Vienna and Naples. Here
 then we have a second deposition, not of any thing he had already done,
 and the actual commission of which, would have subjected him to the
 rigorous inquiry of the law, but of what he imagines he should have done
 had occasion offered, and which consequently is no subject of a
 juridical inquiry. Thus does he twice together accuse himself of private
 thoughts that he might have entertained in a future time. The known
 world does not produce an instance of a man tried and condemned for
 vague and inconsequential notions that came into his head, and which he
 never communicated to any one; nor is there a court of justice in Europe
 that will hear a man accuse himself of criminal thoughts; nay, we
 believe that they are not punished by God himself, unless accompanied by
 a fixed resolution to put them in practice.
 
 To these natural reflections it may be answered, that the czarowitz had
 given his father a just right to punish him, by having withheld the
 names of several of the accomplices of his flight. His pardon was
 promised him only on condition of making a full and open confession,
 which he did not till it was too late. Lastly, after so public an
 affair, it was not in human nature that Alexis should ever forgive a
 brother in favour of whom he had been disinherited; therefore, it was
 thought better to punish one guilty person, than to expose a whole
 nation to danger, and herein the rigour of justice and reasons of state
 acted in concert.
 
 We must not judge of the manners and laws of one nation by those of
 others. The czar was possessed of the fatal, but incontestable right of
 punishing his son with death, for the single crime of having withdrawn
 himself out of the kingdom against his consent; and he thus explains
 himself in his declaration addressed to the prelates and others, who
 composed the high courts of justice. 'Though, according to all laws,
 civil and divine, and especially those of this empire, which grant an
 absolute jurisdiction to fathers over their children (even fathers in
 private life) we have a full and unlimited power to judge our son for
 his crimes according to our pleasure, without asking the advice of any
 person whatsoever: yet, as men are more liable to prejudice and
 partiality in their own affairs, than in those of others, and as the
 most eminent and expert physicians rely not on their judgment concerning
 themselves, but call in the advice and assistance of others; so we,
 under the fear of God, and an awful dread of offending him, in like
 manner make known our disease, and apply to you for a cure; being
 apprehensive of eternal death, if ignorant perhaps of the nature of our
 distemper, we should attempt to cure ourselves; and the rather as in a
 solemn appeal to Almighty God, I have signed, sworn, and confirmed a
 promise of pardon to my son, in case he should declare to me the truth.
 
 'And though he has violated this promise, by concealing the most
 important circumstances of his rebellious design against us; yet that we
 may not in any thing swerve from our obligations, we pray you to
 consider this affair with seriousness and attention, and report what
 punishment he deserves without favour or partiality either to him or
 me; for should you apprehend that he deserves but a slight punishment,
 it will be disagreeable to me. I swear to you by the great God and his
 judgments, that you have nothing to fear on this head.
 
 'Neither let the reflection of your being to pass sentence on the son of
 your prince have any influence on you, but administer justice without
 respect of persons, and destroy not your own souls and mine also, by
 doing any thing to injure our country, or upbraid our consciences in the
 great and terrible day of judgment.'
 
 The czar afterwards addressed himself to the clergy,[105] by another
 declaration to the same purpose; so that every thing was transacted in
 the most authentic manner, and Peter's behaviour through the whole of
 this affair was so open and undisguised, as shewed him to be fully
 satisfied of the justice of his cause.
 
 On the first of July the clergy delivered their opinion in writing. In
 fact, it was their opinion only, and not a judgment, which the czar
 required of them. The beginning is deserving the attention of all
 Europe.
 
 'This affair (say the prelates and the rest of the clergy) does in no
 wise fall within the verge of the ecclesiastical court, nor is the
 absolute power invested in the sovereign of the Russian empire subject
 to the cognizance of his people; but he has an unlimited power of acting
 herein as to him shall seem best, without any inferior having a right to
 intermeddle therein.'
 
 After their preamble they proceed to cite several texts of scripture,
 particularly Leviticus, wherein it is said, 'Cursed be he that curseth
 his father or mother;' and the gospel of St. Matthew, which repeats this
 severe denunciation. And they concluded, after several other
 quotations,[106] with these remarkable words:
 
 'If his majesty is inclinable to punish the offender according to his
 deeds and the measure of his crimes, he has before him the examples in
 the Old Testament, if on the other hand, he is inclined to shew mercy,
 he has a pattern in our Lord Jesus Christ, who receives the prodigal
 son, when returning with a contrite heart, who set free the woman taken
 in adultery, whom the law sentenced to be stoned to death, and who
 prefers mercy to burnt-offerings. He has likewise the example of David,
 who spared his son Absalom, who had rebelled against and persecuted him,
 saying to his captains, when going forth to the fight, "Spare my son
 Absalom." The father was here inclinable to mercy, but divine Justice
 suffered not the offender to go unpunished.
 
 'The heart of the czar is in the hands of God; let him take that side to
 which it shall please the Almighty to direct him.'
 
 This opinion was signed by eight archbishops and bishops, four
 archpriests, and two professors of divinity; and, as we have already
 observed, the metropolitan archbishop of Rezan, the same with whom the
 prince had held a correspondence, was the first who signed.
 
 As soon as the clergy had signed this opinion, they presented it to the
 czar. It is easy to perceive that this body was desirous of inclining
 his mind to clemency; and nothing can be more beautiful than the
 contrast between the mercy of Jesus Christ, and the rigour of the Jewish
 law, placed before the eyes of a father, who was the prosecutor of his
 own son.
 
 The same day the czarowitz was again examined for the last time, and
 signed his final confession in writing, wherein he acknowledges himself
 'to have been a bigot in his youthful days, to have frequented the
 company of priests and monks, to have drank with them, and to have
 imbibed from their conversations the first impressions of dislike to the
 duties of his station, and even to the person of his father.'
 
 If he made this confession of his own accord, it shews that he must have
 been ignorant of the mild advice the body of clergy, whom he thus
 accuses, had lately given his father; and it is a still stronger proof,
 how great a change the czar had wrought in the manners of the clergy of
 his time, who, from a state of the most deplorable ignorance, were in so
 short a time become capable of drawing up a writing, which for its
 wisdom and eloquence might have been owned, without a blush, by the most
 illustrious fathers of the church.
 
 It is in this last confession that the czarowitz made that declaration
 on which we have already commented, viz. that he endeavoured to secure
 to himself the succession by any means whatever, except such as were
 just.
 
 One would imagine, by this last confession, that the prince was
 apprehensive he had not rendered himself sufficiently criminal in the
 eyes of his judges, by his former self-accusations, and that, by giving
 himself the character of a dissembler and a bad man, and supposing how
 he might have acted had he been the master, he was carefully studying
 how to justify the fatal sentence which was about to be pronounced
 against him, and which was done on the 5th of July. This sentence will
 be found, at length, at the end of this volume; therefore, we shall only
 observe in this place that it begins, like the opinion of the clergy, by
 declaring, that 'it belongs not to subjects to take cognizance of such
 an affair, which depends solely on the absolute will of the sovereign,
 whose authority is derived from God alone;' and then, after having set
 forth the several articles of the charge brought against the prince, the
 judges express themselves thus: 'What shall we think of a rebellious
 design, almost unparalleled in history, joined to that of a horrid
 parricide against him, who was his father in a double capacity?'
 
 Probably these words have been wrong translated from the trial printed
 by order of the czar; for certainly there have been instances in history
 of much greater rebellions; and no part of the proceedings against the
 czarowitz discover any design in him of killing his father. Perhaps, by
 the word parricide, is understood the deposition made by the prince,
 that one day he declared at confession, that he had wished for the death
 of his father. But, how can a private declaration of a secret thought,
 under the seal of confession, be a double parricide?
 
 Be this as it may, the czarowitz was unanimously condemned to die, but
 no mention was made in the sentence of the manner in which he was to
 suffer. Of one hundred and forty-four judges, there was not one who
 thought of a lesser punishment than death. Whereas, an English tract,
 which made a great noise at that time, observes, that if such a cause
 had been brought before an English parliament, there would not have been
 one judge out of one hundred and forty-four, that would have inflicted
 even a penalty.
 
 There cannot be a stronger proof of the difference of times and places.
 The consul Manlius would have been condemned by the laws of England to
 lose his own life, for having put his son to death; whereas he was
 admired and extolled for that action by the rigid Romans: but the same
 laws would not punish a prince of Wales for leaving the kingdom, who, as
 a peer of the realm, has a right to go and come when he pleases.[107] A
 criminal design, not perpetrated, is not punishable by the laws in
 England[108] or France, but it is in Russia. A continued formal and
 repeated disobedience of commands would, amongst us, be considered only
 an error in conduct, which ought to be suppressed; but, in Russia, it
 was judged a capital crime in the heir of a great empire, whose ruin
 might have been the consequence of that disobedience. Lastly, the
 czarowitz was culpable towards the whole nation, by his design of
 throwing it back into that state of darkness and ignorance, from which
 his father had so lately delivered it.
 
 Such was the acknowledged power of the czar, that he might put his son
 to death for disobedience to him, without consulting any one;
 nevertheless, he submitted the affair to the judgment of the
 representatives of the nation, so that it was in fact the nation itself
 who passed sentence on the prince; and Peter was so well satisfied with
 the equity of his own conduct, that he voluntarily submitted it to the
 judgment of every other nation, by causing the whole proceedings to be
 printed and translated into several languages.
 
 The law of history would not permit us to disguise or palliate aught in
 the relation of this tragic event. All Europe was divided in its
 sentiments, whether most to pity a young prince, prosecuted by his own
 father, and condemned to lose his life, by those who were one day to
 have been his subjects; or the father, who thought himself under a
 necessity to sacrifice his own son to the welfare of his nation.
 
 It was asserted in several books, published on this subject, that the
 czar sent to Spain for a copy of the proceedings against Don Carlos, who
 had been condemned to death by his father, king Philip II. But this is
 false, inasmuch as Don Carlos was never brought to his trial: the
 conduct of Peter I. was totally different from that of Philip. The
 Spanish monarch never made known to the world the reasons for which he
 had confined his son, nor in what manner that prince died. He wrote
 letters on this occasion to the pope and the empress, which were
 absolutely contradictory to each other. William prince of Orange accused
 Philip publicly of having sacrificed his son and his wife to his
 jealousy, and to have behaved rather like a jealous and cruel husband,
 and an unnatural and murderous father, than a severe and upright judge.
 Philip suffered this accusation against him to pass unanswered: Peter,
 on the contrary, did nothing but in the eye of the world; he openly
 declared, that he preferred his people to his own son, submitted his
 cause to the judgment of the principal persons of his kingdom, and made
 the whole world the judge of their proceedings and his own.
 
 There was another extraordinary circumstance attending this unhappy
 affair, which was, that the empress Catherine, who was hated by the
 czarowitz, and whom he had publicly threatened with the worst of
 treatment, whenever he should mount the throne, was not in any way
 accessary to his misfortunes; and was neither accused, nor even
 suspected by any foreign minister residing at the court of Russia, of
 having taken the least step against a son-in-law, from whom she had so
 much to fear. It is true, indeed, that no one pretends to say she
 interceded with the czar for his pardon: but all the accounts of these
 times, and especially those of the count de Bassewitz, agree, that she
 was greatly affected with his misfortunes.
 
 I have now before me the memoirs of a public minister, in which I find
 the following words: 'I was present when the czar told the duke of
 Holstein, that the czarina Catherine, had begged of him to prevent the
 sentence passed upon the czarowitz, being publicly read to that prince.
 'Content yourself,' said she, 'with obliging him to turn monk; for this
 public and formal condemnation of your son will reflect an odium on your
 grandson.'
 
 The czar, however, would not hearken to the intercession of his spouse;
 he thought there was a necessity to have the sentence publicly read to
 the prince himself, in order that he might have no pretence left to
 dispute this solemn act, in which he himself acquiesced, and that being
 dead in law, he could never after claim a right to the crown.
 
 Nevertheless, if, after the death of Peter, a formidable party had arose
 in favour of Alexis, would his being dead in law have prevented him from
 ascending the throne?
 
 The prince then had his sentence read to him: and the memoirs I have
 just mentioned observe, that he fell into a fit on hearing these words:
 'The laws divine and ecclesiastical, civil and military, condemn to
 death, without mercy, those whose attempts against their father and
 their sovereign have been fully proved.' These fits it is said, turned
 to an apoplexy, and it was with great difficulty he was recovered at
 that time. Afterwards, when he came a little to himself, and in the
 dreadful interval, between life and death, he sent for his father to
 come to him: the czar accordingly went, and both father and son burst
 into a flood of tears. The unhappy culprit asked his offended parent's
 forgiveness, which he gave him publicly: then, being in the agonies of
 death, extreme unction was administered to him in the most solemn
 manner, and soon after he expired in the presence of the whole court,
 the day after the fatal sentence had been pronounced upon him. His body
 was immediately carried to the cathedral, where it lay in state, exposed
 to public view for four days, after which it was interred in the church
 of the citadel, by the side of his late princess; the czar and czarina
 assisting at the funeral.
 
 And here I think myself indispensably obliged to imitate, in some
 measure, the conduct of the czar; that is to say, to submit to the
 judgment of the public, the several facts which I have related with the
 most scrupulous exactness, and not only the facts themselves, but
 likewise the various reports which were propagated in relation to them,
 by authors of the first credit. Lamberti, the most impartial of any
 writer on this subject and at the same time the most exact, and who has
 confined himself to the simple narrative of the original and authentic
 pieces, relating to the affairs of Europe, seems in this matter to have
 departed from that impartiality and discernment for which he is so
 remarkable; for he thus expresses himself.
 
 'The czarina, ever anxious for the fortune of her own son, did not
 suffer the czar to rest till she had obliged him to commence the
 proceedings against the czarowitz, and to prosecute that unhappy prince
 to death: and, what is still more extraordinary, the czar, after having
 given him the knout (which is a kind of torture) with his own hand, was
 himself his executioner, by cutting off his head, which was afterwards
 so artfully joined to the body, that the separation could not be
 perceived, when it was exposed to public view. Some little time
 afterwards, the czarina's son died, to the inexpressible regret of her
 and the czar. This latter, who had beheaded his own son, coming now to
 reflect, that he had no successor, grew exceedingly ill-tempered. Much
 about that time also, he was informed, that his spouse, the czarina, was
 engaged in a secret and criminal correspondence with prince Menzikoff.
 This, joined to the reflection, that she had been the cause of his
 putting to death with his own hand his eldest son, made him conceive a
 design to strip her of the imperial honours, and shut her up in a
 convent, in the same manner as he had done his first wife, who is still
 living there. It was a custom with the czar to keep a kind of diary of
 his private thoughts in his pocket book, and he had accordingly entered
 therein a memorandum of this his intention. The czarina having found
 means to gain over to her interest all the pages of the czar's
 bed-chamber, one of them finding his pocket-book, which he had
 carelessly left on the table, brought it to Catherine, who upon reading
 this memorandum, immediately sent for prince Menzikoff, and communicated
 it to him, and, in a day or two afterwards, the czar was seized with a
 violent distemper, of which he died. This distemper was attributed to
 poison, on account of its being so sudden and violent, that it could not
 be supposed to proceed from a natural cause, and that the horrible act
 of poisoning was but too frequently used in Russia.'
 
 These accusations, thus handed down by Lamberti, were soon spread
 throughout Europe; and, as there still exist a great number of pieces,
 both in print and manuscript, which may give a sanction to the belief of
 this fact to the latest posterity, I think it is my duty to mention, in
 this place, what is come to my knowledge from unexceptionable authority.
 
 In the first place, then, I take it upon me to declare, that the person
 who furnished Lamberti with this strange anecdote, was in fact a native
 of Russia, but of a foreign extraction, and who himself did not reside
 in that country, at the time this event happened, having left it several
 years before. I was formerly acquainted with him; he had been in company
 with Lamberti, at the little town of Nyon,[109] whither that writer had
 retired, and where I myself have often been. This very man declared to
 me, that he had never told this story to Lamberti, but in the light of a
 report, which had been handed about at that time.
 
 This example may suffice to shew, how easy it was in former times,
 before the art of printing was found out, for one man to destroy the
 reputation of another, in the minds of whole nations, by reason that
 manuscript histories were in a few hands only, and not exposed
 to general examination and censure, or of the observations of
 contemporaries, as they now are. A single line in Tacitus or Sallust,
 nay, even in the authors of the most fabulous legends was enough to
 render a great prince odious to the half of mankind, and to perpetuate
 his name with infamy to successive generations.
 
 How was it possible that the czar could have beheaded his son with his
 own hand, when extreme unction was administered to the latter in the
 presence of the whole court? Was he dead when the sacred oil was poured
 upon his head? When or how could this dissevered head have been rejoined
 to its trunk? It is notorious, that the prince was not left alone a
 single moment, from the first reading of his sentence to him to the
 instant of his death.
 
 Besides, this story of the czar's having had recourse to the sword,
 acquits him at least of having made use of poison. I will allow, that it
 is somewhat uncommon, that a young man in the vigour of his days should
 die of a sudden fright, occasioned by hearing the sentence of his own
 death read to him, and especially when it was a sentence that he
 expected; but, after all, physicians will tell us that this is not a
 thing impossible.
 
 If the czar dispatched his son by poison, as so many authors would
 persuade us, he by that means deprived himself of every advantage he
 might expect from this fatal process, in convincing all Europe that he
 had a right to punish every delinquent. He rendered all the reasons for
 pronouncing the condemnation of the czarowitz suspected; and, in fact,
 accused himself. If he was desirous of the death of his son, he was in
 possession of full power to have caused the sentence to be put in
 execution: would a man of any prudence then, would a sovereign, on whom
 the eyes of all his neighbours were fixed, have taken the base and
 dastardly method of poisoning the person, over whose devoted head he
 himself already held the sword of justice? Lastly, would he have
 suffered his memory to have been transmitted to posterity as an assassin
 and a poisoner, when he could so easily have assumed the character of an
 upright though severe judge?
 
 It appears then, from all that has been delivered on this subject in the
 preceding pages, that Peter was more the king than the parent; and that
 he sacrificed his own son to the sentiments of the father and lawgiver
 of his country, and to the interest of his people, who, without this
 wholesome severity, were on the verge of relapsing again into that state
 from which he had taken them. It is evident that he did not sacrifice
 this son to the ambition of a step-mother, or to the son he had by her,
 since he had often threatened the czarowitz to disinherit him, before
 Catherine brought him that other son, whose infirm infancy gave signs of
 a speedy death, which actually happened in a very short time afterwards.
 Had Peter taken this important step merely to please his wife, he must
 have been a fool, a madman, or a coward; neither of which, most
 certainly, could be laid to his charge. But he foresaw what would be the
 fate of his establishments, and of his new-born nation, if he had such a
 successor as would not adopt his views. The event has verified this
 foresight: the Russian empire is become famous and respectable
 throughout Europe, from which it was before entirely separated; whereas,
 had the czarowitz succeeded to the throne, every thing would have been
 destroyed. In fine, when this catastrophe comes to be seriously
 considered, the compassionate heart shudders, and the rigid applauds.
 
 This great and terrible event is still fresh in the memories of mankind;
 and it is frequently spoken of as a matter of so much surprise, that it
 is absolutely necessary to examine what contemporary writers have said
 of it. One of these hireling scribblers, who has taken on him the title
 of historian, speaks thus of it in a work which he has dedicated to
 count Bruhl, prime minister to his Polish majesty, whose name indeed may
 seem to give some weight to what he advances. 'Russia was convinced that
 the czarowitz owed his death to poison, which had been given him by his
 mother-in-law.' But this accusation is overturned by the declaration
 which the czar made to the duke of Holstein, that the empress Catherine
 had advised him to confine his son in a monastery.
 
 With regard to the poison which the empress is said to have given
 afterwards to her husband, that story is sufficiently destroyed by the
 simple relation of the affair of the page and pocket-book. What man
 would think of making such a memorandum as this, 'I must remember to
 confine my wife in a convent?' Is this a circumstance of so trivial a
 nature, that it must be set down lest it should be forgotten? If
 Catherine had poisoned her son-in-law and her husband she would have
 committed crimes; whereas, so far from being suspected of cruelty, she
 had a remarkable character for lenity and sweetness of temper.
 
 It may now be proper to shew what was the first cause of the behaviour
 of the czarowitz, of his flight, and of his death, and that of his
 accomplices, who fell by the hands of the executioner. It was owing then
 to mistaken notions in religion, and to a superstitious fondness for
 priests and monks. That this was the real source from whence all his
 misfortunes were derived, is sufficiently apparent from his own
 confession, which we have already set before the reader, and in
 particular, by that expression of the czar in his letter to his unhappy
 son, 'A corrupt priesthood will be able to turn you at pleasure.'
 
 The following is, almost word for word, the manner in which a certain
 ambassador to the court of Russia explains these words.--Several
 ecclesiastics, says he, fond of the ancient barbarous customs, and
 regretting the authority they had lost by the nation having become more
 civilized, wished earnestly to see prince Alexis on the throne, from
 whose known disposition they expected a return of those days of
 ignorance and superstition which were so dear to them. In the number of
 these was Dozitheus, bishop of Rostow. This prelate feigned a revelation
 from St. Demetrius, and that the saint had appeared to him, and had
 assured him as from God himself, that the czar would not live above
 three months; that the empress Eudocia, who was then confined in the
 convent of Susdal (and had taken the veil under the name of sister
 Helena), and the princess Mary the czar's sister, should ascend the
 throne and reign jointly with prince Alexis. Eudocia and the princess
 Mary were weak enough to credit this imposture, and were even so
 persuaded of the truth of this prediction, that the former quitted her
 habit and the convent, and throwing aside the name of sister Helena,
 reassumed the imperial title and the ancient dress of the czarina's,
 and caused the name of her rival Catherine to be struck out of the form
 of prayer. And when the lady abbess of the convent opposed these
 proceedings, Eudocia answered her haughtily--That as Peter had punished
 the strelitzes who had insulted his mother, in like manner would prince
 Alexis punish those who had offered an indignity to his. She caused the
 abbess to be confined to her apartment. An officer named Stephen Glebo
 was introduced into the convent; this man Eudocia made use of as the
 instrument of her designs, having previously won him over to her
 interest by heaping favours on him. Glebo caused Dozitheus's prediction
 to be spread over the little town of Susdal, and the neighbourhood
 thereof. But the three months being nearly expired, Eudocia reproached
 the bishop with the czar's being still alive, 'My father's sins,'
 answered Dozitheus, 'have been the cause of this; he is still in
 purgatory, and has acquainted me therewith.' Upon this Eudocia caused a
 thousand masses for the dead to be said, Dozitheus assuring her that
 this would not fail of having the desired effect: but in about a month
 afterwards, he came to her and told, that his father's head was already
 out of purgatory; in a month afterwards he was freed as far as his
 waist, so that then he only stuck in purgatory by his feet; but as soon
 as they should be set free, which was the most difficult part of the
 business, the czar would infallibly die.
 
 The princess Mary, persuaded by Dozitheus, gave herself up to him, on
 condition that his father should be immediately released from purgatory,
 and the prediction accomplished, and Glebo continued his usual
 correspondence with the old czarina.
 
 It was chiefly on the faith of these predictions that the czarowitz
 quitted the kingdom, and retired into a foreign country, to wait for the
 death of his father. However the whole scheme was soon discovered;
 Dozitheus and Glebo were seized; the letters of the princess Mary to
 Dozitheus, and those of sister Helena to Glebo, were read in the open
 senate. In consequence of which, the princess Mary was shut up in the
 fortress of Schusselbourg, and the old czarina removed to another
 convent, where she was kept a close prisoner. Dozitheus and Glebo,
 together with the other accomplices of these idle and superstitious
 intrigues, were put to the torture, as were likewise the confidants of
 the czarowitz's flight. His confessor, his preceptor, and the steward of
 his household, all died by the hands of the executioner.
 
 Such then was the dear and fatal price at which Peter the Great
 purchased the happiness of his people, and such were the numberless
 obstacles he had to surmount in the midst of a long and dangerous war
 without doors, and an unnatural rebellion at home. He saw one half of
 his family plotting against him, the majority of the priesthood
 obstinately bent to frustrate his designs, and almost the whole nation
 for a long time opposing its own felicity, of which as yet it was not
 become sensible. He had prejudices to overcome, and discontents to
 sooth. In a word, there wanted a new generation formed by his care, who
 would at length entertain the proper ideas of happiness and glory, which
 their fathers were not able to comprehend or support.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XXX.
 
     Works and establishments in 1718, and the following years.
 
 
 Throughout the whole of the foregoing dreadful catastrophe, it appeared
 clearly, that Peter had acted only as the father of his country, and
 that he considered his people as his family. The punishments he had been
 obliged to inflict on such of them, who had endeavoured to obstruct or
 impede the happiness of the rest, were necessary, though melancholy
 sacrifices, made to the general good.
 
 1718.] This year, which was the epoch of the disinheriting and death of
 his eldest son, was also that of the greatest advantage he procured to
 his subjects, by establishing a general police hitherto unknown; by the
 introduction or improvement of manufactures and works of every kind, by
 opening new branches of trade, which now began to flourish, and by the
 construction of canals, which joined rivers, seas, and people,
 that nature had separated from each other. We have here none of
 those striking events which charm common readers; none of those
 court-intrigues which are the food of scandal and malice, nor of those
 great revolutions which amaze the generality of mankind; but we behold
 the real springs of public happiness, which the philosophic eye delights
 to contemplate.
 
 He now appointed a lieutenant-general of police over the whole empire,
 who was to hold his court at Petersburg, and from thence preserve order
 from one end of the kingdom to the other. Extravagance in dress, and the
 still more dangerous extravagance of gaming, were prohibited under
 severe penalties; schools for teaching arithmetic, which had been first
 set on foot in 1716, were now established in many towns in Russia. The
 hospitals, which had been began, were now finished, endowed, and filled
 with proper objects.
 
 To these we may add the several useful establishments which had been
 projected some time before, and which were completed a few years
 afterwards. The great towns were now cleared of those innumerable swarms
 of beggars, who will not follow any other occupation but that of
 importuning those who are more industrious than themselves, and who lead
 a wretched and shameful life at the expense of others: an abuse too much
 overlooked in other nations.
 
 The rich were obliged to build regular and handsome houses in
 Petersburg, agreeable to their circumstances, and, by a master-stroke of
 police, the several materials were brought carriage free to the city, by
 the barks and waggons which returned empty from the neighbouring
 provinces.
 
 Weights and measures were likewise fixed upon an uniform plan, in the
 same manner as the laws. This uniformity, so much, but in vain desired,
 in states that have for many ages been civilized, was established in
 Russia without the least difficulty or murmuring; and yet we fancy that
 this salutary regulation is impracticable amongst us.
 
 The prices of the necessaries of life were also fixed. The city of
 Petersburg was well lighted with lamps during the night; a convenience
 which was first introduced in Paris by Louis XIV., and to which Rome is
 still a stranger. Pumps were erected for supplying water in cases of
 fire; the streets were well paved, and rails put up for the security of
 foot passengers: in a word, every thing was provided that could minister
 to safety, decency, and good order, and to the quicker dispatch and
 convenience of the inland trade of the country. Several privileges were
 granted to foreigners, and proper laws enacted to prevent the abuse of
 those privileges. In consequence of these useful and salutary
 regulations, Petersburg and Moscow put on a new face.
 
 The iron and steel manufactories received additional improvements,
 especially those which the czar had founded at about ten miles distance
 from Petersburg, of which he himself was the first superintendant, and
 wherein no less than a thousand workmen were employed immediately under
 his eye. He went in person to give directions to those who farmed the
 corn-mills, powder-mills, and mills for sawing timber, and to the
 managers of the manufactories for cordage and sail-cloth, to the
 brick-makers, slaters, and the cloth-weavers. Numbers of workmen in
 every branch came from France to settle under him; these were the fruits
 he reaped from his travels.
 
 He established a board of trade, which was composed of one half natives,
 and the other half foreigners, in order that justice might be equally
 distributed to all artists and workmen. A Frenchman settled a
 manufactory for making fine looking-glass at Petersburg, with the
 assistance of prince Menzikoff. Another set up a loom for working
 curious tapestry, after the manner of the Gobelins; and this manufactory
 still meets with great encouragement. A third succeeded in making of
 gold and silver thread, and the czar ordered that no more than four
 thousand marks of gold or silver should be expended in these works in
 the space of a year; by this means to prevent the too great consumption
 of bullion in the kingdom.
 
 He gave thirty thousand rubles, that is, about one hundred and fifty
 thousand French livres,[110] together with all the materials and
 instruments necessary for making the several kinds of woollen stuffs. By
 this useful bounty he was enabled to clothe all his troops with the
 cloth made in his own country; whereas, before that time, it was
 purchased from Berlin and other foreign kingdoms.
 
 They made as fine linen cloth in Moscow as in Holland; and at his death
 there were in that capital and at Jaroslaw, no less than fourteen linen
 and hempen manufactories.
 
 It could certainly never be imagined, at the time that silk sold in
 Europe for its weight in gold, that one day there would arise on the
 banks of the lake Ladoga, in the midst of a frozen region, and among
 unfrequented marshes, a magnificent and opulent city, where the silks of
 Persia should be manufactured in as great perfection as at Ispahan.
 Peter, however, undertook this great phenomenon in commerce, and
 succeeded in the attempt. The working of iron mines was carried to their
 highest degree of perfection; several other mines of gold and silver
 were discovered, and the council of mines was appointed to examine and
 determine, whether the working of these would bring in a profit adequate
 to the expense.
 
 But, to make so many different arts and manufactures flourish, and to
 establish so many various undertakings, it was not alone sufficient to
 grant patents, or to appoint inspectors: it was necessary that our
 great founder should behold all these pass under his own eye in their
 beginnings, and work at them with his own hands, in the same manner as
 we have already seen him working at the construction, the rigging, and
 the sailing of a ship. When canals were to be dug in marshy and almost
 impassable grounds, he was frequently seen at the head of the workmen
 digging the earth, and carrying it away himself.
 
 In this same year (1718) he formed the plan of the canal and sluices of
 Ladoga: this was intended to make a communication between the Neva and
 another navigable river, in order for the more easy conveyance of
 merchandize to Petersburg, without taking the great circuit of the lake
 Ladoga, which, on account of the storms that prevailed on the coast, was
 frequently impassable for barks or small vessels. Peter levelled the
 ground himself, and they still preserve the tools which he used in
 digging up and carrying off the earth. The whole court followed the
 example of their sovereign, and persisted in a work, which, at the same
 time, they looked upon as impracticable; and it was finished after his
 death: for not one of his projects, which had been found possible to be
 effected, was abandoned.
 
 The great canal of Cronstadt, which is easily drained of its waters, and
 wherein they careen and clean the men of war, was also began at the same
 time that he was engaged in the proceedings against his son.
 
 In this year also he built the new city of Ladoga. A short time
 afterwards, he made the canal which joins the Caspian Sea to the gulf of
 Finland and to the ocean. The boats, after sailing up the Wolga, came
 first to the communication of two rivers, which he joined for that
 purpose; from thence, by another canal, they enter into the lake of
 Ilmen, and then fall into the canal of Ladoga, from whence goods and
 merchandizes may be conveyed by sea to all parts of the world.
 
 In the midst of these labours, which all passed under his inspection, he
 carried his views from Kamschatka to the most eastern limits of his
 empire, and caused two forts to be built in these regions, which were so
 long unknown to the rest of the world. In the meantime, a body of
 engineers, who were draughted from the marine academy established in
 1715, were sent to make the tour of the empire, in order to form exact
 charts thereof, and lay before mankind the immense extent of country
 which he had civilized and enriched.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XXXI.
 
     Of the trade of Russia.
 
 
 The Russian trade without doors was in a manner annihilated before the
 reign of Peter. He restored it anew, after his accession to the throne.
 It is notorious, that the current of trade has undergone several changes
 in the world. The south part of Russia was before the time of Tamerlane,
 the staple of Greece, and even of the Indies; and the Genoese were the
 principal factors. The Tanais and the Boristhenes were loaded with the
 productions of Asia: but when Tamerlane, towards the end of the
 fourteenth century, had conquered the Taurican Chersonesus, afterwards
 called Crimea or Crim Tartary, and when the Turks became masters of
 Azoph, this great branch of trade was totally destroyed. Peter formed
 the design of reviving it, by getting possession of Azoph; but the
 unfortunate campaign of Pruth wrested this city out of his hands, and
 with it all his views on the Black Sea: nevertheless he had it still in
 his power to open as extensive a road to commerce through the Caspian
 Sea. The English who, in the end of the fifteenth, and beginning of the
 sixteenth century, had opened a trade to Archangel, had endeavoured to
 do the same likewise by the Caspian Sea, but failed in all their
 attempts for this purpose.
 
 It has been already observed, that the father of Peter the Great caused
 a ship to be built in Holland, to trade from Astracan to the coast of
 Persia. This vessel was burnt by the rebel Stenkorazin, which put an
 immediate stop to any views of trading on a fair footing with the
 Persians. The Armenians, who are the factors of that part of Asia, were
 received by Peter the Great into Astracan; every thing was obliged to
 pass through their hands, and they reaped all the advantage of that
 trade; as is the case with the Indian traders, and the Banians, and with
 the Turks, as well as several nations in Christendom, and the Jews: for
 those who have only one way of living, are generally very expert in that
 art on which they depend for a support; and others pay a voluntary
 tribute to that knowledge in which they know themselves deficient.
 
 Peter had already found a remedy for this inconvenience, in the treaty
 which he made with the sophi of Persia, by which all the silk, which was
 not used for the manufactories in that kingdom, was to be delivered to
 the Armenians of Astracan, and by them to be transported into Russia.
 
 The troubles which arose in Persia soon overturned this arrangement; and
 in the course of this history, we shall see how the sha, or emperor of
 Persia, Hussein, when persecuted by the rebels, implored the assistance
 of Peter; and how that monarch, after having supported a difficult war
 against the Turks and the Swedes, entered Persia, and subjected three of
 its provinces. But to return to the article of trade.
 
 
 _Of the Trade with China._
 
 The undertaking of establishing a trade with China seemed to promise the
 greatest advantages. Two vast empires, bordering on each other, and each
 reciprocally possessing what the other stood in need of, seemed to be
 both under the happy necessity of opening a useful correspondence,
 especially after the treaty of peace, so solemnly ratified between these
 two empires in the year 1689, according to our way of reckoning.
 
 The first foundation of this trade had been laid in the year 1653. There
 was at that time two companies of Siberian and Bukarian families settled
 in Siberia. Their caravans travelled through the Calmuck plains; after
 they had crossed the deserts of Chinese Tartary, and made a considerable
 profit by their trade; but the troubles which happened in the country of
 the Calmucks, and the disputes between the Russians and the Chinese, in
 regard to the frontiers, put a stop to this commerce.
 
 After the peace of 1689, it was natural for the two great nations to fix
 on some neutral place, whither all the goods should be carried. The
 Siberians, like all other nations, stood more in need of the Chinese,
 than these latter did of them; accordingly permission was asked of the
 emperor of China, to send caravans to Pekin, which was readily granted.
 This happened in the beginning of the present century.
 
 It is worthy of observation, that the emperor Camhi had granted
 permission for a Russian church in the suburbs of Pekin; which church
 was to be served by Siberian priests, the whole at the emperor's own
 expense, who was so indulgent to cause this church to be built for the
 accommodation of several families of eastern Siberia; some of whom had
 been prisoners before the peace of 1680, and the others were adventurers
 from their own country, who would not return back again after the peace
 of Niptchou. The agreeable climate of Pekin, the obliging manners of the
 Chinese, and the ease with which they found a handsome living,
 determined them to spend the rest of their days in China. The small
 Greek church could not become dangerous to the peace of the empire, as
 those of the Jesuits have been to that of other nations; and moreover,
 the emperor Camhi was a favourer of liberty of conscience. Toleration
 has, in all times, been the established custom in Asia, as it was in
 former times all over the world, till the reign of the Roman emperor
 Theodosius I. The Russian families, thus established in China, having
 intermarried with the natives, have since quitted the Christian
 religion, but their church still subsists.
 
 It was stipulated, that this church should be for the use of those who
 come with the Siberian caravans, to bring furs and other commodities
 wanted at Pekin. The voyage out and home, and the stay in the country,
 generally took up three years. Prince Gagarin, governor of Siberia, was
 twenty years at the head of this trade. The caravans were sometimes very
 numerous; and it was difficult to keep the common people, who made the
 greatest number, within proper bounds.
 
 They passed through the territories of a Laman priest, who is a kind of
 Tartarian sovereign, resides on the sea-coast of Orkon, and has the
 title of Koutoukas: he is the vicar of the grand Lama, but has rendered
 himself independent, by making some change in the religion of the
 country, where the Indian tenet of metempsychosis is the prevailing
 opinion. We cannot find a more apt comparison for this priest than in
 the bishops of Lubeck and Osnaburg, who have shaken off the dominion of
 the church of Rome. The caravans, in their march, sometimes committed
 depredations on the territories of this Tartarian prelate, as they did
 also on those of the Chinese. This irregular conduct proved an
 impediment to the trade of those parts; for the Chinese threatened to
 shut the entrance into their empire against the Russians, unless a stop
 was put to these disorders. The trade with China was at that time very
 advantageous to the Russians, who brought from thence gold, silver, and
 precious stones, in return for their merchandize. The largest ruby in
 the world was brought out of China to prince Gagarin, who sent it to
 prince Menzikoff; and it is now one of the ornaments of the imperial
 crown.
 
 The exactions put in practice by prince Gagarin were of great prejudice
 to that trade, which had brought him so much riches; and, at length,
 they ended in his own destruction; for he was accused before the court
 of justice, established by the czar, and sentenced to lose his head, a
 year after the condemnation of the czarowitz, and the execution of all
 those who had been his accomplices.
 
 About the same time, the emperor Camhi, perceiving his health to decay,
 and knowing, by experience, that the European mathematicians were much
 more learned in their art than those of his own nation, thought that
 the European physicians must also have more knowledge than those of
 Pekin, and therefore sent a message to the czar, by some ambassadors who
 were returning from China to Petersburg, requesting him to send him one
 of his physicians. There happened at that time to be an English surgeon
 at Petersburg, who offered to undertake the journey in that character;
 and accordingly set out in company with a new ambassador, and one
 Laurence Lange, who has left a description of that journey. This embassy
 was received, and all the expense of it defrayed with great pomp, by
 Camhi. The surgeon, at his arrival, found the emperor in perfect health,
 and gained the reputation of a most skilful physician. The caravans who
 followed this embassy made prodigious profits; but fresh excesses having
 been committed by this very caravan, the Chinese were so offended
 thereat, that they sent back Lange, who was at that time resident from
 the czar at the Chinese court, and with him all the Russian merchants
 established there.
 
 The emperor Camhi dying, his son Yontchin, who had as great a share of
 wisdom, and more firmness than his father, and who drove the Jesuits out
 of his empire, as the czar had done from Russia in 1718, concluded a
 treaty with Peter, by which the Russian caravans were no more to trade
 on the frontiers of the two empires. There are only certain factors,
 dispatched in the name of the emperor or empress of Russia, and these
 have liberty to enter Pekin, where they are lodged in a vast house,
 which the emperor of China formerly assigned for the reception of the
 envoys from Corea: but it is a considerable time since either caravans
 or factors have been sent from Russia thither so that the trade is now
 in a declining way, but may possibly soon be revived.
 
 
 _Of the Trade of_ PETERSBURG, _and the other ports of the_ RUSSIAN
 EMPIRE.
 
 There were at this time above two hundred foreign vessels traded to the
 new capital, in the space of a year. This trade has continued
 increasing, and has frequently brought in five millions (French money)
 to the crown. This was greatly more than the interest of the money which
 this establishment had cost. This trade, however, greatly diminished
 that of Archangel, and was precisely what the founder desired; for the
 port of Archangel is too dangerous, and at too great distance from other
 ports: besides that, a trade which is carried on immediately under the
 eye of an assiduous sovereign, is always the most advantageous. That of
 Livonia continued still on the same footing. The trade of Russia in
 general has proved very successful; its ports have received from one
 thousand to twelve hundred vessels in a year, and Peter discovered the
 happy expedient of joining utility to glory.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XXXII.
 
     Of the laws.
 
 
 It is well known, that good laws are scarce, and that the due execution
 of them is still more so. The greater the extent of any state, and the
 variety of people of which it is composed, the more difficult it is to
 unite them by the same body of laws. The father of czar Peter formed a
 digest or code under the title of _Oulogenia_, which was actually
 printed, but it by no means answered the end intended.
 
 Peter, in the course of his travels, had collected materials for
 repairing this great structure, which was falling to decay in many of
 its parts. He gathered many useful hints from the governments of
 Denmark, Sweden, England, Germany, and France, selecting from each of
 these different nations what he thought most suitable to his own.
 
 There was a court of boyards or great men, who determined all matters
 _en dernier ressort_. Rank and birth alone gave a seat in this assembly;
 but the czar thought that knowledge was likewise requisite, and
 therefore this court was dissolved.
 
 He then instituted a procurator-general, assisted by four assistors, in
 each of the governments of the empire. These were to overlook the
 conduct of the judges, whose decrees were subject to an appeal to the
 senate which he established. Each of those judges was furnished with a
 copy of the _Oulogenia_, with additions and necessary alterations, until
 a complete body of laws could be formed.
 
 It was forbid to these judges to receive any fees, which, however
 moderate, are always an abusive tax on the fortunes and properties of
 those concerned in suits of law. The czar also took care that the
 expenses of the court were moderate, and the decisions speedy. The
 judges and their clerks had salaries appointed them out of the public
 treasury, and were not suffered to purchase their offices.
 
 It was in the year 1718, at the very time that he was engaged in the
 process against his son, that he made the chief part of these
 regulations. The greatest part of the laws he enacted were borrowed from
 those of the Swedes, and he made no difficulty to admit to places in his
 courts of judicature such Swedish prisoners who were well versed in the
 laws of their own country, and who, having learnt the Russian language,
 were willing to continue in that kingdom.
 
 The governor of each province and his assistors had the cognizance of
 private causes within such government; from them there was an appeal to
 the senate; and if any one, after having been condemned by the senate,
 appealed to the czar himself, and such appeal was found unjust, he was
 punished with death: but to mitigate the rigour of this law, the czar
 created a master of the requests, who received the petitions of those
 who had affairs depending in the senate, or in the inferior courts,
 concerning which the laws then in force were not sufficiently
 explanatory.
 
 At length, in 1722, he completed his new code, prohibiting all the
 judges, under pain of death, to depart therefrom in their decrees, or to
 set up their own private opinions in place of the general statutes. This
 dreadful ordonnance was publicly fixed up, and still remains in all the
 courts of judicature of the empire.
 
 He erected every thing anew; there was not, even to the common affairs
 of society, aught but what was his work. He regulated the degrees
 between man and man, according to their posts and employments, from the
 admiral and the field-marshal to the ensign, without any regard to
 birth.
 
 Having always in his own mind, and willing to imprint it on those of his
 subjects, that services are preferable to pedigree, a certain rank was
 likewise fixed for the women; and she who took a seat in a public
 assembly, that did not properly belong to her, was obliged to pay a
 fine.
 
 By a still more useful regulation, every private soldier, on being made
 an officer, instantly became a gentleman; and a nobleman, if his
 character had been impeached in a court of justice, was degraded to a
 plebeian.
 
 After the settling of these several laws and regulations, it happened
 that the increase of towns, wealth, and population in the empire, new
 undertakings, and the creation of new employs, necessarily introduced a
 multitude of new affairs and unforeseen cases, which were all
 consequences of that success which attended the czar in the general
 reformation of his dominions.
 
 The empress Elizabeth completed the body of laws which her father had
 begun, in which she gave the most lively proofs of that mildness and
 clemency for which she was so justly famed.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XXXIII.
 
     Of Religion.
 
 
 At this time Peter laboured more than ever to reform the clergy. He had
 abolished the patriarchal office, and by this act of authority had
 alienated the minds of the ecclesiastics. He was determined that the
 imperial power should be free and absolute, and that of the church
 respected, but submissive. His design was, to establish a council of
 religion, which should always subsist, but dependent on the sovereign,
 and that it should give no laws to the church, but such as should be
 approved of by the head of the state, of which the church was a part. He
 was assisted in this undertaking by the archbishop of Novogorod, named
 Theophanes Procop, or Procopowitz, i.e. son of Procop.
 
 This prelate was a person of great learning and sagacity: his travels
 through the different parts of Europe had afforded him opportunities of
 remarks on the several abuses which reign amongst them. The czar, who
 had himself been a witness of the same, had this great advantage in
 forming all his regulations, that he was possessed of an unlimited power
 to choose what was useful, and reject what was dangerous. He laboured,
 in concert with the archbishop, in the years 1718 and 1719, to effect
 his design. He established a perpetual synod, to be composed of twelve
 members, partly bishops, and partly archpriests, all to be chosen by the
 sovereign. This college was afterwards augmented to fourteen.
 
 The motives of this establishment were explained by the czar in a
 preliminary discourse. The chief and most remarkable of these was, 'That
 under the administration of a college of priests, there was less danger
 of troubles and insurrections, than under the government of a single
 head of the church; because the common people, who are always prone to
 superstition, might, by seeing one head of the church, and another of
 the state, be led to believe that they were in fact two different
 powers.' And hereupon he cites as an example, the divisions which so
 long subsisted between the empire and the papal see, and which stained
 so many kingdoms with blood.
 
 Peter thought, and openly declared, that the notion of two powers in a
 state, founded on the allegory of the two swords, mentioned in the
 apostles, was absurd and erroneous.
 
 This court was invested with the ecclesiastical power of regulating all
 penances, and examining into the morals and capacity of those nominated
 by the court to bishoprics, to pass judgment _en dernier ressort_ in all
 causes relating to religion, in which it was the custom formerly to
 appeal to the patriarch, and also to take cognizance of the revenues of
 monasteries, and the distribution of alms.
 
 This synod had the title of _most holy_, the same which the patriarchs
 were wont to assume, and in fact the czar seemed to have preserved the
 patriarchal dignity, but divided among fourteen members, who were all
 dependant on the crown, and were to take an oath of obedience, which the
 patriarchs never did. The members of this holy synod, when met in
 assembly, had the same rank as the senators; but they were like the
 senate, all dependant on the prince. But neither this new form of church
 administration, nor the ecclesiastical code, were in full vigour till
 four years after its institution, namely in 1722. Peter at first
 intended, that the synod should have the presentation of those whom they
 thought most worthy to fill the vacant bishoprics. These were to be
 nominated by the emperor, and consecrated by the synod, Peter frequently
 presided in person at the assembly. One day that a vacant see was to be
 filled, the synod observed to the emperor, that they had none but
 ignorant persons to present to his majesty: 'Well, then,' replied the
 czar, 'you have only to pitch upon the most honest man, he will be worth
 two learned ones.'
 
 It is to be observed, that the Greek church has none of that motley
 order called secular abbots. The _petit collet_ is unknown there,
 otherwise than by the ridiculousness of its character, but by another
 abuse (as every thing in this world must be subject to abuse) the
 bishops and prelates are all chosen from the monastic orders. The first
 monks were only laymen, partly devotees, and partly fanatics, who
 retired into the deserts, where they were at length gathered together by
 St. Basil, who gave them a body of rules, and then they took vows, and
 were reckoned as the lower order of the church, which is the first step
 to be taken to arise at higher dignities. It was this that filled all
 Greece and Asia with monks. Russia was overrun with them. They became
 rich, powerful, and though excessively ignorant, they were, at the
 accession of Peter to the throne, almost the only persons who knew how
 to write. Of this knowledge they made such an abuse, when struck and
 confounded with the new regulations which Peter introduced in all the
 departments of government, that he was obliged in 1703 to issue an
 edict, forbidding the use of pen and ink to the monks, without an
 express order from the archimandrite, or prior of the convent, who in
 that case was responsible for the behaviour of those to whom he granted
 this indulgence.
 
 Peter designed to make this a standing law, and at first he intended,
 that no one should be admitted into any order under fifty years of age;
 but that appeared too late an age, as the life of man being in general
 so limited, there was not time sufficient for such persons to acquire
 the necessary qualifications for being made bishops; and therefore, with
 the advice of his synod, he placed it at thirty years complete, but
 never under; at the same time expressly prohibiting any person
 exercising the profession of a soldier, or an husbandman, to enter into
 a convent, without an immediate order from the emperor, or the synod,
 and to admit no married man upon any account, even though divorced from
 his wife; unless that wife should at the same time embrace a religious
 life of her own pure will, and that neither of them had any children. No
 person in actual employ under government can take the habit, without an
 express order of the state for that purpose. Every monk is obliged to
 work with his own hands at some trade. The nuns are never to go without
 the walls of their convent, and at the age of fifty are to receive the
 tonsure, as did the deaconesses of the primitive church; but if, before
 undergoing that ceremony, they have an inclination to marry, they are
 not only allowed, but even exhorted so to do. An admirable regulation in
 a country where population is of infinitely greater use than a monastic
 life.
 
 Peter was desirous that those unhappy females, whom God has destined to
 people a kingdom, and who, by a mistaken devotion, annihilated in
 cloisters that race of which they would otherwise become mothers, should
 at least be of some service to society, which they thus injure; and
 therefore ordered, that they should all be employed in some handy works,
 suitable to their sex. The empress Catherine took upon herself the care
 of sending for several handicrafts over from Brabant and Holland, whom
 she distributed among these convents, and, in a short time, they
 produced several kinds of work, which the empress and her ladies always
 wore as a part of their dress.
 
 There cannot perhaps be any thing conceived more prudent than these
 institutions; but what merits the attention of all ages, is the
 regulation which Peter made himself, and which he addressed to the synod
 in 1724. The ancient ecclesiastical institution is there very learnedly
 explained, and the indolence of the monkish life admirably well exposed;
 and he not only recommends an application to labour and industry, but
 even commands it; and that the principal occupation of those people
 should be, to assist and relieve the poor. He likewise orders, that sick
 and infirm soldiers shall be quartered in the convents, and that a
 certain number of monks shall be set apart to take care of them, and
 that the most strong and healthy of these shall cultivate the lands
 belonging to those convents. He orders the same regulations to be
 observed in the monasteries for women, and that the strongest of these
 shall take care of the gardens, and the rest to wait on sick or infirm
 women, who shall be brought from the neighbouring country into the
 convents for that purpose. He also enters into the minutest details
 relating to these services; and lastly, he appoints certain monasteries
 of both sexes for the reception and education of orphans.
 
 In reading this ordinance of Peter the Great, which was published the
 31st January, 1724, one would imagine it to have been framed by a
 minister of state and a father of the church.
 
 Almost all the customs in the Russian church are different from those of
 ours. As soon as a man is made a sub-deacon, we prohibit him from
 marrying, and he is accounted guilty of sacrilege if he proves
 instrumental to the population of his country. On the contrary, when any
 one has taken a sub-deacon's order in Russia, he is obliged likewise to
 take a wife, and then may rise to the rank of priest, and arch-priest,
 but he cannot be made a bishop, unless he is a widower and a monk.
 
 Peter forbid all parish-priests from bringing up more than one son to
 the service of the church, unless it was particularly desired by the
 parishioners; and this he did, lest a numerous family might in time come
 to tyrannize over the parish. We may perceive in these little
 circumstances relating to church-government, that the legislator had
 always the good of the state in view, and that he took every precaution
 to make the clergy properly respected, without being dangerous, and
 that they should be neither contemptible nor powerful.
 
 In those curious memoirs, composed by an officer who was a particular
 favourite of Peter the Great, I find the following anecdote:--One day a
 person reading to the czar that number of the English Spectator, in
 which a parallel is drawn between him and Lewis XIV. 'I do not think,'
 said Peter, 'that I deserve the preference that is here given me over
 that monarch; but I have been fortunate enough to have the superiority
 over him in one essential point, namely, that of having obliged my
 clergy to live in peace and submission; whereas my brother Lewis has
 suffered himself to be ruled by his.'
 
 A prince, whose days were almost wholly spent in the fatigues of war,
 and his nights in the compiling laws for the better government of so
 large an empire, and in directing so many great labours, through a space
 of two thousand leagues, must stand in need of some hours of amusement.
 Diversions at that time were neither so noble or elegant as they now
 are, and therefore we must not wonder if Peter amused himself with the
 entertainment of the sham conclave, of which mention has been already
 made, and other diversions of the same stamp, which were frequently at
 the expense of the Romish church, to which he had a great dislike, and
 which was very pardonable in a prince of the Greek communion, who was
 determined to be master in his own dominions. He likewise gave several
 entertainments of the same kind at the expense of the monks of his own
 country; but of the ancient monks, whose follies and bigotry he wished
 to ridicule, while he strove to reform the new.
 
 We have already seen that previous to his publishing his church-laws,
 he created one of his fools pope, and celebrated the feast of the sham
 conclave. This fool, whose name was Jotof, was between eighty and
 ninety. The czar took it into his head to make him marry an old widow of
 his own age, and to have their nuptials publicly solemnized; he caused
 the invitation to the marriage guests to be made by four persons who
 were remarkable for stammering. The bride was conducted to church by
 decrepit old men, four of the most bulky men that could be found in
 Russia acted as running footmen. The music were seated in a waggon drawn
 by bears, whom they every now and then pricked with goads of iron, and
 who, by their roaring, formed a full base, perfectly agreeable to the
 concert in the cart. The married couple received the benediction in the
 cathedral from the hands of a deaf and blind priest, who, to appear more
 ridiculous, wore a large pair of spectacles on his nose. The procession,
 the wedding, the marriage-feast, the undressing and putting to bed of
 the bride and bridegroom, were all of a piece with the rest of this
 burlesque ceremony.
 
 We may perhaps be apt to look upon this as a trivial and ridiculous
 entertainment for a great prince; but is it more so than our carnival?
 or to see five or six hundred persons with masks on their faces, and
 dressed in the most ridiculous manner, skipping and jumping about
 together, for a whole night in a large room, without speaking a word to
 each other?
 
 In fine, were the ancient feasts of the fools and the ass, and the abbot
 of the cuckolds, which were formerly celebrated in our churches, much
 superior, or did our comedies of the foolish mother exhibit marks of a
 greater genius?
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XXXIV.
 
     The congress of Aland or Oeland. Death of Charles XII., &c. The
     treaty of Nystadt.
 
 
 These immense labours, this minute review of the whole Russian empire,
 and the melancholy proceedings against his unhappy son, were not the
 only objects which demanded the attention of the czar; it was necessary
 to secure himself without doors, at the same time that he was settling
 order and tranquillity within. The war with Sweden was still carried on,
 though faintly, in hopes of approaching peace.
 
 It is a known fact, that in the year 1717, cardinal Alberoni, prime
 minister to Philip V. of Spain, and baron Gortz, who had gained an
 entire ascendant over the mind of Charles XII. had concerted a project
 to change the face of affairs in Europe, by effecting a reconciliation
 between this last prince and the czar, driving George I. from the
 English throne, and replacing Stanislaus on that of Poland, while
 cardinal Alberoni was to procure the regency of France for his master
 Philip. Gortz, as has been already observed, had opened his mind on this
 head to the czar himself. Alberoni had begun a negotiation with prince
 Kourakin, the czar's ambassador at the Hague, by means of the Spanish
 ambassador, Baretti Landi, a native of Mantua, who had, like the
 cardinal, quitted his own country to live in Spain.
 
 Thus a set of foreigners were about to overturn the general system, for
 masters under whose dominion they were not born, or rather for
 themselves. Charles XII. gave into all these projects, and the czar
 contented himself with examining them in private. Since the year 1716 he
 had made only feeble efforts against Sweden, and those rather with a
 view to oblige that kingdom to purchase peace by restoring those places
 it had taken in the course of the war, than with an intent to crush it
 altogether.
 
 The baron Gortz, ever active and indefatigable in his projects, had
 prevailed on the czar to send plenipotentiaries to the island of Oeland
 to set on foot a treaty of peace. Bruce, a Scotchman, and grand master
 of the ordnance in Russia, and the famous Osterman, who was afterwards
 at the head of affairs, arrived at the place appointed for the congress
 exactly at the time that the czarowitz was put under arrest at Moscow.
 Gortz and Gillembourg were already there on the part of Charles XII.
 both impatient to bring about a reconciliation between that prince and
 Peter, and to revenge themselves on the king of England. It was an
 extraordinary circumstance that there should be a congress, and no
 cessation of arms. The czar's fleet still continued cruising on the
 coasts of Sweden, and taking the ships of that nation. Peter thought by
 keeping up hostilities to hasten the conclusion of a peace, of which he
 knew the Swedes stood greatly in need, and which must prove highly
 glorious to the conqueror.
 
 Notwithstanding the little hostilities which still continued, every
 thing bespoke the speedy approach of peace. The preliminaries began by
 mutual acts of generosity, which produce stronger effects than many
 hand-writings. The czar sent back without ransom marshal Erenschild,
 whom he had taken prisoner with his own hands, and Charles in return did
 the same by Trubetskoy and Gallowin, who had continued prisoners in
 Sweden ever since the battle of Narva.
 
 The negotiations now advanced apace, and a total change was going to be
 made in the affairs of the North. Gortz proposed to the czar to put the
 duchy of Mecklenburg into his hands. Duke Charles, its sovereign, who
 had married a daughter of czar John, Peter's elder brother, was at
 variance with the nobility of the country, who had taken arms against
 him. And Peter, who looked upon that prince as his brother-in-law, had
 an army in Mecklenburg ready to espouse his cause. The king of England,
 elector of Hanover, declared on the side of the nobles. Here was another
 opportunity of mortifying the king of England, by putting Peter in
 possession of Mecklenburg, who, being already master of Livonia, would
 by this means, in a short time, become more powerful in Germany than any
 of its electors. The duchy of Courland was to be given to the duke of
 Mecklenburg, as an equivalent for his own, together with a part of
 Prussia at the expense of Poland, who was to have Stanislaus again for
 her king. Bremen and Verden were to revert to Sweden; but these
 provinces could not be wrested out of the hands of the king of England
 but by force of arms; accordingly Gortz's project was (as we have
 already said) to effect a firm union between Peter and Charles XII., and
 that not only by the bands of peace, but by an offensive alliance, in
 which case they were jointly to send an army into Scotland. Charles XII.
 after having made himself master of Norway, was to make a descent on
 Great Britain, and he fondly imagined he should be able to set a new
 sovereign on the throne of those kingdoms, after having replaced one of
 his own choosing on that of Poland. Cardinal Alberoni promised both
 Peter and Charles to furnish them with subsidies. The fall of the king
 of England would, it was supposed, draw with it that of his ally, the
 regent of France, who being thus deprived of all support, was to fall a
 victim to the victorious arms of Spain, and the discontent of the French
 nation.
 
 Alberoni and Gortz now thought themselves secure of totally overturning
 the system of Europe, when a cannon ball from the bastions of
 Frederickshal in Norway confounded all their mighty projects. Charles
 XII. was killed, the Spanish fleet was beaten by that of England, the
 conspiracy which had been formed in France was discovered and quelled,
 Alberoni was driven out of Spain, and Gortz was beheaded at Stockholm;
 and of all this formidable league, so lately made, the czar alone
 retained his credit, who by not having put himself in the power of any
 one, gave law to all his neighbours.
 
 At the death of Charles XII. there was a total change of measures in
 Sweden. Charles had governed with a despotic power, and his sister
 Ulrica was elected Queen on express condition of renouncing arbitrary
 government. Charles intended to form an alliance with the czar against
 England and its allies, and the new government of Sweden now joined
 those allies against the czar.
 
 The congress at Oeland, however, was not broken up; but the Swedes, now
 in league with the English, flattered themselves that the fleets of that
 nation sent into the Baltic would procure them a more advantageous
 peace. A body of Hanoverian troops entered the dominions of the duke of
 Mecklenburg (Feb. 1716.), but were soon driven from thence by the czar's
 forces.
 
 Peter likewise had a body of troops in Poland, which kept in awe both
 the party of Augustus, and that of Stanislaus; and as to Sweden, he had
 a fleet always ready, either to make a descent on their coasts, or to
 oblige the Swedish government to hasten matters in the congress. This
 fleet consisted of twelve large ships of the line, and several lesser
 ones, besides frigates and galleys. The czar served on board this fleet
 as vice-admiral, under the command of admiral Apraxin.
 
 A part of this fleet signalized itself in the beginning against a
 Swedish squadron, and, after an obstinate engagement, took one ship of
 the line, and two frigates. Peter, who constantly endeavoured, by every
 possible means, to encourage and improve the navy he had been at so much
 pains to establish, gave, on this occasion, sixty thousand French
 livres[111] in money among the officers of this squadron, with several
 gold medals, besides conferring marks of honour on those who principally
 distinguished themselves.
 
 About this time also the English fleet under admiral Norris came up the
 Baltic, in order to favour the Swedes. Peter, who well knew how far he
 could depend on his new navy, was not to be frightened by the English,
 but boldly kept the sea, and sent to know of the English admiral if he
 was come only as a friend to the Swedes, or as an enemy to Russia? The
 admiral returned for answer, that he had not as yet any positive orders
 from his court on that head: however Peter, notwithstanding this
 equivocal reply, continued to keep the sea with his fleet.
 
 The English fleet, which in fact was come thither only to shew itself,
 and thereby induce the czar to grant more favourable conditions of peace
 to the Swedes, went to Copenhagen, and the Russians made some descents
 on the Swedish coast, and even in the neighbourhood of Copenhagen, (July
 1719.) where they destroyed some copper mines, burnt about fifteen
 thousand houses, and did mischief enough to make the Swedes heartily
 wish for a speedy conclusion of the peace.
 
 Accordingly the new queen of Sweden pressed a renewal of the
 negotiations; Osterman himself was sent to Stockholm, and matters
 continued in this situation during the whole of the year 1719.
 
 The following year the prince of Hesse, husband to the queen of Sweden,
 and now become king, in virtue of her having yielded up the sovereign
 power in his favour, began his reign by sending a minister to the court
 of Petersburg, in order to hasten the so much desired peace; but the war
 was still carried on in the midst of these negotiations.
 
 The English fleet joined that of the Swedes, but did not yet commit any
 hostilities, as there was no open rupture between the courts of Russia
 and England, and admiral Norris even offered his master's mediation
 towards bringing about a peace; but as this offer was made with arms in
 hand, it rather retarded than facilitated the negotiations. The coasts
 of Sweden, and those of the new Russian provinces in the Baltic, are so
 situated, that the former lay open to every insult, while the latter are
 secured by their difficult access. This was clearly seen when admiral
 Norris, after having thrown off the mask, (June 1720.) made a descent in
 conjunction with the Swedish fleet on a little island in the province of
 Esthonia, called Narguen, which belonged to the czar, where they only
 burnt a peasant's house; but the Russians at the same time made a
 descent near Wasa, and burnt forty-one villages, and upwards of one
 thousand houses, and did an infinite deal of damage to the country round
 about. Prince Galitzin boarded and took four Swedish frigates, and the
 English admiral seemed to have come only to be spectator of that pitch
 of glory to which the czar had raised his infant navy; for he had but
 just shewn himself in those seas, when the Swedish frigates were carried
 in triumph into the harbour of Cronslot before Petersburg.[112] On this
 occasions methinks the English did too much if they came only as
 mediators, and too little if as enemies.
 
 Nov. 1720.] At length, the new king of Sweden demanded a cessation of
 arms; and as he found the menaces of the English had stood him in no
 stead, he had recourse to the duke of Orleans, the French regent; and
 this prince, at once an ally of Russia and Sweden, had the honour of
 effecting a reconciliation between them. (Feb. 1721.) He sent Campredon,
 his plenipotentiary, to the court of Petersburg, and from thence to that
 of Stockholm. A congress was opened at Nystadt,[113] but the czar would
 not agree to a cessation of arms till matters were on the point of being
 concluded and the plenipotentiaries ready to sign. He had an army in
 Finland ready to subdue the rest of that province, and his fleets were
 continually threatening the Swedish coasts, so that he seemed absolute
 master of dictating the terms of peace; accordingly they subscribed to
 whatever he thought fit to demand. By this treaty he was to remain in
 perpetual possession of all that his arms had conquered, from the
 borders of Courland to the extremity of the gulf of Finland, and from
 thence again of the whole extent of the country of Kexholm, and that
 narrow slip of Finland which stretches out to the northward of the
 neighbourhood of Kexholm; so that he remained master of all Livonia,
 Esthonia, Ingria, Carelia, with the country of Wybourg, and the
 neighbouring isles, which secured to him the sovereignty of the sea, as
 likewise of the isles of Oessel, Dago, Mona, and several others: the
 whole forming an extent of three thousand leagues of country, of unequal
 breadth, and which altogether made a large kingdom, that proved the
 reward of twenty years' immense pains and labour.
 
 The peace was signed at Nystadt the 10th September, 1721, N. S. by the
 Russian minister Osterman, and general Bruce.
 
 Peter was the more rejoiced at that event, as it freed him from the
 necessity of keeping such large armies on the frontiers of Sweden, as
 also from any apprehensions on the part of England, or of the
 neighbouring states, and left him at full liberty to exert his whole
 attention to the modelling of his empire, in which he had already made
 so successful a beginning, and to cherish arts and commerce, which he
 had introduced among his subjects, at the expense of infinite labour and
 industry.
 
 In the first transports of his satisfaction, we find him writing in
 these terms to his plenipotentiaries; 'You have drawn up the treaty as
 if we ourself had dictated and sent it to you to offer the Swedes to
 sign. This glorious event shall be ever present to our remembrance.'
 
 All degrees of people, throughout the Russian empire, gave proofs of
 their satisfaction, by the most extraordinary rejoicings of all kinds,
 and particularly at Petersburg. The triumphal festivals, with which the
 czar had entertained his people during the course of the war, were
 nothing to compare to these rejoicings for the peace, which every one
 hailed with unutterable satisfaction. The peace itself was the most
 glorious of all his triumphs; and what pleased more than all the pompous
 shows on the occasion, was a free pardon and general release granted to
 all prisoners, and a general remission of all sums due to the royal
 treasury for taxes throughout the whole empire, to the day of the
 publication of the peace. In consequence of which a multitude of
 unhappy wretches, who had been confined in prison, were set at
 liberty, excepting only those guilty of highway-robbery, murder, or
 treason.[114]
 
 It was at this time that the senate decreed Peter the titles of _Great_,
 _Emperor_, and _Father of his Country_. Count Golofkin, the high
 chancellor, made a speech to the czar in the great cathedral, in the
 name of all the orders of the state, the senators crying aloud, _Long
 live our emperor and father!_ in which acclamations they were joined by
 the united voice of all the people present. The ministers of France,
 Germany, Poland, Denmark, and the states-general, waited on him, with
 their congratulations, on the titles lately bestowed on him, and
 formally acknowledged for emperor him who had been always publicly known
 in Holland by that title, ever since the battle of Pultowa. The names of
 _Father_, and of _Great_, were glorious epithets, which no one in Europe
 could dispute him; that of _Emperor_ was only a honorary title, given by
 custom to the sovereigns of Germany, as titular kings of the Romans; and
 it requires time before such appellations come to be formally adopted by
 those courts where forms of state and real glory are different things.
 But Peter was in a short time after acknowledged emperor by all the
 states of Europe, excepting only that of Poland, which was still divided
 by factions, and the pope, whose suffrage was become of very little
 significance, since the court of Rome had lost its credit in proportion
 as other nations became more enlightened.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XXXV.
 
     Conquests in Persia.
 
 
 The situation of Russia is such, as necessarily obliges her to keep up
 certain connexions with all the nations that lie in the fifth degree of
 north latitude. When under a bad administration, she was a prey by turns
 to the Tartars, the Swedes, and the Poles; but when governed by a
 resolute and vigorous prince, she became formidable to all her
 neighbours. Peter began his reign by an advantageous treaty with the
 Chinese. He had waged war at one and the same time against the Swedes
 and the Turks, and now prepared to lead his victorious armies into
 Persia.
 
 At this time Persia began to fall into that deplorable state, in which
 we now behold her. Let us figure to ourselves the thirty years' war in
 Germany, the times of the league, those of the massacre of St.
 Bartholomew, and the reigns of Charles VI. and of king John in France,
 the civil wars in England, the long and horrible ravages of the whole
 Russian empire by the Tartars, or their invasion of China; and then we
 shall have some slight conception of the miseries under which the
 Persian empire has so long groaned.
 
 A weak and indolent prince, and a powerful and enterprising subject, are
 sufficient to plunge a whole nation into such an abyss of disasters.
 Hussein, sha, shaic, or sophi of Persia, a descendant of the great sha
 Abbas, who sat at this time on the throne of Persia, had given himself
 wholly up to luxury and effeminacy: his prime minister committed acts of
 the greatest violence and injustice, which this great prince winked at,
 and this gave rise to forty years' desolation and bloodshed.
 
 Persia, like Turkey, has several provinces, all governed in a different
 manner; she has subjects immediately under her dominion, vassals,
 tributary princes, and even nations, to whom the court was wont to pay a
 tribute, under the name of subsidies; for instance, the people of
 Daghestan, who inhabit the branches of mount Caucasus, to the westward
 of the Caspian Sea, which was formerly a part of the ancient Albania;
 for all nations have changed their appellation and their limits. These
 are now called Lesgians, and are mountaineers, who are rather under the
 protection, than the dominion, of Persia; to these the government paid
 subsidies for defending the frontiers.
 
 At the other extremity of the empire, towards the Indies, was the prince
 of Candahar, who commanded a kind of martial militia, called Aghwans.
 This prince of Candahar was a vassal of the Persian, as the hospodars of
 Walachia and Moldavia are of the Turkish empire: this vassalage was not
 hereditary, but exactly the same with the ancient feudal tenures
 established throughout Europe, by that race of Tartars who overthrew the
 Roman empire. The Aghwan militia, of which the prince of Candahar was
 the head, was the same with the Albanians on the coasts of the Caspian
 Sea, in the neighbourhood of Daghestan, and a mixture of Circassians and
 Georgians, like the ancient Mamelucks who enslaved Egypt. The name of
 Aghwans is a corruption; Timur, whom we call Tamerlane, had led these
 people into India, and they remained settled in the province of
 Candahar, which sometimes belonged to the Mogul empire, and sometimes to
 that of Persia. It was these Aghwans and Lesgians who began the
 revolution.
 
 Mir-Weis, or Meriwitz, intendant of the province, whose office was only
 to collect the tributes, assassinated the prince of Candahar, armed the
 militia, and continued master of the province till his death, which
 happened in 1717. His brother came quietly to the succession, by paying
 a slight tribute to the Persian court. But the son of Mir-Weis, who
 inherited the ambition of his father, assassinated his uncle, and began
 to erect himself into a conqueror. This young man was called
 Mir-Mahmoud, but he was known in Europe only by the name of his father,
 who had begun the rebellion. Mahmoud reinforced his Aghwans, by adding
 to them all the Guebres he could get together. These Guebres were an
 ancient race of Persians, who had been dispersed by the caliph Omar, and
 who still continued attached to the religion of the Magi (formerly
 flourished in the reign of Cyrus), and were always secret enemies to the
 new Persians. Having assembled his forces, Mahmoud marched into the
 heart of Persia, at the head of a hundred thousand men.
 
 At the same time the Lesgians or Albanians, who, on account of the
 troublesome times, had not received their subsidies from the court of
 Persia, came down from their mountains with an armed force, so that the
 flames of civil war were lighted up at both ends of the empire, and
 extended themselves even to the capital.
 
 These Lesgians ravaged all that country which stretches along the
 western borders of the Caspian Sea, as far as Derbent, or the Iron Gate.
 In this country is situated the city of Shamache, about fifteen leagues
 distant from the sea, and is said to have been the ancient residence of
 Cyrus, and by the Greeks called Cyropolis, for we know nothing of the
 situation or names of these countries, but what we have from the Greeks;
 but as the Persians never had a prince called Cyrus, much less had they
 any city called Cyropolis. It is much in the same manner that the Jews,
 who commenced authors when they were settled in Alexandria, framed a
 notion of a city called Scythopolis, which, said they, was built by the
 Scythians in the neighbourhood of Judea, as if either Scythians or
 ancient Jews could have given Greek names to their towns.
 
 The city of Shamache was very rich. The Armenians, who inhabit in the
 neighbourhood of this part of the Persian empire, carried on an immense
 traffic there, and Peter had lately established a company of Russian
 merchants at his own expense, which company became very flourishing. The
 Lesgians made themselves masters of this city by surprise, plundered it,
 and put to death all the Russians who traded there under the protection
 of shah Hussein, after having stripped all their warehouses. The loss on
 this occasion was said to amount to four millions of rubles.
 
 Peter upon this sent to demand satisfaction of the emperor Hussein, who
 was then disputing the throne with the rebel Mahmoud, who had usurped
 it, and likewise of Mahmoud himself. The former of these was willing to
 do the czar justice, the other refused it; Peter therefore resolved to
 right himself, and take advantage of the distractions in the Persian
 empire.
 
 Mir-Mahmoud still pushed his conquests in Persia. The sophi hearing that
 the emperor of Russia was preparing to enter the Caspian Sea, in order
 to revenge the murder of his subjects at Shamache, made private
 application to him, by means of an Armenian, to take upon him at the
 same time the defence of Persia.
 
 Peter had for a considerable time formed a project to make himself
 master of the Caspian Sea, by means of a powerful naval force, and to
 turn the tide of commerce from Persia and a part of India through his
 own dominions. He had caused several parts of this sea to be sounded,
 the coasts to be surveyed, and exact charts made of the whole. He then
 set sail for the coast of Persia the 15th day of May, 1722. Catherine
 accompanied him in this voyage, as she had done in the former. They
 sailed down the Wolga as far as the city of Astracan. From thence he
 hastened to forward the canals which were to join the Caspian, the
 Baltic, and the Euxine seas, a work which has been since executed in
 part under the reign of his grandson.
 
 While he was directing these works, the necessary provisions for his
 expedition were arrived in the Caspian Sea. He was to take with him
 twenty-two thousand foot, nine thousand dragoons, fifteen thousand
 Cossacks, and three thousand seamen, who were to work the ships, and
 occasionally assist the soldiery in making descents on the coast. The
 horse were to march over land through deserts where there was frequently
 no water to be had, and afterwards to pass over the mountains of
 Caucasus, where three hundred men are sufficient to stop the progress of
 a whole army; but the distracted condition in which Persia then was,
 warranted the most hazardous enterprises.
 
 The czar sailed about a hundred leagues to the southward of Astracan,
 till he came to the little town of Andrewhoff. It may appear
 extraordinary to hear of the name of Andrew on the coasts of the
 Hyrcanian Sea; but some Georgians, who were formerly a sect of
 Christians, had built this town, which the Persians afterwards
 fortified; but it fell an easy prey to the czar's arms. From thence he
 continued advancing by land into the province of Daghestan, and caused
 manifestoes to be circulated in the Turkish and Persian languages.[115]
 It was necessary to keep fair with the Ottoman Porte, who reckoned among
 its subjects, not only the Circassians and Georgians, who border upon
 this country, but also several powerful vassals, who had of late put
 themselves under the protection of the grand seignior.
 
 Among others there was one very powerful, named Mahmoud d'Utmich, who
 took the title of sultan, and had the courage to attack the czar's
 troops, by which he was totally defeated, and the story says, that his
 whole country was made a bonfire on the occasion.
 
 Sept. 14, 1722.] In a short time afterwards Peter arrived at the city of
 Derbent, by the Persians and Turks called Demir Capi, that is, the Iron
 Gate, and so named from having formerly had an iron gate at the south
 entrance. The city is long and narrow, its upper part joins to a rocky
 branch of Mount Caucasus, and the walls of the lower part are washed by
 the sea, which in violent storms make a breach over them. These walls
 might pass for one of the wonders of antiquity, being forty feet in
 height, and six in breadth, defended with square towers at the distance
 of every fifty feet. The whole work seems one uniform piece, and is
 built of a sort of brown free-stone mixed with pounded shells, which
 served as mortar, so that the whole forms a mass harder than marble. The
 city lies open from the sea, but part of it next the land appears
 impregnable. There are still some ruins of an old wall like that of
 China, which must have been built in the earliest times of antiquity,
 and stretched from the borders of the Caspian Sea to the Pontus Euxinus;
 and this was probably a rampart raised by the ancient kings of Persia
 against those swarms of barbarians which dwelt between those two seas.
 
 According to the Persian tradition, the city of Derbent was partly
 repaired and fortified by Alexander the Great. Arrian and Quintus
 Curtius tell us, that Alexander absolutely rebuilt this city. They say
 indeed that it was on the banks of the Tanais or Don, but then in their
 time the Greeks gave the name of Tanais to the river Cyrus, which runs
 by the city. It would be a contradiction to suppose that Alexander
 should build a harbour in the Caspian Sea, on a river that opens into
 the Black Sea.
 
 There were formerly three or four other ports in different parts of the
 Caspian Sea, all which were probably built with the same view; for the
 several nations inhabiting to the west, east, and north of that sea,
 have in all times been barbarians, who had rendered themselves
 formidable to the rest of the world, and from hence principally issued
 those swarms of conquerors who subjugated Asia and Europe.
 
 And here I must beg leave to remark, how much pleasure authors in all
 ages have taken to impose upon mankind, and how much they have preferred
 a vain show of eloquence to matter of fact. Quintus Curtius puts into
 the mouths of Scythians an admirable speech full of moderation and
 philosophy, as if the Tartars of those regions had been all so many
 sages, and that Alexander had not been the general nominated by the
 Greeks against the king of Persia, sovereign of the greatest part of
 southern Scythia and the Indies. Other rhetoricians, thinking to imitate
 Quintus Curtius, have studied to make us look upon those savages of
 Caucacus and its dreary deserts, who lived wholly upon rapine and
 bloodshed, as the people in the world most remarkable for austere virtue
 and justice, and have painted Alexander, the avenger of Greece, and the
 conqueror of those who would have enslaved him and his country, as a
 public robber, who had ravaged the world without justice or reason.
 
 Such writers do not consider, that these Tartars were never other than
 destroyers, and that Alexander built towns in the very country which
 they inhabited; and in this respect I may venture to compare Peter the
 Great to Alexander; like him he was assiduous and indefatigable in his
 pursuits, a lover and friend of the useful arts; he surpassed him as a
 lawgiver, and like him endeavoured to change the tide of commerce in the
 world, and built and repaired at least as many towns as that celebrated
 hero of antiquity.
 
 On the approach of the Russian army, the governor of Derbent resolved
 not to sustain a siege, whether he thought he was not able to defend the
 place, or that he preferred the czar's protection to that of the tyrant
 Mahmoud; brought the keys of the town and citadel (which were silver)
 and presented them to Peter, whose army peaceably entered the city, and
 then encamped on the sea-shore.
 
 The usurper, Mahmoud, already master of great part of Persia, in vain
 endeavoured to prevent the czar from taking possession of Derbent: he
 stirred up the neighbouring Tartars, and marched into Persia to the
 relief of the place; but, too late, for Derbent was already in the hands
 of the conqueror.
 
 Peter however was not in a condition to push his successes any further
 at this time. The vessels which were bringing him a fresh supply of
 provisions, horses, and recruits, had been cast away near Astracan, and
 the season was far spent. He therefore returned to Moscow, Jan. 5. which
 he entered in triumph; and after his arrival (according to custom) gave
 a strict account of his expedition to the vice-czar Romadanowski, thus
 keeping up this extraordinary farce, which, says his eulogium,
 pronounced in the academy of sciences at Paris, ought to have been
 performed before all the monarchs of the earth.
 
 The empire of Persia continued to be divided between Hussein and the
 usurper Mahmoud. The first of these thought to find a protector in the
 czar, and the other dreaded him as an avenger, who was come to snatch
 the fruits of his rebellion out of his hands. Mahmoud exerted all his
 endeavours to stir up the Ottoman Porte against Peter, and for this
 purpose sent an embassy to Constantinople, while the princes of
 Daghestan, who were under the protection of the grand seignior, and had
 been stript of their territories by the victorious army of Peter, cried
 aloud for vengeance. The divan was now alarmed for the safety of
 Georgia, which the Turks reckon in the number of their dominions.
 
 The grand seignior was on the point of declaring war against the czar,
 but was prevented by the courts of Vienna and Paris. The emperor of
 Germany at the same time declared, that if Russia should be attacked by
 the Turks, he must be obliged to defend it. The marquis de Bonac, the
 French ambassador at Constantinople, made a dextrous use of the menaces
 of the imperial court, and at the same time insinuated, that it was
 contrary to the true interest of the Turkish empire, to suffer a rebel
 and an usurper to set the example of dethroning sovereigns, and that the
 czar had done no more than what the grand seignior himself ought to have
 done.
 
 During these delicate negotiations, Mir Mahmoud was advanced to the
 gates of Derbent, and had laid waste all the neighbouring country in
 order to cut off all means of subsistence from the Russian army. That
 part of ancient Hyrcania, now called Ghilan, was reduced to a desert,
 and the inhabitants threw themselves under the protection of the
 Russians, whom they looked upon as their deliverers.
 
 In this they followed the example of the sophi himself. That unfortunate
 prince sent a formal embassy to Peter the Great, to request his
 assistance; but the ambassador was hardly departed, when the rebel, Mir
 Mahmoud, seized on Ispahan and the person of his master.
 
 Thamaseb, the son of the dethroned sophi, who was taken prisoner, found
 means to escape out of the tyrant's hands, and got together a body of
 troops, with which he gave the usurper battle. He seconded his father's
 entreaties to Peter the Great for his protection, and sent to the
 ambassador the same instructions which Shah Hussein had given him.
 
 This ambassador, whose name was Ishmael Beg, found that his negotiations
 had proved successful, even before he arrived in person; for, on landing
 at Astracan, he learnt that general Matufkin was going to set out with
 fresh recruits to reinforce the army in Daghestan. The dey of Baku or
 Bachu, which with the Persians gives to the Caspian Sea the name of the
 Sea of Bacou, was not yet taken. The ambassador therefore gave the
 Russian general a letter for the inhabitants, in which he exhorted them
 in his master's name to submit to the emperor of Russia. The ambassador
 then proceeded to Petersburg, and general Matufkin departed to lay siege
 to the city of Bachu. (Aug. 1723.) The Persian ambassador arrived at the
 czar's court the very day that tidings were brought of the reduction of
 that city.
 
 Baku is situate near Shamache, but is neither so well peopled, nor so
 rich as the latter. It is chiefly remarkable for the naptha, with which
 it furnishes all Persia. Never was treaty so speedily concluded as that
 of Ishmael Beg. (Sept. 1723.) Czar Peter promised to march with his
 forces into Persia, in order to revenge the death of his subjects, and
 to succour Thamaseb against the usurper of his crown, and the new sophi
 in return was to cede to him, not only the towns of Bachu and Derbent,
 but likewise the provinces of Ghilan, Mazanderan, and Asterabath.
 
 Ghilan is, as we have already observed, the ancient South Hyrcania;
 Mazanderan, which joins to it, is the country of the Mardi, or Mardians;
 and Asterabath borders upon Mazanderan. These were the three principal
 provinces of the ancient Median kings; so that Peter beheld himself, by
 the means of arms and treaties, in possession of the original kingdom of
 Cyrus.
 
 It may not be foreign to our subject to observe, that by the articles of
 this convention, the prices of necessaries to be furnished to the army
 were settled. A camel was to cost only sixty franks (about twelve
 rubles) a pound of bread no more than five farthings, the same weight of
 beef about six. These prices furnish a convincing proof of the plenty
 he found in these countries, that possessions in land are of the most
 intrinsic value, and that money, which is only of nominal worth, was at
 that time very scarce.
 
 Such was the deplorable state to which Persia was then reduced, that the
 unfortunate sophi Thamaseb, a wanderer in his own kingdom, and flying
 before the face of the rebel, Mahmoud, who had dipt his hands in the
 blood of his father and his brothers, was necessitated to entreat the
 court of Russia and the Turkish divan to accept of one part of his
 dominions to preserve for him the rest.
 
 It was agreed then, between czar Peter, sultan Achmet III. and the sophi
 Thamaseb, that the first of these should keep the three provinces
 above-named, and that the Porte should have Casbin, Tauris, and Erivan,
 besides what she had already taken from the usurper. Thus was this noble
 kingdom dismembered at once by the Russians, the Turks, and the Persians
 themselves.
 
 And now the emperor Peter might be said to extend his dominions from the
 furthest part of the Baltic Sea, beyond the southern limits of the
 Caspian. Persia still continued a prey to violations and devastations,
 and its natives, till then opulent and polite, were now sunk in poverty
 and barbarism, while the Russian people had arisen from indigence and
 ignorance to a state of riches and learning. One single man, by a
 resolute and enterprising genius, had brought his country out of
 obscurity; and another, by his weakness and indolence, had brought
 destruction upon his.
 
 Hitherto we know very little of the private calamities which for so long
 a time spread desolation over the face of the Persian empire. It is
 said, that shah Hussein was so pusillanimous as to place with his own
 hands the tiara or crown of Persia on the head of the usurper Mahmoud,
 and also that this Mahmoud afterwards went mad. Thus the lives of so
 many thousands of men depend on the caprice of a madman or a fool. They
 add furthermore, that Mahmoud, in one of his fits of frenzy, put to
 death with his own hand all the sons and nephews of the shah Hussein to
 the number of a hundred; and that he caused the gospel of St. John to be
 read upon his head, in order to purify himself, and to receive a cure
 for his disorder. These and such like Persian fables have been
 circulated by our monks, and afterwards printed in Paris.
 
 The tyrant, after having murdered his uncle, was in his turn put to
 death by his nephew Eshreff, who was as cruel and bloody a tyrant as
 Mahmoud himself.
 
 Shah Thamaseb still continued imploring the assistance of Russia. This
 Thamaseb or shah Thomas, was assisted and afterwards replaced on the
 throne by the famous Kouli Khan, and was again dethroned by the same
 Kouli Khan.
 
 The revolutions and wars which Russia had afterwards to encounter
 against the Turks, and in which she proved victorious, the evacuating
 the three provinces in Persia, which cost Russia more to keep than they
 were worth, are events which do not concern Peter the Great, as they did
 not happen till several years after his death; it may suffice to
 observe, that he finished his military career by adding three provinces
 to his empire on the part next to Persia, after having just before added
 the same number on that side next to Sweden.
 
 
 
 
 CHAP. XXXVI.
 
     Of the Coronation of the Empress Catherine I. and the Death of Peter
     the Great.
 
 
 Peter, at his return from his Persian expedition, found himself in a
 better condition than ever to be the arbiter of the North. He now openly
 declared himself the protector of Charles XII. whose professed enemy he
 had been for eighteen years. He sent for the duke of Holstein, nephew to
 that monarch, to his court, promised him his eldest daughter in
 marriage, and began to make preparations for supporting him in his
 claims on the duchy of Holstein Sleswick, and even engaged himself so to
 do by a treaty of alliance, (Feb. 1724.) which he concluded with the
 crown of Sweden.
 
 He continued the works he had begun all over his empire, to the further
 extremity of Kamtshatka, and for the better direction of them,
 established an academy of sciences at Petersburg. The arts began now to
 flourish on every side: manufactures were encouraged, the navy was
 augmented, the army well provided, and the laws properly enforced. He
 now enjoyed his glory in full repose; but was desirous of sharing it in
 a new manner with her who, according to his own declaration, by
 remedying the disaster of the campaign of Pruth, had been in some
 measure the instrument of his acquiring that glory.
 
 Accordingly, the coronation of his consort Catherine was performed at
 Moscow, in presence of the duchess of Courland, his eldest brother's
 daughter, and the duke of Holstein, his intended son-in-law. (May 28,
 1724.) The declaration which he published on this occasion merits
 attention: he therein cites the examples of several Christian princes
 who had placed the crown on the heads of their consorts, as likewise
 those of the heathen emperors, Basilides, Justinian, Heraclius, and Leo,
 the philosopher. He enumerates the services Catherine had done to the
 state, and in particular in the war against the Turks,--'Where my army,'
 says he, 'which had been reduced to 22,000 men, had to encounter an army
 above 200,000 strong.' He does not say, in this declaration, that the
 empress was to succeed to the crown after his death; but this ceremony,
 which was altogether new and unusual in the Russian empire, was one of
 those means by which he prepared the minds of his subjects for such an
 event. Another circumstance that might perhaps furnish a stronger reason
 to believe that he destined Catherine to succeed him on the throne, was,
 that he himself marched on foot before her the day of her coronation, as
 captain of a new company, which he had created under the name of the
 _knights of the empress_.
 
 When they arrived at the cathedral, Peter himself placed the crown on
 her head; and when she would have fallen down and embraced his knees, he
 prevented her; and, at their return from the church, caused the sceptre
 and globe to be carried before her. The ceremony was altogether worthy
 an emperor; for on every public occasion Peter shewed as much pomp and
 magnificence as he did plainness and simplicity in his private manner of
 living.
 
 Having thus crowned his spouse, he at length determined to give his
 eldest daughter, Anna Petrowna, in marriage to the duke of Holstein.
 This princess greatly resembled her father in the face, was very
 majestic, and of a singular beauty. She was betrothed to the duke of
 Holstein on the 24th of November, 1724, but with very little ceremony.
 Peter having for some time past found his health greatly impaired, and
 this, together with some family uneasiness, that perhaps rather
 increased his disorder, which in a short time proved fatal, permitted
 him to have but very little relish for feasts or public diversions in
 this latter part of his life. [116] The empress Catherine had at that
 time a young man for the chamberlain of her household, whose name was
 Moens de la Croix, a native of Russia, but of Flemish parents,
 remarkably handsome and genteel. His sister, madame de Balc, was
 bed-chamber-woman to the empress, and these two had entirely the
 management of her household. Being both accused of having taken
 presents, they were sent to prison, and afterwards brought to their
 trial by express order of the czar; who, by an edict in the year 1714,
 had forbidden any one holding a place about court to receive any present
 or other gratuity, on pain of being declared infamous, and suffering
 death; and this prohibition had been several times renewed.
 
 The brother and sister were found guilty, and received sentence, and all
 those who had either purchased their services or given them any gratuity
 in return for the same, were included therein, except the duke of
 Holstein and his minister count Bassewitz: as it is probable that the
 presents made by that prince, to those who had a share in bringing about
 his marriage with the czar's daughter, were not looked upon in a
 criminal light.
 
 Moens was condemned to be beheaded, and his sister (who was the
 empress's favourite) to receive eleven strokes of the knout. The two
 sons of this lady, one of whom was an officer in the household, and the
 other a page, were degraded, and sent to serve as private soldiers in
 the army in Persia.
 
 These severities, though they shock our manners, were perhaps necessary
 in a country where the observance of the laws is to be enforced only by
 the most terrifying rigour. The empress solicited her favourite's
 pardon; but the czar, offended at her application, peremptorily refused
 her, and, in the heat of his passion, seeing a fine looking-glass in the
 apartment, he, with one blow of his fist, broke it into a thousand
 pieces; and, turning to the empress, 'Thus,' said he, 'thou seest I can,
 with one stroke of my hand, reduce this glass to its original dust.'
 Catherine, in a melting accent, replied, 'It is true, you have destroyed
 one of the greatest ornaments of your palace, but do you think that
 palace is the more charming for its loss?' This answer appeased the
 emperor's wrath; but all the favour that Catherine could obtain for her
 bed-chamber-woman was, that she should receive only five strokes of the
 knout instead of eleven.
 
 I should not have related this anecdote, had it not been attested by a
 public minister, who was eye-witness of the whole transaction, and who,
 by having made presents to the unfortunate brother and sister, was
 perhaps himself one of the principal causes of their disgrace and
 sufferings. It was this affair that emboldened those who judge of every
 thing in the worst light, to spread the report that Catherine hastened
 the death of her husband, whose choleric disposition filled her with
 apprehensions that overweighed the gratitude she owed him for the many
 favours he had heaped upon her.
 
 These cruel suspicions were confirmed by Catherine's recalling to court
 her woman of the bed-chamber immediately upon the death of the czar, and
 reinstating her in her former influence. It is the duty of an historian
 to relate the public reports which have been circulated in all times in
 states, on the decease of princes who have been snatched away by a
 premature death, as if nature was not alone sufficient to put a period
 to the existence of a crowned head as well as that of a beggar; but it
 is likewise the duty of an historian to shew how far such reports were
 rashly or unjustly formed.
 
 There is an immense distance between the momentary discontent which may
 arise from the morose or harsh behaviour of a husband, and the desperate
 resolution of poisoning that husband, who is at the same time our
 sovereign and benefactor in the highest degree. The danger attending
 such a design would have been as great as it was criminal. Catherine had
 at that time a powerful party against her, who epoused the cause of the
 son of the deceased czarowitz. Nevertheless, neither that faction, nor
 any one person about the court, once suspected the czarina; and the
 vague rumours which were spread on this head were founded only on the
 mistaken notions of foreigners, who were very imperfectly acquainted
 with the affair, and who chose to indulge the wretched pleasure of
 accusing of heinous crimes those whom they thought interested to commit
 them. But it was even very doubtful whether this was at all the case
 with Catherine. It was far from being certain that she was to succeed
 her husband. She had been crowned indeed, but only in the character of
 wife to the reigning sovereign, and not as one who was to enjoy the
 sovereign authority after his death.
 
 Peter, in his declaration, had only ordered this coronation as a matter
 of ceremony, and not as conferring a right of governing. He therein only
 cited the examples of emperors, who had caused their consorts to be
 crowned, but not of those who had conferred on them the royal authority.
 In fine, at the very time of Peter's illness, several persons believed
 that the princess Anna Petrowna would succeed him jointly with her
 husband the duke of Holstein, or that the czar would nominate his
 grandson for his successor; therefore, so far from Catherine's being
 interested in the death of the emperor, she rather seemed concerned in
 the preservation of his life.
 
 It is undeniable, that Peter had, for a considerable time, been troubled
 with an abscess in the bladder, and a stoppage of urine. The mineral
 waters of Olnitz, and some others, which he had been advised to use, had
 proved of very little service to him, and he had found himself growing
 sensibly weaker, ever since the beginning of the year 1724. His labours,
 from which he would not allow himself any respite, increased his
 disorder, and hastened his end: (Jan. 1723.) his malady became now more
 and more desperate, he felt burning pains, which threw him into an
 almost constant delirium,[117] whenever he had a moment's interval, he
 endeavoured to write, but he could only scrawl a few lines that were
 wholly unintelligible; and it was with the greatest difficulty that the
 following words, in the Russian language, could be distinguished:--'_Let
 every thing be given to ----_'
 
 He then called for the princess Anna Petrowna, in order to dictate to
 her, but by that time she could come to his bed-side, he had lost his
 speech, and fell into a fit, which lasted sixteen hours. The empress
 Catherine did not quit his bed-side for three nights together. At
 length, he breathed his last in her arms, on the 28th of Jan. 1725.
 about four o'clock in the morning.
 
 His body was conveyed into the great hall of the palace, accompanied by
 all the imperial family, the senate, all the principal personages of
 state, and an innumerable concourse of people. It was there exposed on a
 bed of state, and every one was permitted to approach and kiss his hand,
 till the day of his interment, which was on the 10-21st of March,
 1725.[118]
 
 It has been thought, and it has been asserted in print, that he had
 appointed his wife Catherine to succeed him in the empire, by his last
 will, but the truth is, that he never made any will, or at least none
 that ever appeared; a most astonishing negligence in so great a
 legislator, and a proof that he did not think his disorder mortal.
 
 No one knew, at the time of his death, who was to succeed him: he left
 behind him his grandson Peter, son of the unfortunate Alexis, and his
 eldest daughter Anna, married to the duke of Holstein. There was a
 considerable faction in favour of young Peter; but prince Menzikoff, who
 had never had any other interests than those of the empress Catherine,
 took care to be beforehand with all parties, and their designs; and
 accordingly, when the czar was upon the point of giving up the ghost, he
 caused the empress to remove into another apartment of the palace, where
 all their friends were assembled ready: he had the royal treasures
 conveyed into the citadel, and secured the guards in his interest, as
 likewise the archbishop of Novogorod; and then they held a private
 council, in presence of the empress Catherine, and one Macarof, a
 secretary, in whom they could confide, at which the duke of Holstein's
 minister assisted.
 
 At the breaking up of this council, the empress returned to the czar's
 bed-side, who soon after yielded up the ghost in her arms. As soon as
 his death was made known, the principal senators and general officers
 repaired to the palace, where the empress made a speech to them, which
 prince Menzikoff answered in the name of all present. The empress being
 withdrawn, they proceeded to consider the proper forms to be observed on
 the occasion, when Theophanes, archbishop of Pleskow, told the assembly,
 that, on the eve of the coronation of the empress Catherine, the
 deceased czar had declared to him, that his sole reason for placing the
 crown on her head, was, that she might wear it after his death; upon
 which the assembly unanimously signed the proclamation, and Catherine
 succeeded her husband on the throne the very day of his death.
 
 Peter the Great was regretted by all those whom he had formed, and the
 descendants of those who had been sticklers for the ancient customs soon
 began to look on him as their father: foreign nations, who have beheld
 the duration of his establishments, have always expressed the highest
 admiration for his memory, acknowledging that he was actuated by a more
 than common prudence and wisdom, and not by a vain desire of doing
 extraordinary things. All Europe knows that though he was fond of fame,
 he coveted it only for noble principles; that though he had faults, they
 never obscured his noble qualities, and that, though, as a man, he was
 liable to errors, as a monarch he was always great: he every way forced
 nature, in his subjects, in himself, by sea and land: but he forced her
 only to render her more pleasing and noble. The arts, which he
 transplanted with his own hands, into countries, till then in a manner
 savage, have flourished, and produced fruits which are lasting
 testimonies of his genius, and will render his memory immortal, since
 they now appear as natives of those places to which he introduced them.
 The civil, political, and military government, trade, manufactures, the
 arts and the sciences, have all been carried on, according to his plan,
 and by an event not to be paralleled in history: we have seen four women
 successively ascend the throne after him, who have maintained, in full
 vigour, all the great designs he accomplished, and have completed those
 which he had begun.
 
 The court has undergone some revolutions since his death, but the empire
 has not suffered one. Its splendour was increased by Catherine I. It
 triumphed over the Turks and the Swedes under Anna Petrowna; and under
 Elizabeth it conquered Prussia, and a part of Pomerania; and lastly, it
 has tasted the sweets of peace, and has seen the arts flourish in
 fulness and security in the reign of Catherine the Second.[119]
 
 Let the historians of that nation enter into the minutest circumstances
 of the new creation, the wars and undertakings of Peter the Great: let
 them rouse the emulation of their countrymen, by celebrating those
 heroes who assisted this monarch in his labours, in the field, and in
 the cabinet. It is sufficient for a stranger, a disinterested admirer of
 merit, to have endeavoured to set to view that great man, who learned of
 Charles XII. to conquer him, who twice quitted his dominions, in order
 to govern them the better, who worked with his own hands, in almost all
 the useful and necessary arts, to set an example of instruction to his
 people, and who was the founder and the father of his empire.[120]
 
 Princes, who reign over states long since civilized, may say to
 themselves, 'If a man, assisted only by his own genius, has been capable
 of doing such great things in the frozen climes of ancient Scythia, what
 may not be expected from us, in kingdoms where the accumulated labours
 of many ages have rendered the way so easy?'
 
 
 
 
 ORIGINAL PIECES RELATIVE TO THIS HISTORY, AGREEABLE TO THE TRANSLATIONS
 MADE AT THEIR FIRST PUBLICATION, BY ORDER OF CZAR PETER I.
 
 
 SENTENCE _Pronounced against the CZAROWITZ ALEXIS, June 24th, 1718._
 
 By virtue of an express ordinance issued by his czarish majesty, and
 signed by his own hand, on the 13th of June, for the judgment of the
 czarowitz Alexis Petrowitz, in relation to his crimes and transgressions
 against his father and sovereign; the undernamed ministers and senators,
 estates military and civil, after having assembled several times in the
 regency chamber of the senate of Petersburg, and having heard read the
 original writings and testimonies given against the czarowitz, as also
 his majesty's admonitory letters to that prince, and his answers to them
 in his own writing, and other acts relating to the process, and likewise
 the criminal informations, declarations and confessions of the
 czarowitz, partly written with his own hand, and partly delivered by
 word of mouth to his father and sovereign, before the several persons
 undernamed, constituted by his czarish majesty's authority to the effect
 of the present judgment, do acknowledge and declare, that though
 according to the laws of the Russian empire, it belongs not to them, the
 natural subjects of his czarish majesty's sovereign dominions, to take
 cognizance of an affair of this nature, which for its importance depends
 solely on the absolute will of the sovereign, whose power, unlimited by
 any law, is derived from God alone; yet, in submission to his ordinance
 who hath given them this liberty, and after mature reflection, observing
 the dictates of their consciences without fear, flattery, or respect of
 persons, having nothing before their eyes but the divine laws applicable
 to the present case, the canons and rules of councils, the authority of
 the holy fathers and doctors of the church, and taking also for their
 rule the instruction of the archbishops and clergy assembled at
 Petersburg on this occasion, and conforming themselves to the laws and
 constitutions of this empire, which are agreeable to those of other
 nations, especially the Greeks and the Romans, and other Christian
 princes; they unanimously agreed and pronounced the czarowitz Alexis
 Petrowitz _to be worthy of death_, for the aforesaid crimes and capital
 transgressions against his sovereign and father, he being his czarish
 majesty's son and subject; and that, notwithstanding the promise given
 by his czarish majesty to the czarowitz, in a letter sent by M. Tolstoy
 and captain Romanzoff, dated from Spaw, the 10th of July, 1717, to
 pardon his elopement if he voluntarily returned, as the czarowitz
 himself acknowledges with gratitude, in his answer to that letter, dated
 from Naples, the 4th of October, 1717, wherein he returns thanks to his
 majesty for the pardon he had promised him solely on condition of his
 speedy and voluntary return; yet he hath forfeited and rendered himself
 unworthy of that pardon, by renewing and continuing his former
 transgressions, as is fully set forth in his majesty's manifesto of the
 3d of February, in this present year, and for not returning voluntarily
 and of his own accord.
 
 And although his majesty did, upon the arrival of the czarowitz at
 Moscow, and his humbly confessing in writing his crimes, and asking
 pardon for them, take pity on him, as is natural for every father to act
 towards a son, and at the audience, held in the great hall of the
 castle, dated the said 3d day of February, did promise him full pardon
 for all his crimes and transgressions, it was only on condition that he
 would declare, without reserve or restriction, all his designs, and who
 were his counsellors and abettors therein, but that if he concealed any
 one person or thing, that in such case the promised pardon should be
 null and void, which conditions the czarowitz did at that time accept
 and receive, with all outward tokens of gratitude and obedience,
 solemnly swearing on the holy cross and the blessed evangelists, and in
 the presence of all those assembled at that time and for that purpose in
 the cathedral church, that he would faithfully, and without reserve,
 declare the whole truth.
 
 His majesty did also the next day confirm to the czarowitz in writing
 the said promise, in the interrogatories which hereafter follow, and
 which his majesty caused to be delivered to him, having first written at
 the begining what follows:
 
 'As you did yesterday receive your pardon, on condition that you would
 confess all the circumstances of your flight, and whatever relates
 thereto; but if you concealed any part thereof, you should answer for it
 with your life; and, as you have already made some confessions, it is
 expected of you, for our more full satisfaction, and your own safety, to
 commit the same to writing, in such order as shall in the course of your
 examination be pointed out to you.'
 
 And at the end, under the seventh question, there was again written,
 with his czarish majesty's own hand:
 
 'Declare to us, and discover whatever hath any relation to this affair,
 though it be not here expressed, and clear yourself as if it were at
 confession; for if you conceal any thing that shall by any other means
 be afterwards discovered, do not impute the consequence to us, since you
 have been already told, that in such case the pardon granted you should
 be null and void.'
 
 Notwithstanding all which, the answers and confessions of the czarowitz
 were delivered without any sincerity; he not only concealing many of his
 accomplices, but also the capital circumstances relating to his own
 transgressions, particularly his rebellious design in usurping the
 throne even in the life-time of his father, flattering himself that the
 populace would declare in his favour; all which hath since been fully
 discovered in the criminal process, after he had refused to make a
 discovery himself, as hath appeared by the above presents.
 
 Thus it hath appeared by the whole conduct of the czarowitz, as well as
 by the confessions which he both delivered in writing, and by word of
 mouth, particularly, that he was not disposed to wait for the succession
 in the manner in which his father had left it to him after his death,
 according to equity, and the order of nature which God has established;
 but intended to take the crown off the head of his father, while living,
 and set it upon his own, not only by a civil insurrection, but by the
 assistance of a foreign force, which he had actually requested.
 
 The czarowitz has hereby rendered himself unworthy of the clemency and
 pardon, promised him by the emperor his father; and since the laws
 divine and ecclesiastical, civil and military, condemn to death, without
 mercy, not only those whose attempts against their father and sovereign
 have been proved by testimonies and writings; but even such as have been
 convicted of an intention to rebel, and of having formed a base design
 to kill their sovereign, and usurp the throne; what shall we think of a
 rebellious design, almost unparalleled in history, joined to that of a
 horrid parricide, against him who was his father in a double capacity; a
 father of great lenity and indulgence, who brought up the czarowitz from
 the cradle with more than paternal care and tenderness; who earnestly
 endeavoured to form him for government, and with incredible pains, and
 indefatigable application, to instruct him in the military art, and
 qualify him to succeed to so great an empire? with how much stronger
 reason does such a design deserve to be punished with death?
 
 It is therefore with hearts full of affliction, and eyes streaming with
 tears, that we, as subjects and servants, pronounce this sentence;
 considering that it belongs not to us to give judgment in a case of so
 great importance, and especially to pronounce against the son of our
 most precious sovereign lord the czar. Nevertheless, it being his
 pleasure that we should act in this capacity, we, by these presents,
 declare our real opinion, and pronounce this sentence of condemnation
 with a pure and Christian conscience, as we hope to be able to answer
 for it at the just, awful, and impartial tribunal of Almighty God.
 
 We submit, however, this sentence, which we now pass, to the sovereign
 power, the will, and merciful revisal of his czarish majesty, our most
 gracious sovereign.
 
 
 THE PEACE OF NYSTADT.
 
 In the name of the Most Holy and undivided Trinity.
 
 Be it known by these presents, that whereas a bloody, long, and
 expensive war has arisen and subsisted for several years past, between
 his late majesty king Charles XII. of glorious memory, king of Sweden,
 of the Goths, and Vandals, &c. &c. his successors to the throne of
 Sweden, the lady Ulrica queen of Sweden, of the Goths and Vandals, &c.
 and the kingdom of Sweden, on the one part; and between his czarish
 majesty Peter the First, emperor of all the Russias, &c. and the empire
 of Russia, on the other part; the two powers have thought proper to
 exert their endeavours to find out means to put a period to those
 troubles, and prevent the further effusion of so much innocent blood;
 and it has pleased the Almighty to dispose the hearts of both powers, to
 appoint a meeting of their ministers plenipotentiary, to treat of, and
 conclude a firm, sincere and lasting peace, and perpetual friendship
 between the two powers, their dominions, provinces, countries, vassals,
 subjects, and inhabitants; namely, Mr. John Liliensted, one of the most
 honourable privy-council to his majesty the king of Sweden, his kingdom
 and chancery, and baron Otto Reinhold Stroemfeld, intendant of the
 copper mines and fiefs of Dalders, on the part of his said majesty; and
 on the part of his czarish majesty, count Jacob Daniel Bruce, his
 general adjutant, president of the colleges of mines and manufactories,
 and knight of the order of St. Andrew and the White Eagle, and Mr. Henry
 John Frederic Osterman, one of his said majesty's privy-counsellors in
 his chancery: which plenipotentiary ministers, being assembled at
 Nystadt, and having communicated to each other their respective
 commissions, and imploring the divine assistance, did enter upon this
 important and salutary enterprise, and have, by the grace and blessing
 of God, concluded the following peace between the crown of Sweden and
 his czarish majesty.
 
 Art. 1. There shall be now and henceforward a perpetual and inviolable
 peace, sincere union, and indissoluble friendship, between his majesty
 Frederic the First, king of Sweden, of the Goths and Vandals, his
 successors to the crown and kingdom of Sweden, his dominions, provinces,
 countries, villages, vassals, subjects, and inhabitants, as well within
 the Roman empire as out of said empire, on the one side; and his czarish
 majesty Peter the First, emperor of all the Russias, &c. his successors
 to the throne of Russia, and all his countries, villages, vassals,
 subjects, and inhabitants, on the other side; in such wise, that for
 the future, neither of the two reconciled powers shall commit, or suffer
 to be committed, any hostility, either privately or publicly, directly
 or indirectly, nor shall in any wise assist the enemies of each other,
 on any pretext whatever, not contract any alliance with them, that may
 be contrary to this peace, but shall always maintain and preserve a
 sincere friendship towards each other, and as much as in them lies,
 support their mutual honour, advantage and safety; as likewise prevent,
 to the utmost of their power, any injury or vexation with which either
 of the reconciled parties may be threatened by any other power.
 
 Art. 2. It is further mutually agreed upon betwixt the two parties, that
 a general pardon and act of oblivion for all hostilities committed
 during the war, either by arms or otherwise, shall be strictly observed,
 so far as that neither party shall ever henceforth either call to mind,
 or take vengeance for the same, particularly in regard to persons of
 state, and subjects who have entered into the service of either of the
 two parties during the war, and have thereby become enemies to the
 other, except only the Russian Cossacks, who enlisted in the service of
 the king of Sweden, and whom his czarish majesty will not consent to
 have included in the said general pardon, notwithstanding the
 intercession made for them by the king of Sweden.
 
 Art. 3. All hostilities, both by sea and land, shall cease both here and
 in the grand duchy of Finland in fifteen days, or sooner, if possible,
 after the regular exchange of the ratifications; and to this intent the
 conclusion of the peace shall be published without delay. And in case
 that, after the expiration of the said term, any hostilities should be
 committed by either party, either by sea or land, in any manner
 whatsoever, through ignorance of the conclusion of the peace, such
 offence shall by no means prejudice the conclusion of said peace; on the
 contrary, each shall make a reciprocal exchange of both men and effects
 that may be taken after the said term.
 
 Art. 4. His majesty the king of Sweden does, by the present treaty, as
 well for himself as for his successors to the throne and kingdom of
 Sweden, cede to his czarish majesty, and his successors to the Russian
 empire, in full, irrevocable and everlasting possession, the provinces
 which have been taken by his czarish majesty's arms from the crown of
 Sweden during this war, viz. Livonia, Esthonia, Ingria, and a part of
 Carelia, as likewise the district of the fiefs of Wybourg specified
 hereafter in the article for regulating the limits; the towns and
 fortresses of Riga, Dunamund, Pernau, Revel, Dorpt, Nerva, Wybourg,
 Kexholm, and the other towns, fortresses, harbours, countries,
 districts, rivers, and coasts, belonging to the provinces: as likewise
 the islands of Oesel, Dagoe, Moen, and all the other islands from the
 frontiers of Courland, towards the coasts of Livonia, Esthonia, and
 Ingria, and on the east side of Revel, and in the road of Wybourg,
 towards the south-east, with all the present inhabitants of those
 islands, and of the aforesaid provinces, towns, and countries; and in
 general, all their appurtenances, dependencies, prerogatives, rights,
 and advantages, without exception, in like manner as the crown of Sweden
 possessed them.
 
 To which purpose, his majesty the king of Sweden renounces for ever, in
 the most solemn manner, as well for his own part, as for his successors,
 and for the whole kingdom of Sweden, all pretensions which they have
 hitherto had, or could have, to the said provinces, islands, countries,
 and towns; and all the inhabitants thereof shall, by virtue of these
 presents, be discharged from the oath of allegiance, which they have
 taken to the crown of Sweden, in such wise as that his Swedish majesty,
 and the kingdom of Sweden, shall never hereafter either claim or demand
 the same, on any pretence whatsoever; but, on the contrary, they shall
 be and remain incorporated for ever into the empire of Russia. Moreover,
 his Swedish majesty, and the kingdom of Sweden, promise by these
 presents to assist and support from henceforth his czarish majesty, and
 his successors to the empire of Russia, in the peaceable possession of
 the said provinces, islands, countries, and towns; and that they will
 find out and deliver up to the persons authorized by his czarish majesty
 for that purpose, all the records and papers principally belonging to
 those places which have been taken away and carried into Sweden during
 the war.
 
 Art 5. His czarish majesty, in return, promises to evacuate and restore
 to his Swedish majesty, and the kingdom of Sweden, within the space of
 four weeks after the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty, or
 sooner if possible, the grand duchy of Finland, except only that part
 thereof which has been reserved by the following regulation of the
 limits which shall belong to his czarish majesty, so that his said
 czarish majesty, and his successors, never shall have or bring the least
 claim or demand on the said duchy, on any pretence whatever. His czarish
 majesty further declares and promises, that certain and prompt payment
 of two millions of crowns shall be made without any discount to the
 deputies of the king of Sweden, on condition that they produce and give
 sufficient receipts, as agreed upon; and the said payment shall be made
 in such coin as shall be agreed upon by a separate article, which shall
 be of equal force as if inserted in the body of this treaty.
 
 Art. 6. His majesty the king of Sweden does further reserve to himself,
 in regard to trade, the liberty of buying corn yearly at Riga, Revel,
 and Arensbourg, to the amount of fifty thousand rubles, which corn shall
 be transported from thence into Sweden, without paying duty or any other
 taxes, on producing a certificate, shewing that such corn has been
 purchased for the use of his Swedish majesty, or by his subjects,
 charged with the care of making this purchase by his said majesty; and
 such right shall not be subject to, or depend on any exigency, wherein
 his czarish majesty may find it necessary, either on account of a bad
 harvest, or some other important reasons, to prohibit in general the
 exportation of corn to any other nation.
 
 Art. 7. His czarish majesty does also promise, in the most solemn
 manner, that he will in no wise interfere with the private affairs of
 the kingdom of Sweden, nor with the form of government, which has been
 regulated and established by the oath of allegiance, and unanimous
 consent of the states of said kingdom; neither will he assist therein
 any person whatever, in any manner, directly or indirectly; but, on the
 contrary, will endeavour to hinder and prevent any disturbance
 happening, provided his czarish majesty has timely notice of the same,
 who will on all such occasions act as a sincere friend and good
 neighbour to the crown of Sweden.
 
 Art. 8. And as they mutually intend to establish a firm sincere and
 lasting peace, to which purpose it is very necessary to regulate the
 limits so, that neither of the parties can harbour any jealousy, but
 that each shall peaceably possess whatever has been surrendered to him
 by this treaty of peace, they have thought proper to declare, that the
 two empires shall from henceforth and for ever have the following
 limits, beginning on the northern coast of the Bothnic gulf, near
 Wickolax, from whence they shall extend to within half a league of the
 sea-coast inland, and from the distance of half a league from the sea as
 far as opposite to Willayoki, and from thence further inland; so that
 from the sea-side, and opposite to Rohel, there shall be a distance of
 about three-quarters of a league, in a direct line, to the road which
 leads from Wibourg to Lapstrand, at three leagues distance from Wibourg,
 and which proceeds the same distance of three leagues towards the north
 by Wibourg, in a direct line to the former limits between Russia and
 Sweden, even before the reduction of the district of Kexholm under the
 government of the king of Sweden. Those ancient limits extend eight
 leagues towards the north, from thence they run in a direct line through
 the district of Kexholm, to the place where the harbour of Porogerai,
 which begins near the town of Kudumagube, joins to the ancient limits,
 between Russia and Sweden, so that his majesty the king and kingdom of
 Sweden, shall henceforth possess all that part lying west and north
 beyond the above specified limits, and his czarish majesty and the
 empire of Russia all that part which is situated east and south of the
 said limits. And as his czarish majesty surrenders from henceforth to
 his Swedish majesty and the kingdom of Sweden, a part of the district of
 Kexholm, which belonged heretofore to the empire of Russia, he promises,
 in the most solemn manner, in regard to himself and successors to the
 throne of Russia, that he never will make any future claim to this said
 district of Kexholm, on any account whatever; but the said district
 shall hereafter be and remain incorporated into the kingdom of Sweden.
 As to the limits in the country of Lamparque, they shall remain on the
 same footing as they were before the beginning of this war between the
 two empires. It is further agreed upon, that commissaries shall be
 appointed by each party, immediately after the ratification of this
 treaty to regulate the limits as aforesaid.
 
 Art. 9. His czarish majesty further promises to maintain all the
 inhabitants of the provinces of Livonia, Esthonia, and Oesel, as well
 nobles as plebeians, and the towns, magistrates, companies, and trades,
 in the full enjoyment of the said privileges, customs and prerogatives,
 which they have enjoyed under the dominion of his Swedish majesty.
 
 Art. 10. There shall not hereafter be any violence offered to the
 consciences of the inhabitants of the ceded countries; on the contrary,
 his czarish majesty engages on his side to preserve and maintain the
 evangelical (Lutheran) religion on the same footing as under the Swedish
 government, provided there is likewise a free liberty of conscience
 allowed to those of the Greek religion.
 
 Art. 11. In regard to the reductions and liquidations made in the reign
 of the late king of Sweden in Livonia, Esthonia, and Oesel, to the great
 injury of the subjects and inhabitants of those countries, which,
 conformable to the justice of the affair in question, obliged his late
 majesty the king of Sweden, of glorious memory, to promise, by an
 ordinance (which was published the 13th day of April, 1700, that if any
 one of his subjects could fairly prove, that the goods which had been
 confiscated were their property justice should be done them, whereby
 several subjects of the said countries have had such their confiscated
 effects restored to them) his czarish majesty engages and promises, that
 justice shall be done to every person, whether residing or not, who has
 a just claim or pretension to any lands in Livonia, Esthonia, or the
 province of Oesel, and can make full proof thereof, and that such person
 shall be reinstated in the possession of his lands and effects.
 
 Art. 12. There shall likewise be immediate restitution made, conformable
 to the general amnesty regulated and agreed by the second article, to
 such of the inhabitants of Livonia, Esthonia, and the island of Oesel,
 who may during this war have joined the king of Sweden, together with
 all their effects, lands, and houses, which have been confiscated and
 given to others, as well in the towns of these provinces, as in those of
 Narva and Wibourg, notwithstanding they may have passed during the said
 war by inheritance or otherwise into other hands, with any exception or
 restraint, even though the proprietors should be actually in Sweden,
 either as prisoners or otherwise; and such restitution shall take place
 so soon as each person is re-naturalized by his respective government,
 and produces his documents relating to his right; on the other hand,
 these proprietors shall by no means lay claim to, or pretend to any part
 of, the revenues, which may have been received by those who were in
 possession in consequence of the confiscation, nor to any other
 compensation for their losses in the war or otherwise. And all persons,
 who are thus put in re-possession of their effects and lands, shall be
 obliged to do homage to his czarish majesty, their present sovereign,
 and further to behave themselves as faithful vassals and subjects; and
 when they have taken the usual oath of allegiance, they shall be at
 liberty to leave their own country to go and live in any other, which is
 in alliance and friendship with the Russian empire, as also to enter
 into the service of neutral powers, or to continue therein, if already
 engaged, as they shall think proper. On the other hand, in regard to
 those, who do not choose to do homage to his czarish majesty, they shall
 be allowed the space of three years from the publication of the peace,
 to sell or dispose of their effects, lands, and all belonging to them,
 to the best advantage, without paying any more than is paid by every
 other person, agreeably to the laws and statutes of the country. And if
 hereafter, it should happen that an inheritance should devolve to any
 person according to the laws of the country, and that such person shall
 not as yet have taken the oath of allegiance to his czarish majesty, he
 shall in such case be obliged to take the same at the time of entering
 on the possession of his inheritance, otherwise to sell off all his
 effects in the space of one year.
 
 Also those who have advanced money on lands in Livonia, Esthonia, and
 the island of Oesel, and have lawful security for the same, shall enjoy
 their mortgages peaceably, until both capital and interest are
 discharged; on the other hand, the mortgages shall not claim any
 interest, which expired during the war, and which have not been demanded
 or paid; but those who in either of these cases have the administration
 of the said effects, shall be obliged to do homage to his czarish
 majesty. This likewise extends to all those who remain in his czarish
 majesty's dominions, and who shall have the same liberty to dispose of
 their effects in Sweden, and in those countries which have been
 surrendered to that crown by this peace. Moreover, the subjects of each
 of the reconciled powers shall be mutually supported in all their lawful
 claims and demands, whether on the public, or on individuals within the
 dominions of the two powers, and immediate justice shall be done them,
 so that every person may be reinstated in the possession of what justly
 belongs to him.
 
 Art. 13. All contributions in money shall from the signing of this
 treaty cease in the grand duchy of Finland, which his czarish majesty by
 the fifth article of this treaty cedes to his Swedish majesty and the
 kingdom of Sweden; on the other hand the duchy of Finland shall furnish
 his czarish majesty's troops with the necessary provisions and forage
 gratis, until they shall have entirely evacuated the said duchy, on the
 said footing as has been practised heretofore; and his czarish majesty
 shall prohibit and forbid, under the severest penalties, the dislodging
 any ministers or peasants of the Finnish nation, contrary to their
 inclinations, or that the least injury be done to them. In consideration
 of which, and as it will be permitted his czarish majesty, upon
 evacuating the said countries and towns, to take with him his great and
 small cannon, with their carriages and other appurtenances, and the
 magazines and other warlike stores which he shall think fit. The
 inhabitants shall furnish a sufficient number of horse and waggons as
 far as the frontiers; and also, if the whole of this cannot be executed
 according to the stipulated terms, and that any part of such artillery,
 &c. is necessitated to be left behind, then, and in such cases, that
 which is so left shall be properly taken care of, and afterwards
 delivered to his czarish majesty's deputies, whenever it shall be
 agreeable to them, and likewise be transported to the frontiers in
 manner as above. If his czarish majesty's troops shall have found and
 sent out of the country any deeds or papers belonging to the grand duchy
 of Finland, strict search shall be made for the same, and all of them
 that can be found shall be faithfully restored to deputies of his
 Swedish majesty.
 
 Art. 14. All the prisoners on each side, of whatsoever nation, rank, and
 condition, shall be set at liberty immediately after the ratification of
 this treaty, without any ransom, at the same time every prisoner shall
 either pay or give sufficient security for the payment of all debts by
 them contracted. The prisoners on each side shall be furnished with the
 necessary horses and waggons gratis during the time allotted for their
 return home, in proportion to the distance from the frontiers. In regard
 to such prisoners, who shall have sided with one or the other party, or
 who shall choose to settle in the dominions of either of the two powers,
 they shall have full liberty so to do without restriction: and this
 liberty shall likewise extend to all those who have been compelled to
 serve either party during the war, who may in like manner remain where
 they are, or return home; except such who have voluntarily embraced the
 Greek religion, in compliance to his czarish majesty; for which purpose
 each party shall order that the edicts be published and made known in
 their respective dominions.
 
 Art. 15. His majesty the king, and the republic of Poland, as allies to
 his czarish majesty, are expressly comprehended in this treaty of peace,
 and have equal right thereto, as if the treaty of peace between them and
 the crown of Sweden had been inserted here at full length: to which
 purpose all hostilities whatsoever shall cease in general throughout all
 the kingdoms, countries, and patrimonies belonging to the two reconciled
 parties, whether situated within or out of the Roman empire, and there
 shall be a solid and lasting peace established between the two aforesaid
 powers. And as no plenipotentiary on the part of his Polish majesty and
 the republic of Poland has assisted at this treaty of peace, held at
 Nystadt, and that consequently they could not at one and the same time
 renew the peace by a solemn treaty between his majesty the king of
 Poland and the crown of Sweden, his majesty the king of Sweden does
 therefore engage and promise, that he will send plenipotentiaries to
 open the conferences, so soon as a place shall be appointed for the said
 meeting, in order to conclude, through the mediation of his czarish
 majesty, a lasting peace between the two crowns, provided nothing is
 therein contained which may be prejudicial to the treaty of perpetual
 peace made with his czarish majesty.
 
 Art. 16. A free trade shall be regulated and established as soon as
 possible, which shall subsist both by sea and land between the two
 powers, their dominions, subjects, and inhabitants, by means of a
 separate treaty on this head, to the good and advantage of their
 respective dominions; and in the mean time the subjects of Russia and
 Sweden shall have leave to trade freely in the empire of Russia and
 kingdom of Sweden, so soon as the treaty of peace is ratified, after
 paying the usual duties on the several kinds of merchandise; so that,
 the subjects of Russia and Sweden shall reciprocally enjoy the same
 privileges and prerogatives as are enjoyed by the closest friends of
 either of the said states.
 
 Art. 17. Restitution shall be made on both sides, after the ratification
 of the peace, not only of the magazines which were before the
 commencement of the war established in certain trading towns belonging
 to the two powers, but also liberty shall be reciprocally granted to the
 subjects of his czarish majesty and the king of Sweden to establish
 magazines in the towns, harbours, and other places subject to both or
 either of the said powers.
 
 Art. 18. If any Swedish ships of war or merchant vessels shall have the
 misfortune to be wrecked, or cast away by stress of weather, or any
 other accident, on the coasts and harbours of Russia, his czarish
 majesty's subjects shall be obliged to give them all aid and assistance
 in their power to save their rigging and effects, and faithfully to
 restore whatever may be drove on shore, if demanded, provided they are
 properly rewarded. And the subjects of his majesty the king of Sweden
 shall do the same in regard to such Russian ships and effects as may
 have the misfortune to be wrecked or otherwise lost on the coasts of
 Sweden; for which purpose, and to prevent all ill treatment, robbing,
 and plundering, which commonly happens on such melancholy occasions, his
 czarish majesty and the king of Sweden will cause a most rigorous
 prohibition to be issued, and all who shall be found transgressing in
 this point shall be punished on the spot.
 
 Art. 19. And to prevent all possible cause or occasion of
 misunderstanding between the two parties, in relation to sea affairs,
 they have concluded and determined, that any Swedish ships of war, of
 whatever number or size, that shall hereafter pass by any of his czarish
 majesty's forts or castles, shall salute the same with their cannon,
 which compliment shall be directly returned in the same manner by the
 Russian fort or castle; and, _vice versa_, any Russian ships of war, of
 whatever number or size, that shall hereafter pass by any fort or castle
 belonging to his Swedish majesty, shall salute the same with a discharge
 of their cannon, which compliment shall be instantly returned in the
 same manner by the Swedish fort; and in case any one or more Swedish and
 Russian ships shall meet at sea, or in any harbour or elsewhere, they
 shall salute each other with a common discharge, as is usually practised
 on such occasions between the ships of Sweden and Denmark.
 
 Art. 20. It is mutually agreed between the two powers, no longer to
 defray the expenses of the ministers of the two powers, as have been
 done hitherto; but their representative ministers, plenipotentiaries,
 and envoys, shall hereafter defray their own expenses and those of their
 own attendants, as well on their journey as during their stay, and back
 to their respective place of residence. On the other hand, either of the
 two parties, on receiving timely notice of the arrival of an envoy,
 shall order that their subjects give them all the assistance that may be
 necessary to escort them safe on their journey.
 
 Art. 21. His majesty the king of Sweden does on his part comprehend his
 majesty the king of Great Britain in this treaty of peace, reserving
 only the differences subsisting between their czarish and his Britannic
 majesties, which they shall immediately endeavour to terminate in a
 friendly manner; and such other powers, who shall be named by the two
 reconciled parties within the space of three months, shall likewise be
 included in this treaty of peace.
 
 Art. 22. In case any misunderstanding shall hereafter arise between the
 states and subjects of Sweden and Russia, it shall by no means prejudice
 this treaty of perpetual peace; which shall nevertheless always be and
 remain in full force agreeable to its intent, and commissaries shall
 without delay be appointed on each side to inquire into and adjust all
 disputes.
 
 Art. 23. All those who have been guilty of high treason, murder, theft,
 and other crimes, and those who deserted from Sweden to Russia, and from
 Russia to Sweden, either singly or with their wives and children, shall
 be immediately sent back, provided the complaining party of the country
 from whence they made their escape, shall think fit to recal them, let
 them be of what nation soever, and in the same condition as they were at
 their arrival, together with their wives and children, as likewise with
 all they had stolen, plundered, or taken away with them in their flight.
 
 Art. 24. The exchange of the ratification of this treaty of peace, shall
 be reciprocally made at Nystadt within the space of three weeks, after
 the day of signing the same, or sooner, if possible. In witness whereof,
 two copies of this treaty, exactly corresponding with each other, have
 been drawn up, and confirmed by the plenipotentiary ministers on each
 side, in virtue of the authority they have received from their
 respective sovereigns; which copies they have signed with their own
 hands, and sealed with their own seals. Done at Nystadt, this 30th day
 of August, in the year of our Lord 1721. O. S.

 _Ordinance of the Emperor Peter I. for the crowning of the Empress
 Catherine._
 
 We, Peter the First, emperor and autocrator of all the Russias, &c. to
 all our officers ecclesiastical, civil, and military, and all others of
 the Russian nation, our faithful subjects.
 
 No one can be ignorant that it has been a constant and invariable custom
 among the monarchs of all Christian states, to cause their consorts to
 be crowned, and that the same is at present practised, and hath
 frequently been in former times by those emperors who professed the
 holy faith of the Greek church; to wit, by the emperor Basilides, who
 caused his wife Zenobia to be crowned; the emperor Justinian, his wife
 Lucipina; the emperor Heraclius, his wife Martina: the emperor Leo, the
 philosopher, his wife Mary; and many others, who have in like manner
 placed the imperial crown on the head of their consorts, and whom it
 would be too tedious here to enumerate.
 
 It is also well known to every one how much we have exposed our person,
 and faced the greatest dangers, for the good of our country during the
 one and twenty years' course of the late war, which we have by the
 assistance of God terminated in so honourable and advantageous a manner,
 that Russia hath never beheld such a peace, nor ever acquired so great
 glory as in the late war. Now the empress Catherine, our dearly beloved
 wife, having greatly comforted and assisted us during the said war, and
 also in several other our expeditions, wherein she voluntarily and
 cheerfully accompanied us, assisting us with her counsel and advice in
 every exigence, notwithstanding the weakness of her sex, particularly in
 the battle against the Turks, on the banks of the river Pruth, wherein
 our army was reduced to twenty thousand men, while that of the Turks
 amounted to two hundred and seventy thousand, and on which desperate
 occasion she signalized herself in a particular manner, by a courage and
 presence of mind superior to her sex, which is well known to all our
 army, and to the whole Russian empire: therefore, for these reasons, and
 in virtue of the power which God has given us, we have resolved to
 honour our said consort Catherine with the imperial crown, as a reward
 for her painful services; and we propose, God willing, that this
 ceremony shall be performed the ensuing winter at Moscow. And we do
 hereby give notice of this our resolution to all who are faithful
 subjects, in favour of whom our imperial affection is unalterable.
 
 
                                 THE END.

 the press; for the lady here spoken of was the daughter of Matthias

 latter part of the third chapter, where he says, that this princess,
 perceiving that her brother Theodore was near his end, declined retiring
 to a convent, as was the usual custom of the princesses of the imperial
 family.
 
 [29] We find, in the memoirs of count Strahlemberg, a Swedish officer,
 who was taken prisoner at the battle of Pultowa, and continued many
 years at the court of czar Peter, the following account of the true
 cause of this extraordinary kind of hydrophobia. When Peter was about
 five years of age, his mother took him with her in a coach for an
 airing, and having to pass a dam, where there was a great fall of water
 the child, who was then sleeping in his nurse's lap, was so terrified by
 the rushing of the water (the noise of which waked him suddenly out of
 his sleep), that he was seized with a violent fever, and, after his
 recovery, he retained such a dread of that element, that he could not
 bear the sight even of any standing water, much less to hear a running
 stream.

 withstand the attacks of the French, who breathed nothing less than the
 utter subversion of their state.

 [39] The present reigning empress Catharine seems even to exceed her
 aunt in lenity, which together with the superior qualifications of this
 princess, affords her people the most happy presage of a glorious reign;
 and it is not without reason, that the most sensible amongst them
 flatter themselves with the hope, that under this august princess, the
 Russian empire will arrive at its highest pinnacle of glory.

 [41] It is in consequence of this glorious and equitable distinction,
 that at this day we find nobility gives no precedence in the court of
 Russia; nor can the son of a prince appear there in any other rank, than
 that which his situation in the army gives him; while a private citizen,
 who by his merit has raised himself above his condition, receives all
 the honours due to his post; or more properly speaking, to the merit
 which obtained him that post. A reputation of this kind would, methinks,
 be attended with great advantages, both in England and France, as it
 would be a means to raise in the youth of all ranks, a virtuous and
 noble emulation.

 [50] A most extraordinary instance of the obstinate attachment of the
 Russians to their old customs, happened in the time of the czar
 Bassilowitz, and undoubtedly influenced him not a little in the severity
 with which he treated his people. The king of Poland, Stephen Battori,
 having recovered Livonia, went himself into that province to establish a
 new form of government. According to the constant custom there, when any
 peasant, all of whom were treated as slaves, had committed a fault, he
 was whipped with a rod till the blood came. The king was willing to
 commute this barbarous punishment for one that was more moderate; but
 the peasants, insensible of the favour designed them, threw themselves
 at his feet, and intreated him not to make any alterations in their
 ancient customs, because they had experienced, that all innovations, far
 from procuring them the least redress, had always made their burthens
 sit the heavier on them.
 
 [51] Memoirs of captain Perry, the engineer, employed by Peter the
 Great, in Russia, and MSS. of Le Fort.
 
 [52] Captain Perry, in p. 184 of his memoirs, says, that these
 executions being performed in the depth of winter, their bodies were
 immediately frozen; those who were beheaded, were ordered to be left in
 the same posture as when executed, in ranks upon the ground, with their
 heads lying by them: and those who were hanged round the three walls of
 the city, were left hanging the whole winter, to the view of the people,
 till the warm weather began to come on in the spring, when they were
 taken down and buried together in a pit, to prevent infection. This
 author adds, that there were other gibbets placed on all the public
 roads leading to Moscow, where others of these rebels were hanged.

 [56] Norberg, chaplain and confessor to Charles XII. says, in his
 history, 'That he had the insolence to complain of oppressions, and that
 he was condemned to lose his honour and life.' This is speaking like the
 high-priest of despotism. He should have observed, that no one can
 deprive a citizen of his honour for doing his duty.

 [60] The chaplain Norberg, pretends, that, immediately after the battle
 of Narva, the Grand Seignior wrote a letter of congratulation to the
 king of Sweden, in these terms. 'The sultan Basha, by the grace of God,
 to Charles XII. &c.' The letter was dated from the aera of the creation
 of the world.

 [62] This chapter and the following, are taken entirely from the journal

 [63] We must beg leave to remark in this place, that a king of England
 has the power of doing good in virtue of his own authority, and may do
 evil if so disposed, by having a majority in a corrupt parliament;
 whereas, a king of Poland can neither do good nor evil, not having it in
 his power to dispose even of a pair of colours.
 
 [64] This seems a mistake; our author probably meant to say Kercholme,
 because Wibourg is not on the lake Ladoga, but on the gulf of Finland.

 Petersburg, carefully compared with other memoirs.
 
 [70] Menzikoff's parents were vassals of the monastery of Cosmopoly: at
 the age of thirteen, he went to Moscow, and was taken into the service
 of a pastry-cook. His employment was singing ballads, and crying puffs
 and cakes about the streets. One day, as he was following this
 occupation, the czar happening to hear him, and to be diverted with one
 of his songs, sent for him, and asked him if he would sell his pies and
 his basket? The boy answered, that his business was to sell his pies,
 but he must ask his master's leave to sell his basket; yet as every
 thing belonged to his prince, his majesty had only to lay his commands
 upon him. The czar was so pleased with this answer, that he immediately
 ordered him to court, where he gave him at first a mean employment; but
 being every day more pleased with his wit, he thought fit to place him
 about his person, and to make him groom of his bed-chamber, from whence
 he gradually raised him to the highest preferments. He was tall and well
 shaped. At his first coming into the czar's service, he inlisted in Le
 Fort's company, and acquired, under that general's instruction, such a
 degree of knowledge and skill, as enabled him to command armies, and to
 become one of the bravest and most successful generals in Russia.
 
 [71] M. de Voltaire calls this city Wibourg, in this and some other
 places of his history. The French are not always very attentive to the
 right names of places, but here it is of some consequence. Wibourg is
 the capital of Jutland in Denmark. Wiburn, the city here meant, is the
 capital of Carelia in Russian Finland.
 
 [72] The czar's manifesto in the Ukraine, 1709.
 
 [73] The impartiality of an historian obliges us in this place to
 advertise our readers, that it was not the fault of Augustus, that
 Patkul was delivered up to the king of Sweden; Augustus having privately
 sent orders to the commandant of the fort of Konigstein, where Patkul
 was then confined, to suffer his prisoner to make his escape in time.
 But the avarice of this officer proved fatal to the life of the unhappy
 captive, and to the character of his own prince; for while he was
 endeavouring to make the best bargain he could for himself, the time
 slipped inconceivably away; and while they were yet debating upon the
 price of the proposed releasement, the guards sent by Charles came and
 demanded Patkul in the name of their sovereign. The commandant was
 forced to obey, and the unhappy victim was delivered up, contrary to the
 intentions of Augustus.
 
 [74] What would those Swedes say, were they living, to see the pitiful
 figure their descendants have made in this war.

 [76] This is acknowledged by Norberg himself, vol. ii. p. 263.

 [78] The Memoirs of Peter the Great, by the pretended boyard Iwan
 Nestesuranoy, printed at Amsterdam, in 1730, say, that the king of
 Sweden, before he passed the Boristhenes, sent a general officer with
 proposals of peace to the czar. The four volumes of these Memoirs are
 either a collection of untruths and absurdities, or compilations from
 common newspapers.
 
 [79] This fact is likewise found in a letter, printed before the
 Anecdotes of Russia, p. 23.
 
 [80] La Motraye, in the relation of his travels, quotes a letter from
 Charles XII. to the grand vizier; but this letter is false, as are most
 of the relations of that mercenary writer; and Norberg himself
 acknowledges that the king of Sweden never could be prevailed on to
 write to the grand vizier.
 
 [81] The czar, says the preface to lord Whitworth's account of Russia,
 who had been absolute enough to civilize savages, had no idea, could
 conceive none, of the privileges of a nation civilized in the only
 rational manner by laws and liberties. He demanded immediate and severe
 punishment of the offenders: he demanded it of a princess, whom he
 thought interested, to assert the sacredness of the persons of monarchs,
 even in their representatives; and he demanded it with threats of
 wreaking his vengeance on all English merchants and subjects established
 in his dominions. In this light the menaces were formidable; otherwise,
 happily, the rights of the whole people were more sacred here than the
 persons of foreign ministers. The czar's memorials urged the queen with
 the satisfaction which she herself had extorted, when only the boat and
 servants of the earl of Manchester had been insulted at Venice. That
 state had broken through the fundamental laws, to content the queen of
 Great Britain. How noble a picture of government, when a monarch, that
 can force another nation to infringe its constitution, dare not violate
 his own? One may imagine with what difficulty our secretaries of state
 must have laboured through all the ambages of phrase in English, French,
 German, and Russ, to explain to Muscovite ears and Muscovite
 understandings, the meaning of indictments, pleadings, precedents,
 juries, and verdicts; and how impatiently Peter must have listened to
 promises of a hearing next term? With what astonishment must he have
 beheld a great queen, engaging to endeavour to prevail on her parliament
 to pass an act to prevent any such outrage for the future? What honour
 does it not reflect on the memory of that princess to own to an
 arbitrary emperor, that even to appease him she dare not put the meanest
 of her subjects to death uncondemned by law!--There are, says she, in
 one of her dispatches to him, insuperable difficulties, with respect to
 the ancient and fundamental laws of the government of our people; which
 we fear do not permit so severe and rigorous a sentence to be given, as
 your imperial majesty at first seemed to expect in this case; and we
 persuade ourself, that your imperial majesty, who are a prince famous
 for clemency and exact justice, will not require us, who are the
 guardian and protectress of the laws, to inflict a punishment upon our
 subjects, which the law does not impower us to do. Words so venerable
 and heroic, that this broil ought to become history, and be exempted
 from the oblivion due to the silly squabbles of ambassadors and their
 privileges. If Anne deserved praise for her conduct on this occasion, it
 reflects still greater glory on Peter, that this ferocious man should
 listen to these details, and had moderation and justice enough to be
 persuaded by the reason of them.
 
 [82] Afterwards created lord Whitworth, by king George I.
 
 [83] The account this chaplain gives of the demands of the grand
 seignior is equally false and puerile. He says, that sultan Achmet,
 previous to his declaring war against the czar, sent to that prince a
 paper, containing the conditions on which he was willing to grant him
 peace. These conditions, Norberg tells us, were as follows: 'That Peter
 should renounce his alliance with Augustus, reinstate Stanislaus in the
 possession of the crown of Poland, restore all Livonia to Charles XII.,
 and pay that prince the value in ready money of what he had taken from
 him at the battle of Pultowa; and, lastly, that the czar should demolish
 his newly-built city of Petersburg.' This piece was forged by one
 Brazey, a half-starved pamphleteer, and author of a work entitled,
 Memoirs, Satirical, Historical, and Entertaining. It was from this
 fountain Norberg drew his intelligence; and however he may have been the
 confessor of Charles XII. he certainly does not appear to have been his
 confidant.
 
 [84] The new vizier embraced every opportunity of affronting the czar,
 in the person of his envoy, and particularly in giving the French
 ambassador the preference. It was customary, on the promotion of the
 grand vizier, for all the foreign ministers to request an audience of
 congratulation. Count Tolstoy was the first who demanded that audience;
 but was answered--That the precedence had always been given to the
 ambassador of France: whereupon Tolstoy informed the vizier--That he
 must be deprived of the pleasure of waiting on him at all: which, being
 maliciously represented, as expressing the utmost contempt of his
 person, and the khan of Tartary being at the same time instigated to
 make several heavy complaints against the conduct of the Russians on the
 frontiers, count Tolstoy was immediately committed to the castle of the
 Seven Towers.
 
 [85] It is very strange that so many writers always confound Walachia
 and Moldavia together.
 
 [86] This duke of Holstein, at the time he married the daughter of Peter
 I. was a prince of very inconsiderable power, though of one of the most
 ancient houses in Germany. His ancestors had been stripped of great part
 of their dominions by the kings of Denmark; so that, at the time of this
 marriage, he found himself greatly circumscribed in point of
 possessions; but, from this epoch of his alliance with the czar of
 Muscovy, we may date the rise of the ducal branch of Holstein, which now
 fills the thrones of Russia and Sweden, and is likewise in possession of
 the bishopric of Lubec, which, in all probability, will fall to this
 house, notwithstanding the late election, which at present is the
 subject of litigation, the issue of which will, to all appearance,
 terminate in favour of the prince, son to the present bishop, through
 the protection of the courts of Vienna and Petersburg. The empress
 Catherine, who now sits on the throne of Russia is herself descended
 from this august house, by the side of her mother, who was sister to the
 king of Sweden, to the prince-bishop of Lubec, and to the famous prince
 George of Holstein, whose achievements made so much noise during the
 war. This princess, whose name was Elizabeth, married the reigning
 prince of Anbak Zerbst, whose house was indisputably the most ancient;
 and, in former times, the most powerful in all Germany, since they can
 trace their pedigree from the dukes of Ascania, who were formerly
 masters of the two electorates of Saxony and Brandenburg, as appears by
 their armorial bearings, which are, quarterly, the arms of Saxony and
 Brandenburg. Of this branch of Zerbst there is remaining only the
 present reigning prince, brother to the empress Catherine, who, in case
 he should die without issue, will succeed to the principality of Yevern,
 in East Friesland; from all which it appears already, that the family of
 Holstein is at present the most powerful in Europe, as being in
 possession of three crowns in the North.--[Since the above was written
 important changes have taken place.]
 
 [87] This same count Poniatowsky, who was at that time in the service of
 Charles XII., died afterwards castellan of Cracovia, and first senator
 of the republic of Poland, after having enjoyed all the dignities to
 which a nobleman of that country can attain. His connexions with Charles
 XII. during that prince's retirement at Bender, first made him taken
 notice of; and, it is to be wished, for the honour of his memory, that
 he had waited till the conclusion of a peace between Sweden and Poland,
 to be reconciled to king Augustus; but following the dictates of
 ambition, rather than those of strict honour, he sacrificed the
 interests of both Charles and Stanislaus, to the care of his own
 fortune; and, while he appeared the most zealous in their cause, he
 secretly did them all the ill services he could at the Ottoman Porte: to
 this double dealing he owed the immense fortune of which he was
 afterwards possessed. He married the princess Czartoriski, daughter of
 the castellan of Vilna, a lady, for her heroic spirit, worthy to have
 been born in the times of ancient Rome: when her eldest son, the present
 grand chamberlain of the crown, had that famous dispute with Count
 Tarlo, palatine of Lublin; a dispute which made so much noise in all the
 public papers in the year 1742, this lady, after having made him shoot
 at a mark every day, for three weeks, in order to be expert at firing,
 said to him, as he was mounting his horse, to go to meet his
 adversary--'Go, my son; but, if you do not acquit yourself with honour
 in this affair, never appear before me again.' This anecdote may serve
 as a specimen of the character of our heroine. The family of Czartoriski
 is descended from the ancient Jagellins, who were, for several ages, in
 lineal possession of the crown of Poland; and is, at this day, extremely
 rich and powerful, by the alliances it has contracted, but they have
 never been able to acquire popularity; and so long as count Tarlo (who
 was killed in a duel with the young count Poniatowsky) lived, had no
 influence in the dictines, or lesser assembly of the states, because
 Tarlo, who was the idol of the nobles, and a sworn enemy to the
 Czartoriski family, carried every thing before him, and nothing was done
 but according to his pleasure.

 to perpetuate the memory of her love in his distressed condition on the

 order are, a broad white riband, and wore over the right shoulder, with

 [97] The conspiracy carried on in France by cardinal Alberoni, was
 discovered in a very singular manner. The Spanish ambassador's
 secretary, who used frequently to go to the house of one La Follon, a
 famous procuress of Paris, to amuse himself for an hour or two after the
 fatigues of business, had appointed a young nymph, whom he was fond of,
 to meet him there at nine o'clock in the evening, but did not come to
 her till near two o'clock in the morning. The lady, as may be supposed,
 reproached him with the little regard he paid to her charms, or his own
 promise; but he excused himself, by saying, that he had been obliged to
 stay to finish a long dispatch in ciphers, which was to be sent away
 that very night by a courier to Spain: so saying, he undressed and threw
 himself into bed, where he quietly fell asleep. In pulling off his
 clothes, he had, by accident, dropped a paper out of his pocket, which,
 by its bulk, raised in the nymph that curiosity so natural to her sex.
 She picked it up, and read it partly over, when the nature of its
 contents made her resolve to communicate them to La Follon: accordingly,
 she framed some excuse for leaving the room, and immediately went to the
 apartment of the old lady, and opened her budget. La Follon, who was a
 woman of superior understanding to most in her sphere, immediately saw
 the whole consequence of the affair; and, after having recommended to
 the girl, to amuse her gallant as long as possible, she immediately went
 to waken the regent, to whom she had access at all hours, for matters of
 a very different nature to the present. This prince, whose presence of
 mind was equal to every exigency, immediately dispatched different
 couriers to the frontiers; in consequence of which, the Spanish
 ambassador's messenger was stopped at Bayonne, and his dispatches taken
 from him; upon deciphering of which, they were found exactly to agree
 with the original delivered to the regent by La Follon: upon this the
 prince of Cellamar, the Spanish ambassador was put under an arrest, and
 all his papers seized; after which he was sent under a strong guard to
 the frontiers, where they left him to make the best of his way to his
 own country. Thus an event, which would have brought the kingdom of
 France to the verge of destruction, was frustrated by a votary of Venus,
 and a priestess of the temple of pleasure.
 
 [98] As these letters and answers afford the most striking evidence of
 the czar's prudence, and the prince's insincerity, and will convey to
 the reader a clear idea of the grounds and motives of this extraordinary
 transaction, we have inserted the following translation of them. The
 first letter from the czar to his son, is dated the 27th of October,
 1715, and displays a noble spirit of religion, with the most ardent
 desire of leaving a successor who should perpetuate his name and glory
 to future ages.
 
 'Son,' says the czar to him, 'you cannot be ignorant of what is known to
 all the world, that our people groaned under the oppression of the
 Swedes, before the beginning of this present war. By the usurped
 possession of many of our maritime ports, so necessary to our state,
 they cut us off from all commerce with the rest of mankind; and we saw,
 with deep regret, that they had even cast a mist over the eyes of
 persons of the greatest discernment, who tamely brooked their slavery,
 and made no complaints to us. You know how much it cost us at the
 beginning of this war, to make ourselves thoroughly experienced, and
 to stand our ground in spite of all the advantages which our
 irreconcileable enemies gained over us. The Almighty alone has conducted
 us by his hand, and conducts us still. We submitted to that probationary
 state with resignation to the will of God, not doubting but it was he
 who made us pass through it: he has accepted our submission; and the
 same enemy, before whom we were wont to tremble, now trembles before us.
 These are effects, which, under God's assistance, we owe to our labour,
 and those of our faithful and affectionate sons, and Russian subjects.
 But while I survey the successes with which God has blessed our arms, if
 I turn my eyes on the posterity that is to succeed me, my soul is
 pierced with anguish; and I have no enjoyment of my present happiness,
 when I carry my views into futurity. All my felicity vanishes away like
 a dream, since you, my son, reject all means of rendering yourself
 capable of governing well after me. Your incapacity is voluntary; for
 you cannot excuse yourself from want of genius: it is inclination alone
 you want. Far less can you plead the want of bodily strength, as if God
 had not furnished you sufficiently in that respect: for though your
 constitution be none the strongest, it cannot be reckoned weak. Yet you
 will not so much as hear of warlike exercises; though it is by those
 means we are risen from that obscurity in which we were buried, and have
 made ourselves known to the nations about us, whose esteem we now enjoy.
 I am far from desiring you to cherish in yourself a disposition to make
 war for its own sake, and without just reasons: all I demand of you is,
 that you would apply yourself to learn the military art; because,
 without understanding the rules of war, it is impossible to be qualified
 for government. I might set before your eyes many examples of what I
 propose to you; but shall only mention the Greeks, with whom we are
 united by the same profession of faith. Whence came the declension of
 their empire, but from the neglect of arms? Sloth and inaction have
 subjected them to tyrants, and that slavery under which they have
 groaned. You are much mistaken if you imagine it is enough for a prince
 that he have good generals to act under his orders: no, my son, it is
 upon the chief himself that the eyes of the world are fixed; they study
 his inclinations, and easily slide into the imitation of his manners. My
 brother, during his reign, loved magnificence in dress, and splendid
 equipages, and horses richly caparisoned; the taste of this country was
 not much formed that way; but the pleasures of the prince soon became
 those of the subjects, who are readily led to imitate him both in the
 objects of his love and disgust. If people are so easily disengaged from
 things that are only for pleasure, will they not be still more prone to
 forget, and in process of time wholly to lay aside the use of arms, the
 exercise of which grows the more irksome the less they are habituated to
 them? You have no inclination to learn the profession of war; you do not
 apply yourself to it; and consequently will never know it. How then will
 you be able to command others, and to judge of the rewards which those
 subjects deserve who do their duty, or of the punishment due to such as
 fall short of obedience? You must judge only by other people's eyes; and
 will be considered as a young bird, which reaching out its beak, is as
 ready to receive poison as proper nourishment. You say, the infirm state
 of your health makes you unfit to bear the fatigues of war; but that is
 a frivolous excuse. I desire you not to undergo the fatigues of that
 profession, though it is there that all great captains are begun; but I
 wish you had an inclination to the military art; and reason may give it
 you, if you have it not from nature. Had you once this inclination, it
 would occupy your thoughts at all times, even in your hours of sickness.
 Ask those who remember my brother's reign: his state of health was much
 more infirm than your's; he could not manage a horse of never so little
 mettle, nor hardly mount him: yet he loved horses, and perhaps there
 never will be in the country finer stables than his. Hence you see, that
 success does not always depend upon personal labour, but upon the
 inclination. If you think that there are princes, whose affairs fail not
 to succeed, though they go not to war in person, you are in the right;
 but if they go not to the field of battle, they have, however, an
 inclination to go, and are acquainted with the military art. For
 instance, the late king of France did not always take the field himself;
 but we know to what a degree he was a lover of war, and how many
 glorious exploits he performed therein; which made his campaigns be
 called the theatre and school of the world. The bent of that prince's
 mind was not turned to military affairs only, he had also a taste for
 the polite arts, for manufactures, and other institutions, which have
 made his kingdom more flourishing than any other. After all these
 remonstrances which I have laid before you, I return to my first
 subject, which immediately concerns yourself. I am a man, and
 consequently must die: to whom shall I leave the care of finishing what,
 by God's grace, I have begun, and of preserving what I have in part
 recovered? To a son who, like that slothful servant in the gospel,
 buries his talent in the earth, and neglects to improve what God has
 committed to his trust? How often have I reproached you for your
 sullenness and indocility? I have been obliged to chastise you on that
 account. For these several years past I have hardly spoke to you,
 because I almost despair of bringing you back to the right way;
 discouraged and disheartened by the fruitlessness of all my endeavours.
 You loiter on in supine indolence; abandoning yourself to shameful
 pleasures, without extending your foresight to the dangerous
 consequences which such a conduct must produce both to yourself and the
 whole state: you confine yourself to the government of your own house,
 and in that station you acquit yourself very ill; St. Paul has told us,
 'he that knows not how to govern his own house, how shall he be able to
 rule the church of God?' In like manner I say to you, since you know not
 how to manage your domestic affairs, how can you be able to govern a
 kingdom? I am determined, at last, to signify to you my final purpose;
 being willing, however, to defer the execution of it for a short time,
 to see if you will reform: if not, know that I am resolved to deprive
 you of the succession, as I would lop off a useless branch. Do not
 imagine, that because I have no other child but you,[99] I mean by this
 only to intimidate you: I will most certainly execute my resolution; and
 God requires it of me: for, since I spare not my own life for the sake
 of my country, and the welfare of my people, why should I allow an
 effeminate prince to ascend the throne after me, who would sacrifice the
 interest of the subject to his pleasures? and should he be obliged to
 expose his life in their behalf, would leave them to perish, rather than
 redress their grievances. I will call in a mere stranger to the crown,
 if he be but worthy of that honour, sooner than my own son, if he is
 unworthy.
 
                                                                 'PETER.'
 
 To this letter the czarowitz replied: 'Most gracious sovereign and
 father, I have read the letter which your majesty sent me of the 27th of
 October, 1715, after the interment of my wife; and all the answer I can
 make to it is, that if your majesty is determined to deprive me of the
 succession to the crown of Russia, on account of my inability, your will
 be done. I even request it of you very earnestly; because I judge not
 myself fit for government. My memory is greatly impaired; and without
 memory there is no managing affairs. The powers both of my body and mind
 are much weakened by the diseases to which I have been incident, and I
 am thereby incapacitated for the rule of so great a people. Such a
 charge requires a man far more vigorous than I am. For these reasons I
 am not ambitious to succeed you (whom God preserve through a length of
 years) in the crown of Russia, even though I had no brother, as I have
 one at present, whom God long preserve. As little will I for the future
 set up any claim to the succession: to the truth of which I solemnly
 swear, taking God to be my witness; and in testimony thereof I write and
 sign these presents. I put my children into your hands: and for myself I
 ask no more of you than a bare maintenance during my life, leaving the
 whole to your pleasure.
 
                                            'Your humble servant and son,
 
                                                                'ALEXIS.'
 
 Peter soon penetrated through the disguise his son had assumed, and
 therefore wrote him the above letter, dated January 19, 1716, and which
 he called his 'Last Admonition.'
 
 [99] This letter was written about eight days before the birth of Peter
 Patrowitz, the czar's second son.
 
 [100] This letter was couched in the following terms:--'Most gracious
 sovereign and father, yesterday morning I received your letter, of the
 19th of this month: my indisposition hinders me from writing to you at
 large, but I am willing to embrace the monastic state, and I beg your
 gracious consent thereto.
 
                                         'Your servant, and unworthy son,
 
                                                                'ALEXIS.'
 
 [101] The prince's renunciation was couched in the following terms:--'I,
 the undernamed, declare upon the holy gospel, that on account of the
 crimes I have committed against his czarish majesty, my father and
 sovereign, as set forth in his manifesto, I am, through my own fault,
 excluded from the throne of Russia. Therefore I confess and acknowledge
 that exclusion to be just, as having merited it by my own fault and
 unworthiness; and I hereby oblige myself, and swear in the presence of
 Almighty God, in unity of nature, and trinity of persons, as my supreme
 Judge, to submit in all things to my father's will, never to set up a
 claim or pretension to the succession, or accept of it under any pretext
 whatever, acknowledging my brother Peter Petrowitz as lawful successor
 to the crown. In testimony whereof, I kiss the holy cross, and sign
 these presents with my own hand.
 
                                                                'ALEXIS.'
 
 [102] As this extraordinary piece cannot fail of being interesting to
 most part of our readers, we have ventured to subjoin the whole of it in
 a note, our author having only given some few extracts.
 
 
 _The Czar's Declaration._
 
 Peter I. by the grace of God, czar, emperor of Russia, &c. to all our
 faithful subjects, ecclesiastical, military, and civil, of all the
 states of the Russian nation. It is notorious, and well known to the
 greatest part of our faithful subjects, and chiefly to those who live in
 the places of our residence, or who are in our service, with how much
 care and application we have caused our eldest son Alexis to be brought
 up and educated; having given him for that purpose, from his infancy,
 tutors to teach him the Russian tongue, and foreign languages, and to
 instruct him in all arts and sciences, in order not only to bring him up
 in our Christian orthodox faith of the Greek profession, but also in the
 knowledge of political and military affairs, and likewise in the
 constitution of foreign countries, their customs and languages; through
 the reading of history, and other books, in all manner of sciences,
 becoming a prince of his high rank, he might acquire the qualifications
 worthy of a successor to our throne of Great Russia. Nevertheless, we
 have seen with grief, that all attention and care, for the education and
 instruction of our son, proved ineffectual and useless, seeing he always
 swerved from his filial obedience, shewing no application for what was
 becoming a worthy successor, and slighting the precepts of the masters
 we had appointed for him; but, on the contrary, frequenting disorderly
 persons, from whom he could learn nothing good, or that would be
 advantageous and useful to him. We have not neglected often to endeavour
 to reclaim, and bring him back to his duty, sometimes by caresses and
 gentle means, sometimes by reprimands, sometimes by paternal
 corrections. We have more than once taken him with us into our army and
 the field, that he might be instructed in the art of war, as one of the
 chief sciences for the defence of his country; guarding him, at the same
 time, from all hazard of the succession, though we exposed ourself to
 manifest perils and dangers. We have at other times left him at Moscow,
 putting into his hands a sort of regency in the empire, in order to form
 him in the art of government, and that he might learn how to reign after
 us. We have likewise sent him into foreign countries, in hopes and
 expectation, that seeing, in his travels, governments so well regulated,
 this would excite in him some emulation and an inclination to apply
 himself to do well. But all our care has been fruitless, and like the
 seed of the doctrine fallen upon a rock; for he has not only refused to
 follow that which is good, but even is come to hate it, without shewing
 any inclination, or disposition, either for military or political
 affairs; hourly and continually conversing with base and disorderly
 persons, whose morals are rude and abominable. As we were resolved to
 endeavour, by all imaginable means, to reclaim him from that disorderly
 course, and to inspire him with an inclination to converse with persons
 of virtue and honour; we exhorted him to choose a consort among the
 chief foreign houses, as is usual in other countries, and hath been
 practised by our ancestors, the czars of Russia, who have contracted
 alliances by marriages with other sovereign houses, and we have left him
 at liberty to make a choice. He declared his inclination for the
 princess, grand-daughter of the duke of Wolfenbuttle, then reigning,
 sister-in-law to his imperial majesty the emperor of the Romans, now
 reigning, and cousin to the king of Great Britain; and having desired us
 to procure him that alliance, and permit him to marry that princess, we
 readily consented thereunto, without any regard to the great expense
 which was necessarily occasioned by that marriage: but, after its
 consummation, we found ourselves disappointed of the hopes we had, that
 the change in the condition of our son would produce good fruits, and
 change his bad inclinations; for, notwithstanding his spouse was, as far
 as we have been able to observe, a wise, sprightly princess, and of a
 virtuous conduct, and that he himself had chosen her, he nevertheless
 lived with her in the greatest disunion, while he redoubled his
 affection for lewd people, bringing thereby a disgrace upon our house in
 the eyes of foreign powers to whom that princess was related, which drew
 upon us many complaints and reproaches. Our frequent advices and
 exhortations to him, to reform his conduct, proved ineffectual, and he
 at last violated the conjugal faith, and gave his affection to a
 prostitute of the most servile and low condition, living publicly in
 that crime with her, to the great contempt of his lawful spouse, who
 soon after died; and it was believed that her grief, occasioned by the
 disorderly life of her husband, hastened the end of her days. When we
 saw his resolution to persevere in his vicious courses, we declared to
 him, at the funeral of his consort, that if he did not for the future
 conform to our will, and apply himself to things becoming a prince,
 presumptive heir to so great an empire, we would deprive him of the
 succession, without any regard to his being our only son (our second son
 was not then born) and that he ought not to rely upon his being such,
 because we would rather choose for our successor a stranger worthy
 thereof, than an unworthy son; that we would not leave our empire to
 such a successor, who would ruin and destroy what we have, by God's
 assistance, established, and tarnish the glory and honour of the Russian
 nation, for the acquiring of which we had sacrificed our ease and our
 health, and willingly exposed our life on several occasions; besides,
 that the fear of God's judgment would not permit us to leave the
 government of such vast territories in the hands of one whose
 insufficiency and unworthiness we were not ignorant of. In short, we
 exhorted him in the most pressing terms we could make use of, to behave
 himself with discretion, and gave him time to repent and return to his
 duty. His answer to these remonstrances was, that he acknowledged
 himself guilty in all these points; but alleged the weakness of his
 parts and genius, which did not permit him to apply himself to the
 sciences, and other functions recommended to him: he owned himself
 incapable of our succession, and desired us to discharge him from the
 same. Nevertheless, we continued to exhort him with a paternal
 affection, and joining menaces to our exhortations; we forgot nothing to
 bring him back to the right way. The operations of the war having
 obliged us to repair to Denmark, we left him at Petersburg, to give him
 time to return to his duty, and amend his ways; and, afterwards, upon
 the repeated advices we received of the continuance of his disorderly
 life, we sent him orders to come to us at Copenhagen, to make the
 campaign, that he might thereby the better form himself. But, forgetting
 the fear and commandments of God, who enjoins obedience even to private
 parents, and much more to those who are at the same time sovereigns, our
 paternal cares had no other return than unheard-of ingratitude; for,
 instead of coming to us as we ordered, he withdrew, with large sums of
 money, and his infamous concubine, with whom he continued to live in a
 criminal course, and put himself under the protection of the emperor,
 raising against us, his father and his lord, numberless calumnies and
 false reports, as if we did persecute him, and intended, without cause,
 to deprive him of the succession; alleging, moreover, that even his life
 was not safe if he continued with us, and desired the emperor not only
 to give him refuge in his dominions, but also to protect him against us
 by force of arms. Every one may judge, what shame and dishonour this
 conduct of our son hath drawn upon us and our empire, in the face of the
 whole world; the like instance is hardly to be found in history. The
 emperor, though informed of his excesses, and how he had lived with his
 consort, sister-in-law to his imperial majesty, thought fit, however,
 upon these pressing instances, to appoint him a place where he might
 reside; and he desired farther, that he might be so private there, that
 we might not come to the knowledge of it. Meanwhile his long stay having
 made us fear, out of a tender and fatherly affection for him, that some
 misfortune had befallen him, we sent persons several ways to get
 intelligence of him, and, after a great deal of trouble, we were at last
 informed by the captain of our guard, Alexander Romanzoff, that he was
 privately kept in an imperial fortress at Tyrol; whereupon we wrote a
 letter, with our own hand, to the emperor, to desire that he might be
 sent back to us: but, notwithstanding the emperor acquainted him with
 our demands, and exhorted him to return to us, and submit to our will,
 as being his father and lord; yet he alleged, with a great many
 calumnies against us, that he ought not to be delivered into our hands,
 as if we had been his enemy, and a tyrant, from whom he had nothing to
 expect but death. In short, he persuaded his imperial majesty, instead
 of sending him back at that time to us, to remove him to some remote
 place in his dominions, namely, Naples in Italy, and keep him there
 secretly in the castle, under a borrowed name. Nevertheless, we having
 notice of the place where he was, did thereupon dispatch to the emperor
 our privy-counsellor, Peter Tolstoy, and the captain of our guard,
 aforesaid, with a most pressing letter, representing how unjust it would
 be to detain our son, contrary to all laws, divine and human, according
 to which private parents, and with much more reason those who are
 besides invested with a sovereign authority as we are, have an unlimited
 power over their children, independently of any other judge; and we set
 forth on one side, the just and affectionate manner with which we had
 always used our son, and, on the other, his disobedience; representing,
 in the conclusion, the ill consequences and animosities which the
 refusal of delivering up our son to us might occasion, because we would
 not leave this affair in that condition. We, at the same time, ordered
 those we sent with that letter, to make verbal remonstrances even in
 more pressing terms, and to declare that we should be obliged to
 revenge, by all possible methods, such detaining our son. We wrote
 likewise a letter to him with our own hand, to represent to him the
 horror and impiety of his conduct, and the enormity of the crime he had
 committed against us his father, and how God threatened in his laws to
 punish disobedient children with eternal death: we threatened him, as a
 father, with our curses, and, as his lord, to declare him a traitor to
 his country, unless he returned, and obeyed our commands; and gave him
 assurance, that if he did as we desired, and returned, we would pardon
 his crime. Our envoys, after many solicitations, and the above
 representation, made by us in writing, at last obtained leave of the
 emperor to go and speak to our son, in order to dispose him to return
 home. The imperial minister gave them at the same time to understand,
 that our son had informed the emperor that we persecuted him, and that
 his life was not safe with us, whereby he moved the emperor's
 compassion, and induced him to take him into his protection; but that
 the emperor, taking now into his consideration our true and solid
 representations, promised to use his utmost endeavour to dispose him to
 return to us; and would, moreover, declare to him, that he could not in
 justice and equity refuse to deliver him to his father, or have any
 difference with us on that account. Our envoys, upon their arrival at
 Naples, having desired to deliver to him our letter, written with our
 hand, sent us word, that he did refuse to admit them; but that the
 emperor's viceroy had found means, by inviting him to his house, to
 present them to him afterwards, much against his will. He did then,
 indeed, receive our letter, containing our paternal exhortation, and
 threatening our curse, but without shewing the least inclination to
 return; alleging still a great many falsities and calumnies against us,
 as if, by reason of several dangers he had to apprehend from us, he
 could not, nor would not return; and boasting, that the emperor had not
 only promised to defend and protect him against us, but even to set him
 upon the throne of Russia against our will, by force of arms. Our envoys
 perceiving this evil disposition, tried all imaginable ways to prevail
 with him to return, they intreated him, they expatiated by turns upon
 the graciousness of our assurances towards him, and upon our threats in
 case of disobedience, and that we would even bring him away by force of
 arms; they declared to him that the emperor would not enter into a war
 with us on his account, and many other such-like representations did
 they make to him. But he paid no regard to all this, nor shewed any
 inclination to return to us, until the imperial viceroy, convinced at
 last of his obstinacy, told him in the emperor's name, that he ought to
 return; for that his imperial majesty could not by any law keep him from
 us, nor, during the present war with Turkey, and also in Italy with
 Spain, embroil himself with us upon his account. When he saw how the
 case stood, fearing he should be delivered up to us, whether he would or
 not, he at length resolved to return home; and declared his mind to our
 envoys, and to the imperial viceroy: he likewise wrote the same thing to
 us, acknowledging himself to be a criminal, and blameworthy. Now
 although our son, by so long a course of criminal disobedience against
 us, his father and lord, for many years, and particularly for the
 dishonour he hath cast upon us in the face of the world, by withdrawing
 himself, and raising calumnies against us, as if we were an unnatural
 father, and for opposing his sovereign, hath deserved to be punished
 with death; yet our paternal affection inclines us to have mercy upon
 him, and we therefore pardon his crimes, and exempt him from all
 punishment for the same. But considering his unworthiness, we cannot in
 conscience, leave him after us the succession to the throne of Russia;
 foreseeing that, by his vicious courses, he would entirely destroy the
 glory of our nation and the safety of our dominions, which, through
 God's assistance, we have acquired and established by incessant
 application; for it is notorious and known to every one, how much it
 hath cost us, and with what efforts we have not only recovered the
 provinces which the enemy had usurped from our empire, but also
 conquered several considerable towns and countries, and with what care
 we have caused our people to be instructed in all sorts of civil and
 military sciences, to the glory and advantage of the nation and empire.
 Now, as we should pity our states and faithful subjects, if, by such a
 successor, we should throw them back into a much worse condition than
 ever they were yet; so, by the paternal authority, in virtue of which,
 by the laws of our empire, any of our subjects may disinherit a son, and
 give his succession to such other of his sons, as he pleases; and, in
 quality of sovereign prince, in consideration of the safety of our
 dominions, we do deprive our said son Alexis, for his crimes and
 unworthiness, of the succession after us to the throne of Russia, even
 though there should not remain one single person of our family after us.
 And we do constitute and declare successor to the said throne after us,
 our second son Peter, though yet very young, having no successor that is
 older. We lay upon our said son Alexis our paternal curse, if ever at
 any time he pretends to, or reclaims, the said succession; and we desire
 our faithful subjects, whether ecclesiastics or seculars, of all ranks
 and conditions, and the whole Russian nation, in conformity to this
 constitution and our will, to acknowledge and consider our said son
 Peter, appointed by our constitution, to confirm the whole by oath,
 before the holy altar, upon the holy gospel, kissing the cross; and all
 those who shall ever, at any time, oppose this our will, and who, from
 this day forward, shall dare to consider our son Alexis, as successor,
 or to assist him for that purpose, declare them traitors to us and their
 country. And we have ordered that these presents shall be every where
 published and promulgated, to the end that no person may pretend
 ignorance.--Given at Moscow, the third of February, 1718. Signed with
 our hand, and sealed with our seal.
 
                                                                 'PETER.'
 
 [103] This was the son of the empress Catherine, who died April 15,
 1719.
 
 [104] At the same time confirming it by an oath, the form of which was
 as follows: 'I swear before Almighty God, and upon his holy gospel, that
 whereas our most gracious sovereign, the czar Peter Alexiowitz, has
 caused circular letters to be published through his empire, to notify
 that he has thought fit to exclude his son, prince Alexis Petrowitz,
 from the throne of Russia, and to appoint for his successor to the crown
 his second son, the prince royal Peter Petrowitz; I do acknowledge this
 order and regulation made by his majesty in favour of the said prince
 Peter Petrowitz, to be just and lawful, and entirely conform and submit
 myself to the same; promising always to acknowledge the said prince
 royal Peter Petrowitz for his lawful successor, and to stand by him on
 all occasions, even to the loss of my life, against all such as shall
 presume to oppose the said succession; and that I never will, on any
 pretence whatsoever assist the prince Alexis Petrowitz, nor in any
 manner whatsoever contribute to procure him the succession. And this I
 solemnly promise by my oath on the holy gospel, kissing the holy cross
 thereupon.'
 
 [105] His declaration to the clergy concluded in this manner:--'Though
 this affair does not fall within the verge of the spiritual, but of the
 civil jurisdiction, and we have this day referred it to the imperial
 decision of the secular court, but remembering that passage in the word
 of God, which requires us on such occasions to consult the priests and
 elders of the church, in order to know the will of Heaven, and being
 desirous of receiving all possible instructions in a matter of such
 importance, we desire of you, the archbishops, and the whole
 ecclesiastical state, as teachers of the word of God, not to pronounce
 judgment in this case, but to examine and give us your opinion
 concerning it, according to the sacred oracles, from whom we may be best
 informed what punishment my son deserves, and that you will give it us
 in writing under your hands, that being properly instructed herein, we
 may lay no burthen on our conscience. We therefore repose our confidence
 in you, that, as guardians of the divine laws, as faithful pastors of
 the Christian flock, and as well affected towards your country, you will
 act suitable to your dignity, conjuring you by that dignity, and the
 holiness of your function, to proceed without fear or dissimulation.
 
 [106] Besides the particular passages in holy writ cited on this
 occasion, which were, Levit. xx. 1, 9. Deut. xxxi. Matt. xx. 1. Mark
 vii. 9. Rom. i. 28. Ephes vi. 1. those from the constitutions of the
 empire were as follows: 'If any person, by any ill design, forms any
 attempt against the health of the czar, or does any thing to his
 prejudice, and is found inclined to execute his pernicious designs, let
 him be put to death, after he is convicted thereof.' Stat. 1. 'In like
 manner, if any one, during the reign of his czarian majesty, through a
 desire to reign in the empire of Russia, and put the czar to death,
 shall begin to raise troops with this pernicious view; or if any one
 shall form an alliance with the enemies of his czarian majesty, or hold
 a correspondence with them, or assist them to arrive at the government,
 or raise any other disorder; if any one declare it, and the truth be
 found out upon such declaration, let the traitor suffer death upon
 conviction of the treason.' Stat. 2. From the military laws the
 following citations were made; chap. 3. art. 19. 'If any subject raises
 men, and takes up arms against the czarian majesty; or if any person
 forms a design of taking his majesty prisoner, or killing him; or if he
 offers any violence to him; he and all his abettors and adherents shall
 be quartered, as guilty of treason, and their goods confiscated.' To
 which article the following explanation was added: 'They also shall
 suffer the same punishment, who, though they have not been able to
 execute their crime, shall be convicted of inclination and desire to
 commit it; and likewise, those who shall not have discovered it when it
 came to their knowledge,' chap. 26. art. 37. 'He who forms a design of
 committing any treason, or any other matter of the like nature, shall be
 punished with the same capital punishments as if he had actually
 executed his design.'
 
 [107] M. de Voltaire is mistaken in this point; for, by our laws, no
 peer of the realm can absent himself from the service of the parliament
 during its session, without the liberty of the king or the house.
 
 [108] This is another mistake; for it is death by our law to compass or
 imagine the death of the sovereign.

 [114] Notwithstanding the great rejoicings made on this occasion, Peter
 was noways inattentive to the affairs of state; but held frequent
 councils thereon: and being desirous, as his son Peter Petrowitz was
 dead, to settle the succession on a prince who would follow his maxims,
 and prosecute the great designs which he had begun for civilizing his
 people, he ordered public notice to be given, on the 23d of February, to
 all his subjects inhabiting the city of Moscow, to repair the next day
 to Castle-church; which they having done, printed papers were delivered
 to them all, signifying, 'That it was his imperial majesty's pleasure,
 that every man should swear, and give under his hand, that he would not
 only approve the choice his majesty would make of a successor, but
 acknowledge the person he should appoint as emperor and sovereign.' An
 order was likewise published a few days after at Petersburg, requiring
 the magistrates and all persons to subscribe the same declaration; and
 all the grandees of the empire were commanded, on pain of death and
 confiscation, to repair to Moscow by the latter end of March for that
 purpose, except those inhabiting Astracan and Siberia, who, living at
 too great a distance, were excused from giving their personal
 attendance, and permitted to subscribe before their respective
 governors. This oath was readily taken by all ranks and degrees of the
 people, who were well assured that their emperor would make choice of
 one who was every way worthy of the succession, and capable of
 supporting the dignity intended for him: but they were still in the dark
 as to the identical person, though it was generally believed to be
 prince Nariskin, who was nearly related to the emperor, and allowed to
 have all the qualities requisite for his successor: but a little time
 shewed them, that this conjecture was groundless.

 faithful subjects, against the tyranny of Mir Mahmoud, and to obtain
 satisfaction from him and his Tartars, for the robberies and mischiefs
 which they had committed in the Russian empire.

 [118] Catherine paid the last duties to her husband's ashes, with a pomp
 becoming the greatest monarch that Russia, or perhaps any other country,
 had ever known; and though there is no court of Europe where splendour
 and magnificence is carried to a greater height on these occasions than
 in that of Russia, yet it may with great truth be said, that she even
 surpassed herself in the funeral honours paid to her great Peter. She
 purchased the most precious kinds of marble, and employed some of the
 ablest sculptors of Italy to erect a mausoleum to this hero, which
 might, if possible, transmit the remembrance of his great actions to the
 most distant ages. Not satisfied with this, she caused a medal to be
 struck, worthy of the ancients. On one side was represented the bust of
 the late emperor, with these words--'_Peter the Great, Emperor and
 Sovereign of all Russia, born May 30, 1672_. On the reverse was the
 empress sitting, with the crown on her head, the globe and sceptre by
 her side on a table, and before her were a sphere, sea charts, plans,
 mathematical instruments, arms, and a caduceus. At distances, in three
 different places, were represented an edifice on the sea coast, with a
 platform before it, a ship and galley at sea, and the late emperor in
 the clouds, supported by eternity, looking on the empress, and shewing
 her with his right hand all the treasures he had left her, with these
 words, 'Behold what I have left you.' In the exergue, 'Deceased 28
 January, 1725.' Several of these medals she ordered to be struck in
 gold, to the weight of fifty ducats and distributed among the foreign
 ministers, and all the grandees of the empire, as a testimony of her
 respect and gratitude to the memory of her late husband, to whose
 generosity she took a pleasure in owning herself indebted for her
 present elevated station.
 
 Mottley gives us the following, as the czar's epitaph:
 
                               Here lieth,
                  All that could die of a man immortal,
                            PETER ALEXIOWITZ:
                     It is almost superfluous to add,
                        _Great Emperor of Russia!_
                                 A title,
                  Which, instead of adding to his glory,
                    Became glorious by his wearing it.
                          Let antiquity be dumb,
                  Nor boast her Alexander, or her Caesar.
                           How easy was victory
                 To leaders who were followed by heroes!
                 And whose soldiers felt a noble disdain
           At being thought less vigilant than their generals!
                                 But he,
                    Who in this place first knew rest,
                    Found subjects base and inactive,
                    Unwarlike, unlearned, untractable;
            Neither covetous of fame, nor fearless of danger;
                     Creatures with the names of men,
             But with qualities rather brutal than rational!
                             Yet, even these
                He polished from their native ruggedness;
                    And, breaking out like a new sun,
                   To illuminate the minds of a people,
              Dispelled their night of hereditary darkness;
                And, by force of his invincible influence,
                          Taught them to conquer
                     Even the conquerors of Germany.
             Other princes have commanded victorious armies;
                       This commander created them.
              Blush, O Art! at a hero who owed thee nothing
               Exult, O Nature! for thine was this prodigy.
 
 [119] The distinguished regard which this princess shews for the arts
 and sciences, and her endeavours to attract the great geniuses of all
 nations to reside in her dominions, by every possible encouragement,
 affords the strongest presumptions, that in her reign we shall see a
 second age of Louis XIV. and of this we have had a recent proof, in the
 obliging letter which this august princess wrote with her own hand to M.
 d'Alembert, and the choice she has since made of M. Duplex, a member of
 the royal academy of sciences at Paris, when the beforementioned
 gentleman thought fit to decline the gracious offers she made him. In
 which choice she has shewn that it is not birth nor rank, but true merit
 and virtue, which she considers as the essential qualifications in a
 person to whom she would confide the most sacred of all trusts, that of
 the education of the grand duke, her son. What then may not be expected
 from the administration of a sovereign so superior to vulgar prejudice?
 And especially when assisted by a Woronzoff and a Galitzin, both the
 professed friends and patrons of literature and the fine arts, which
 they themselves have not disdained to cultivate, when business and the
 weighty affairs of state have allowed them a few moments leisure.
 
 [120] The following anecdote, communicated by a nobleman of the
 strictest probity, who was himself an eye-witness of the fact, will give
 us a clear insight into the character and disposition of Peter I. In one
 of the many plots which was formed against the life and government of
 this monarch, there was among the number of those seized a soldier,
 belonging to his own regiment of guards. Peter being told by his
 officers that this man had always behaved extremely well, had a
 curiosity to see him, and learn from his own mouth what might have been
 his inducement to be concerned in a plot against him; and to this
 purpose he dressed himself in a plain garb, and so as not to be known by
 the man again, and went to the prison where he was confined, when, after
 some conversation, 'I should be glad to know, friend,' said Peter, 'what
 were your reasons for being concerned in an attempt against the emperor
 your master, as I am certain that he never did you any injury, but on
 the contrary, has a regard for you, as being a brave soldier, and one
 who have always done your duty in the field; and therefore, if you were
 to shew the least remorse for what you have done, I am persuaded that
 the emperor would forgive you: but before I interest myself in your
 behalf, you must tell me what motives you had to join the mutineers; and
 repeat to you again, that the emperor is naturally so good and
 compassionate, that I am certain he will give you your pardon.'
 
 'I know little or nothing of the emperor,' replied the soldier, 'for I
 never saw him but at a distance; but he caused my father's head to be
 cut off some time ago, for being concerned in a former rebellion, and it
 is the duty of a son to revenge the death of his father, by that of the
 person who took away his life. If then the emperor is really so good and
 merciful as you have represented him, counsel him, for his own safety
 not to pardon me; for were he to restore me my liberty, the first use I
 should make of it would be, to engage in some new attempt against his
 life, nor should I ever rest till I had accomplished my design;
 therefore the securest method he can take, will be to order my head to
 be struck off immediately, without which his own life is not in safety.'
 The czar in vain used all the arguments he could think of, to set before
 this desperado the folly and injustice of such sentiments; he still
 persisted in what he had declared, and Peter departed, greatly chagrined
 at the bad success of his visit, and gave orders for the execution of
 this man and the rest of his accomplices.

 ACT I
 
 ANITUS:
 My dear confidants, my dear agents, you know how much money I made you
 during the last festival of Ceres. I'm getting married and I hope you
 will do your duty on this grand occasion.
 
 DRIXA:
 Yes, without doubt, Milord, since you are going to make us earn yet
 more.
 
 ANITUS:
 Madame Drixa, I must have two beautiful Persian rugs. You, Terpandre,
 of you I only ask two large silver candelabra. And of you, Acros, a
 half dozen dresses of silk embroidered with gold.
 
 TERPANDRE:
 That's a bit much; but Milord there's nothing I won't do to deserve
 your holy protection.
 
 ANITUS:
 You will regain all that a hundred fold. It's the best way to deserve
 the favors of the gods and goddesses. Give much and you will receive
 much; and especially don't fail to arouse the people against all the
 people of quality who do not vow enough, and who do not present
 offerings.
 
 ACROS:
 We will never fail in that; it's too sacred a duty not to be faithful
 to it.
 
 ANITUS:
 Go, my dear friends. May the gods keep you in these sentiments, so
 pious and just! And count on prospering, yourselves, your children and
 your grandchildren.
 
 TERPANDRE:
 We are sure of that because you said it.
 
 (Exit Terpandre and Acros)
 
 ANITUS:
 Well, my dear Madame Drixa, I think you don't find it ill that I am
 espousing Aglaea; but I don't love you any less. We will live together
 as usual.
 
 DRIXA:
 Oh! Milord, I am not jealous; and since business is going so well I am
 very satisfied. Since I have the honor of being one of your
 mistresses, I have enjoyed great consideration in Athens. If you love
 Aglaea, I love the young Sophronine. And Xantippe, the wife of
 Socrates has promised to give him to me in marriage. You will still
 have the same rights over me. I am only annoyed that this young man
 may be raised by that villainous Socrates, and that Aglaea may yet be
 in his clutches. They must be gotten out of them as quickly as
 possible. Xantippe will be enchanted to be rid of them. The handsome
 Sophronine and the beautiful Aglaea are very ill in Socrates hands.
 
 ANITUS:
 I really flatter myself, my dear Madame Drixa, that Melitus and I will
 ruin that dangerous man, who preaches nothing but virtue and divinity
 and who has dared to mock certain intrigues that happened at the
 Mysteries of Ceres. But Socrates is the tutor of Aglaea. Agathon,
 Aglaea's father, they say has left her great wealth. Aglaea is
 adorable. I idolize Aglaea. I must marry Aglaea and I must deal
 tactfully with Socrates while waiting to hang him.
 
 DRIXA:
 Deal tactfully with Socrates in order that I may have my young man.
 But why did Agathon allow his daughter into the clutches of that old,
 flat nosed Socrates, that insufferable fault-finder who corrupts the
 young and prevents them from frequenting courtesans and the holy
 mysteries?
 
 ANITUS:
 Agathon was infatuated with the same principles. He was one of those
 sober and serious types who have different morals from ours; who are
 from another country, and who are our sworn enemies, who think they've
 fulfilled all their duties when they've adored divinity, helped
 humanity, cultivated friendship and studied philosophy; one of those
 folks who insolently pretend that the gods have not inscribed the
 future in the liver of an ox; one of those pitiless dialecticians who
 find fault with priests for sacrificing their daughters or spending
 the night with them, as needs be. You feel they are monsters fit only
 to be choked. If there were only five or six sages in Athens who had
 as much credit as he, that would be enough to deprive me of most of my
 income and honors.
 
 DRIXA:
 The Devil! Now that's really serious.
 
 ANITUS:
 While waiting to strangle him, I am going to speak with him under the
 porticoes and conclude this business with him about my marriage.
 
 DRIXA:
 Here he is: you do him too much honor. I am going to leave you and I
 am going to speak about my young man to Xantippe.
 
 ANITUS:
 The gods accompany you, my darling Drixa. Serve them always and beware
 of believing in only one God, and don't forget my two beautiful
 Persian rugs.
 
 (Enter Socrates)
 
 Eh! Hello, my dear Socrates, the favorite of the gods and the wisest
 of mortals. I feel I am raised above myself every time I see you and
 in you, I respect Human Nature.
 
 SOCRATES:
 I am a simple man destitute of sciences and full of weakness like the
 rest. It's much if you support me.
 
 ANITUS:
 Support you! I admire you; I would like to resemble you if it were
 possible. And it is in order to be a more frequent witness to your
 virtues, to hear your lessons more often, that I wish to marry your
 beautiful pupil Aglaea whose destiny depends on you.
 
 SOCRATES:
 It's true that her father, Agathon, who was my friend, that is to say
 much more than just a relative, confided to me by his will this
 amiable and virtuous orphan.
 
 ANITUS:
 With considerable riches? For they say it's the best part of Athens.
 
 SOCRATES:
 On that subject, I can give you no enlightenment; her father, that
 kind friend whose wishes are sacred to me, forbade me by that same
 will, to divulge the condition of his daughter's fortune.
 
 ANITUS:
 That respect for the last wishes of a friend, and that discretion are
 worthy of your beautiful soul. But people know well enough that
 Agathon was a rich man.
 
 SOCRATES:
 He deserved to be, if riches are a favor of the Supreme Being.
 
 ANITUS:
 They say that a little hare-brain named Sophronine, is paying court to
 her on account of her fortune. But I am persuaded that you will show
 the door to such a character, and that a man like me won't have a
 rival.
 
 SOCRATES:
 I know what I must think of a man like you: but it's not for me to
 obstruct Aglaea's feelings. I serve her as her father; I am not her
 master. She must dispose of her heart. I regard constraint as a crime.
 Speak to her: If she listens to your propositions, I will consent to
 her will.
 
 ANITUS:
 I've already got the consent of Xantippe, your wife; without doubt she
 is informed of Aglaea's feelings; so I regard the thing as done.
 
 SOCRATES:
 I cannot regard things as done until they are.
 
 (Aglaea enters)
 
 Come beautiful Aglaea, come decide your fate. Here's a gentleman,
 priest of high rank, the leading priest in Athens, who offers himself
 to be your spouse. I leave you complete liberty to explain things with
 him. That liberty will not be constrained by my presence. Whatever
 choice you make I will approve. Xantippe will prepare everything for
 your wedding.
 
 (Socrates leaves)
 
 AGLAEA:
 Ah, generous Socrates it's with great regret I see you leave.
 
 ANITUS:
 It seems, amiable Aglaea, that you have great confidence in the good
 Socrates.
 
 AGLAEA:
 I owe it to him; he's serving as my father and he forms my soul.
 
 ANITUS:
 Well! If he directs your feelings, could you tell me what you think of
 Ceres, of Cybele, of Venus?
 
 AGLAEA:
 Alas! I will; whatever you wish.
 
 ANITUS:
 That's well said: you will also do what I wish.
 
 AGLAEA:
 No. That's much different from the other.
 
 ANITUS:
 You see that the wise Socrates consents to our union. Xantippe, his
 wife, presses for this marriage. You know what feelings you have
 inspired in me. You know my rank and my reputation. You see that my
 happiness and perhaps yours depends on a word from your mouth.
 
 AGLAEA:
 I am going to respond to you with the truth which that great man who
 just left here instructed me never to dissemble, and with the liberty
 that he left me. I respect your dignity; I know little of your person
 and I cannot give myself to you.
 
 ANITUS:
 You cannot! You who are free! Ah, Aglaea, you don't wish it then?
 
 AGLAEA:
 It's true that I don't wish it.
 
 ANITUS:
 Are you really aware of the affront you are giving me? I see very
 clearly that Socrates has betrayed me. It's he who is dictating your
 response. It's he who is giving preference to this young Sophronine,
 to my unworthy rival, to that impious--
 
 AGLAEA:
 Sophronine is not impious; he's been attached to him since childhood.
 Socrates serves as a father to him as to me. Sophronine is full of
 grace and virtue. I love him and I am loved by him. He clings only to
 me to be his wife. But I will no more have him than you.
 
 ANITUS:
 All that you tell me astonishes me. What! You dare to admit to me that
 you love Sophronine?
 
 AGLAEA:
 Yes, I dare confess to you because nothing is more true.
 
 ANITUS:
 And when he demands that you be happy with him, you refuse his hand?
 
 AGLAEA:
 Again, nothing is more true.
 
 ANITUS:
 Doubtless it's fear of displeasing me that delays your engagement to
 him?
 
 AGLAEA:
 Assuredly no. Never having sought to please you, I do not at all fear
 displeasing you.
 
 ANITUS:
 Then you fear to offend the gods by preferring a profane man like this
 Sophronine to a minister of the altars?
 
 AGLAEA:
 Not at all; I am persuaded that the Supreme Being cares very little
 whether I marry you or not.
 
 ANITUS:
 The Supreme Being! My dear girl, that's not the way you must speak.
 You must speak of gods and goddesses. Take care: I perceive in you
 dangerous sentiments and I know very well who inspired them. Know that
 Ceres, whose high priest I am, can punish you for having scorned her
 cult and her minister.
 
 AGLAEA:
 I scorn neither the one nor the other. They tell me that Ceres
 presides over wheat: I intend to believe it. But she doesn't meddle
 with my marriage.
 
 ANITUS:
 She meddles with everything. You know that very well; but still I hope
 to convert you. Are you really determined not to marry Sophronine?
 
 AGLAEA:
 Yes, I am very determined, and I'm very annoyed about it.
 
 ANITUS:
 I don't understand these contradictions at all. Listen: I love you. I
 wanted to make you happy and place you in a high rank. Believe me,
 don't offend me. Don't reject your fortune. Think that it is necessary
 to sacrifice everything to an advantageous establishment; that youth
 passes and that fortune remains. That riches and honors must be your
 only goal and that I speak to you on behalf of the Gods and Goddesses.
 I beg you to reflect on it. Goodbye, my dear girl. I am going to pray
 to Ceres that she may inspire you. And I hope that she will touch your
 heart. Goodbye, one more time. Remember you promised me not to marry
 Sophronine.
 
 AGLAEA:
 I promised that to myself not to you.
 
 (Anitus leaves)
 
 How that man increases my chagrin. I don't know why I never see that
 priest without trembling. But here's Sophronine. Alas, while his rival
 fills me with terror, this one increases my sorrows and my tenderness.
 
 SOPHRONINE: (entering)
 Darling Aglaea, I see Anitus, that priest of Ceres, that evil man,
 that sworn enemy of Socrates, is leaving you, and your eyes seem damp
 with tears.
 
 AGLAEA:
 Him! He's the enemy of our benefactor, Socrates? I am no longer
 astonished by the aversion that he inspired me with even before he
 spoke to me.
 
 SOPHRONINE:
 Alas, is it to him that I must impute the tears that darken your eyes?
 
 AGLAEA:
 He can only inspire me with disgust. No, Sophronine, only you can make
 my tears flow.
 
 SOPHRONINE:
 Me, great gods! I who would pay for them with my blood! I, who adore
 you, who flatter myself to be loved by you! I, who must reproach
 myself for having cast a moment of bitterness into your life? You are
 weeping and I am the cause of it? Then what have I done? What crime
 have I committed?
 
 AGLAEA:
 You didn't commit any. I am crying because you deserve all my
 tenderness; because you have it; and because I must renounce you.
 
 SOPHRONINE:
 What funereal words have you uttered? No, I cannot believe it; you
 love me, you cannot change. You promised me to be mine; you don't wish
 my death.
 
 AGLAEA:
 I want you to live happy, Sophronine, and I cannot make you happy. I
 hoped, but my fate misled me. I swear that, not being able to be
 yours, I will belong to no one. I declared it to that Anitus who is
 pursuing me, and whom I scorn. I declare to you my heart is full of
 the most acute sorrow and the most tender love.
 
 SOPHRONINE:
 Since you love me, I ought to live; but if you refuse me your hand, I
 must die. Dearest Aglaea, in the name of so much love, in the name of
 your charms and your virtues, explain this funereal mystery to me.
 
 (Socrates enters)
 
 O Socrates! my master! my father! I see myself here the most unlucky
 of men: between two beings through whom I breathe; it's you who taught
 me wisdom; it's Aglaea who taught me how to feel love. You've given
 your consent to our marriage; the beautiful Aglaea who seems to desire
 it refuses me and, as she tells me she loves me, plunges the dagger in
 my heart. She breaks off our marriage without explaining to me the
 reason for such a cruel caprice. Either prevent my pain, or teach me,
 if it is possible, to bear it.
 
 SOCRATES:
 Aglaea is the mistress of her will; her father made me her tutor and
 not her tyrant. I based my happiness on seeing you united together; if
 she has changed her mind, I am surprised by it, but we must hear her
 reasons. If they are just, we must submit to them.
 
 SOPHRONINE:
 They cannot be just.
 
 AGLAEA:
 They are, at least in my eyes. Condescend to listen to me, person to
 person. When you had accepted the secret testament of my father, wise
 and generous Socrates, you told me that it would leave me an honest
 fortune with which I could establish myself. From that time, I formed
 the plan of giving this fortune to your dear disciple, Sophronine, who
 has only your support and for his entire wealth possessed only his
 virtue. You entirely approved my resolution. You conceived that it was
 my good fortune to make the fortune of an Athenian that I regard as
 your son. Full of my happiness, carried away by a sweet joy, that my
 heart could not contain, I confided this delirious state my soul was
 in to your wife, Xantippe, and just as soon that condition
 disappeared. She treated me as a dreamer. She showed me the will of my
 father who died in poverty, who left me nothing, and who confided me
 to the friendship which united you. At that moment, awakened from my
 dream, I felt only sadness at being unable to make the fortune of
 Sophronine; I don't wish to overwhelm him with the weight of my
 misery.
 
 SOPHRONINE:
 Indeed, I told you Socrates that her reasons were valueless; if she
 loves me am I not rich enough? I've subsisted, it's true through your
 charity, but it's not a guilty employment that I embrace only to
 support my dear Aglaea. I must, it's true, make her the sacrifice of
 my love, to find for her, an advantageous role for myself. But I
 confess, I don't have the strength, and in that respect I am unworthy
 of her. But if she could be content with my conditions, if she could
 lower herself to me! No, I don't dare ask it; I don't dare wish it and
 I won't succumb to a misfortune that she suffers.
 
 SOCRATES:
 My children, Xantippe was really indiscreet to have shown you that
 will. But believe me, beautiful Aglaea, that she deceived you.
 
 AGLAEA:
 She didn't deceive me. I saw my misery with my own eyes. My father's
 handwriting is well known to me. Be sure, Socrates, that I know how to
 bear poverty; I know how to work with my hands. It's enough to live.
 That's all I need. But it's not enough for Sophronine.
 
 SOPHRONINE:
 It's a thousand times too much for me, tender, sublime soul, worthy of
 having been raised by Socrates. A noble and laborious poverty is the
 natural state of man. I would have wanted to offer you a throne. But
 if you deign to live with me, our respectable poverty is higher than
 the throne of Croesus,
 
 SOCRATES:
 Your feelings please me more than they soften me. With ecstacy, I see
 blooming in your hearts the virtue that I sowed there. Never have my
 cares been better rewarded; never have my hopes been better fulfilled.
 But, yet once more, Aglaea, believe me, my wife has ill informed you.
 You are richer than you can imagine. It was not in her but in me that
 your father confided. Can you not have wealth that Xantippe is
 ignorant of?
 
 AGLAEA:
 No, Socrates. It says exactly in his will that he is leaving me poor.
 
 SOCRATES:
 And as for me, I tell you that you are mistaken; that he left you
 wherewithal to live happily with the virtuous Sophronine, and that it
 is necessary that you both come to sign the contract now.
 
 XANTIPPE (entering)
 Come on, come on, my daughter. Don't amuse yourself with the dreams of
 my husband. Philosophy is all very fine when one is in easy
 circumstances, but you have nothing. One has to live. You will
 philosophize later. I have concluded your marriage with Anitus, a
 worthy priest, a man of credit, a powerful man. Come follow me. There
 must be neither delay nor contradiction; I like to be obeyed. And
 quickly, it's for your good. Don't argue and follow me.
 
 SOPHRONINE:
 Ah, heaven, ha! dearest Aglaea!
 
 SOCRATES:
 Let her talk and trust in me for your happiness.
 
 XANTIPPE:
 What do you mean, let me talk? Really, I mean to do so, and they'd
 better let me do it. It's really for you, with your wisdom, and your
 familiar demon, and your irony, and all your nonsense which is good
 for nothing, for you to meddle in the marriage of young girls! You are
 a good sort, but you don't understand anything about worldly affairs.
 And you are very lucky that I govern you. Come on, Aglaea, come so I
 can establish you. And you, who remain bewildered, I've got just the
 thing for you, too. Drixa is your thing. You will thank me, both of
 you. Everything will be concluded in no time; I am expeditious. Let's
 not waste time. All this should have been concluded already.
 
 SOCRATES:
 Don't offend her, my children. Show her all sorts of deference. It's
 necessary to humor her since one cannot correct her, It's the triumph
 of superior reason to live with folks who don't have any.
 
 CURTAIN
 
 
 
 ACT II
 
 SOPHRONINE:
 Divine Socrates, I cannot believe my luck: how can it be that Aglaea
 whose father died in extreme poverty has such a considerable dowry?
 
 SOCRATES:
 I already told you; she had more than she knew. I knew her father's
 resources better than she. May it suffice you both to enjoy a fortune
 you deserve; as for myself, I owe the dead a secret as well as the
 living.
 
 SOPHRONINE:
 I have only one fear; it's that that priest of Ceres, over whom you've
 preferred me will avenge Aglaea's refusals on you. He's a man really
 to be feared.
 
 SOCRATES:
 Eh! What can be feared when one is doing one's duty? I know the rage
 of my enemies. I know all their slanders; but when one only tries to
 do good to men and when one does not offend heaven, one can fear
 nothing, neither during life, nor after death.
 
 SOPHRONINE:
 Nothing is more true; but I would die of sorrow if the happiness I owe
 you allowed your enemies to force you to put your heroic constancy to
 use.
 
 AGLAEA: (entering)
 My benefactor, my father, man above all men, I embrace your knees.
 Second me, Sophronine, it's he, it's Socrates who is marrying us at
 the expense of his fortune, who is paying my dowry, who is depriving
 himself of the greatest share of his wealth for us. No. We won't
 suffer it; we won't be rich at this price. The more grateful our
 heart, the more we must imitate the nobility of his.
 
 SOPHRONINE:
 Like Aglaea, I am throwing myself at your feet. I am seized as she is.
 We feel your benefactions equally. We love you too much, Socrates, to
 abuse it. Look at us as your children. But don't let your children be
 an expense to such a degree. Your friendship is the greatest of
 treasures; it's the only one that we want. What! You are not rich and
 you are doing what the powerful on earth don't do! If we were to
 accept your benefits we would be unworthy of them.
 
 SOCRATES:
 Rise, children. You are making me too weak. Listen, mustn't we respect
 the will of the dead? Aglaea, your father whom I regarded as the
 better part of myself, didn't he order me to treat you as my own
 daughter? I am obeying him. I would be betraying his friendship and
 confidence if I did less. I accepted his testament, and I will execute
 it. The little that I am giving you is useless to my old age which is
 without needs. Finally, as I have a duty to obey my friend, you must
 obey your father. It is I who in his sacred name order you not to
 overwhelm me with sorrow by refusing me. But retire; I observe
 Xantippe. I have my reasons for begging you to avoid her at this time.
 
 AGLAEA:
 Ah. What cruel orders you give us.
 
 (Aglaea and Sophronine exit)
 
 XANTIPPE (entering)
 Truly, you've just made a fine masterpiece! My word, my dear husband,
 it's necessary to prevent you. See, if you please, these stupidities.
 I promised Aglaea to the priest Anitus who has much credit among the
 great. I promised Sophronine to that big business woman, Drixa who has
 great credit among the people, and you marry the two dummies to each
 other to make me break my word. It's not enough you are endowering
 them with the greatest share of your wealth. Twenty thousand drachmas,
 just gods! Twenty thousand drachmas! Aren't you ashamed? With what
 will you live at the age of seventy? Who will pay for your doctors
 when you become ill; your lawyers when you have a law suit? Finally,
 what will I do when this trickster, this hypocrite, Anitus and his
 party that you could have won over to yourself conspire to persecute
 you, as they've done so many times? Heaven confound philosophers and
 philosophy, and my stupid friendship for you! You meddle to direct
 others when you need to be led about. You argue endlessly and you have
 no common sense. If you weren't the best man in the world, you would
 be the most ridiculous and unbearable. Listen: Only one word will
 work. Instantly break off this impertinent bargain and do what your
 wife wishes.
 
 SOCRATES:
 My dear Xantippe, it's quite well to speak and with moderation; but
 listen to me in your turn. I didn't propose this marriage. Sophronine
 and Aglaea love each other and are worthy of each other. I've already
 given you all the wealth that I could grant you under the laws. I am
 giving almost all which remains to me to the daughter of my friend.
 The little I am keeping will suffice for me. I have neither doctors to
 pay, because I am sober, nor lawyers, because I have no debts. With
 regard to the philosophy for which you reproach me it teaches me how
 to suffer the indignities of Anitus and your reproaches. To love you
 despite your temper. (he leaves)
 
 XANTIPPE:
 The old fool! I have to respect him despite himself, for after all,
 there's I don't know what of grandeur in his folly. The calm of his
 extravagances enrages me. It's useless for me to scold him; I waste my
 efforts. I've been screaming at him for thirty years, and when I've
 really screamed he overawes me and I am really confounded. Could he
 have something in his soul superior to mine?
 
 DRIXA: (entering)
 Well, Madam Xantippe! See how you are mistress in your own house! Fie!
 How cowardly to allow oneself to be governed by one's husband! This
 cursed Socrates has carried off this handsome boy whose fortune I
 wanted to make! The traitor! He will pay me for that!
 
 XANTIPPE:
 My poor Madame Drixa, don't be angry with my husband. I am
 sufficiently angry with him. He's an imbecile, I know that very well.
 But at bottom, he's got the best heart in the world. There's no malice
 in him. He commits every possible stupidity without intending any
 trickery and with so much integrity that it's disarming. Anyway, he's
 headstrong like a mule. I've spent my life torturing him; I've even
 beaten him sometimes. Not only have I been unable to correct him, I
 haven't even been able to anger him. What do you expect me to do?
 
 DRIXA:
 I will avenge myself, I tell you. I notice under the porticoes his
 good friend Anitus and some of ours. Let me alone.
 
 XANTIPPE:
 My God! I fear that all these folks may play my husband some trick.
 Let's go quickly to warn him. for after all, one cannot help loving
 him.
 
 (Exit Xantippe)
 
 DRIXA:
 Our insults are alike, respected Anitus. You are betrayed like me.
 This dishonest man, Socrates, is giving almost all his wealth to
 Aglaea only to drive you to despair. You must exact an exemplary
 vengeance.
 
 ANITUS:
 That's indeed my intention; heaven is concerned in it. Since he
 disdains me, this man doubtless scorns the gods. Accusations have
 already been brought against him; you must help me to renew them.
 We'll put him in danger of his life. Then I will offer him my
 protection on the condition that he gives me Aglaea and surrenders
 your handsome Sophronine to you. That way we will fulfill all our
 duties. He will be punished by the fright we have given him. I will
 obtain my mistress and you shall have your lover.
 
 DRIXA:
 You speak like wisdom itself. Some divinity must inspire you. Instruct
 us: what must be done?
 
 ANITUS:
 The judges will soon pass here to go to the Tribunal; Melitus is at
 their head.
 
 DRIXA:
 But that Melitus is a little pedant; an evil man who is your enemy.
 
 ANITUS:
 Yes, but he's even more an enemy of Socrates. He's a hypocritical
 rogue who maintains the rights of the Areopagus against me. But we
 will join together when it's a question of ruining those false wise
 men who are capable of enlightening the people about our conduct.
 Listen, my dear Drixa, you are devout.
 
 DRIXA:
 Yes, assuredly, my lord. I love money and pleasure with all my heart,
 but as regards devotion, I will give place to no one.
 
 ANITUS:
 Go take some devout people with you and when the judges pass by,
 scream out against impiety.
 
 TERPANDRE:
 Will there be something to gain by it? We are ready.
 
 ACROS:
 Yes. But what kind of impiety?
 
 ANITUS:
 All types. You have only to accuse him boldly of not believing in the
 gods. That's the quickest way.
 
 DRIXA:
 Oh! Let me do it.
 
 ANITUS:
 You will be perfectly seconded. Go under these porticoes; stir up your
 friends. Meanwhile, I am going to instruct some newsmongers of the
 controversy, some hack scribblers who often come to dine with me. They
 are very despicable people, I admit. But, when they are carefully
 directed, on occasion, they can do harm. All means must be used to
 make the good cause triumph. Go, my dear friends. Commend yourselves
 to Ceres. You will shout on my given signal. It's the sure way of
 gaining hearers, and especially to live happily on earth.
 
 (They leave; Nonoti, Chomos and Bertios enter)
 
 ANITUS:
 Tireless, Nonoti, deep Chomos, fastidious Bertios; have you prepared
 against this evil Socrates the little works I ordered?
 
 NONOTI:
 I have labored, Milord; he won't recover from it.
 
 CHOMOS:
 I have demonstrated the truth against him. He is confounded.
 
 BERTIOS:
 I said only one word in my paper: he is ruined.
 
 ANITUS:
 Take care, Nonoti. I forbade you to be prolix. You are naturally
 boring; you could try the patience of the court.
 
 NONOTI:
 Milord, I've written only a page. There I prove that the soul is an
 infused quintessence; that tails are given to animals to shoo flies;
 that love works miracles, and that consequently Socrates is an enemy
 of the state who must be exterminated.
 
 ANITUS:
 You couldn't draw a better conclusion. Go bring your accusation to the
 second judge, who is an excellent philosopher. I will answer for it.
 You will soon defeat your enemy Socrates.
 
 NONOTI:
 Milord, I am not his enemy. I am only annoyed that he's got too great
 a reputation, and all that I am doing is for the glory of Ceres, and
 the good of the country.
 
 ANITUS:
 Go, I tell you. Hurry up. Well, wise Chomos, what have you done?
 
 CHOMOS:
 Milord, not having found anything to reprove in Socrates' writings,
 I've adroitly accused him of thinking contrary to what he says. I
 point out the venom in what he says.
 
 ANITUS:
 Marvelous. Take that piece to the fourth judge. He's a man who lacks
 common sense and will understand you perfectly. And you, Bertios?
 
 BERTIOS:
 Milord, here's my last paper on chaos. I show, cleverly passing from
 chaos to the Olympic games, that Socrates is perverting the youth.
 
 ANITUS:
 Admirable! Go on my behalf to the seventh judge and tell him that I
 commend Socrates to him. Fine, here's Melitus already, the Chief of
 the Eleven coming forward. There's no beating around the bush to be
 done with him. We know each other, too well.
 
 (Exit Bertios and Chomos, enter Melitus.)
 
 ANITUS:
 Your honor, the judge, a word. Socrates must be destroyed.
 
 MELITUS:
 Your Reverence, the Priest, I've been pondering it for a long while.
 Let's unite on this point and we will be less embroiled on the rest.
 
 ANITUS:
 I know quite well we hate each other. But while detesting each other,
 we must unite to govern the republic.
 
 MELITUS:
 Agreed. No one can hear us here. I know that you are a fraud. You
 don't look on me as an honest man. I cannot injure you because you are
 a high priest. You cannot ruin me because I am the leading judge, But
 Socrates could hurt either of us by unmasking us. You and I must begin
 by compassing his death and then we will see how we can exterminate
 each other at the first opportunity.
 
 ANITUS:
 No one could say it better.
 
 (Aside)
 Hum! How I'd like to hold this rascal from the Areopagus on an altar,
 arms hanging on one side, legs over the other, so as to open his
 stomach with my golden knife and consult his liver at my ease.
 
 MELITUS: (aside)
 Will I ever get this gallows bird of a High Priest in jail and make him
 drink a pint of Hemlock at my pleasure?
 
 ANITUS:
 There now, my dear chap, there are your comrades who are coming
 forward. I've prepared the mood of the people.
 
 MELITUS:
 Very fine, my dear ally. Count on me as yourself at this moment. But
 the grudge still remains.
 
 (Some judges pass through the porticoes. Anitus whispers in Melitus'
 ear.)
 
 DRIXA, TERPANDRE, ACROS:
 Justice! Justice! Scandal, impiety! Justice, justice! Irreligion,
 impiety! Justice!
 
 ANITUS:
 What's all this, my friends? Of what are you complaining?
 
 DRIXA, TERPANDRE, ACROS:
 Justice! In the name of the people.
 
 MELITUS:
 Against whom?
 
 DRIXA, TERPANDRE, ACROS:
 Against Socrates.
 
 MELITUS:
 Ah! ah! Against Socrates? It's not the first time he's been complained
 of. What's he done?
 
 ACROS:
 I don't know anything about it.
 
 TERPANDRE:
 They say that he gives money to girls to get married.
 
 ACROS:
 Yes. He's corrupting the youth.
 
 DRIXA:
 He's impious. He never offers gifts to Ceres. He says there's too much
 gold and too much useless money in the temples. That the poor are
 dying of hunger and that they must be helped.
 
 ACROS:
 Yes, he says that the priests of Ceres sometimes get drunk. It's true,
 he's impious.
 
 DRIXA:
 He's a heretic. He denies the plurality of the gods. He's a deist. He
 believes only in one God. He's an atheist.
 
 MELITUS:
 Now these are very grave accusations and very credible. They've
 already informed me of all that you are telling us.
 
 ANITUS:
 If such horrors are allowed to go unpunished, the state is in danger.
 Minerva will withhold her aid from us.
 
 DRIXA:
 Yes, Minerva without doubt. I heard him make jokes about the owl of
 Minerva.
 
 MELITUS:
 About the owl of Minerva! Oh! Heavens! Aren't you of the opinion he
 should be put in prison immediately?
 
 JUDGES: (together)
 Yes, in prison. Right away. In prison!
 
 MELITUS:
 Ushers! Take Socrates to prison immediately.
 
 DRIXA:
 And there let him be burned without having been heard.
 
 ONE OF THE JUDGES:
 Ah! He must at least be heard! We cannot infringe the law.
 
 ANITUS:
 What this fine, pious man means is--he must be heard, but one cannot
 be surprised by what he says. For you know these philosophers are
 diabolically clever. Where we bring harmony, they disturb all the
 Estates.
 
 MELITUS:
 To prison! to prison!
 
 (Xantippe, Sophronine, Aglaea enter. Then Socrates, enchained.)
 
 XANTIPPE:
 Ah, mercy! They are dragging my husband to prison. Honorable judges,
 aren't you ashamed to treat a man of his age thus? What evil could he
 do? He is incapable of it. Alas, he's more stupid than bad. Gentlemen,
 take pity on him. Indeed, I told you, my husband, that you would get
 yourself into some bad business. That's what comes of dowering girls.
 How unhappy I am!
 
 SOPHRONINE:
 Ah, gentlemen. Respect his age and his virtue. Put me in irons. I am
 ready to give my liberty and my life for his.
 
 AGLAEA:
 Yes. We will go to prison in place of him. We will die for him if need
 be. Don't seek the life of the greatest of men. Take us for your
 victims.
 
 MELITUS:
 You see how he corrupts the youth!
 
 SOCRATES:
 Cease, my wife; cease, my children to set yourselves up in opposition
 to the will of heaven. It is manifesting itself through the organ of
 the laws. Whoever resists the law is unworthy of being a citizen. God
 wished that I be put in irons; I submit to his decrees without a
 murmur. In my house, in Athens, in a prison cell, I am equally free.
 And in you I see so much sincere gratitude, so much friendship that I
 am still happy. What does it matter whether Socrates sleeps in his
 room or in an Athenian prison? Everything is in the eternal order of
 things and my will must be there.
 
 MELITUS:
 Let them take away this dialectician. That's how they all are. They
 press you with arguments right under the gallows.
 
 ANITUS:
 Gentlemen, what has just been said touches me. This man shows good
 disposition. I flatter myself I am able to convert him. Let me speak
 to him a moment in private. And order his wife and these young people
 to retire.
 
 A JUDGE:
 We indeed wish it, venerable Anitus. You can speak to him before he
 appears before our tribunal.
 
 (They exit leaving Socrates alone with Anitus.)
 
 ANITUS:
 Virtuous Socrates, my heart bleeds to see you in this condition.
 
 SOCRATES:
 You actually have a heart?
 
 ANITUS:
 Yes, and I am ready to do everything for you.
 
 SOCRATES:
 Really? I'm convinced you've done much already.
 
 ANITUS:
 Listen. Your situation is more dangerous than you think. It goes to
 your life.
 
 SOCRATES:
 Then it's a question of a little thing.
 
 ANITUS:
 It's little to your intrepid and sublime soul. To the eyes of those
 who cherish, as I do, your virtue, it's everything. Believe me, with
 whatever philosophy your souls may be armed, it is hard to perish by
 execution. That's not all: your reputation which must be dear to you
 will be tarnished throughout the centuries. Not only will all the
 bigots laugh over your death, they will insult you, light the pyre on
 which you will burn if they burn you, tighten the rope if they
 strangle you, grind the Hemlock if they poison you. But they will
 render your memory execrable to the entire future. You can easily
 avoid such a funereal end. I will answer for saving your life, and
 even will have you declared by the judges to be the wisest of men, as
 you were by the oracle of Apollo. It's only a question of giving me
 your pupil Aglaea. With the dowry you are giving her, understood. We
 can easily break off her marriage with Sophronine. You will enjoy a
 peaceable and honorable old age and the gods and goddesses will bless
 you.
 
 SOCRATES:
 Guards! Take me to prison without further delay.
 
 (They lead him away.)
 
 ANITUS:
 This man is incorrigible. It's not my fault. I have nothing to
 reproach myself with. He must be abandoned to his reprobate opinions
 and allowed to die unrepentant.
 
 CURTAIN
 
 
 
 ACT III
 
 (The Judges are seated on a tribunal. Socrates is standing.)
 
 A JUDGE: (to Anitus)
 You mustn't sit here. You are a priest of Ceres.
 
 ANITUS:
 I am only here for edification.
 
 MELITUS:
 Silence. Listen, Socrates, you are accused of being a bad citizen; of
 corrupting the youth; of denying the plurality of the gods; of being a
 heretic, deist, atheist. Answer.
 
 SOCRATES:
 Athenian Judges, I exhort you always to be good citizens as I have
 always tried to be. To shed your blood for the country as I have done
 in more than one battle. Regarding the youth of which you speak, do
 not cease to guide them through your admonitions, and especially by
 your examples; teach them to love true virtue, and to flee the
 wretched philosophy of the school; the article of the plurality of the
 gods is a bit difficult to discuss, but you will easily understand me.
 Athenian Judges, there is only one God.
 
 MELITUS AND ANOTHER JUDGE:
 Oh, the knave.
 
 SOCRATES:
 There is only one God, I tell you. His nature is to be infinite. No
 being can share his infinity with him. Raise your eyes toward the
 celestial globes, turn them towards earth and the sea. All
 corresponds, all is made for each other. Each being is intimately
 linked to other beings. Everything is of the same design. There is
 only a single architect, a single master, a single guardian. Perhaps
 he's deigned to form some genies, some demons, more powerful and more
 enlightened than men. And if they exist they are creatures like you;
 they are his first subjects and not gods at all. But nothing in nature
 advertises to us that they exist, while all nature announces to us one
 God and one Father. This God has no need of Mercury and Iris to
 signify his orders. He has only to will it and that's enough. If by
 Minerva, you understand only the wisdom of God, if by Neptune you
 intend only his immutable laws which raise and lower the seas, I would
 say to you: He allows you to revere Neptune and Minerva, since under
 these emblems you are still adoring only the eternal Being, and so
 long as you are not giving occasion to people to misunderstand it.
 
 ANITUS:
 What impious balderdash.
 
 SOCRATES:
 Always beware of turning religion into metaphysics: Morality is its
 essence. Adore and stop disputing. If our ancestors had said that the
 Supreme God had descended into the arms of Alcmene, of Danae, of
 Semele, and that he had children with them, our ancestors were
 imagining dangerous fables. It's insulting to the Divinity to pretend
 that he had committed with a woman in whatever manner it might be what
 we would call amongst men an adultery. That's discouraging to the rest
 of men to say that to be a great man, one must be born from the
 mysterious coupling with one of your wives or daughters. Miltiades,
 Cimon, Themistocles, Arisitides, that you persecuted were perhaps
 worth more than Perseus, Herakles and Bacchus. There being no other
 way to be the children of this God than by trying to please him, and
 by being just. Deserve that title by never rendering iniquitous
 judgments.
 
 MELITUS:
 What blasphemies and insolence!
 
 ANOTHER JUDGE:
 What absurdities! No one knows what he means.
 
 MELITUS:
 Socrates, if you always continue to argue, this is not what we need.
 Answer briefly and precisely. Did you make fun of the owl of Minerva?
 
 SOCRATES:
 Athenian judges, take care of your owls! When you propose ridiculous
 things to believe, too many men will choose to believe nothing at all.
 They have enough wit to see that your doctrine is impertinent, But
 they don't have enough to raise themselves to the true law. They know
 how to laugh at your little gods. They don't know how to adore the God
 of all beings, unique, incomprehensible, incommunicable, eternal, and
 all just as well as all powerful.
 
 MELITUS:
 Ah! The blasphemer! ah, the monster! He's said more than enough. I
 conclude for death.
 
 SEVERAL JUDGES:
 And we, too.
 
 A JUDGE:
 Several of us are not of that opinion. We think that Socrates spoke
 very well. We believe that men would be more just and more wise if
 they thought like him. And as for me, far from condemning him, I am of
 the opinion he ought to be rewarded.
 
 SEVERAL JUDGES:
 We think the same.
 
 MELITUS:
 The opinions seems to be divided.
 
 ANITUS:
 Gentlemen of the Areopagus, let me question Socrates. Do you think
 that the Sun turns and that the Areopagus is of Divine Right?
 
 SOCRATES:
 You have no right to ask me questions. But I have the right to show
 you what you are ignorant of. It matters little to society whether the
 earth may turn, but it matters greatly that men who turn with it be
 just. Virtue alone is of Divine Right. And you, the Areopagus have no
 other rights but those the nation has given you.
 
 ANITUS:
 Illustrious and equitable judges make Socrates leave.
 
 (Melitus gives a sign. They lead Socrates out. Anitus continues.)
 
 August Areopagus, instituted by heaven, you have heard him. This
 dangerous man denies that the Sun turns, and that you are filled with
 Divine Right. If these horrible opinions spread, no more magistrates,
 no more Sun; you will no longer be those judges established by the
 fundamental laws of Minerva; you are no longer masters of the state,
 you must no longer judge except by following the laws. And if you
 depend on the laws, you are ruined. Punish the rebellion, avenge
 heaven and earth. I am leaving: Fear the anger of the gods if Socrates
 remains alive.
 
 (Anitus leaves and the judges opine.)
 
 A JUDGE:
 I don't wish a quarrel with Anitus; he's a man much to be feared. If
 it were only a question of the gods it would still be overlooked.
 
 A JUDGE: (to whom he just spoke)
 Between ourselves, Socrates is right. But he's wrong to be right so
 publicly. I don't make more of the case of Ceres or Neptune than he
 does. But he ought not to say before the whole Areopagus what should
 only be whispered in the ear. Where, after all, is the evil in
 poisoning a philosopher, especially when he's old and ugly?
 
 ANOTHER JUDGE:
 If there is injustice in condemning Socrates, That's Anitus' affair.
 It's not mine. I put it all on his conscience. Anyway, it's late,
 we're wasting his time! To death, to death and no more discussion
 about it.
 
 ANOTHER:
 They say he's a heretic and an atheist. To death. To death.
 
 MELITUS:
 Let them call Socrates.
 
 (Socrates is brought in)
 
 The gods be blessed; the plurality is for death. Socrates, the gods
 condemn you through our mouth to drink Hemlock so that death will
 follow.
 
 SOCRATES:
 We are all mortal. Nature condemns you all to die in a short time. And
 probably you will all have an end sadder than mine. Diseases which
 lead to death are worse than a goblet of Hemlock. As to the rest, I
 owe praise to the judges who opined in favor of innocence. To the
 others, I owe only my pity.
 
 ONE JUDGE: (leaving)
 Certainly this man deserves a state pension rather than a bowl of
 Hemlock.
 
 ANOTHER JUDGE:
 That's true; but at the same time what's the point of getting
 embroiled with a priest of Ceres?
 
 ANOTHER JUDGE:
 I'm really quite comfortable in putting a philosopher to death. Those
 folk have a certain pride in wit which it's good to humble a little.
 
 ONE JUDGE:
 Gentlemen, one thing. While our shoulder is at the wheel, wouldn't we
 do better to put to death all the geometers who pretend that the three
 angles of a triangle add up to two right angles? They strangely
 scandalize the populace that reads their books.
 
 ANOTHER JUDGE:
 Yes, yes, we'll hang them at the next session. Let's go to dinner.
 
 (Exit the judges.)
 
 (There should be a scene change here to Socrates cell. But there is no
 indication in the text.)
 
 SOCRATES:
 I've been prepared for death for a long while. All that worries me now
 is that my wife, Xantippe may come trouble my last moments and
 interrupt the sweet composure of my soul: I mustn't be occupied except
 with the Supreme Being before whom I must soon appear. But here she
 is: I've got to be resigned to everything.
 
 XANTIPPE: (entering)
 Well! Poor man! What have these law folk concluded? Are you condemned
 to a fine? are you banished? Are you absolved? My God! How you've
 upset me! Try, I beg you, not to let this happen again.
 
 SOCRATES:
 No, my wife. I'll answer for that. It won't happen again. You won't be
 troubled by anything.
 
 (Enter Disciples)
 
 Be welcome, my dear disciples, my friends.
 
 CRITO: (at the head of Socrates' Disciples)
 You sees us as alarmed at your fate as your wife, Xantippe. We have
 obtained from the judges, permission to see you. Just heaven! Must we
 see Socrates burdened with chains? Allow us to kiss these irons that
 honor you and are the shame of Athens. Is it possible that Anitus and
 his accomplices have been able to put you in this condition?
 
 SOCRATES:
 My dear friends, let's not think of these trivia and let's continue
 the discussion we were having yesterday about the immortality of the
 soul. It seems to me we were saying that nothing is more probable than
 that idea. Indeed, matter changes and never perishes; why should the
 soul perish? Could it be made so that we, being elevated to
 consciousness of a God through the veil of the mortal body, would
 cease to know Him when the veil falls. No. Since we think, we will
 think forever; thought is the being of man. That being will appear
 before a just God who rewards virtue, who punishes crime and who
 excuses weakness.
 
 XANTIPPE:
 That's well said: I didn't understand any of it. To always think
 because one has thought! Does one always wipe one's nose because one
 has wiped it before. But who's this villainous man with his bowl?
 
 JAILOR OR SERVANT OF THE ELEVEN: (bringing the cup of Hemlock)
 Here! Socrates: this is what the Senate sends you.
 
 XANTIPPE:
 What! Cursed poisoner of the republic, you come here to kill my
 husband in my presence! I will disfigure you, monster!
 
 SOCRATES:
 My dear friend, I ask your pardon for my wife. She's always scolded
 her husband. She's treating you the same way. I beg you to excuse this
 little excitement. Give it to me. (taking the bowl)
 
 ONE OF THE DISCIPLES:
 Let it be permitted for us to take this poison, divine Socrates. By
 what horrible injustice are you ravished from us? Why? The criminals
 have condemned the just. The fanatics have proscribed the wise man!
 You are going to die.
 
 SOCRATES:
 No, I am going to live. Here's the brew of immortality. It's not the
 perishable body that you loved, that instructed you, it's my soul
 alone that lived with you. And it will love you forever. (wants to
 drink)
 
 SERVANT OF THE ELEVEN:
 First, I must remove your chains. That's the rule.
 
 SOCRATES:
 If it's the rule, remove them. (he scratches his leg a bit)
 
 ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES:
 What! You are smiling?
 
 SOCRATES:
 I am smiling. Reflecting that pleasure comes from pain. It's in this
 manner that Eternal Happiness will be born from the miseries of life.
 (Socrates drinks)
 
 CRITO:
 Alas, what have you done?
 
 XANTIPPE:
 Alas, it's for I don't know how many ridiculous speeches of this sort
 that they are making this poor man die. Truly, my husband, you break
 my heart and I will strangle all the judges with my own hands. I
 scolded you, but I loved you: and these are the polite folk who've
 poisoned you. Ah! ah! My dear husband, ah!
 
 SOCRATES:
 Calm yourself, my good Xantippe. Don't cry any more my friends. It
 doesn't become disciples of Socrates to shed tears.
 
 CRITO:
 And can one not pour them out after this frightful sentence, after
 this judicial poisoning ordered by perverse ignorance, who've bought
 with fifty thousand drachmas the right to murder their fellow citizens
 with impunity?
 
 SOCRATES:
 That's the way they often treat the worshippers of a single God, and
 the enemies of superstition.
 
 CRITO:
 Alas! Must you be one of those victims?
 
 SOCRATES:
 It's beautiful to be the victim of Divinity. I am dying satisfied.
 It's true I would have liked to join to the consolation of seeing you
 that of Sophronine and Aglaea as well. I am astonished not to see
 them. They would have rendered my last moments even sweeter than they
 are.
 
 CRITO:
 Alas, they are unaware that you have consummated the iniquity of your
 judges. They are speaking to the people. They are encouraging the
 magistrates who took your part. Aglaea is revealing the crime of
 Anitus. His shame is going to be public. Aglaea and Sophronine perhaps
 would have saved your life. Ah! Dear Socrates, why did you hurry your
 last moments.
 
 AGLAEA: (entering with Sophronine)
 Divine Socrates, fear nothing. Xantippe console yourself. Worthy
 disciples don't weep.
 
 SOPHRONINE:
 Your enemies are confounded; all the people are coming to your
 defense.
 
 AGLAEA:
 We've spoken out. We've revealed the jealousy and intrigue of the
 impious Anitus. It was up to me to demand justice for his crime since
 I was the cause of it.
 
 SOPHRONINE:
 Anitus escaped by flight before the fury of the people. They are
 pursuing him and his accomplices. They are giving solemn thanks to the
 judges who opined in your favor. The people are at the gate of the
 prison, waiting for you to appear, to escort you home in triumph. All
 the judges have recanted.
 
 XANTIPPE:
 Alas, such pains wasted.
 
 ONE OF THE DISCIPLES:
 O heaven! O Socrates! Why did you obey?
 
 AGLAEA:
 Live, dear Socrates, benefactor of your country, model of men. Live
 for the happiness of the world.
 
 CRITO:
 Virtuous couple, worthy friends, there's no longer time.
 
 XANTIPPE:
 You are too late.
 
 AGLAEA:
 What? There's no time? Just heaven!
 
 SOPHRONINE:
 What! Socrates has already drunk the poisoned cup?
 
 SOCRATES:
 Loveable Aglaea, tender Sophronine, the law ordained that I take the
 poison. I've obeyed the law, all unjust that it is--because it
 oppressed only me. If this injustice were directed toward another I
 would have fought it. I am going to die, but the example of friendship
 and greatness of soul that you are giving to the world will never
 perish. Your virtue prevails over the crime of those who accused me. I
 bless what they call my misfortune. It has given birth to the strength
 of your beautiful soul. My dear Xantippe, be happy and think that to
 be so one must subdue one's temper. My beloved disciples harken always
 to the voice of philosophy which scorns persecutors and which takes
 pity on human weakness. And you, my daughter, Aglaea, my son,
 Sophronine, be always that way yourselves.
 
 AGLAEA:
 How we are to be pitied not to be able to die for you!
 
 SOCRATES:
 Your life is precious, mine is useless, Receive my tender and last
 farewells. The doors of eternity are opening for me.
 
 XANTIPPE:
 Come to think of it, he was a great man. Ah, I am going to rouse the
 nation and eat Anitus' heart!
 
 SOPHRONINE:
 We could raise temples to Socrates as a man deserving of it.
 
 CRITO:
 At least may his wisdom teach men that it is to God alone that we owe
 temples.
