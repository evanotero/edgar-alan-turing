 Biographical Introduction
 
 
 The material facts in Hume's life are to be found in the autobiography
 which he prefixed to his _History of England_. _My Own Life_, as he
 calls it, is but a brief exposition, but it is sufficient for its
 purpose, and the longer biographies of him do little more than amplify
 the information which he gives us himself. The Humes, it appears, were a
 remote branch of the family of Lord Hume of Douglas. Hume's father was
 Joseph Hume, of Ninewells, a minor Scotch laird, who died when his son
 was an infant. David Hume was born at Edinburgh on April 26th, 1711,
 during a visit of his parents to the Scotch capital. Hume tells us that
 his father passed for a man of parts, and that his mother, who herself
 came of good Scottish family, "was a woman of singular merit; though
 young and handsome, she devoted herself entirely to the rearing and
 educating of her children." At school Hume won no special distinction.
 He matriculated in the class of Greek at the Edinburgh University when
 he was twelve years old, and, he says "passed through the ordinary
 course of education with success"; but "our college education in
 Scotland," he remarks in one of his works, "extending little further
 than the languages, ends commonly when we are about fourteen or fifteen
 years of age." During his youth, Mrs. Hume does not appear to have
 maintained any too flattering opinion of her son's abilities; she
 considered him a good-natured but "uncommon weak-minded" creature.
 Possibly her judgment underwent a change in course of time, since she
 lived to see the beginnings of his literary fame; but his worldly
 success was long in the making, and he was a middle-aged man before his
 meagre fortune was converted into anything like a decent maintenance.
 
 It may have been Hume's apparent vacillation in choosing a career that
 made this "shrewd Scots wife" hold her son in such small esteem. At
 first the family tried to launch him into the profession of the law, but
 "while they fancied I was poring over Voet and Vinnius, Cicero and
 Virgil were the authors I was secretly devouring." For six years Hume
 remained at Ninewells and then made "a feeble trial for entering on a
 more active scene of life." Commerce, this time, was the chosen
 instrument, but the result was not more successful. "In 1734 I went to
 Bristol with some recommendations to eminent merchants, but in a few
 months found that scene totally unsuitable for me." At length--in the
 middle of 1736 when Hume was twenty-three years of age and without any
 profession or means of earning a livelihood--he went over to France. He
 settled first at Rheims, and afterwards at La Fleche in Anjou, and
 "there I laid that plan of life which I have steadily and successfully
 pursued. I resolved to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency
 of fortune, to maintain unimpaired my independency, and to regard every
 object as contemptible except the improvement of my talents in
 literature." At La Fleche Hume lived in frequent intercourse with the
 Jesuits at the famous college in which Descartes was educated, and he
 composed his first book, the _Treatise of Human Nature_. According to
 himself "it fell dead-born from the press, without reaching such
 distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots." But this work
 which was planned before the author was twenty-one and written before he
 was twenty-five, in the opinion of Professor Huxley, is probably the
 most remarkable philosophical work, both intrinsically and in its
 effects upon the course of thought, that has ever been written. Three
 years later Hume published anonymously, at Edinburgh, the first volume
 of _Essays, Moral and Political_, which was followed in 1742 by the
 second volume. The _Essays_, he says, were favourably received and soon
 made me entirely forget my former disappointments.
 
 In 1745 Hume became tutor to a young nobleman, the Marquis of Annandale,
 who was mentally affected, but he did not endure the engagement for
 long. Next year General St. Clair, who had been appointed to command an
 expedition in the War of the Pragmatic Sanction, invited him to be his
 secretary, an office to which that of judge-advocate was afterwards
 added. The expedition was a failure, but General St. Clair, who was
 afterwards entrusted with embassies to Turin and Vienna, and upon whom
 Hume seems to have created a favourable impression, insisted that he
 should accompany him in the same capacity as secretary; he further made
 him one of his _aides-de-camp_. Thus Hume had to attire his portly
 figure in a "scarlet military uniform," and Lord Charlemont who met him
 in Turin says that he wore his uniform "like a grocer of the
 train-bands." At Vienna the Empress-Dowager excused him on ceremonial
 occasions from walking backwards, a concession which was much
 appreciated by "my companions who were desperately afraid of my falling
 on them and crushing them." Hume returned to London in 1749. "These
 years," he says, "were almost the only interruptions my studies have
 received during the course of my life. I passed them agreeably and in
 good company, and my appointments, with my frugality, had made me reach
 a fortune which I called independent, though most of my friends were
 inclined to smile when I said so; in short, I was now master of near a
 thousand pounds."
 
 While Hume was away with General St. Clair his _Inquiry Concerning Human
 Understanding_ was published, but it was not more successful than the
 original _Treatise_ of a portion of which it was a recasting. A new
 edition of _Moral and Political Essays_ met with no better fate, but
 these disappointments, he says, "made little or no impression" on him.
 In 1749 Hume returned to Ninewells, and lived for a while with his
 brothers. Afterwards he took a flat of his own at Edinburgh, with his
 sister to keep house for him. At this period the _Political Discourses_
 and the _Inquiry concerning the Principles of Morals_ were published. Of
 the _Inquiry_ Hume held the opinion, an opinion, however, which was not
 shared by the critics, that "it is of all my writings--historical,
 philosophical, or literary incomparably the best." Slowly and surely his
 publications were growing in reputation. In 1752 the Faculty of
 Advocates elected Hume their librarian, an office which was valuable to
 him, not so much for the emolument as for the extensive library which
 enabled him to pursue the historical studies upon which he had for some
 time been engaged. For the next nine years he was occupied with his
 _History of England_. The first volume was published in 1754, and the
 second volume, which met with a better reception than the first, in
 1756. Only forty-five copies of the first volume were sold in a
 twelvemonth; but the subsequent volumes made rapid headway, and raised a
 great clamour, for in the words of Macaulay, Hume's historical picture,
 though drawn by a master hand, has all the lights Tory and all the
 shades Whig. In 1757 one of his most remarkable works, the _Natural
 History of Religion_, appeared. The book was attacked--not wholly to
 Hume's dissatisfaction, for he appreciated fame as well as
 success--"with all the illiberal petulance, arrogance, and scurrility
 which distinguish the Warburtonian school."
 
 Hume remained in Edinburgh superintending the publication of the
 _History_ until 1763 when Lord Hertford, who had been appointed
 ambassador to France, offered him office in the embassy, with the
 promise of the secretaryship later on. The appointment was the more
 honourable, inasmuch as Hume was not personally acquainted with Lord
 Hertford, who had a reputation for virtue and piety, whilst Hume's views
 about religion had rendered him one of the best abused men of his time.
 In France Hume's reputation stood higher than it was in England; several
 of his works had been translated into French; and he had corresponded
 with Montesquieu, Helvetius and Rousseau. Thus he was received in French
 society with every mark of distinction. In a letter to Adam Smith in
 October 1763, he wrote: "I have been three days at Paris and two at
 Fontainebleau, and have everywhere met with the most extraordinary
 honours, which the most exorbitant vanity could wish or desire." Great
 nobles feted him, and great ladies struggled for the presence of the
 "_gros_ David" at their receptions or in their boxes at the theatre. "At
 the opera his broad unmeaning face was usually to be seen _entre deux
 joli minois_," says Lord Charlemont. Hume took his honours with
 satisfaction, but with becoming good sense, and he did not allow these
 flatteries to turn his head.
 
 In 1767 Hume was back in London, and for the next two years held office
 as Under-Secretary of State. It is not necessary to dwell upon this
 period of his life, or to go into the details of his quarrel with
 Rousseau. In 1769 he returned to Edinburgh "very opulent" in the
 possession of L1,000 a year, and determined to take the rest of his life
 easily and pleasantly. He built himself a house in Edinburgh, and for
 the next six years it was the centre of the most accomplished society in
 the city. In 1755 Hume's health began to fail, and he knew that his
 illness must be fatal. Thus he made his will and wrote _My Own Life_,
 which ends simply in these words:
 
      "I now reckon upon a speedy dissolution. I have suffered very
      little pain from my disorder; and what is more strange have,
      notwithstanding the great decline of my person, never suffered a
      moment's abatement of spirits; insomuch that were I to name the
      period of my life which I should most choose to pass over again, I
      might be tempted to point to this later period. I possess the same
      ardour as ever in study, and the same gaiety in company; I
      consider, besides, that a man of sixty-five, by dying, cuts off
      only a few years of infirmities; and though I see many symptoms of
      my literary reputation's breaking out at last with additional
      lustre, I know that I could have but few years to enjoy it. It is
      difficult to be more detached from life than I am at present.
 
      "To conclude historically with my own character, I am, or rather
      was (for that is the style I must now use in speaking of myself); I
      was, I say, a man of mild dispositions, of command of temper, of
      an open, social, and cheerful humour, capable of attachment, but
      little susceptible of enmity, and of great moderation in all my
      passions. Even my love of literary fame, my ruling passion, never
      soured my temper, notwithstanding my frequent disappointments. My
      company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as
      to the studious and literary; and as I took a particular pleasure
      in the company of modest women, I had no reason to be displeased
      with the reception I met with from them. In a word, though most men
      any wise eminent, have found reason to complain of calumny, I never
      was touched or even attacked by her baleful tooth; and though I
      wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious
      factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted
      fury. My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one
      circumstance of my character and conduct; not but that the zealots,
      we may well suppose, would have been glad to invent and propagate
      any story to my disadvantage, but they could never find any which
      they thought would wear the face of probability. I cannot say there
      is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself, but I hope
      it is not a misplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which is
      easily cleared and ascertained."
 
 Hume died in Edinburgh on August 25th, 1776, and a few days later was
 buried in a spot selected by himself on the Carlton Hill.

 OF THE DELICACY OF TASTE AND PASSION
 
 
 Some people are subject to a certain _delicacy_ of _passion_, which
 makes them extremely sensible to all the accidents of life, and gives
 them a lively joy upon every prosperous event, as well as a piercing
 grief when they meet with misfortune and adversity. Favours and good
 offices easily engage their friendship, while the smallest injury
 provokes their resentment. Any honour or mark of distinction elevates
 them above measure, but they are sensibly touched with contempt. People
 of this character have, no doubt, more lively enjoyments, as well as
 more pungent sorrows, than men of cool and sedate tempers. But, I
 believe, when every thing is balanced, there is no one who would not
 rather be of the latter character, were he entirely master of his own
 disposition. Good or ill fortune is very little at our disposal; and
 when a person that has this sensibility of temper meets with any
 misfortune, his sorrow or resentment takes entire possession of him, and
 deprives him of all relish in the common occurrences of life, the right
 enjoyment of which forms the chief part of our happiness. Great
 pleasures are much less frequent than great pains, so that a sensible
 temper must meet with, fewer trials in the former way than in the
 latter. Not to mention, that men of such lively passions are apt to be
 transported beyond all bounds of prudence and discretion, and to take
 false steps in the conduct of life, which are often irretrievable.
 
 There is a _delicacy_ of _taste_ observable in some men, which very much
 resembles this _delicacy_ of _passion_, and produces the same
 sensibility to beauty and deformity of every kind, as that does to
 prosperity and adversity, obligations and injuries. When you present a
 poem or a picture to a man possessed of this talent, the delicacy of his
 feeling makes him be sensibly touched with every part of it; nor are the
 masterly strokes perceived with more exquisite relish and satisfaction,
 than the negligences or absurdities with disgust and uneasiness. A
 polite and judicious conversation affords him the highest entertainment;
 rudeness or impertinence is as great punishment to him. In short,
 delicacy of taste has the same effect as delicacy of passion. It
 enlarges the sphere both of our happiness and misery, and makes us
 sensible to pains as well as pleasures which escape the rest of mankind.
 
 I believe, however, every one will agree with me, that notwithstanding
 this resemblance, delicacy of taste is as much to be desired and
 cultivated, as delicacy of passion is to be lamented, and to be
 remedied, if possible. The good or ill accidents of life are very little
 at our disposal; but we are pretty much masters what books we shall
 read, what diversions we shall partake of, and what company we shall
 keep. Philosophers have endeavoured to render happiness entirely
 independent of every thing external. The degree of perfection is
 impossible to be _attained_; but every wise man will endeavour to place
 his happiness on such objects chiefly as depend upon himself; and _that_
 is not to be _attained_ so much by any other means as by this delicacy
 of sentiment. When a man is possessed of that talent, he is more happy
 by what pleases his taste, than by what gratifies his appetites, and
 receives more enjoyment from a poem, or a piece of reasoning, than the
 most expensive luxury can afford.
 
 Whatever connection there may be originally between these two species of
 delicacy, I am persuaded that nothing is so proper to cure us of this
 delicacy of passion, as the cultivating of that higher and more refined
 taste, which enables us to judge of the characters of men, of the
 compositions of genius, and of the productions of the nobler arts. A
 greater or less relish for those obvious beauties which strike the
 senses, depends entirely upon the greater or less sensibility of the
 temper; but with regard to the sciences and liberal arts, a fine taste
 is, in some measure, the same with strong sense, or at least depends so
 much upon it that they are inseparable. In order to judge aright of a
 composition of genius, there are so many views to be taken in, so many
 circumstances to be compared, and such a knowledge of human nature
 requisite, that no man, who is not possessed of the soundest judgment,
 will ever make a tolerable critic in such performances. And this is a
 new reason for cultivating a relish in the liberal arts. Our judgment
 will strengthen by this exercise. We shall form juster notions of life.
 Many things which please or afflict others, will appear to us too
 frivolous to engage our attention; and we shall lose by degrees that
 sensibility and delicacy of passion which is so incommodious.
 
 But perhaps I have gone too far, in saying that a cultivated taste for
 the polite arts extinguishes the passions, and renders us indifferent to
 those objects which are so fondly pursued by the rest of mankind. On
 further reflection, I find, that it rather improves our sensibility for
 all the tender and agreeable passions; at the same time that it renders
 the mind incapable of the rougher and more boisterous emotions.
 
      Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes,
      Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros.
 
 For this, I think, there may be assigned two very natural reasons. In
 the _first_ place, nothing is so improving to the temper as the study of
 the beauties either of poetry, eloquence, music, or painting. They give
 a certain elegance of sentiment to which the rest of mankind are
 strangers. The emotions which they excite are soft and tender. They draw
 off the mind from the hurry of business and interest; cherish
 reflection; dispose to tranquillity; and produce an agreeable
 melancholy, which, of all dispositions of the mind, is the best suited
 to love and friendship.
 
 In the _second_ place, a delicacy of taste is favourable to love and
 friendship, by confining our choice to few people, and making us
 indifferent to the company and conversation of the greater part of men.
 You will seldom find that mere men of the world, whatever strong sense
 they may be endowed with, are very nice in distinguishing characters, or
 in marking those insensible differences and gradations, which make one
 man preferable to another. Any one that has competent sense is
 sufficient for their entertainment. They talk to him of their pleasures
 and affairs, with the same frankness that they would to another; and
 finding many who are fit to supply his place, they never feel any
 vacancy or want in his absence. But to make use of the allusion of a
 celebrated French[1] author, the judgment may be compared to a clock or
 watch, where the most ordinary machine is sufficient to tell the hours;
 but the most elaborate alone can point out the minutes and seconds, and
 distinguish the smallest differences of time. One that has well digested
 his knowledge both of books and men, has little enjoyment but in the
 company of a few select companions. He feels too sensibly, how much all
 the rest of mankind fall short of the notions which he has entertained.
 And, his affections being thus confined within a narrow circle, no
 wonder he carries them further than if they were more general and
 undistinguished. The gaiety and frolic of a bottle companion improves
 with him into a solid friendship; and the ardours of a youthful appetite
 become an elegant passion.

 OF THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS
 
 
 Nothing is more apt to surprise a foreigner, than the extreme liberty
 which we enjoy in this country of communicating whatever we please to
 the public and of openly censuring every measure entered into by the
 king or his ministers. If the administration resolve upon war, it is
 affirmed, that, either wilfully or ignorantly, they mistake the
 interests of the nation; and that peace, in the present situation of
 affairs, is infinitely preferable. If the passion of the ministers lie
 towards peace, our political writers breathe nothing but war and
 devastation, and represent the specific conduct of the government as
 mean and pusillanimous. As this liberty is not indulged in any other
 government, either republican or monarchical; in Holland and Venice,
 more than in France or Spain; it may very naturally give occasion to the
 question, _How it happens that Great Britain alone enjoys this peculiar
 privilege?_
 
 The reason why the laws indulge us in such a liberty, seems to be
 derived from our mixed form of government, which is neither wholly
 monarchical, nor wholly republican. It will be found, if I mistake not,
 a true observation in politics, that the two extremes in government,
 liberty and slavery, commonly approach nearest to each other; and that,
 as you depart from the extremes, and mix a little of monarchy with
 liberty, the government becomes always the more free; and, on the other
 hand, when you mix a little of liberty with monarchy, the yoke becomes
 always the more grievous and intolerable. In a government, such as that
 of France, which is absolute, and where law, custom, and religion
 concur, all of them, to make the people fully satisfied with their
 condition, the monarch cannot entertain any _jealousy_ against his
 subjects, and therefore is apt to indulge them in great _liberties_,
 both of speech and action. In a government altogether republican, such
 as that of Holland, where there is no magistrate so eminent as to give
 _jealousy_ to the state, there is no danger in intrusting the
 magistrates with large discretionary powers; and though many advantages
 result from such powers, in preserving peace and order, yet they lay a
 considerable restraint on men's actions, and make every private citizen
 pay a great respect to the government. Thus it seems evident, that the
 two extremes of absolute monarchy and of a republic, approach near to
 each other in some material circumstances. In the _first_, the
 magistrate has no jealousy of the people; in the _second_, the people
 have none of the magistrate: which want of jealousy begets a mutual
 confidence and trust in both cases, and produces a species of liberty in
 monarchies, and of arbitrary power in republics.
 
 To justify the other part of the foregoing observation, that, in every
 government, the means are most wide of each other, and that the mixtures
 of monarchy and liberty render the yoke either more grievous; I must
 take notice of a remark in Tacitus with regard to the Romans under the
 Emperors, that they neither could bear total slavery nor total liberty,
 _Nec totam servitutem, nec totam libertatem pati possunt._ This remark a
 celebrated poet has translated and applied to the English, in his lively
 description of Queen Elizabeth's policy and government.
 
      Et fit aimer son joug a l'Anglois indompte,
      Qui ne peut ni servir, ni vivre en liberte.
                                         HENRIADE, liv. i.
 
 According to these remarks, we are to consider the Roman government
 under the Emperors as a mixture of despotism and liberty, where the
 despotism prevailed; and the English government as a mixture of the same
 kind, where the liberty predominates. The consequences are conformable
 to the foregoing observation, and such as may be expected from those
 mixed forms of government, which beget a mutual watchfulness and
 jealousy. The Roman emperors were, many of them, the most frightful
 tyrants that ever disgraced human nature; and it is evident, that their
 cruelty was chiefly excited by their _jealousy_, and by their observing
 that all the great men of Rome bore with impatience the dominion of a
 family, which, but a little before, was nowise superior to their own. On
 the other hand, as the republican part of the government prevails in
 England, though with a great mixture of monarchy, it is obliged, for its
 own preservation, to maintain a watchful _jealousy_ over the
 magistrates, to remove all discretionary powers, and to secure every
 one's life and fortune by general and inflexible laws. No action must be
 deemed a crime but what the law has plainly determined to be such: no
 crime must be imputed to a man but from a legal proof before his judges;
 and even these judges must be his fellow-subjects, who are obliged, by
 their own interest, to have a watchful eye over the encroachments and
 violence of the ministers. From these causes it proceeds, that there is
 as much liberty, and even perhaps licentiousness, in Great Britain, as
 there were formerly slavery and tyranny in Rome.
 
 These principles account for the great liberty of the press in these
 kingdoms, beyond what is indulged in any other government. It is
 apprehended that arbitrary power would steal in upon us, were we not
 careful to prevent its progress, and were there not any easy method of
 conveying the alarm from one end of the kingdom to the other. The spirit
 of the people must frequently be roused, in order to curb the ambition
 of the court; and the dread of rousing this spirit must be employed to
 prevent that ambition. Nothing so effectual to this purpose as the
 liberty of the press; by which all the learning, wit, and genius of the
 nation, may be employed on the side of freedom, and every one be
 animated to its defence. As long, therefore, as the republican part of
 our government can maintain itself against the monarchical, it will
 naturally be careful to keep the press open, as of importance to its own
 preservation.[1]
 
 It must however be allowed, that the unbounded liberty of the press,
 though it be difficult, perhaps impossible, to propose a suitable remedy
 for it, is one of the evils attending those mixed forms of government.
 
 
 [1] Since, therefore, the liberty of the press is so essential to the
 support of our mixed government, this sufficiently decides the second
 question, _Whether this liberty be advantageous or prejudicial,_ there
 being nothing of greater importance in every state than the preservation
 of the ancient government, especially if it be a free one. But I would
 fain go a step further, and assert, that such a liberty is attended with
 so few inconveniences, that it may be claimed as the common right of
 mankind, and ought to be indulged them almost in every government except
 the ecclesiastical, to which, indeed, it would be fatal. We need not
 dread from this liberty any such ill consequences as followed from the
 harangues of the popular demagogues of Athens and Tribunes of Rome. A
 man reads a book or pamphlet alone and coolly. There is none present
 from whom he can catch the passion by contagion. He is not hurried away
 by the force and energy of action. And should he be wrought up to never
 so seditious a humour, there is no violent resolution presented to him
 by which he can immediately vent his passion. The liberty of the press,
 therefore, however abused, can scarce ever excite popular tumults or
 rebellion. And as to those murmurs or secret discontents it may
 occasion, it is better they should get vent in words, that they may come
 to the knowledge of the magistrate before it be too late, in order to
 his providing a remedy against them. Mankind, it is true, have always a
 greater propension to believe what is said to the disadvantage of their
 governors than the contrary; but this inclination is inseparable from
 them whether they have liberty or not. A whisper may fly as quick, and
 be as pernicious as a pamphlet. Nay, it will be more pernicious, where
 men are not accustomed to think freely, or distinguish betwixt truth and
 falsehood.
 
 It has also been found, as the experience of mankind increases, that the
 _people_ are no such dangerous monsters as they have been represented,
 and that it is in every respect better to guide them like rational
 creatures than to lead or drive them like brute beasts. Before the
 United Provinces set the example, toleration was deemed incompatible
 with good government; and it was thought impossible that a number of
 religious sects could live together in harmony and peace, and have all
 of them an equal affection to their common country and to each other.
 _England_ has set a like example of civil liberty; and though this
 liberty seems to occasion some small ferment at present, it has not as
 yet produced any pernicious effects; and it is to be hoped that men,
 being every day more accustomed to the free discussion of public
 affairs, will improve in their judgment of them, and be with greater
 difficulty seduced by every idle rumour and popular clamour.
 
 It is a very comfortable reflection to the lovers of liberty, that this
 peculiar privilege of _Britain_ is of a kind that cannot easily be
 wrested from us, and must last as long as our government remains in any
 degree free and independent. It is seldom that liberty of any kind is
 lost all at once. Slavery has so frightful an aspect to men accustomed
 to freedom, that it must steal in upon them by degrees, and must
 disguise itself in a thousand shapes in order to be received. But if the
 liberty of the press ever be lost, it must be lost at once. The general
 laws against sedition and libelling are at present as strong as they
 possibly can be made. Nothing can impose a further restraint but either
 the clapping an imprimatur upon the press, or the giving very large
 discretionary powers to the court to punish whatever displeases them.
 But these concessions would be such a barefaced violation of liberty,
 that they will probably be the last efforts of a despotic government. We
 may conclude that the liberty of _Britain_ is gone for ever when these
 attempts shall succeed.
 
 
 
 
 THAT POLITICS MAY BE REDUCED TO A SCIENCE
 
 
 It is a question with several, whether there be any essential difference
 between one form of government and another? and, whether every form may
 not become good or bad, according as it is well or ill administered?[1]
 Were it once admitted, that all governments are alike, and that the only
 difference consists in the character and conduct of the governors, most
 political disputes would be at an end, and all _Zeal_ for one
 constitution above another must be esteemed mere bigotry and folly. But,
 though a friend to moderation, I cannot forbear condemning this
 sentiment, and should be sorry to think, that human affairs admit of no
 greater stability, than what they receive from the casual humours and
 characters of particular men.
 
 It is true, those who maintain that the goodness of all government
 consists in the goodness of the administration, may cite many particular
 instances in history, where the very same government, in different
 hands, has varied suddenly into the two opposite extremes of good and
 bad. Compare the French government under Henry III and under Henry IV.
 Oppression, levity, artifice, on the part of the rulers; faction,
 sedition, treachery, rebellion, disloyalty on the part of the subjects:
 these compose the character of the former miserable era. But when the
 patriot and heroic prince, who succeeded, was once firmly seated on the
 throne, the government, the people, every thing, seemed to be totally
 changed; and all from the difference of the temper and conduct of these
 two sovereigns.[2] Instances of this kind may be multiplied, almost
 without number, from ancient as well as modern history, foreign as well
 as domestic.
 
 But here it may be proper to make a distinction. All absolute
 governments must very much depend on the administration; and this is one
 of the great inconveniences attending that form of government. But a
 republican and free government would be an obvious absurdity, if the
 particular checks and controls, provided by the constitution had really
 no influence, and made it not the interest, even of bad men, to act for
 the public good. Such is the intention of these forms of government, and
 such is their real effect, where they are wisely constituted: as, on the
 other hand, they are the source of all disorder, and of the blackest
 crimes, where either skill or honesty has been wanting in their original
 frame and institution.
 
 So great is the force of laws, and of particular forms of government,
 and so little dependence have they on the humours and tempers of men,
 that consequences almost as general and certain may sometimes be deduced
 from them, as any which the mathematical sciences afford us.
 
 The constitution of the Roman republic gave the whole legislative power
 to the people, without allowing a negative voice either to the nobility
 or consuls. This unbounded power they possessed in a collective, not in
 a representative body. The consequences were: when the people, by
 success and conquest, had become very numerous, and had spread
 themselves to a great distance from the capital, the city tribes, though
 the most contemptible, carried almost every vote: they were, therefore,
 most cajoled by every one that affected popularity: they were supported
 in idleness by the general distribution of corn, and by particular
 bribes, which they received from almost every candidate: by this means,
 they became every day more licentious, and the Campus Martius was a
 perpetual scene of tumult and sedition: armed slaves were introduced
 among these rascally citizens, so that the whole government fell into
 anarchy; and the greatest happiness which the Romans could look for, was
 the despotic power of the Caesars. Such are the effects of democracy
 without a representative.
 
 A Nobility may possess the whole, or any part of the legislative power
 of a state, in two different ways. Either every nobleman shares the
 power as a part of the whole body, or the whole body enjoys the power as
 composed of parts, which have each a distinct power and authority. The
 Venetian aristocracy is an instance of the first kind of government; the
 Polish, of the second. In the Venetian government the whole body of
 nobility possesses the whole power, and no nobleman has any authority
 which he receives not from the whole. In the Polish government every
 nobleman, by means of his fiefs, has a distinct hereditary authority
 over his vassals, and the whole body has no authority but what it
 receives from the concurrence of its parts. The different operations and
 tendencies of these two species of government might be made apparent
 even _a priori_. A Venetian nobility is preferable to a Polish, let the
 humours and education of men be ever so much varied. A nobility, who
 possess their power in common, will preserve peace and order, both among
 themselves, and their subjects; and no member can have authority enough
 to control the laws for a moment. The nobles will preserve their
 authority over the people, but without any grievous tyranny, or any
 breach of private property; because such a tyrannical government
 promotes not the interests of the whole body, however it may that of
 some individuals. There will be a distinction of rank between the
 nobility and people, but this will be the only distinction in the state.
 The whole nobility will form one body, and the whole people another,
 without any of those private feuds and animosities, which spread ruin
 and desolation everywhere. It is easy to see the disadvantages of a
 Polish nobility in every one of these particulars.
 
 It is possible so to constitute a free government, as that a single
 person, call him a doge, prince, or king, shall possess a large share of
 power, and shall form a proper balance or counterpoise to the other
 parts of the legislature. This chief magistrate may be either _elective_
 or _hereditary_, and though the former institution may, to a superficial
 view, appear the most advantageous; yet a more accurate inspection will
 discover in it greater inconveniences than in the latter, and such as
 are founded on causes and principles eternal and immutable. The filling
 of the throne, in such a government, is a point of too great and too
 general interest, not to divide the whole people into factions, whence a
 civil war, the greatest of ills, may be apprehended, almost with
 certainty, upon every vacancy. The prince elected must be either a
 _Foreigner_ or a _Native_: the former will be ignorant of the people
 whom he is to govern; suspicious of his new subjects, and suspected by
 them; giving his confidence entirely to strangers, who will have no
 other care but of enriching themselves in the quickest manner, while
 their master's favour and authority are able to support them. A native
 will carry into the throne all his private animosities and friendships,
 and will never be viewed in his elevation without exciting the sentiment
 of envy in those who formerly considered him as their equal. Not to
 mention that a crown is too high a reward ever to be given to merit
 alone, and will always induce the candidates to employ force, or money,
 or intrigue, to procure the votes of the electors: so that such an
 election will give no better chance for superior merit in the prince,
 than if the state had trusted to birth alone for determining the
 sovereign.
 
 It may, therefore, be pronounced as an universal axiom in politics,
 _That an hereditary prince, a nobility without vassals, and a people
 voting by their representatives, form the best_ MONARCHY, ARISTOCRACY,
 _and_ DEMOCRACY. But in order to prove more fully, that politics admit
 of general truths, which are invariable by the humour or education
 either of subject or sovereign, it may not be amiss to observe some
 other principles of this science, which may seem to deserve that
 character.
 
 It may easily be observed, that though free governments have been
 commonly the most happy for those who partake of their freedom; yet are
 they the most ruinous and oppressive to their provinces: and this
 observation may, I believe, be fixed as a maxim of the kind we are here
 speaking of. When a monarch extends his dominions by conquest, he soon
 learns to consider his old and his new subjects as on the same footing;
 because, in reality, all his subjects are to him the same, except the
 few friends and favourites with whom he is personally acquainted. He
 does not, therefore, make any distinction between them in his _general_
 laws; and, at the same time, is careful to prevent all _particular_ acts
 of oppression on the one as well as the other. But a free state
 necessarily makes a great distinction, and must always do so till men
 learn to love their neighbours as well as themselves. The conquerors, in
 such a government, are all legislators, and will be sure to contrive
 matters, by restrictions on trade, and by taxes, so as to draw some
 private, as well as public advantage from their conquests. Provincial
 governors have also a better chance, in a republic, to escape with their
 plunder, by means of bribery or intrigue; and their fellow-citizens, who
 find their own state to be enriched by the spoils of the subject
 provinces, will be the more inclined to tolerate such abuses. Not to
 mention, that it is a necessary precaution in a free state to change the
 governors frequently, which obliges these temporary tyrants to be more
 expeditious and rapacious, that they may accumulate sufficient wealth
 before they give place to their successors. What cruel tyrants were the
 Romans over the world during the time of their commonwealth! It is true,
 they had laws to prevent oppression in their provincial magistrates; but
 Cicero informs us, that the Romans could not better consult the
 interests of the provinces than by repealing these very laws. For, in
 that case, says he, our magistrates, having entire impunity, would
 plunder no more than would satisfy their own rapaciousness; whereas, at
 present, they must also satisfy that of their judges, and of all the
 great men in Rome, of whose protection they stand in need. Who can read
 of the cruelties and oppressions of Verres without horror and
 astonishment? And who is not touched with indignation to hear, that,
 after Cicero had exhausted on that abandoned criminal all the thunders
 of his eloquence, and had prevailed so far as to get him condemned to
 the utmost extent of the laws, yet that cruel tyrant lived peaceably to
 old age, in opulence and ease, and, thirty years afterwards, was put
 into the proscription by Mark Antony, on account of his exorbitant
 wealth, where he fell with Cicero himself, and all the most virtuous men
 of Rome? After the dissolution of the commonwealth, the Roman yoke
 became easier upon the provinces, as Tacitus informs us; and it may be
 observed, that many of the worst emperors, Domitian, for instance, were
 careful to prevent all oppression on the provinces. In Tiberius's time,
 Gaul was esteemed richer than Italy itself: nor do I find, during the
 whole time of the Roman monarchy, that the empire became less rich or
 populous in any of its provinces; though indeed its valour and military
 discipline were always upon the decline. The oppression and tyranny of
 the Carthaginians over their subject states in Africa went so far, as we
 learn from Polybius, that, not content with exacting the half of all the
 produce of the land, which of itself was a very high rent, they also
 loaded them with many other taxes. If we pass from ancient to modern
 times, we shall still find the observation to hold. The provinces of
 absolute monarchies are always better treated than those of free states.
 Compare the _Pais conquis_ of France with Ireland, and you will be
 convinced of this truth; though this latter kingdom, being in a good
 measure peopled from England, possesses so many rights and privileges as
 should naturally make it challenge better treatment than that of a
 conquered province. Corsica is also an obvious instance to the same
 purpose.
 
 There is an observation of Machiavel, with regard to the conquests of
 Alexander the Great, which, I think, may be regarded as one of those
 eternal political truths, which no time nor accidents can vary. It may
 seem strange, says that politician, that such sudden conquests, as those
 of Alexander, should be possessed so peaceably by his successors, and
 that the Persians, during all the confusions and civil wars among the
 Greeks, never made the smallest effort towards the recovery of their
 former independent government. To satisfy us concerning the cause of
 this remarkable event, we may consider, that a monarch may govern his
 subjects in two different ways. He may either follow the maxims of the
 Eastern princes, and stretch his authority so far as to leave no
 distinction of rank among his subjects, but what proceeds immediately
 from himself; no advantages of birth; no hereditary honours and
 possessions; and, in a word, no credit among the people, except from his
 commission alone. Or a monarch may exert his power after a milder
 manner, like other European princes; and leave other sources of honour,
 beside his smile and favour; birth, titles, possessions, valour,
 integrity, knowledge, or great and fortunate achievements. In the former
 species of government, after a conquest, it is impossible ever to shake
 off the yoke; since no one possesses, among the people, so much personal
 credit and authority as to begin such an enterprise: whereas, in the
 latter, the least misfortune, or discord among the victors, will
 encourage the vanquished to take arms, who have leaders ready to prompt
 and conduct them in every undertaking.[3]
 
 Such is the reasoning of Machiavel, which seems solid and conclusive;
 though I wish he had not mixed falsehood with truth, in asserting that
 monarchies, governed according to Eastern policy, though more easily
 kept when once subdued, yet are the most difficult to subdue; since they
 cannot contain any powerful subject, whose discontent and faction may
 facilitate the enterprises of an enemy. For, besides, that such a
 tyrannical government enervates the courage of men, and renders them
 indifferent towards the fortunes of their sovereigns; besides this, I
 say, we find by experience, that even the temporary and delegated
 authority of the generals and magistrates, being always, in such
 governments, as absolute within its sphere as that of the prince
 himself, is able, with barbarians accustomed to a blind submission, to
 produce the most dangerous and fatal revolutions. So that in every
 respect, a gentle government is preferable, and gives the greatest
 security to the sovereign as well as to the subject.
 
 Legislators, therefore, ought not to trust the future government of a
 state entirely to chance, but ought to provide a system of laws to
 regulate the administration of public affairs to the latest posterity.
 Effects will always correspond to causes; and wise regulations, in any
 commonwealth, are the most valuable legacy that can be left to future
 ages. In the smallest court or office, the stated forms and methods by
 which business must be conducted, are found to be a considerable check
 on the natural depravity of mankind. Why should not the case be the same
 in public affairs? Can we ascribe the stability and wisdom of the
 Venetian government, through so many ages, to any thing but the form of
 government? And is it not easy to point out those defects in the
 original constitution, which produced the tumultuous governments of
 Athens and Rome, and ended at last in the ruin of these two famous
 republics? And so little dependence has this affair on the humours and
 education of particular men, that one part of the same republic may be
 wisely conducted, and another weakly, by the very same men, merely on
 account of the differences of the forms and institutions by which these
 parts are regulated. Historians inform us that this was actually the
 case with Genoa. For while the state was always full of sedition, and
 tumult, and disorder, the bank of St. George, which had become a
 considerable part of the people, was conducted, for several ages, with
 the utmost integrity and wisdom.
 
 The ages of greatest public spirit are not always most eminent for
 private virtue. Good laws may beget order and moderation in the
 government, where the manners and customs have instilled little humanity
 or justice into the tempers of men. The most illustrious period of the
 Roman history, considered in a political view, is that between the
 beginning of the first and end of the last Punic war; the due balance
 between the nobility and people being then fixed by the contests of the
 tribunes, and not being yet lost by the extent of conquests. Yet at this
 very time, the horrid practice of poisoning was so common, that, during
 part of the season, a _Praetor_ punished capitally for this crime above
 three thousand persons in a part of Italy; and found informations of
 this nature still multiplying upon him. There is a similar, or rather a
 worse instance, in the more early times of the commonwealth; so depraved
 in private life were that people, whom in their histories we so much
 admire. I doubt not but they were really more virtuous during the time
 of the two _Triumvirates_, when they were tearing their common country
 to pieces, and spreading slaughter and desolation over the face of the
 earth, merely for the choice of tyrants.
 
 Here, then, is a sufficient inducement to maintain, with the utmost
 zeal, in every free state, those forms and institutions by which liberty
 is secured, the public good consulted, and the avarice or ambition of
 particular men restrained and punished. Nothing does more honour to
 human nature, than to see it susceptible of so noble a passion; as
 nothing can be a greater indication of meanness of heart in any man than
 to see him destitute of it. A man who loves only himself, without regard
 to friendship and desert, merits the severest blame; and a man, who is
 only susceptible of friendship, without public spirit, or a regard to
 the community, is deficient in the most material part of virtue.
 
 But this is a subject which needs not be longer insisted on at present.
 There are enow of zealots on both sides, who kindle up the passions of
 their partisans, and, under pretence of public good, pursue the
 interests and ends of their particular faction. For my part, I shall
 always be more fond of promoting moderation than zeal; though perhaps
 the surest way of producing moderation in every party is to increase our
 zeal for the public. Let us therefore try, if it be possible, from the
 foregoing doctrine, to draw a lesson of moderation with regard to the
 parties into which our country is at present divided; at the same time,
 that we allow not this moderation to abate the industry and passion,
 with which every individual is bound to pursue the good of his country.
 
 Those who either attack or defend a minister in such a government as
 ours, where the utmost liberty is allowed, always carry matters to an
 extreme, and exaggerate his merit or demerit with regard to the public.
 His enemies are sure to charge him with the greatest enormities, both in
 domestic and foreign management; and there is no meanness or crime, of
 which, in their account, he is not capable. Unnecessary wars, scandalous
 treaties, profusion of public treasure, oppressive taxes, every kind of
 maladministration is ascribed to him. To aggravate the charge, his
 pernicious conduct, it is said, will extend its baneful influence even
 to posterity, by undermining the best constitution in the world, and
 disordering that wise system of laws, institutions, and customs, by
 which our ancestors, during so many centuries, have been so happily
 governed. He is not only a wicked minister in himself, but has removed
 every security provided against wicked ministers for the future.
 
 On the other hand, the partisans of the minister make his panegyric run
 as high as the accusation against him, and celebrate his wise, steady,
 and moderate conduct in every part of his administration. The honour and
 interest of the nation supported abroad, public credit maintained at
 home, persecution restrained, faction subdued; the merit of all these
 blessings is ascribed solely to the minister. At the same time, he
 crowns all his other merits by a religious care of the best constitution
 in the world, which he has preserved in all its parts, and has
 transmitted entire, to be the happiness and security of the latest
 posterity.
 
 When this accusation and panegyric are received by the partisans of each
 party, no wonder they beget an extraordinary ferment on both sides, and
 fill the nation with violent animosities. But I would fain persuade
 these party zealots, that there is a flat contradiction both in the
 accusation and panegyric, and that it were impossible for either of them
 to run so high, were it not for this contradiction. If our constitution
 be really _that noble fabric, the pride of Britain, the envy of our
 neighbours, raised by the labour of so many centuries, repaired at the
 expense of so many millions, and cemented by such a profusion of
 blood_;[4] I say, if our constitution does in any degree deserve these
 eulogies, it would never have suffered a wicked and weak minister to
 govern triumphantly for a course of twenty years, when opposed by the
 greatest geniuses in the nation, who exercised the utmost liberty of
 tongue and pen, in parliament, and in their frequent appeals to the
 people. But, if the minister be wicked and weak, to the degree so
 strenuously insisted on, the constitution must be faulty in its original
 principles, and he cannot consistently be charged with undermining the
 best form of government in the world. A constitution is only so far
 good, as it provides a remedy against maladministration; and if the
 British, when in its greatest vigour, and repaired by two such
 remarkable events as the _Revolution_ and _Accession_, by which our
 ancient royal family was sacrificed to it; if our constitution, I say,
 with so great advantages, does not, in fact, provide any such remedy, we
 are rather beholden to any minister who undermines it, and affords us an
 opportunity of erecting a better in its place.
 
 I would employ the same topics to moderate the zeal of those who defend
 the minister. _Is our constitution so excellent?_ Then a change of
 ministry can be no such dreadful event; since it is essential to such a
 constitution, in every ministry, both to preserve itself from violation,
 and to prevent all enormities in the administration. _Is our
 constitution very bad?_ Then so extraordinary a jealousy and
 apprehension, on account of changes, is ill placed; and a man should no
 more be anxious in this case, than a husband, who had married a woman
 from the stews, should be watchful to prevent her infidelity. Public
 affairs, in such a government, must necessarily go to confusion, by
 whatever hands they are conducted; and the zeal of _patriots_ is in that
 case much less requisite than the patience and submission of
 _philosophers_. The virtue and good intention of Cato and Brutus are
 highly laudable; but to what purpose did their zeal serve? Only to
 hasten the fatal period of the Roman government, and render its
 convulsions and dying agonies more violent and painful.
 
 I would not be understood to mean, that public affairs deserve no care
 and attention at all. Would men be moderate and consistent, their claims
 might be admitted; at least might be examined. The _country party_ might
 still assert, that our constitution, though excellent, will admit of
 maladministration to a certain degree; and therefore, if the minister be
 bad, it is proper to oppose him with a _suitable_ degree of zeal. And,
 on the other hand, the _court party_ may be allowed, upon the
 supposition that the minister were good, to defend, and with some zeal
 too, his administration. I would only persuade men not to contend, as if
 they were fighting _pro aris et focis_, and change a good constitution
 into a bad one, by the violence of their factions.
 
 I have not here considered any thing that is personal in the present
 controversy. In the best civil constitutions, where every man is
 restrained by the most rigid laws, it is easy to discover either the
 good or bad intentions of a minister, and to judge whether his personal
 character deserve love or hatred. But such questions are of little
 importance to the public, and lay those who employ their pens upon
 them, under a just suspicion either of malevolence or of flattery.[5]

 [3] I have taken it for granted, according to the supposition of
 Machiavel, that the ancient Persians had no nobility; though there is
 reason to suspect, that the Florentine secretary, who seems to have been
 better acquainted with the Roman than the Greek authors, was mistaken in
 this particular. The more ancient Persians, whose manners are described
 by Xenophon, were a free people, and had nobility. Their [Greek:
 omotimoi] were preserved even after the extending of their conquests and
 the consequent change of their government. Arrian mentions them in
 Darius's time, _De exped. Alex._ lib. ii. Historians also speak often of
 the persons in command as men of family. Tygranes, who was general of
 the Medes under Xerxes, was of the race of Achmaenes, Heriod. lib. vii.
 cap. 62. Artachaeus, who directed the cutting of the canal about Mount
 Athos, was of the same family. Id. cap. 117. Megabyzus was one of the
 seven eminent Persians who conspired against the Magi. His son, Zopyrus,
 was in the highest command under Darius, and delivered Babylon to him.
 His grandson, Megabyzus, commanded the army defeated at Marathon. His
 great-grandson, Zopyrus, was also eminent, and was banished Persia.
 Heriod. lib. iii. Thuc. lib. i. Rosaces, who commanded an army in Egypt
 under Artaxerxes, was also descended from one of the seven conspirators,
 Diod. Sic. lib. xvi. Agesilaus, in Xenophon. Hist. Graec. lib. iv. being
 desirous of making a marriage betwixt king Cotys his ally, and the
 daughter of Spithridates, a Persian of rank, who had deserted to him,
 first asks Cotys what family Spithridates is of. One of the most
 considerable in Persia, says Cotys. Ariaeus, when offered the sovereignty
 by Clearchus and the ten thousand Greeks, refused it as of too low a
 rank, and said, that so many eminent Persians would never endure his
 rule. _Id. de exped._ lib. ii. Some of the families descended from the
 seven Persians above mentioned remained during Alexander's successors;
 and Mithridates, in Antiochus's time, is said by Polybius to be
 descended from one of them, lib. v. cap. 43. Artabazus was esteemed as
 Arrian says, [Greek: en tois prootois Persoon], lib. iii. And when
 Alexander married in one day 80 of his captains to Persian women, his
 intention plainly was to ally the Macedonians with the most eminent
 Persian families. Id. lib. vii. Diodorus Siculus says, they were of the
 most noble birth in Persia, lib. xvii. The government of Persia was
 despotic, and conducted in many respects after the Eastern manner, but
 was not carried so far as to extirpate all nobility, and confound all
 ranks and orders. It left men who were still great, by themselves and
 their family, independent of their office and commission. And the reason
 why the Macedonians kept so easily dominion over them, was owing to
 other causes easy to be found in the historians, though it must be owned
 that Machiavel's reasoning is, in itself, just, however doubtful its
 application to the present case.
 
 [4] Dissertation on Parties, Letter X.
 
 [5] _What our author's opinion was of the famous minister here pointed
 at, may be learned from that Essay, printed in the former edition, under
 the title of_ 'A Character of Sir Robert Walpole.' _It was as
 follows_:--There never was a man whose actions and character have been
 more earnestly and openly canvassed than those of the present minister,
 who, having governed a learned and free nation for so long a time,
 amidst such mighty opposition, may make a large library of what has been
 wrote for and against him, and is the subject of above half the paper
 that has been blotted in the nation within these twenty years. I wish,
 for the honour of our country, that any one character of him had been
 drawn with such _judgment_ and _impartiality_ as to have some credit
 with posterity, and to show that our liberty has, once at least,
 employed to good purpose. I am only afraid of failing in the former
 quality of judgment; but if it should be so, it is but one page more
 thrown away, after an hundred thousand upon the same subject, that have
 perished and become useless. In the mean time, I shall flatter myself
 with the pleasing imagination, that the following character will be
 adopted by future historians.
 
 Sir Robert Walpole, Prime Minister of _Great Britain_, is a man of
 ability, not a genius, good-natured, not virtuous; constant, not
 magnanimous; moderate, not equitable.[*] His virtues, in some instances,
 are free from the alloy of those vices which usually accompany such
 virtues; he is a generous friend, without being a bitter enemy. His
 vices, in other instances, are not compensated by those virtues which
 are nearly allied to them: his want of enterprise is not attended with
 frugality. The private character of the man is better than the public:
 his virtues more than his vices: his fortune greater than his fame. With
 many good qualities, he has incurred the public hatred: with good
 capacity, he has not escaped ridicule. He would have been esteemed more
 worthy of his high station, had he never possessed it; and is better
 qualified for the second than for the first place in any government; his
 ministry has been more advantageous to his family than to the public,
 better for this age than for posterity; and more pernicious by bad
 precedents than by real grievances. During his time trade has
 flourished, liberty declined, and learning gone to ruin. As I am a man,
 I love him; as I am a scholar, I hate him; as I am a _Briton_, I calmly
 wish his fall. And were I a member of either House, I would give my vote
 for removing him from St James's; but should be glad to see him retire
 to _Houghton-Hall_, to pass the remainder of his days in ease and
 pleasure.
 
 *Moderate in the exercise of power, not equitable in engrossing it.
 
 _The author is pleased to find, that after animosities are laid, and
 calumny has ceased, the whole nation almost have returned to the same
 moderate sentiments with regard to this great man, if they are not
 rather become more favourable to him, by a very natural transition, from
 one extreme to another. The author would not oppose these humane
 sentiments towards the dead; though he cannot forbear observing, that
 the not paying more of our public debts was, as hinted in this
 character, a great, and the only great, error in that long
 administration._
 
 
 
 
 
 
 OF THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT
 
 
 Nothing appears more surprising to those who consider human affairs with
 a philosophical eye, than the easiness with which the many are governed
 by the few; and the implicit submission, with which men resign their own
 sentiments and passions to those of their rulers. When we enquire by
 what means this wonder is effected, we shall find, that, as Force is
 always on the side of the governed, the governors have nothing to
 support them but opinion. It is, therefore, on opinion only that
 government is founded; and this maxim extends to the most despotic and
 most military governments, as well as to the most free and most popular.
 The soldan of Egypt, or the emperor of Rome, might drive his harmless
 subjects, like brute beasts, against their sentiments and inclination.
 But he must, at least, have led his _mamalukes_ or _praetorian bands_,
 like men, by their opinion.
 
 Opinion is of two kinds, to wit, opinion of interest, and opinion of
 right. By opinion of INTEREST, I chiefly understand the sense of the
 general advantage which is reaped from government; together with the
 persuasion, that the particular government which is established is
 equally advantageous with any other that could easily be settled. When
 this opinion prevails among the generality of a state, or among those
 who have the force in their hands, it gives great security to any
 government.
 
 Right is of two kinds; right to Power, and right to Property. What
 prevalence opinion of the first kind has over mankind, may easily be
 understood, by observing the attachment which all nations have to their
 ancient government, and even to those names which have had the sanction
 of antiquity. Antiquity always begets the opinion of right; and whatever
 disadvantageous sentiments we may entertain of mankind, they are always
 found to be prodigal both of blood and treasure in the maintenance of
 public justice.[1] There is, indeed, no particular in which, at first
 sight, there may appear a greater contradiction in the frame of the
 human mind than the present. When men act in a faction, they are apt,
 without shame or remorse, to neglect all the ties of honour and
 morality, in order to serve their party; and yet, when a faction is
 formed upon a point of right or principle, there is no occasion where
 men discover a greater obstinacy, and a more determined sense of justice
 and equity. The same social disposition of mankind is the cause of
 these contradictory appearances.
 
 It is sufficiently understood, that the opinion of right to property is
 of moment in all matters of government. A noted author has made property
 the foundation of all government; and most of our political writers seem
 inclined to follow him in that particular. This is carrying the matter
 too far; but still it must be owned, that the opinion of right to
 property has a great influence in this subject.
 
 Upon these three opinions, therefore, of public _interest_, of _right to
 power_, and of _right to property_, are all governments founded, and all
 authority of the few over the many. There are indeed other principles
 which add force to these, and determine, limit, or alter their
 operation; such as _self-interest_, _fear_, and _affection_. But still
 we may assert, that these other principles can have no influence alone,
 but suppose the antecedent influence of those opinions above mentioned.
 They are, therefore, to be esteemed the secondary, not the original,
 principles of government.
 
 For, _first_, as to _self-interest_, by which I mean the expectation of
 particular rewards, distinct from the general protection which we
 receive from government, it is evident that the magistrate's authority
 must be antecedently established, at least be hoped for, in order to
 produce this expectation. The prospect of reward may augment his
 authority with regard to some particular persons, but can never give
 birth to it, with regard to the public. Men naturally look for the
 greatest favours from their friends and acquaintance; and therefore, the
 hopes of any considerable number of the state would never centre in any
 particular set of men, if these men had no other title to magistracy,
 and had no separate influence over the opinions of mankind. The same
 observation may be extended to the other two principles of _fear_ and
 _affection_. No man would have any reason to _fear_ the fury of a
 tyrant, if he had no authority over any but from fear; since, as a
 single man, his bodily force can reach but a small way, and all the
 further power he possesses must be founded either on our own opinion, or
 on the presumed opinion of others. And though _affection_ to wisdom and
 virtue in a _sovereign_ extends very far, and has great influence, yet
 he must antecedently be supposed invested with a public character,
 otherwise the public esteem will serve him in no stead, nor will his
 virtue have any influence beyond a narrow sphere.
 
 A government may endure for several ages, though the balance of power
 and the balance of property do not coincide. This chiefly happens where
 any rank or order of the state has acquired a large share in the
 property; but, from the original constitution of the government, has no
 share in the power. Under what pretence would any individual of that
 order assume authority in public affairs? As men are commonly much
 attached to their ancient government, it is not to be expected, that
 the public would ever favour such usurpations. But where the original
 constitution allows any share of power, though small, to an order of men
 who possess a large share of property, it is easy for them gradually to
 stretch their authority, and bring the balance of power to coincide with
 that of property. This has been the case with the House of Commons in
 England.
 
 Most writers that have treated of the British government, have supposed,
 that, as the Lower House represents all the Commons of Great Britain,
 its weight in the scale is proportioned to the property and power of all
 whom it represents. But this principle must not be received as
 absolutely true. For though the people are apt to attach themselves more
 to the House of Commons than to any other member of the constitution,
 that House being chosen by them as their representatives, and as the
 public guardians of their liberty; yet are there instances where the
 House, even when in opposition to the crown, has not been followed by
 the people, as we may particularly observe of the _Tory_ House of
 Commons in the reign of King William. Were the members obliged to
 receive instructions from their constituents, like the Dutch deputies,
 this would entirely alter the case; and if such immense power and
 riches, as those of all the Commons of Great Britain, were brought into
 the scale, it is not easy to conceive, that the crown could either
 influence that multitude of people, or withstand the balance of
 property. It is true, the crown has great influence over the collective
 body in the elections of members; but were this influence, which at
 present is only exerted once in seven years, to be employed in bringing
 over the people to every vote, it would soon be wasted, and no skill,
 popularity, or revenue, could support it. I must, therefore, be of
 opinion, that an alteration in this particular would introduce a total
 alteration in our government, and would soon reduce it to a pure
 republic; and, perhaps, to a republic of no inconvenient form. For
 though the people, collected in a body like the Roman tribes, be quite
 unfit for government, yet, when dispersed in small bodies, they are most
 susceptible both of reason and order; the force of popular currents and
 tides is in a great measure broken; and the public interests may be
 pursued with some method and constancy. But it is needless to reason any
 further concerning a form of government, which is never likely to have
 place in Great Britain, and which seems not to be the aim of any party
 amongst us. Let us cherish and improve our ancient government as much as
 possible, without encouraging a passion for such dangerous novelties.[2]
 
 
 [1] This passion we may denominate enthusiasm, or we may give it what
 appellation we please; but a politician who should overlook its
 influence on human affairs, would prove himself to have but a very
 limited understanding.
 
 [2] I shall conclude this subject with observing, that the present
 political controversy with regard to _instructions_, is a very frivolous
 one, and can never be brought to any decision, as it is managed by both
 parties. The country party do not pretend that a member is absolutely
 bound to follow instructions as an ambassador or general is confined by
 his orders, and that his vote is not to be received in the House, but so
 far as it is conformable to them. The court party, again, do not pretend
 that the sentiments of the people ought to have no weight with every
 member; much less that he ought to despise the sentiments of those whom
 he represents, and with whom he is more particularly connected. And if
 their sentiments be of weight, why ought they not to express these
 sentiments? The question then is only concerning the degrees of weight
 which ought to be placed on instructions. But such is the nature of
 language, that it is impossible for it to express distinctly these
 different degrees; and if men will carry on a controversy on this head,
 it may well happen that they differ in the language, and yet agree in
 their sentiments; or differ in their sentiments, and yet agree in their
 language. Besides, how is it possible to fix these degrees, considering
 the variety of affairs that come before the House, and the variety of
 places which members represent? Ought the instructions of _Totness_ to
 have the same weight as those of London? or instructions with regard to
 the _Convention_ which respected foreign politics to have the same
 weight as those with regard to the _Excise_, which respected only our
 domestic affairs?
 
 
 
 
 OF THE ORIGIN OF GOVERNMENT
 
 
 Man, born in a family, is compelled to maintain society from necessity,
 from natural inclination, and from habit. The same creature, in his
 further progress, is engaged to establish political society, in order to
 administer justice, without which there can be no peace among them, nor
 safety, nor mutual intercourse. We are, therefore, to look upon all the
 vast apparatus of our government, as having ultimately no other object
 or purpose but the distribution of justice, or, in other words, the
 support of the twelve judges. Kings and parliaments, fleets and armies,
 officers of the court and revenue, ambassadors, ministers, and privy
 counsellors, are all subordinate in their end to this part of
 administration. Even the clergy, as their duty leads them to inculcate
 morality, may justly be thought, so far as regards this world, to have
 no other useful object of their institution.
 
 All men are sensible of the necessity of justice to maintain peace and
 order; and all men are sensible of the necessity of peace and order for
 the maintenance of society. Yet, notwithstanding this strong and obvious
 necessity, such is the frailty or perverseness of our nature! it is
 impossible to keep men faithfully and unerringly in the paths of
 justice. Some extraordinary circumstances may happen, in which a man
 finds his interests to be more promoted by fraud or rapine, than hurt by
 the breach which his injustice makes in the social union. But much more
 frequently he is seduced from his great and important, but distant
 interests, by the allurement of present, though often very frivolous
 temptations. This great weakness is incurable in human nature.
 
 Men must, therefore, endeavour to palliate what they cannot cure. They
 must institute some persons under the appellation of magistrates, whose
 peculiar office it is to point out the decrees of equity, to punish
 transgressors, to correct fraud and violence, and to oblige men, however
 reluctant, to consult their own real and permanent interests. In a word,
 obedience is a new duty which must be invented to support that of
 justice, and the ties of equity must be corroborated by those of
 allegiance.
 
 But still, viewing matters in an abstract light, it may be thought that
 nothing is gained by this alliance, and that the factitious duty of
 obedience, from its very nature, lays as feeble a hold of the human
 mind, as the primitive and natural duty of justice. Peculiar interests
 and present temptations may overcome the one as well as the other. They
 are equally exposed to the same inconvenience; and the man who is
 inclined to be a bad neighbour, must be led by the same motives, well
 or ill understood, to be a bad citizen or subject. Not to mention, that
 the magistrate himself may often be negligent, or partial, or unjust in
 his administration.
 
 Experience, however, proves that there is a great difference between the
 cases. Order in society, we find, is much better maintained by means of
 government; and our duty to the magistrate is more strictly guarded by
 the principles of human nature, than our duty to our fellow-citizens.
 The love of dominion, is so strong in the breast of man, that many not
 only submit to, but court all the dangers, and fatigues, and cares of
 government; and men, once raised to that station, though often led
 astray by private passions, find, in ordinary cases, a visible interest
 in the impartial administration of justice. The persons who first attain
 this distinction, by the consent, tacit or express, of the people, must
 be endowed with superior personal qualities of valour, force, integrity,
 or prudence, which command respect and confidence; and, after government
 is established, a regard to birth, rank, and station, has a mighty
 influence over men, and enforces the decrees of the magistrate. The
 prince or leader exclaims against every disorder which disturbs his
 society. He summons all his partisans and all men of probity to aid him
 in correcting and redressing it, and he is readily followed by all
 indifferent persons in the execution of his office. He soon acquires the
 power of rewarding these services; and in the progress of society, he
 establishes subordinate ministers, and often a military force, who find
 an immediate and a visible interest in supporting his authority. Habit
 soon consolidates what other principles of human nature had imperfectly
 founded; and men, once accustomed to obedience, never think of departing
 from that path, in which they and their ancestors have constantly trod,
 and to which they are confined by so many urgent and visible motives.
 
 But though this progress of human affairs may appear certain and
 inevitable, and though the support which allegiance brings to justice be
 founded on obvious principles of human nature, it cannot be expected
 that men should beforehand be able to discover them, or foresee their
 operation. Government commences more casually and more imperfectly. It
 is probable, that the first ascendent of one man over multitudes began
 during a state of war; where the superiority of courage and of genius
 discovers itself most visibly, where unanimity and concert are most
 requisite, and where the pernicious effects of disorder are most
 sensibly felt. The long continuance of that state, an incident common
 among savage tribes, inured the people to submission; and if the
 chieftain possessed as much equity as prudence and valour, he became,
 even during peace, the arbiter of all differences, and could gradually,
 by a mixture of force and consent, establish his authority. The benefit
 sensibly felt from his influence, made it be cherished by the people, at
 least by the peaceable and well disposed among them; and if his son
 enjoyed the same good qualities, government advanced the sooner to
 maturity and perfection; but was still in a feeble state, till the
 further progress of improvement procured the magistrate a revenue, and
 enabled him to bestow rewards on the several instruments of his
 administration, and to inflict punishments on the refractory and
 disobedient. Before that period, each exertion of his influence must
 have been particular, and founded on the peculiar circumstances of the
 case. After it, submission was no longer a matter of choice in the bulk
 of the community, but was rigorously exacted by the authority of the
 supreme magistrate.
 
 In all governments, there is a perpetual intestine struggle, open or
 secret, between Authority and Liberty, and neither of them can ever
 absolutely prevail in the contest. A great sacrifice of liberty must
 necessarily be made in every government; yet even the authority, which
 confines liberty, can never, and perhaps ought never, in any
 constitution, to become quite entire and uncontrollable. The sultan is
 master of the life and fortune of any individual; but will not be
 permitted to impose new taxes on his subjects: a French monarch can
 impose taxes at pleasure; but would find it dangerous to attempt the
 lives and fortunes of individuals. Religion also, in most countries, is
 commonly found to be a very intractable principle; and other principles
 or prejudices frequently resist all the authority of the civil
 magistrate; whose power, being founded on opinion, can never subvert
 other opinions equally rooted with that of his title to dominion. The
 government, which, in common appellation, receives the appellation of
 free, is that which admits of a partition of power among several
 members, whose united authority is no less, or is commonly greater, than
 that of any monarch; but who, in the usual course of administration,
 must act by general and equal laws, that are previously known to all the
 members, and to all their subjects. In this sense, it must be owned,
 that liberty is the perfection of civil society; but still authority
 must be acknowledged essential to its very existence: and in those
 contests which so often take place between the one and the other, the
 latter may, on that account, challenge the preference. Unless perhaps
 one may say (and it may be said with some reason) that a circumstance,
 which is essential to the existence of civil society, must always
 support itself, and needs be guarded with less jealousy, than one that
 contributes only to its perfection, which the indolence of men is so apt
 to neglect, or their ignorance to overlook.
 
 
 
 
 OF THE INDEPENDENCY OF PARLIAMENT[1]
 
 
 Political writers have established it as a maxim, that, in contriving
 any system of government, and fixing the several checks and controls of
 the constitution, every man ought to be supposed a _knave_, and to have
 no other end, in all his actions, than private interest. By this
 interest we must govern him, and, by means of it, make him,
 notwithstanding his insatiable avarice and ambition, cooperate to public
 good. Without this, say they, we shall in vain boast of the advantages
 of any constitution, and shall find, in the end, that we have no
 security for our liberties or possessions, except the good-will of our
 rulers; that is, we shall have no security at all.
 
 It is, therefore, a just _political_ maxim, _that every man must be
 supposed a knave_; though, at the same time, it appears somewhat
 strange, that a maxim should be true in _politics_ which is false in
 _fact_. But to satisfy us on this head, we may consider, that men are
 generally more honest in their private than in their public capacity,
 and will go greater lengths to serve a party, than when their own
 private interest is alone concerned. Honour is a great check upon
 mankind: but where a considerable body of men act together, this check
 is in a great measure removed, since a man is sure to be approved of by
 his own party, for what promotes the common interest; and he soon learns
 to despise the clamours of adversaries. To which we may add, that every
 court or senate is determined by the greater number of voices; so that,
 if self-interest influences only the majority (as it will always do),
 the whole senate follows the allurements of this separate interest, and
 acts as if it contained not one member who had any regard to public
 interest and liberty.
 
 When there offers, therefore, to our censure and examination, any plan
 of government, real or imaginary, where the power is distributed among
 several courts, and several orders of men, we should always consider the
 separate interest of each court, and each order; and if we find that, by
 the skilful division of power, this interest must necessarily, in its
 operation, concur with the public, we may pronounce that government to
 be wise and happy. If, on the contrary, separate interest be not
 checked, and be not directed to the public, we ought to look for nothing
 but faction, disorder, and tyranny from such a government. In this
 opinion I am justified by experience, as well as by the authority of
 all philosophers and politicians, both ancient and modern.
 
 How much, therefore, would it have surprised such a genius as Cicero or
 Tacitus, to have been told, that in a future age there should arise a
 very regular system of _mixed_ government, where the authority was so
 distributed, that one rank, whenever it pleased, might swallow up all
 the rest, and engross the whole power of the constitution! Such a
 government, they would say, will not be a mixed government. For so great
 is the natural ambition of men, that they are never satisfied with
 power; and if one order of men, by pursuing its own interest, can usurp
 upon every other order, it will certainly do so, and render itself, as
 far as possible, absolute and uncontrollable.
 
 But, in this opinion, experience shows they would have been mistaken.
 For this is actually the case with the British constitution. The share
 of power allotted by our constitution to the House of Commons, is so
 great, that it absolutely commands all the other parts of the
 government. The king's legislative power is plainly no proper check to
 it. For though the king has a negative in framing laws, yet this, in
 fact, is esteemed of so little moment, that whatever is voted by the two
 Houses, is always sure to pass into a law, and the royal assent is
 little better than a form. The principal weight of the crown lies in the
 executive; power. But, besides that the executive power in every
 government is altogether subordinate to the legislative; besides this, I
 say, the exercise of this power requires an immense expense, and the
 Commons have assumed to themselves the sole right of granting money. How
 easy, therefore, would it be for that house to wrest from the crown all
 these powers, one after another, by making every grant conditional, and
 choosing their time so well, that their refusal of supply should only
 distress the government, without giving foreign powers any advantage
 over us! Did the House of Commons depend in the same manner upon the
 king, and had none of the members any property but from his gift, would
 not he command all their resolutions, and be from that moment absolute?
 As to the House of Lords, they are a very powerful support to the crown,
 so long as they are, in their turn, supported by it; but both experience
 and reason show, that they have no force or authority sufficient to
 maintain themselves alone, without such support.
 
 How, therefore, shall we solve this paradox? And by what means is this
 member of our constitution confined within the proper limits, since,
 from our very constitution, it must necessarily have as much power as it
 demands, and can only be confined by itself? How is this consistent with
 our experience of human nature? I answer, that the interest of the body
 is here restrained by that of the individuals, and that the House of
 Commons stretches not its power, because such an usurpation would be
 contrary to the interest of the majority of its members. The crown has
 so many offices at its disposal, that, when assisted by the honest and
 disinterested part of the House, it will always command the resolutions
 of the whole, so far, at least, as to preserve the ancient constitution
 from danger. We may, therefore, give to this influence what name we
 please; we may call it by the invidious appellations of _corruption_ and
 _dependence_; but some degree and some kind of it are inseparable from
 the very nature of the constitution, and necessary to the preservation
 of our mixed government.
 
 Instead, then, of asserting absolutely, that the dependence of
 parliament, in every degree, is an infringement of British liberty, the
 country party should have made some concessions to their adversaries,
 and have only examined what was the proper degree of this dependence,
 beyond which it became dangerous to liberty. But such a moderation is
 not to be expected in party men of any kind. After a concession of this
 nature, all declamation must be abandoned; and a calm inquiry into the
 proper degree of court influence and parliamentary dependence would have
 been expected by the readers. And though the advantage, in such a
 controversy, might possibly remain to the _country party_, yet the
 victory would not be so complete as they wish for, nor would a true
 patriot have given an entire loose to his zeal, for fear of running
 matters into a contrary extreme, by diminishing too[2] far the
 influence of the crown. It was, therefore, thought best to deny that
 this extreme could ever be dangerous to the constitution, or that the
 crown could ever have too little influence over members of parliament.
 
 All questions concerning the proper medium between extremes are
 difficult to be decided; both because it is not easy to find _words_
 proper to fix this medium, and because the good and ill, in such cases,
 run so gradually into each other, as even to render our _sentiments_
 doubtful and uncertain. But there is a peculiar difficulty in the
 present case, which would embarrass the most knowing and most impartial
 examiner. The power of the crown is always lodged in a single person,
 either king or minister; and as this person may have either a greater or
 less degree of ambition, capacity, courage, popularity, or fortune, the
 power, which is too great in one hand, may become too little in another.
 In pure republics, where the authority is distributed among several
 assemblies or senates, the checks and controls are more regular in their
 operation; because the members of such numerous assemblies may be
 presumed to be always nearly equal in capacity and virtue; and it is
 only their number, riches, or authority, which enter into consideration.
 But a limited monarchy admits not of any such stability; nor is it
 possible to assign to the crown such a determinate degree of power, as
 will, in every hand, form a proper counterbalance to the other parts of
 the constitution. This is an unavoidable disadvantage, among the many
 advantages attending that species of government.
 
 
 [1] I have frequently observed, in comparing the conduct of the _court_
 and _country_ party, that the former are commonly less assuming and
 dogmatical in conversation, more apt to make concessions, and though
 not, perhaps, more susceptible of conviction, yet more able to bear
 contradiction than the latter, who are apt to fly out upon any
 opposition, and to regard one as a mercenary, designing fellow, if he
 argues with any coolness and impartiality, or makes any concessions to
 their adversaries. This is a fact, which, I believe, every one may have
 observed who has been much in companies where political questions have
 been discussed; though, were one to ask the reason of this difference,
 every party would be apt to assign a different reason. Gentlemen in the
 _opposition_ will ascribe it to the very nature of their party, which,
 being founded on public spirit, and a zeal for the constitution, cannot
 easily endure such doctrines as are of pernicious consequence to
 liberty. The courtiers, on the other hand, will be apt to put us in mind
 of the clown mentioned by Lord Shaftesbury. 'A clown,' says that
 excellent author, 'once took a fancy to hear the _Latin_ disputes of
 doctors at an university. He was asked what pleasure he could take in
 viewing such combatants, when he could never know so much as which of
 the parties had the better.'--_'For that matter,'_ replied the clown,
 _'I a'n't such a fool neither, but I can see who's the first that puts
 t'other into a passion.'_ Nature herself dictated this lesson to the
 clown, that he who had the better of the argument would be easy and well
 humoured: but he who was unable to support his cause by reason would
 naturally lose his temper, and grow violent.
 
 To which of these reasons will we adhere? To neither of them, in my
 opinion, unless we have a mind to enlist ourselves and become zealots in
 either party. I believe I can assign the reason of this different
 conduct of the two parties, without offending either. The country party
 are plainly most popular at present, and perhaps have been so in most
 administrations so that, being accustomed to prevail in company, they
 cannot endure to hear their opinions controverted, but are so confident
 on the public favour, as if they were supported in all their sentiments
 by the most infallible demonstration. The courtiers, on the other hand,
 are Commonly run down by your popular talkers, that if you speak to them
 with any moderation, or make them the smallest concessions, they think
 themselves extremely obliged to you, and are apt to return the favour by
 a like moderation and facility on their part. To be furious and
 passionate, they know, would only gain them the character of shameless
 mercenaries, not that of zealous patriots, which is the character that
 such a warm behaviour is apt to acquire to the other party.
 
 In all controversies, we find, without regarding the truth or falsehood
 on either side, that those who defend the established and popular
 opinions are always most dogmatical and imperious in their style: while
 their adversaries affect almost extraordinary gentleness and moderation,
 in order to soften, as much as possible, any prejudices that may be
 Against them. Consider the behaviour of our _Freethinkers_ of all
 denominations, whether they be such as decry all revelation, or only
 oppose the exorbitant power of the clergy, Collins, Tindal, Foster,
 Hoadley. Compare their moderation and good manners with the furious zeal
 and scurrility of their adversaries, and you will be convinced of the
 truth of my observation. A like difference may be observed in the
 conduct of those French writers, who maintained the controversy with
 regard to ancient and modern learning. Boileau, Monsieur and Madame
 Dacier, l'Abbe de Bos, who defended the party of the ancients, mixed
 their reasonings with satire and invective, while Fontenelle, la Motte,
 Charpentier, and even Perrault, never transgressed the bounds of
 moderation and good breeding, though provoked by the most injurious
 treatment of their adversaries.
 
 I must however observe, that this remark with regard to the seeming
 moderation of the _court_ party, is entirely confined to conversation,
 and to gentlemen who have been engaged by interest or inclination in
 that party. For as to the court writers, being commonly hired
 scribblers, they are altogether as scurrilous as the mercenaries of the
 other party: nor has the _Gazetteer_ any advantage, in this respect,
 above common sense. A man of education will, in any party, discover
 himself to be such by his goodbreeding and decency, as a scoundrel will
 always betray the opposite qualities. _The false accusers accused_, &c.
 is very scurrilous, though that side of the question, being least
 popular, should be defended with most moderation. When L--d B--e, L--d
 M--t, Mr. L--n, take the pen in hand, though they write with warmth,
 they presume not upon their popularity so far as to transgress the
 bounds of decency.
 
 I am led into this train of reflection by considering some papers wrote
 upon that grand topic of _court influence and parliamentary dependence_,
 where, in my humble opinion, the country party show too rigid an
 inflexibility, and too great a jealousy of making concessions to their
 adversaries. Their reasonings lose their force by being carried too far
 and the popularity of their opinions has seduced them to neglect in some
 measure their justness and solidity. The following reasoning will, I
 hope, serve to justify me in this opinion.
 
 [2] By that _influence of the crown_, which I would justify, I mean only
 that which arises from the offices and honours that are at the disposal
 of the crown. As to private _bribery_, it may be considered in the same
 light as the practice of employing spies, which is scarcely justifiable
 in a good minister, and is infamous in a bad one; but to be a spy, or to
 be corrupted, is always infamous under all ministers, and is to be
 regarded as a shameless prostitution. Polybius justly esteems the
 pecuniary influence of the senate and censors to be one of the regular
 and constitutional weights which preserved the balance of the Roman
 government.--Lib. vi. cap. 15.
 
 
 
 
 WHETHER THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT INCLINES MORE TO ABSOLUTE MONARCHY OR TO
 A REPUBLIC
 
 
 It affords a violent prejudice against almost every science, that no
 prudent man, however sure of his principles, dares prophesy concerning
 any event, or foretell the remote consequences of things. A physician
 will not venture to pronounce concerning the condition of his patient a
 fortnight or a month after: and still less dares a politician foretell
 the situation of public affairs a few years hence. Harrington thought
 himself so sure of his general principle, _that the balance of power
 depends on that of property_, that he ventured to pronounce it
 impossible ever to reestablish monarchy in England: but his book was
 scarcely published when the king was restored; and we see that monarchy
 has ever since subsisted upon the same footing as before.
 Notwithstanding this unlucky example, I will venture to examine an
 important question, to wit, _Whether the British Government inclines
 more to absolute monarchy or to a republic; and in which of these two
 species of government it will most probably terminate?_ As there seems
 not to be any great danger of a sudden revolution either way, I shall
 at least escape the shame attending my temerity, if I should be found to
 have been mistaken.
 
 Those who assert that the balance of our government inclines towards
 absolute monarchy, may support their opinion by the following reasons:
 That property has a great influence on power cannot possibly be denied;
 but yet the general maxim, _that the balance of the one depends on the
 balance of the other_, must be received with several limitations. It is
 evident, that much less property in a single hand will be able to
 counterbalance a greater property in several; not only because it is
 difficult to make many persons combine in the same views and measures,
 but because property, when united, causes much greater dependence than
 the same property when dispersed. A hundred persons of L1,000 a year
 apiece, can consume all their income, and nobody shall ever be the
 better for them, except their servants and tradesmen, who justly regard
 their profits as the product of their own labour. But a man possessed of
 L100,000 a year, if he has either any generosity or any cunning, may
 create a great dependence by obligations, and still a greater by
 expectations. Hence we may observe, that, in all free governments, any
 subject exorbitantly rich has always created jealousy, even though his
 riches bore no proportion to those of the state. Crassus's fortune, if I
 remember well, amounted only to about two millions and a half of our
 money; yet we find, that though his genius was nothing extraordinary,
 he was able, by means of his riches alone, to counterbalance, during his
 lifetime, the power of Pompey, as well as that of Caesar, who afterwards
 became master of the world. The wealth of the Medici made them masters
 of Florence, though it is probable it was not considerable, compared to
 the united property of that opulent republic.
 
 These considerations are apt to make one entertain a magnificent idea of
 the British spirit and love of liberty, since we could maintain our free
 government, during so many centuries, against our sovereigns, who,
 besides the power, and dignity, and majesty of the crown, have always
 been possessed of much more property than any subject has ever enjoyed
 in any commonwealth. But it may be said that this spirit, however great,
 will never be able to support itself against that immense property which
 is now lodged in the king, and which is still increasing. Upon a
 moderate computation, there are near three millions a year at the
 disposal of the crown. The civil list amounts to near a million; the
 collection of all taxes to another; and the employments in the army and
 navy, together with ecclesiastical preferments, to above a third
 million:--an enormous sum, and what may fairly be computed to be more
 than a thirtieth part of the whole income and labour of the kingdom.
 When we add to this great property the increasing luxury of the nation,
 our proneness to corruption, together with the great power and
 prerogatives of the crown, and the command of military force, there is
 no one but must despair of being able, without extraordinary efforts, to
 support our free government much longer under these disadvantages.
 
 On the other hand, those who maintain that the bias of the British
 government leans towards a republic, may support their opinions by
 specious arguments. It may be said, that though this immense property in
 the crown be joined to the dignity of first magistrate, and to many
 other legal powers and prerogatives, which should naturally give it
 greater influence; yet it really becomes less dangerous to liberty upon
 that very account. Were England a republic, and were any private man
 possessed of a revenue, a third, or even a tenth part as large as that
 of the crown, he would very justly excite jealousy; because he would
 infallibly have great authority in the government. And such an irregular
 authority, not avowed by the laws, is always more dangerous than a much
 greater authority derived from them. A man possessed of usurped power
 can set no bounds to his pretensions: his partisans have liberty to hope
 for every thing in his favour: his enemies provoke his ambition with his
 fears, by the violence of their opposition: and the government being
 thrown into a ferment, every corrupted humour in the state naturally
 gathers to him. On the contrary, a legal authority, though great, has
 always some bounds, which terminate both the hopes and pretensions of
 the person possessed of it: the laws must have provided a remedy against
 its excesses: such an eminent magistrate has much to fear, and little to
 hope, from his usurpations: and as his legal authority is quietly
 submitted to, he has small temptation and small opportunity of extending
 it further. Besides, it happens, with regard to ambitious aims and
 projects, what may be observed with regard to sects of philosophy and
 religion. A new sect excites such a ferment, and is both opposed and
 defended with such vehemence, that it always spreads faster, and
 multiplies its partisans with greater rapidity than any old established
 opinion, recommended by the sanction of the laws and of antiquity. Such
 is the nature of novelty, that, where any thing pleases, it becomes
 doubly agreeable, if new: but if it displeases, it is doubly displeasing
 upon that very account. And, in most cases, the violence of enemies is
 favourable to ambitious projects, as well as the zeal of partisans.
 
 It may further be said, that, though men be much governed by interest,
 yet even interest itself, and all human affairs, are entirely governed
 by _opinion_. Now, there has been a sudden and sensible change in the
 opinions of men within these last fifty years, by the progress of
 learning and of liberty. Most people in this Island have divested
 themselves of all superstitious reverence to names and authority: the
 clergy have much lost their credit: their pretensions and doctrines
 have been ridiculed; and even religion can scarcely support itself in
 the world. The mere name of _king_ commands little respect; and to talk
 of a king as God's vicegerent on earth, or to give him any of those
 magnificent titles which formerly dazzled mankind, would but excite
 laughter in every one. Though the crown, by means of its large revenue,
 may maintain its authority, in times of tranquillity, upon private
 interest and influence, yet, as the least shock or convulsion must break
 all these interests to pieces, the royal power, being no longer
 supported by the settled principles and opinions of men, will
 immediately dissolve. Had men been in the same disposition at the
 _Revolution_, as they are at present, monarchy would have run a great
 risk of being entirely lost in this Island.
 
 Durst I venture to deliver my own sentiments amidst these opposite
 arguments, I would assert, that, unless there happen some extraordinary
 convulsion, the power of the crown, by means of its large revenue, is
 rather upon the increase; though at the same time, I own that its
 progress seems very slow, and almost insensible. The tide has run long,
 and with some rapidity, to the side of popular government, and is just
 beginning to turn towards monarchy.
 
 It is well known, that every government must come to a period, and that
 death is unavoidable to the political, as well as to the animal body.
 But, as one kind of death may be preferable to another, it may be
 inquired, whether it be more desirable for the British constitution to
 terminate in a popular government, or in an absolute monarchy? Here I
 would frankly declare, that though liberty be preferable to slavery, in
 almost every case; yet I should rather wish to see an absolute monarch
 than a republic in this Island. For let us consider what kind of
 republic we have reason to expect. The question is not concerning any
 fine imaginary republic, of which a man forms a plan in his closet.
 There is no doubt but a popular government may be imagined more perfect
 than an absolute monarchy, or even than our present constitution. But
 what reason have we to expect that any such government will ever be
 established in Great Britain, upon the dissolution of our monarchy? If
 any single person acquire power enough to take our constitution to
 pieces, and put it up anew, he is really an absolute monarch; and we
 have already had an instance of this kind, sufficient to convince us,
 that such a person will never resign his power, or establish any free
 government. Matters, therefore, must be trusted to their natural
 progress and operation; and the House of Commons, according to its
 present constitution, must be the only legislature in such a popular
 government. The inconveniences attending such a situation of affairs
 present themselves by thousands. If the House of Commons, in such a
 case, ever dissolve itself, which is not to be expected, we may look for
 a civil war every election. If it continue itself, we shall suffer all
 the tyranny of a faction sub-divided into new factions. And, as such a
 violent government cannot long subsist, we shall, at last, after many
 convulsions and civil wars, find repose in absolute monarchy, which it
 would have been happier for us to have established peaceably from the
 beginning. Absolute monarchy, therefore, is the easiest death, the true
 _Euthanasia_ of the British constitution.
 
 Thus, if we have reason to be more jealous of monarchy, because the
 danger is more imminent from that quarter; we have also reason to be
 more jealous of popular government, because that danger is more
 terrible. This may teach us a lesson of moderation in all our political
 controversies.
 
 
 
 
 OF PARTIES IN GENERAL
 
 
 Of all men that distinguish themselves by memorable achievements, the
 first place of honour seems due to LEGISLATORS and founders of states,
 who transmit a system of laws and institutions to secure the peace,
 happiness, and liberty of future generations. The influence of useful
 inventions in the arts and sciences may, perhaps, extend further than
 that of wise laws, whose effects are limited both in time and place; but
 the benefit arising from the former is not so sensible as that which
 results from the latter. Speculative sciences do, indeed, improve the
 mind, but this advantage reaches only to a few persons, who have leisure
 to apply themselves to them. And as to practical arts, which increase
 the commodities and enjoyments of life, it is well known that men's
 happiness consists not so much in an abundance of these, as in the peace
 and security with which they possess them: and those blessings can only
 be derived from good government. Not to mention, that general virtue and
 good morals in a state, which are so requisite to happiness, can never
 arise from the most refined precepts of philosophy, or even the severest
 injunctions of religion; but must proceed entirely from the virtuous
 education of youth, the effect of wise laws and institutions. I must,
 therefore, presume to differ from Lord Bacon in this particular, and
 must regard antiquity as somewhat unjust in its distribution of honours,
 when it made gods of all the inventors of useful arts, such as Ceres,
 Bacchus, AEsculapius and dignified legislators, such as Romulus and
 Theseus, only with the appellation of demigods and heroes.
 
 As much as legislators and founders of states ought to be honoured and
 respected among men, as much ought the founders of sects and factions to
 be detested and hated; because the influence of faction is directly
 contrary to that of laws. Factions subvert government, render laws
 impotent, and beget the fiercest animosities among men of the same
 nation, who ought to give mutual assistance and protection to each
 other. And what should render the founders of parties more odious, is
 the difficulty of extirpating these weeds, when once they have taken
 root in any state. They naturally propagate themselves for many
 centuries, and seldom end but by the total dissolution of that
 government, in which they are sown. They are, besides, plants which grow
 most plentiful in the richest soil; and though absolute governments be
 not wholly free from them, it must be confessed, that they rise more
 easily, and propagate themselves faster in free governments, where they
 always infect the legislature itself, which alone could be able, by the
 steady application of rewards and punishments, to eradicate them.
 
 Factions may be divided into Personal and Real; that is, into factions
 founded on personal friendship or animosity among such as compose the
 contending parties, and into those founded on some real difference of
 sentiment or interest. The reason of this distinction is obvious, though
 I must acknowledge, that parties are seldom found pure and unmixed,
 either of the one kind or the other. It is not often seen, that a
 government divides into factions, where there is no difference in the
 views of the constituent members, either real or apparent, trivial or
 material: and in those factions, which are founded on the most real and
 most material difference, there is always observed a great deal of
 personal animosity or affection. But notwithstanding this mixture, a
 party may be denominated either personal or real, according to that
 principle which is predominant, and is found to have the greatest
 influence.
 
 Personal factions arise most easily in small republics. Every domestic
 quarrel, there, becomes an affair of state. Love, vanity, emulation, any
 passion, as well as ambition and resentment, begets public division. The
 NERI and BIANCHI of Florence, the FREGOSI and ADORNI of Genoa, the
 COLONNESI and ORSINI of modern Rome, were parties of this kind.
 
 Men have such a propensity to divide into personal factions, that the
 smallest appearance of real difference will produce them. What can be
 imagined more trivial than the difference between one colour of livery
 and another in horse races? Yet this difference begat two most
 inveterate factions in the Greek empire, the PRASINI and VENETI, who
 never suspended their animosities till they ruined that unhappy
 government.
 
 We find in the Roman history a remarkable dissension between two tribes,
 the POLLIA and PAPIRIA, which continued for the space of near three
 hundred years, and discovered itself in their suffrages at every
 election of magistrates. This faction was the more remarkable, as it
 could continue for so long a tract of time; even though it did not
 spread itself, nor draw any of the other tribes into a share of the
 quarrel. If mankind had not a strong propensity to such divisions, the
 indifference of the rest of the community must have suppressed this
 foolish animosity, that had not any aliment of new benefits and
 injuries, of general sympathy and antipathy, which never fail to take
 place, when the whole state is rent into equal factions.
 
 Nothing is more usual than to see parties, which have begun upon a real
 difference, continue even after that difference is lost. When men are
 once enlisted on opposite sides, they contract an affection to the
 persons with whom they are united, and an animosity against their
 antagonists; and these passions they often transmit to their posterity.
 The real difference between Guelf and Ghibelline was long lost in
 Italy, before these factions were extinguished. The Guelfs adhered to
 the pope, the Ghibellines to the emperor; yet the family of Sforza, who
 were in alliance with the emperor, though they were Guelfs, being
 expelled Milan by the king of France, assisted by Jacomo Trivulzio and
 the Ghibellines, the pope concurred with the latter, and they formed
 leagues with the pope against the emperor.
 
 The civil wars which arose some few years ago in Morocco between the
 _Blacks_ and _Whites_, merely on account of their complexion, are
 founded on a pleasant difference. We laugh at them; but, I believe, were
 things rightly examined, we afford much more occasion of ridicule to the
 Moors. For, what are all the wars of religion, which have prevailed in
 this polite and knowing part of the world? They are certainly more
 absurd than the Moorish civil wars. The difference of complexion is a
 sensible and a real difference; but the controversy about an article of
 faith, which is utterly absurd and unintelligible, is not a difference
 in sentiment, but in a few phrases and expressions, which one party
 accepts of without understanding them, and the other refuses in the same
 manner.[1]
 
 _Real_ factions may be divided into those from _interest_, from
 _principle_, and from _affection_. Of all factions, the first are the
 most reasonable, and the most excusable. Where two orders of men, such
 as the nobles and people, have a distinct authority in a government, not
 very accurately balanced and modelled, they naturally follow a distinct
 interest; nor can we reasonably expect a different conduct, considering
 that degree of selfishness implanted in human nature. It requires great
 skill in a legislator to prevent such parties; and many philosophers are
 of opinion, that this secret, like the _grand elixir_, or _perpetual
 motion_, may amuse men in theory, but can never possibly be reduced to
 practice. In despotic governments, indeed, factions often do not appear;
 but they are not the less real; or rather, they are more real and more
 pernicious upon that very account. The distinct orders of men, nobles
 and people, soldiers and merchants, have all a distinct interest; but
 the more powerful oppresses the weaker with impunity, and without
 resistance; which begets a seeming tranquillity in such governments.
 
 There has been an attempt in England to divide the _landed_ and
 _trading_ part of the nation; but without success. The interests of
 these two bodies are not really distinct, and never will be so, till our
 public debts increase to such a degree as to become altogether
 oppressive and intolerable.
 
 Parties from _principle_, especially abstract speculative principle,
 are known only to modern times, and are, perhaps, the most extraordinary
 and unaccountable _phenomenon_ that has yet appeared in human affairs.
 Where different principles beget a contrariety of conduct, which is the
 case with all different political principles, the matter may be more
 easily explained. A man who esteems the true right of government to lie
 in one man, or one family, cannot easily agree with his fellow-citizen,
 who thinks that another man or family is possessed of this right. Each
 naturally wishes that right may take place, according to his own notions
 of it. But where the difference of principle is attended with no
 contrariety of action, but every one may follow his own way, without
 interfering with his neighbour, as happens in all religious
 controversies, what madness, what fury, can beget such an unhappy and
 such fatal divisions?
 
 Two men travelling on the highway, the one east, the other west, can
 easily pass each other, if the way be broad enough: but two men,
 reasoning upon opposite principles of religion, cannot so easily pass,
 without shocking, though one should think, that the way were also, in
 that case, sufficiently broad and that each might proceed, without
 interruption, in his own course. But such is the nature of the human
 mind, that it always lays hold on every mind that approaches it; and as
 it is wonderfully fortified by an unanimity of sentiments, so it is
 shocked and disturbed by any contrariety. Hence the eagerness which
 most people discover in a dispute; and hence their impatience of
 opposition, even in the most speculative and indifferent opinions.
 
 This principle, however frivolous it may appear, seems to have been the
 origin of all religious wars and divisions. But as this principle is
 universal in human nature, its effects would not have been confined to
 one age, and to one sect of religion, did it not there concur with other
 more accidental causes, which raise it to such a height as to produce
 the greatest misery and devastation. Most religions of the ancient world
 arose in the unknown ages of government, when men were as yet barbarous
 and uninstructed, and the prince, as well as peasant, was disposed to
 receive, with implicit faith, every pious tale or fiction which was
 offered him. The magistrate embraced the religion of the people, and,
 entering cordially into the care of sacred matters, naturally acquired
 an authority in them, and united the ecclesiastical with the civil
 power. But the _Christian_ religion arising, while principles directly
 opposite to it were firmly established in the polite part of the world,
 who despised the nation that first broached this novelty; no wonder
 that, in such circumstances, it was but little countenanced by the civil
 magistrate, and that the priesthood was allowed to engross all the
 authority in the new sect. So bad a use did they make of this power,
 even in those early times, that the primitive persecutions may, perhaps
 _in part_,[2] be ascribed to the violence instilled by them into their
 followers.
 
 And the same principles of priestly government continuing, after
 Christianity became the established religion, they have engendered a
 spirit of persecution, which has ever since been the poison of human
 society, and the source of the most inveterate factions in every
 government. Such divisions, therefore, on the part of the people, may
 justly be esteemed factions of _principle_, but, on the part of the
 priests, who are the prime movers, they are really factions of
 _interest_.
 
 There is another cause (beside the authority of the priests, and the
 separation of the ecclesiastical and civil powers), which has
 contributed to render Christendom the scene of religious wars and
 divisions. Religions that arise in ages totally ignorant and barbarous,
 consist mostly of traditional tales and fictions, which may be different
 in every sect, without being contrary to each other; and even when they
 are contrary, every one adheres to the tradition of his own sect,
 without much reasoning or disputation. But as philosophy was widely
 spread over the world at the time when Christianity arose, the teachers
 of the new sect were obliged to form a system of speculative opinions,
 to divide, with some accuracy, their articles of faith, and to explain,
 comment, confute, and defend, with all the subtlety of argument and
 science. Hence naturally arose keenness in dispute, when the Christian
 religion came to be split into new divisions and heresies: and this
 keenness assisted the priests in the policy of begetting a mutual hatred
 and antipathy among their deluded followers. Sects of philosophy, in the
 ancient world, were more zealous than parties of religion; but, in
 modern times, parties of religion are more furious and enraged than the
 most cruel factions that ever arose from interest and ambition.
 
 I have mentioned parties from _affection_ as a kind of _real_ parties,
 beside those from _interest_ and _principle_. By parties from affection,
 I understand those which are founded on the different attachments of men
 towards particular families and persons whom they desire to rule over
 them. These factions are often very violent; though, I must own, it may
 seem unaccountable that men should attach themselves so strongly to
 persons with whom they are nowise acquainted, whom perhaps they never
 saw, and from whom they never received, nor can ever hope for, any
 favour. Yet this we often find to be the case, and even with men, who,
 on other occasions, discover no great generosity of spirit, nor are
 found to be easily transported by friendship beyond their own interest.
 We are apt to think the relation between us and our sovereign very close
 and intimate. The splendour of majesty and power bestows an importance
 on the fortunes even of a single person. And when a man's good-nature
 does not give him this imaginary interest, his ill-nature will, from
 spite and opposition to persons whose sentiments are different from his
 own.
 
 
 [1] Besides I do not find that the _Whites_ in Morocco ever imposed on
 the Blacks any necessity pi altering their complexion, or frightened
 them with inquisitions and penal laws in case of obstinacy. Nor have the
 Blacks been more unreasonable in this particular. But is a man's
 opinion, where he is able to form a real opinion, more at his disposal
 than his complexion? And can one be induced by force or fear to do more
 than paint and disguise in the one case as well as in the other.
 
 [2] I say _in part_; for it is a vulgar error to imagine, that the
 ancients were as great friends to toleration as the English or Dutch are
 at present. The laws against external superstition, among the Romans,
 were as ancient as the time of the Twelve Tables; and the Jews, as well
 as Christians, were sometimes punished by them; though, in general,
 these laws were not rigorously executed. Immediately after the conquest
 of Gaul, they forbade all but the natives to be initiated into the
 religion of the Druids; and this was a kind of persecution. In about a
 century after this conquest, the emperor Claudius quite abolished that
 superstition by penal laws; which would have been a very grievous
 persecution, if the imitation of the Roman manners had not, beforehand,
 weaned the Gauls from their ancient prejudices. Suetonius _in vita
 Claudii_. Pliny ascribes the abolition of the Druidical superstitions to
 Tiberius, probably because that emperor had taken some steps towards
 restraining them (lib. xxx. cap. i). This is an instance of the usual
 caution and moderation of the Romans in such cases; and very different
 from their violent and sanguinary method of treating the Christians.
 Hence we may entertain a suspicion, that those furious persecutions of
 _Christianity_ were in some measure owing to the imprudent zeal and
 bigotry of the first propagators of that sect; and ecclesiastical
 history affords us many reasons to confirm this suspicion.
 
 
 
 
 OF THE PARTIES OF GREAT BRITAIN
 
 
 Were the British government proposed as a subject of speculation, one
 would immediately perceive in it a source of division and party, which
 it would be almost impossible for it, under any administration, to
 avoid. The just balance between the republican and monarchical part of
 our constitution is really in itself so extremely delicate and
 uncertain, that, when joined to men's passions and prejudices, it is
 impossible but different opinions must arise concerning it, even among
 persons of the best understanding. Those of mild tempers, who love peace
 and order, and detest sedition and civil wars, will always entertain
 more favourable sentiments of monarchy than men of bold and generous
 spirits, who are passionate lovers of liberty, and think no evil
 comparable to subjection and slavery. And though all reasonable men
 agree in general to preserve our mixed government, yet, when they come
 to particulars, some will incline to trust greater powers to the crown,
 to bestow on it more influence, and to guard against its encroachments
 with less caution, than others who are terrified at the most distant
 approaches of tyranny and despotic power. Thus are there parties of
 PRINCIPLE involved in the very nature of our constitution, which may
 properly enough he denominated those of COURT and COUNTRY.[1] The
 strength and violence of each of these parties will much depend upon the
 particular administration. An administration may be so bad, as to throw
 a great majority into the opposition; as a good administration will
 reconcile to the court many of the most passionate lovers of liberty.
 But however the nation may fluctuate between them, the parties
 themselves will always subsist, so long as we are governed by a limited
 monarchy.
 
 But, besides this difference of _Principle_, those parties are very much
 fomented by a difference of INTEREST, without which they could scarcely
 ever be dangerous or violent. The crown will naturally bestow all trust
 and power upon those whose principles, real or pretended, are most
 favourable to monarchical government; and this temptation will naturally
 engage them to go greater lengths than their principles would otherwise
 carry them. Their antagonists, who are disappointed in their ambitious
 aims, throw themselves into the party whose sentiments incline them to
 be most jealous of royal power, and naturally carry those sentiments to
 a greater height than sound politics will justify. Thus _Court_ and
 _Country_, which are the genuine offspring of the British government,
 are a kind of mixed parties, and are influenced both by principle and by
 interest. The heads of the factions are commonly most governed by the
 latter motive; the inferior members of them by the former.[2]
 
 As to ecclesiastical parties, we may observe, that, in all ages of the
 world, priests have been enemies to liberty;[3] and, it is certain, that
 this steady conduct of theirs must have been founded on fixed reasons of
 interest and ambition. Liberty of thinking, and of expressing our
 thoughts, is always fatal to priestly power, and to those pious frauds
 on which it is commonly founded; and, by an infallible connection, which
 prevails among all kinds of liberty, this privilege can never be
 enjoyed, at least has never yet been enjoyed, but in a free government.
 Hence it must happen, in such a constitution as that of Great Britain,
 that the established clergy, while things are in their natural
 situation, will always be of the _Court_ party; as, on the contrary,
 dissenters of all kinds will be of the _Country_ party; since they can
 never hope for that toleration which they stand in need of, but by means
 of our free government. All princes that have aimed at despotic power
 have known of what importance it was to gain the established clergy; as
 the clergy, on their part, have shown a great facility in entering into
 the views of such princes. Gustavus Vasa was, perhaps, the only
 ambitious monarch that ever depressed the church, at the same time that
 he discouraged liberty. But the exorbitant power of the bishops in
 Sweden, who at that time overtopped the crown itself, together with
 their attachment to a foreign family, was the reason of his embracing
 such an unusual system of politics.
 
 This observation, concerning propensity of priests to the government of
 a single person, is not true with regard to one sect only. The
 _Presbyterian_ and _Calvinistic_ clergy in Holland, were professed
 friends to the family of Orange; as the _Arminians_, who were esteemed
 heretics, were of the Louvestein faction, and zealous for liberty. But
 if a prince have the choice of both, it is easy to see that he will
 prefer the Episcopal to the Presbyterian form of government, both
 because of the greater affinity between monarchy and episcopacy, and
 because of the facility which he will find, in such a government, of
 ruling the clergy by means of their ecclesiastical superiors.
 
 If we consider the first rise of parties in England, during the great
 rebellion, we shall observe that it was conformable to this general
 theory, and that the species of government gave birth to them by a
 regular and infallible operation. The English constitution, before that
 period, had lain in a kind of confusion, yet so as that the subjects
 possessed many noble privileges, which, though not exactly bounded and
 secured by law, were universally deemed, from long possession, to belong
 to them as their birthright. An ambitious, or rather a misguided, prince
 arose, who deemed all these privileges to be concessions of his
 predecessors, revocable at pleasure; and, in prosecution of this
 principle, he openly acted in violation of liberty during the course of
 several years. Necessity, at last, constrained him to call a parliament;
 the spirit of liberty arose and spread itself; the prince, being without
 any support, was obliged to grant every thing required of him; and his
 enemies, jealous and implacable, set no bounds to their pretensions.
 Here, then, began those contests in which it was no wonder that men of
 that age were divided into different parties; since, even at this day,
 the impartial are at a loss to decide concerning the justice of the
 quarrel. The pretensions of the parliament, if yielded to, broke the
 balance of the constitution, by rendering the government almost
 entirely republican. If not yielded to, the nation was, perhaps, still
 in danger of absolute power, from the settled principles and inveterate
 habits of the king, which had plainly appeared in every concession that
 he had been constrained to make to his people. In this question, so
 delicate and uncertain, men naturally fell to the side which was most
 conformable to their usual principles; and the more passionate favourers
 of monarchy declared for the king, as the zealous friends of liberty
 sided with the parliament. The hopes of success being nearly equal on
 both sides, _interest_ had no general influence in this contest; so that
 ROUNDHEAD and CAVALIER were merely parties of principle, neither of
 which disowned either monarchy or liberty; but the former party inclined
 most to the republican part of our government, the latter to the
 monarchical. In this respect, they may be considered as court and
 country party, inflamed into a civil war, by an unhappy concurrence of
 circumstances, and by the turbulent spirit of the age. The
 commonwealth's men, and the partisans of absolute power, lay concealed
 in both parties, and formed but an inconsiderable part of them.
 
 The clergy had concurred with the king's arbitrary designs; and, in
 return, were allowed to persecute their adversaries, whom they called
 heretics and schismatics. The established clergy were Episcopal, the
 nonconformists Presbyterian; so that all things concurred to throw the
 former, without reserve, into the king's party, and the latter into
 that of the parliament.[4]
 
 Every one knows the event of this quarrel; fatal to the king first, to
 the parliament afterwards. After many confusions and revolutions, the
 royal family was at last restored, and the ancient government
 reestablished. Charles II was not made wiser by the example of his
 father, but prosecuted the same measures, though, at first, with more
 secrecy and caution. New parties arose, under the appellation of _Whig_
 and _Tory_, which have continued ever since to confound and distract our
 government. To determine the nature of these parties is perhaps one of
 the most difficult problems that can be met with, and is a proof that
 history may contain questions as uncertain as any to be found in the
 most abstract sciences. We have seen the conduct of the two parties,
 during the course of seventy years, in a vast variety of circumstances,
 possessed of power, and deprived of it, during peace, and during war:
 persons, who profess themselves of one side or other, we meet with
 every hour, in company, in our pleasures, in our serious occupations we
 ourselves are constrained, in a manner, to take party; and, living in a
 country of the highest liberty, every one may openly declare all the
 sentiments and opinions: yet are we at a loss to tell the nature,
 pretensions, and principles, of the different factions.[5]
 
 When we compare the parties of WHIG and TORY with those of ROUNDHEAD and
 CAVALIER, the most obvious difference that appears between them consists
 in the principles of _passive obedience_, and _indefeasible right_,
 which were but little heard of among the Cavaliers, but became the
 universal doctrine, and were esteemed the true characteristic of a Tory.
 Were these principles pushed into their most obvious consequences, they
 imply a formal renunciation of all our liberties, and an avowal of
 absolute monarchy; since nothing can be greater absurdity than a limited
 power, which must not be resisted, even when it exceeds its limitations.
 But, as the most rational principles are often but a weak counterpoise
 to passion, it is no wonder that these absurd principles were found too
 weak for that effect. The Tories, as men, were enemies to oppression;
 and also as Englishmen, they were enemies to arbitrary power. Their zeal
 for liberty was, perhaps, less fervent than that of their antagonists,
 but was sufficient to make them forget all their general principles,
 when they saw themselves openly threatened with a subversion of the
 ancient government. From these sentiments arose the _Revolution_, an
 event of mighty consequence, and the firmest foundation of British
 liberty. The conduct of the Tories during that event, and after it, will
 afford us a true insight into the nature of that party.
 
 In the _first_ place, they appear to have had the genuine sentiments of
 Britons in their affection for liberty, and in their determined
 resolution not to sacrifice it to any abstract principle whatsoever, or
 to any imaginary rights of princes. This part of their character might
 justly have been doubted of before the Revolution, from the obvious
 tendency of their avowed principles, and from their compliances with a
 court, which seemed to make little secret of its arbitrary designs. The
 Revolution showed them to have been, in this respect, nothing but a
 genuine _court party_, such as might be expected in a British
 government; that is, _lovers of liberty, but greater lovers of
 monarchy_. It must, however, be confessed, that they carried their
 monarchical principles further even in practice, but more so in theory,
 than was in any degree |consistent with a limited government.
 
 _Secondly_, Neither their principles nor affections concurred, entirely
 or heartily, with the settlement made at the _Revolution_, or with that
 which has since taken place. This part of their character may seem
 opposite to the former, since any other settlement, in those
 circumstances of the nation, must probably have been dangerous, if not
 fatal, to liberty. But the heart of man is made to reconcile
 contradictions; and this contradiction is not greater than that between
 _passive obedience_ and the _resistance_ employed at the Revolution. A
 TORY, therefore, since the _Revolution_, may be defined, in a few words,
 to be a _lover of monarchy, though without abandoning liberty, and a
 partisan of the family of Stuart_: _as a WHIG may be defined to be a
 lover of liberty, though without renouncing monarchy, and a friend to
 the settlement in the Protestant line._[6]
 
 These different views, with regard to the settlement of the crown, were
 accidental, but natural, additions, to the principles of the _Court_
 and _Country_ parties, which are the genuine divisions in the British
 Government. A passionate lover of monarchy is apt to be displeased at
 any change of the succession, as savouring too much of a commonwealth: a
 passionate lover of liberty is apt to think that every part of the
 government ought to be subordinate to the interests of liberty.
 
 Some, who will not venture to assert that the _real_ difference between
 Whig and Tory was lost at the _Revolution_, seem inclined to think, that
 the difference is now abolished, and that affairs are so far returned to
 their natural state, that there are at present no other parties among us
 but _Court_ and _Country_; that is, men who, by interest or principle,
 are attached either to monarchy or liberty. The Tories have been so long
 obliged to talk in the republican style, that they seem to have made
 converts of themselves by their hypocrisy, and to have embraced the
 sentiments, as well as language of their adversaries. There are,
 however, very considerable remains of that party in England, with all
 their old prejudices; and a proof that _Court_ and _Country_ are not our
 only parties, is that almost all the dissenters side with the court, and
 the lower clergy, at least of the church or England, with the
 opposition. This may convince us, that some bias still hangs upon our
 constitution, some extrinsic weight, which turns it from its natural
 course, and causes a confusion in our parties.[7]
 
 
 [1] These words have become of general use, and therefore I shall employ
 them without intending to express by them an universal blame of the one
 party, or approbation of the other. The Court party may no doubt, on
 some occasions, consult best the interest of the country, and the
 Country party oppose it. In like manner, the _Roman_ parties were
 denominated Optimates and Populares; and Cicero, like a true party man,
 defines the Optimates to be such as, in all their public conduct,
 regulated themselves by the sentiments of the best and worthiest Romans;
 _pro Sextio_. The term of Country party may afford a favourable
 definition or etymology of the same kind; but it would be folly to draw
 any argument from that head, and I have no regard to it in employing
 these terms.
 
 [2] I must be understood to mean this of persons who have any motive for
 taking party on any side. For, to tell the truth, the greatest part are
 commonly men who associate themselves they know not why; from example,
 from passion, from idleness. But still it is requisite there be some
 source of division, either in principle or interest; otherwise such
 persons would not find parties to which they could associate themselves.
 
 [3] This proposition is true, notwithstanding that, in the early times
 of the English government, the clergy were the great and principal
 opposers of the crown; but at that time their possessions were so
 immensely great, that they composed a considerable part of the
 proprietors of England, and in many contests were direct rivals of the
 crown.
 
 [4] The clergy had concurred in a shameless manner with the King's
 arbitrary designs, according to their usual maxims in such cases, and,
 in return, were allowed to persecute their adversaries, whom they called
 heretics and schismatics. The established clergy were Episcopal, the
 nonconformists Presbyterians; so that all things concurred to throw the
 former, without reserve, into the King's party, and the latter into that
 of the Parliament. The _Cavaliers_ being the Court party, and the
 _Roundheads_ the Country party, the union was infallible betwixt the
 former and the established prelacy, and betwixt the latter and
 Presbyterian nonconformists. This union is so natural, according to the
 general principles of politics, that it requires some very extraordinary
 situation of affairs to break it.
 
 [5] The question is perhaps in itself somewhat difficult, but has been
 rendered more so by the prejudices and violence of party.
 
 [6] The celebrated writer above cited has asserted, that the
 real distinction betwixt _Whig_ and Tory was lost at the _Revolution_,
 and that ever since they have continued to be mere _personal_ parties,
 like the _Guelfs_ and Ghibellines, after the Emperors had lost all
 authority in Italy. Such an opinion, were it received, would turn our
 whole history into an enigma.
 
 I shall first mention, as a proof of a real distinction betwixt these
 parties, what every one may have observed or heard concerning the
 conduct and conversation of all his friends and acquaintance on both
 sides. Have not the _Tories_ always borne an avowed affection to the
 family of _Stuart_, and have not their adversaries always opposed with
 vigour the succession of that family?
 
 The _Tory_ principles are confessedly the most favourable to monarchy.
 Yet the _Tories_ have almost always opposed the court these fifty years;
 nor were they cordial friends to King _William_, even when employed by
 him. Their quarrel, therefore, cannot be supposed to have lain with the
 throne, but with the person who sat on it.
 
 They concurred heartily with the court during the four last years of
 Queen _Anne_. But is any one at a loss to find the reason?
 
 The succession of the crown in the British government is a point of too
 great consequence to be absolutely indifferent to persons who concern
 themselves, in any degree, about the fortune of the public; much less
 can it be supposed that the Tory party, who never valued themselves upon
 moderation, could maintain a _stoical_ indifference in a point of so
 great importance. Were they, therefore, zealous for the house of
 _Hanover_? or was there any thing that kept an opposite zeal from openly
 appearing, if it did not openly appear, but prudence, and a sense of
 decency?
 
 It is monstrous to see an established Episcopal clergy in declared
 opposition to the court, and a nonconformist Presbyterian clergy in
 conjunction with it. What can produce such an unnatural conduct in both?
 Nothing, but that the former have espoused monarchical principles too
 high for the present settlement, which is founded on the principles of
 liberty, and the latter, being afraid of the prevalence of those high
 principles, adhere to that party from whom they have reason to expect
 liberty and toleration.
 
 The different conduct of the two parties, with regard to foreign
 politics, is also a proof to the same purpose. _Holland_ has always been
 most favoured by one, and _France_ by the other. In short, the proofs of
 this kind seem so palpable and evident, that it is almost needless to
 collect them.
 
 It is however remarkable, that though the principles of _Whig_ and
 _Tory_ be both of them of a compound nature, yet the ingredients which
 predominated in both were not correspondent to each other. A _Tory_
 loved monarchy, and bore an affection to the family of _Stuart_; but the
 latter affection was the predominant inclination of the party. A _Whig_
 loved liberty, and was a friend to the settlement in the Protestant
 line; but the love of liberty was professedly his predominant
 inclination. The Tories have frequently acted as republicans, where
 either policy or revenge has engaged them to that conduct; and there was
 none of the party who, upon the supposition that they were to be
 disappointed in their views with regard to the succession, would not
 have desired to impose the strictest limitations on the crown, and to
 bring our form of government as near republican as possible, in order to
 depress the family, that, according to their apprehension, succeeded
 without any just title. The Whigs, it is true, have also taken steps
 dangerous to liberty, under pretext of securing the succession and
 settlement of the crown according to their views; but, as the body of
 the party had no passion for that succession, otherwise than as the
 means of securing liberty, they have been betrayed into these steps by
 ignorance or frailty, or the interest of their leaders. The succession
 of the crown was, therefore, the chief point with the Tories; the
 security of our liberties with the Whigs.
 
 It is difficult to penetrate into the thoughts and sentiments of any
 particular man; but it is almost impossible to distinguish those of a
 whole party, where it often happens that no two persons agree precisely
 in the same way of thinking. Yet I will venture to affirm, that it was
 not so much principle, or an opinion of indefeasible right, that
 attached the Tories to the ancient family, as affection, or a certain
 love and esteem for their persons. The same cause divided England
 formerly betwixt the houses of York and Lancaster, and Scotland betwixt
 the families of Bruce and Baliol, in an age when political disputes were
 but little in fashion, and when political principles must of course have
 had but little influence on mankind. The doctrine of passive obedience
 is so absurd in itself, and so opposite to our liberties, that it seems
 to have been chiefly left to pulpit declaimers, and to their deluded
 followers among the _mob_ Men of better sense were guided by
 _affection_, and as to the leaders of this party, it is probable that
 interest was their sole motive, and that they acted more contrary to
 their private sentiments than the leaders of the opposite party.
 
 Some who will not venture to assert, that the _real_ difference between
 Whig and Tory, was lost at the _Revolution_, seem inclined to think that
 the difference is now abolished, and that affairs are so far returned to
 their natural state, that there are at present no other parties amongst
 us but _Court_ and _Country_; that is, men who, by interest or principle,
 are attached either to Monarchy or to Liberty. It must indeed be
 confessed, that the Tory party seem of late to have decayed much in
 their numbers, still more in their zeal, and I may venture to say, still
 more in their credit and authority. There are few men of knowledge or
 learning, at least few philosophers since Mr. Locke has wrote, who would
 not be ashamed to be thought of that party; and in almost all companies,
 the name of _Old Whig_ is mentioned as an incontestable appellation of
 honour and dignity. Accordingly, the enemies of the ministry, as a
 reproach, call the courtiers the true _Tories_ and, as an honour,
 denominate the gentlemen in the Opposition the true _Whigs_.
 
 I shall conclude this subject with observing, that we never had any
 Tories in Scotland, according to the proper signification of the word,
 and that the division of parties in this country was really into Whigs
 and Jacobites. A Jacobite seems to be a Tory, who has no regard to the
 constitution, but is either a zealous partisan of absolute monarchy, or
 at least willing to sacrifice our liberties to the obtaining the
 succession in that family to which he is attached. The reason of the
 difference betwixt England and Scotland I take to be this. Our political
 and religious divisions in this country have been, since the Revolution,
 regularly correspondent to each other. The Presbyterians were all Whigs,
 without exception; the Episcopalians of the opposite party. And as the
 clergy of the latter sect were turned out of their churches at the
 Revolution, they had no motive to make any compliances with the
 government in their oaths or forms of prayer, but openly avowed the
 highest principles of their party; which is the cause why their
 followers have been more barefaced and violent than their brethren of
 the Tory party in England.
 
 [7] Some of the opinions delivered in these Essays, with regard to the
 public transactions in the last century, the Author, on a more accurate
 examination, found reason to retract in his History of Great Britain.
 And as he would not enslave himself to the systems of either party,
 neither would he fetter his judgment by his own preconceived opinions
 and principles; nor is he ashamed to acknowledge his mistakes. These
 mistakes were indeed, at that time almost universal in this kingdom.
 
 
 
 
 OF SUPERSTITION AND ENTHUSIASM
 
 
 That _the corruption of the best of things produces the worst_, is grown
 into a maxim, and is commonly proved, among other instances, by the
 pernicious effects of _superstition_ and _enthusiasm_, the corruptions
 of true religion.
 
 These two species of false religion, though both pernicious, are yet of
 a very different, and even of a contrary nature. The mind of man is
 subject to certain unaccountable terrors and apprehensions, proceeding
 either from the unhappy situation of private or public affairs, from ill
 health, from a gloomy and melancholy disposition, or from the
 concurrence of all these circumstances. In such a state of mind,
 infinite unknown evils are dreaded from unknown agents; and where real
 objects of terror are wanting, the soul, active to its own prejudice,
 and fostering its predominant inclination, finds imaginary ones, to
 whose power and malevolence it sets no limits. As these enemies are
 entirely invisible and unknown, the methods taken to appease them are
 equally unaccountable, and consist in ceremonies, observances,
 mortifications, sacrifices, presents, or in any practice, however absurd
 or frivolous, which either folly or knavery recommends to a blind and
 terrified credulity. Weakness, fear, melancholy, together with
 ignorance, are, therefore, the true sources of Superstition.
 
 But the mind of man is also subject to an unaccountable elevation and
 presumption, arising from prosperous success, from luxuriant health,
 from strong spirits, or from a bold and confident disposition. In such a
 state of mind, the imagination swells with great, but confused
 conceptions, to which no sublunary beauties or enjoyments can
 correspond. Every thing mortal and perishable vanishes as unworthy of
 attention; and a full range is given to the fancy in the invisible
 regions, or world of Spirits, where the soul is at liberty to indulge
 itself in every imagination, which may best suit its present taste and
 disposition. Hence arise raptures, transports, and surprising flights of
 fancy; and, confidence and presumption still increasing, these raptures,
 being altogether unaccountable, and seeming quite beyond the reach of
 our ordinary faculties, are attributed to the immediate inspiration of
 that Divine Being who is the object of devotion. In a little time, the
 inspired person comes to regard himself as a distinguished favourite of
 the Divinity; and when this phrensy once takes place, which is the
 summit of enthusiasm, every whimsey is consecrated: human reason, and
 even morality, are rejected as fallacious guides, and the fanatic madman
 delivers himself over, blindly and without reserve, to the supposed
 illapses of the Spirit, and to inspiration from above. Hope, pride,
 presumption, a warm imagination, together with ignorance, are therefore
 the true sources of Enthusiasm.
 
 These two species of false religion might afford occasion to many
 speculations, but I shall confine myself, at present, to a few
 reflections concerning their different influence on government and
 society.
 
 My _first_ reflection is, _that superstition is favourable to priestly
 power, and enthusiasm not less, or rather more contrary to it, than
 sound reason and philosophy._ As superstition is founded on fear,
 sorrow, and a depression of spirits, it represents the man to himself in
 such despicable colours, that he appears unworthy, in his own eyes, of
 approaching the Divine presence, and naturally has recourse to any other
 person, whose sanctity of life, or perhaps impudence and cunning, have
 made him be supposed more favoured by the Divinity. To him the
 superstitious intrust their devotions to his care they recommend their
 prayers, petitions, and sacrifices: and by his means, they hope to
 render their addresses acceptable to their incensed Deity. Hence the
 origin of Priests, who may justly be regarded as an invention of a
 timorous and abject superstition, which, ever diffident of itself, dares
 not offer up its own devotions, but ignorantly thinks to recommend
 itself to the Divinity, by the mediation of his supposed friends and
 servants. As superstition is a considerable ingredient in almost all
 religions, even the most fanatical; there being nothing but philosophy
 able entirely to conquer these unaccountable terrors; hence it proceeds,
 that in almost every sect of religion there are priests to be found: but
 the stronger mixture there is of superstition, the higher is the
 authority of the priesthood.
 
 On the other hand, it may be observed, that all enthusiasts have been
 free from the yoke of ecclesiastics, and have expressed great
 independence in their devotion, with a contempt of forms, ceremonies,
 and traditions. The _Quakers_ are the most egregious, though, at the
 same time, the most innocent enthusiasts that have yet been known; and
 are perhaps the only sect that have never admitted priests among them.
 The _Independents_, of all the English sectaries, approach nearest to
 the _Quakers_ in fanaticism, and in their freedom from priestly bondage.
 The _Presbyterians_ follow after, at an equal distance, in both
 particulars. In short, this observation is founded in experience; and
 will also appear to be founded in reason, if we consider, that, as
 enthusiasm arises from a presumptuous pride and confidence, it thinks
 itself sufficiently qualified to _approach_ the Divinity, without any
 human mediator. Its rapturous devotions are so fervent, that it even
 imagines itself _actually_ to _approach_ him by the way of contemplation
 and inward converse; which makes it neglect all those outward ceremonies
 and observances, to which the assistance of the priests appears so
 requisite in the eyes of their superstitious votaries. The fanatic
 consecrates himself, and bestows on his own person a sacred character,
 much superior to what forms and ceremonious institutions can confer on
 any other.
 
 My _second_ reflection with regard to these species of false religion
 is, _that religions which partake of enthusiasm, are, on their first
 rise, more furious and violent than those which partake of superstition;
 but in a little time become more gentle and moderate._ The violence of
 this species of religion, when excited by novelty, and animated by
 opposition, appears from numberless instances; of the _Anabaptists_ in
 Germany, the _Camisars_ in France, the _Levellers_, and other fanatics
 in England, and the _Covenanters_ in Scotland. Enthusiasm being founded
 on strong spirits, and a presumptuous boldness of character, it
 naturally begets the most extreme resolutions; especially after it rises
 to that height as to inspire the deluded fanatic with the opinion of
 Divine illuminations, and with a contempt for the common rules of
 reason, morality, and prudence.
 
 It is thus enthusiasm produces the most cruel disorders in human
 society; but its fury is like that of thunder and tempest, which exhaust
 themselves in a little time, and leave the air more calm and serene than
 before. When the first fire of enthusiasm is spent, men naturally, in
 all fanatical sects, sink into the greatest remissness and coolness in
 sacred matters; there being no body of men among them endowed with
 sufficient authority, whose interest is concerned to support the
 religious spirit; no rites, no ceremonies, no holy observances, which
 may enter into the common train of life, and preserve the sacred
 principles from oblivion. Superstition, on the contrary, steals in
 gradually and insensibly; renders men tame and submissive; is acceptable
 to the magistrate, and seems inoffensive to the people: till at last the
 priest, having firmly established his authority, becomes the tyrant and
 disturber of human society, by his endless contentions, persecutions,
 and religious wars. How smoothly did the Romish church advance in her
 acquisition of power! But into what dismal convulsions did she throw all
 Europe, in order to maintain it! On the other hand, our sectaries, who
 were formerly such dangerous bigots, are now become very free reasoners;
 and the _Quakers_ seem to approach nearly the only regular body of
 _Deists_ in the universe, the _literati_ or the disciples of Confucius
 in China.[1]
 
 My _third_ observation on this head is, _that superstition is an enemy
 to civil liberty, and enthusiasm a friend to it._ As superstition groans
 under the dominion of priests, and enthusiasm is destructive of all
 ecclesiastical power, this sufficiently accounts for the present
 observation. Not to mention that enthusiasm, being the infirmity of bold
 and ambitious tempers, is naturally accompanied with a spirit of
 liberty, as superstition, on the contrary, renders men tame and abject,
 and fits them for slavery. We learn from English history, that, during
 the civil wars, the _Independents_ and _Deists_, though the most
 opposite in their religious principles, yet were united in their
 political ones, and were alike passionate for a commonwealth. And since
 the origin of _Whig_ and _Tory_, the leaders of the _Whigs_ have either
 been _Deists_ or professed _Latitudinarian_s in their principles; that
 is, friends to toleration, and indifferent to any particular sect of
 _Christians_: while the sectaries, who have all a strong tincture of
 enthusiasm, have always, without exception, concurred with that party in
 defence of civil liberty. The resemblance in their superstitions long
 united the High-Church _Tories_ and the _Roman Catholics_, in support of
 prerogative and kingly power, though experience of the tolerating spirit
 of the _Whigs_ seems of late to have reconciled the _Catholics_ to that
 party.
 
 The _Molinists_ and _Jansenists_ in France have a thousand
 unintelligible disputes, which are not worthy the reflection of a man of
 sense: but what principally distinguishes these two sects, and alone
 merits attention, is the different spirit of their religion. The
 _Molinists_, conducted by the _Jesuits_, are great friends to
 superstition, rigid observers of external forms and ceremonies, and
 devoted to the authority of the priests, and to tradition. The
 _Jansenists_ are enthusiasts, and zealous promoters of the passionate
 devotion, and of the inward life, little influenced by authority, and,
 in a word, but half Catholics. The consequences are exactly conformable
 to the foregoing reasoning. The _Jesuits_ are the tyrants of the people,
 and the slaves of the court; and the _Jansenists_ preserve alive the
 small sparks of the love of liberty which are to be found in the French
 nation.
 
 
 [1] The Chinese literati have no priests or ecclesiastical
 establishment.
 
 
 
 
 OF THE DIGNITY OR MEANNESS OF HUMAN NATURE
 
 
 There are certain sects which secretly form themselves in the learned
 world, as well as factions in the political; and though sometimes they
 come not to an open rupture, they give a different turn to the ways of
 thinking of those who have taken part on either side. The most
 remarkable of this kind are the sects founded on the different
 sentiments with regard to the _dignity of human nature_; which is a
 point that seems to have divided philosophers and poets, as well as
 divines, from the beginning of the world to this day. Some exalt our
 species to the skies, and represent man as a kind of human demigod, who
 derives his origin from heaven, and retains evident marks of his lineage
 and descent. Others insist upon the blind sides of human nature, and can
 discover nothing, except vanity, in which man surpasses the other
 animals, whom he affects so much to despise. If an author possess the
 talent of rhetoric and declamation, he commonly takes part with the
 former: if his turn lie towards irony and ridicule, he naturally throws
 himself into the other extreme.
 
 I am far from thinking that all those who have depreciated our species
 have been enemies to virtue, and have exposed the frailties of their
 fellow-creatures with any bad intention. On the contrary, I am sensible
 that a delicate sense of morals, especially when attended with a
 splenetic temper, is apt to give a man a disgust of the world, and to
 make him consider the common course of human affairs with too much
 indignation. I must, however, be of opinion, that the sentiments of
 those who are inclined to think favourably of mankind, are more
 advantageous to virtue than the contrary principles, which give us a
 mean opinion of our nature. When a man is prepossessed with a high
 notion of his rank and character in the creation, he will naturally
 endeavour to act up to it, and will scorn to do a base or vicious action
 which might sink him below that figure which he makes in his own
 imagination. Accordingly, we find, that all our polite and fashionable
 moralists insist upon this topic, and endeavour to represent vice
 unworthy of man, as well as odious in itself.[1]
 
 We find new disputes that are not founded on some ambiguity in the
 expression; and I am persuaded that the present dispute, concerning the
 dignity or meanness of human nature, is not more exempt from it than any
 other. It may therefore be worth while to consider what is real, and
 what is only verbal, in this controversy.
 
 That there is a natural difference between merit and demerit, virtue and
 vice, wisdom and folly, no reasonable man will deny, yet it is evident
 that, in affixing the term, which denotes either our approbation or
 blame, we are commonly more influenced by comparison than by any fixed
 unalterable standard in the nature of things. In like manner, quantity,
 and extension, and bulk, are by every one acknowledged to be real
 things: but when we call any animal _great_ or _little_, we always form
 a secret comparison between that animal and others of the same species;
 and it is that comparison which regulates our judgment concerning its
 greatness. A dog and a horse may be of the very same size, while the one
 is admired for the greatness of its bulk, and the other for the
 smallness. When I am present, therefore, at any dispute, I always
 consider with myself whether it be a question of comparison or not that
 is the subject of controversy; and if it be, whether the disputants
 compare the same objects together, or talk of things that are widely
 different.
 
 In forming our notions of human nature, we are apt to make a comparison
 between men and animals, the only creatures endowed with thought that
 fall under our senses. Certainly this comparison is favourable to
 mankind. On the one hand, we see a creature whose thoughts are not
 limited by any narrow bounds, either of place or time; who carries his
 researches into the most distant regions of this globe, and beyond this
 globe, to the planets and heavenly bodies; looks backward to consider
 the first origin, at least the history of the human race; casts his eye
 forward to see the influence of his actions upon posterity and the
 judgments which will be formed of his character a thousand years hence;
 a creature, who traces causes and effects to a great length and
 intricacy, extracts general principles from particular appearances;
 improves upon his discoveries; corrects his mistakes; and makes his very
 errors profitable. On the other hand, we are presented with a creature
 the very reverse of this; limited in its observations and reasonings to
 a few sensible objects which surround it; without curiosity, without
 foresight; blindly conducted by instinct, and attaining, in a short
 time, its utmost perfection, beyond which it is never able to advance a
 single step. What a wide difference is there between these creatures!
 And how exalted a notion must we entertain of the former, in comparison
 of the latter.
 
 There are two means commonly employed to destroy this conclusion:
 _First_, By making an unfair representation of the case, and insisting
 only upon the weakness of human nature. And, _secondly_, By forming a
 new and secret comparison between man and beings of the most perfect
 wisdom. Among the other excellences of man, this is one, that he can
 form an idea of perfections much beyond what he has experience of in
 himself; and is not limited in his conception of wisdom and virtue. He
 can easily exalt his notions, and conceive a degree of knowledge, which,
 when compared to his own, will make the latter appear very contemptible,
 and will cause the difference between that and the sagacity of animals,
 in a manner, to disappear and vanish. Now this being a point in which
 all the world is agreed, that human understanding falls infinitely short
 of perfect wisdom, it is proper we should know when this comparison
 takes place, that we may not dispute where there is no real difference
 in our sentiments. Man falls much more short of perfect wisdom, and even
 of his own ideas of perfect wisdom, than animals do of man; yet the
 latter difference is so considerable, that nothing but a comparison with
 the former can make it appear of little moment.
 
 It is also usual to _compare_ one man with another; and finding very few
 whom we can call _wise_ or _virtuous_, we are apt to entertain a
 contemptible notion of our species in general. That we may be sensible
 of the fallacy of this way of reasoning, we may observe, that the
 honourable appellations of wise and virtuous are not annexed to any
 particular degree of those qualities of _wisdom_ and _virtue_, but arise
 altogether from the comparison we make between one man and another. When
 we find a man who arrives at such a pitch of wisdom, as is very
 uncommon, we pronounce him a wise man: so that to say there are few wise
 men in the world, is really to say nothing; since it is only by their
 scarcity that they merit that appellation. Were the lowest of our
 species as wise as Tully or Lord Bacon, we should still have reason to
 say that there are few wise men. For in that case we should exalt our
 notions of wisdom, and should not pay a singular homage to any one who
 was not singularly distinguished by his talents. In like manner, I have
 heard it observed by thoughtless people, that there are few women
 possessed of beauty in comparison of those who want it; not considering
 that we bestow the epithet of _beautiful_ only on such as possess a
 degree of beauty that is common to them with a few. The same degree of
 beauty in a woman is called deformity, which is treated as real beauty
 in one of our sex.
 
 As it is usual, in forming a notion of our species, to _compare_ it with
 the other species above or below it, or to compare the individuals of
 the species among themselves; so we often compare together the different
 motives or actuating principles of human nature, in order to regulate
 our judgment concerning it. And, indeed, this is the only kind of
 comparison which is worth our attention, or decides any thing in the
 present question. Were our selfish and vicious principles so much
 predominant above our social and virtuous, as is asserted by some
 philosophers, we ought undoubtedly to entertain a contemptible notion of
 human nature.[2]
 
 There is much of a dispute of words in all this controversy. When a man
 denies the sincerity of all public spirit or affection to a country and
 community, I am at a loss what to think of him. Perhaps he never felt
 this passion in so clear and distinct a manner as to remove all his
 doubts concerning its force and reality. But when he proceeds afterwards
 to reject all private friendship, if no interest or self-love intermix
 itself; I am then confident that he abuses terms, and confounds the
 ideas of things; since it is impossible for any one to be so selfish, or
 rather so stupid, as to make no difference between one man and another,
 and give no preference to qualities which engage his approbation and
 esteem. Is he also, say I, as insensible to anger as he pretends to be
 to friendship? And does injury and wrong no more affect him than
 kindness or benefits? Impossible: he does not know himself: he has
 forgotten the movements of his heart; or rather, he makes use of a
 different language from the rest of his countrymen and calls not things
 by their proper names. What say you of natural affection? (I subjoin),
 Is that also a species of self-love? Yes; all is self-love. _Your_
 children are loved only because they are yours: _your_ friend for a like
 reason; and _your_ country engages you only so far as it has a
 connection with _yourself_. Were the idea of self removed, nothing
 would affect you: you would be altogether unactive and insensible: or,
 if you ever give yourself any movement, it would only be from vanity,
 and a desire of fame and reputation to this same self. I am willing,
 reply I, to receive your interpretation of human actions, provided you
 admit the facts. That species of self-love which displays itself in
 kindness to others, you must allow to have great influence over human
 actions, and even greater, on many occasions, than that which remains in
 its original shape and form. For how few are there, having a family,
 children, and relations, who do not spend more on the maintenance and
 education of these than on their own pleasures? This, indeed, you justly
 observe, may proceed from their self-love, since the prosperity of their
 family and friends is one, or the chief of their pleasures, as well as
 their chief honour. Be you also one of these selfish men, and you are
 sure of every one's good opinion and good-will; or, not to shock your
 ears with their expressions, the self-love of every one, and mine among
 the rest, will then incline us to serve you, and speak well of you.
 
 In my opinion, there are two things which have led astray those
 philosophers that have insisted so much on the selfishness of man. In
 the _first_ place, they found that every act of virtue or friendship was
 attended with a secret pleasure; whence they concluded, that friendship
 and virtue could not be disinterested. But the fallacy of this is
 obvious. The virtuous sentiment or passion produces the pleasure, and
 does not arise from it. I feel a pleasure in doing good to my friend,
 because I love him; but do not love him for the sake of that pleasure.
 
 In the _second_ place, it has always been found, that the virtuous are
 far from being indifferent to praise; and therefore they have been
 represented as a set of vainglorious men, who had nothing in view but
 the applauses of others. But this also is a fallacy. It is very unjust
 in the world, when they find any tincture of vanity in a laudable
 action, to depreciate it upon that account, or ascribe it entirely to
 that motive. The case is not the same with vanity, as with other
 passions. Where avarice or revenge enters into any seemingly virtuous
 action, it is difficult for us to determine how far it enters, and it is
 natural to suppose it the sole actuating principle. But vanity is so
 closely allied to virtue, and to love the fame of laudable actions
 approaches so near the love of laudable actions for their own sake, that
 these passions are more capable of mixture, than any other kinds of
 affection; and it is almost impossible to have the latter without some
 degree of the former. Accordingly we find, that this passion for glory
 is always warped and varied according to the particular taste or
 disposition of the mind on which it falls. Nero had the same vanity in
 driving a chariot, that Trajan had in governing the empire with justice
 and ability. To love the glory of virtuous deeds is a sure proof of the
 love of virtue.
 
 
 [1] Women are generally much more flattered in their youth than men,
 which may proceed from this reason among others, that their chief point
 of honour is considered as much more difficult than ours, and requires
 to be supported by all that decent pride which can be instilled into
 them.
 
 [2] I may perhaps treat more fully of this subject in some future Essay.
 In the meantime I shall observe, what has been proved beyond question by
 several great moralists of the present age, that the social passions are
 by far the most powerful of any, and that even all the other passions,
 receive from them their chief force and influence. Whoever desires to
 see this question treated at large, with the greatest force of argument
 and eloquence, may consult my Lord Shaftesbury's Enquiry concerning
 Virtue.
 
 
 
 
 OF CIVIL LIBERTY
 
 
 Those who employ their pens on political subjects, free from party rage,
 and party prejudices, cultivate a science, which, of all others,
 contributes most to public utility, and even to the private satisfaction
 of those who addict themselves to the study of it. I am apt, however, to
 entertain a suspicion, that the world is still too young to fix many
 general truths in politics, which will remain true to the latest
 posterity. We have not as yet had experience of three thousand years; so
 that not only the art of reasoning is still imperfect in this science,
 as in all others, but we even want sufficient materials upon which we
 can reason. It is not fully known what degree of refinement, either in
 virtue or vice, human nature is susceptible of, nor what may be expected
 of mankind from any great revolution in their education, customs, or
 principles. Machiavel was certainly a great genius; but, having confined
 his study to the furious and tyrannical governments of ancient times, or
 to the little disorderly principalities of Italy, his reasonings,
 especially upon monarchical government, have been found extremely
 defective; and there scarcely is any maxim in his _Prince_ which
 subsequent experience has not entirely refuted. 'A weak prince,' says
 he, 'is incapable of receiving good counsel; for, if he consult with
 several, he will not be able to choose among their different counsels.
 If he abandon himself to one, that minister may perhaps have capacity,
 but he will not long be a minister. He will be sure to dispossess his
 master, and place himself and his family upon the throne.' I mention
 this, among many instances of the errors of that politician, proceeding,
 in a great measure, from his having lived in too early an age of the
 world, to be a good judge of political truth. Almost all the princes of
 Europe are at present governed by their ministers, and have been so for
 near two centuries, and yet no such event has ever happened, or can
 possibly happen. Sejanus might project dethroning the Caesars, but
 Fleury, though ever so vicious, could not, while in his senses,
 entertain the least hopes of dispossessing the Bourbons.
 
 Trade was never esteemed an affair of state till the last century; and
 there scarcely is any ancient writer on politics who has made mention of
 it. Even the Italians have kept a profound silence with regard to it,
 though it has now engaged the chief attention, as well of ministers of
 state, as of speculative reasoners. The great opulence, grandeur, and
 military achievements of the two maritime powers, seem first to have
 instructed mankind in the importance of an extensive commerce.
 
 Having therefore intended, in this Essay, to make a full comparison of
 civil liberty and absolute government, and to show the great advantages
 of the former above the latter; I began to entertain a suspicion that no
 man in this age was sufficiently qualified for such an undertaking, and
 that, whatever any one should advance on that head, would in all
 probability be refuted by further experience, and be rejected by
 posterity. Such mighty revolutions have happened in human affairs, and
 so many events have arisen contrary to the expectation of the ancients,
 that they are sufficient to beget the suspicion of still further
 changes.
 
 It had been observed by the ancients, that all the arts and sciences
 arose among free nations; and that the Persians and Egyptians,
 notwithstanding their ease, opulence, and luxury, made but faint efforts
 towards a relish in those finer pleasures, which were carried to such
 perfection by the Greeks, amidst continual wars, attended with poverty,
 and the greatest simplicity of life and manners. It had also been
 observed, that, when the Greeks lost their liberty, though they
 increased mightily in riches by means of the conquests of Alexander, yet
 the arts, from that moment, declined among them, and have never since
 been able to raise their head in that climate. Learning was transplanted
 to Rome, the only free nation at that time in the universe; and having
 met with so favourable a soil, it made prodigious shoots for above a
 century; till the decay of liberty produced also the decay of letters,
 and spread a total barbarism over the world. From these two
 experiments, of which, each was double in its kind, and showed the fall
 of learning in absolute governments, as well as its rise in popular
 ones, Longinus thought himself sufficiently justified in asserting that
 the arts and sciences could never flourish but in a free government. And
 in this opinion he has been followed by several eminent writers[1] in
 our own country, who either confined their view merely to ancient facts,
 or entertained too great a partiality in favour of that form of
 government established among us.
 
 But what would these writers have said to the instances of modern Rome
 and Florence? Of which the former carried to perfection all the finer
 arts of sculpture, painting, and music, as well as poetry, though it
 groaned under tyranny, and under the tyranny of priests, while the
 latter made its chief progress in the arts and sciences after it began
 to lose its liberty by the usurpation of the family of Medici. Ariosto,
 Tasso, Galileo, no more than Raphael or Michael Angelo, were born in
 republics. And though the Lombard school was famous as well as the
 Roman, yet the Venetians have had the smallest share in its honours, and
 seem rather inferior to the other Italians in their genius for the arts
 and sciences. Rubens established his school at Antwerp, not at
 Amsterdam. Dresden, not Hamburg, is the centre of politeness in Germany.
 
 But the most eminent instance of the flourishing of learning in absolute
 governments is that of France, which scarcely ever enjoyed any
 established liberty, and yet has carried the arts and sciences as near
 perfection as any other nation. The English are, perhaps, greater
 philosophers; the Italians better painters and musicians; the Romans
 were greater orators; but the French are the only people, except the
 Greeks, who have been at once philosophers, poets, orators, historians,
 painters, architects, sculptors, and musicians. With regard to the
 stage, they have excelled even the Greeks, who far excelled the English.
 And, in common life, they have, in a great measure, perfected that art,
 the most useful and agreeable of any, _l'Art de Vivre_, the art of
 society and conversation.
 
 If we consider the state of the sciences and polite arts in our own
 country, Horace's observation, with regard to the Romans, may in a great
 measure be applied to the British.
 
           Sed in longum tamen aevum
      Manserunt, hodieque manent _vestigia ruris_.
 
 The elegance and propriety of style have been very much neglected among
 us. We have no dictionary of our language, and scarcely a tolerable
 grammar. The first polite prose we have was writ by a man who is still
 alive.[2] As to Sprat, Locke, and even Temple, they knew too little of
 the rules of art to be esteemed elegant writers. The prose of Bacon,
 Harrington, and Milton, is altogether stiff and pedantic, though their
 sense be excellent. Men, in this country, have been so much occupied in
 the great disputes of _Religion_, _Politics_, and _Philosophy_, that
 they had no relish for the seemingly minute observations of grammar and
 criticism. And, though this turn of thinking must have considerably
 improved our sense and our talent of reasoning, it must be confessed,
 that even in those sciences above mentioned, we have not any standard
 book which we can transmit to posterity: and the utmost we have to boast
 of, are a few essays towards a more just philosophy, which indeed
 promise well, but have not as yet reached any degree of perfection.
 
 It has become an established opinion, that commerce can never flourish
 but in a free government; and this opinion seems to be founded on a
 longer and larger experience than the foregoing, with regard to the arts
 and sciences. If we trace commerce in its progress through Tyre, Athens,
 Syracuse, Carthage, Venice, Florence, Genoa, Antwerp, Holland, England,
 &c, we shall always find it to have fixed its seat in free governments.
 The three greatest trading towns now in Europe, are London, Amsterdam,
 and Hamburg; all free cities, and Protestant cities; that is, enjoying a
 double liberty. It must, however, be observed, that the great jealousy
 entertained of late with regard to the commerce of France, seems to
 prove that this maxim is no more certain and infallible than the
 foregoing, and that the subjects of an absolute prince may become our
 rivals in commerce as well as in learning.
 
 Durst I deliver my opinion in an affair of so much uncertainty, I would
 assert, that notwithstanding the efforts of the French, there is
 something hurtful to commerce inherent in the very nature of absolute
 government, and inseparable from it; though the reason I should assign
 for this opinion is somewhat different from that which is commonly
 insisted on. Private property seems to me almost as secure in a
 civilized European monarchy as in a republic, nor is danger much
 apprehended, in such a government, from the violence of the sovereign,
 more than we commonly dread harm from thunder, or earthquakes, or any
 accident the most unusual and extraordinary. Avarice, the spur of
 industry, is so obstinate a passion, and works its way through so many
 real dangers and difficulties, that it is not likely to be scared by an
 imaginary danger, which is so small, that it scarcely admits of
 calculation. Commerce, therefore, in my opinion, is apt to decay in
 absolute governments, not because it is there less secure, but because
 it is less _honourable_. A subordination of rank is absolutely necessary
 to the support of monarchy. Birth, titles, and place, must be honoured
 above industry and riches; and while these notions prevail, all the
 considerable traders will be tempted to throw up their commerce, in
 order to purchase some of those employments, to which privileges and
 honours are annexed.
 
 Since I am upon this head, of the alterations which time has produced,
 or may produce in politics, I must observe, that all kinds of
 government, free and absolute, seem to have undergone in modern times, a
 great change for the better, with regard both to foreign and domestic
 management. The _balance_ of power is a secret in politics, fully known
 only to the present age; and I must add, that the internal police of
 states has also received great improvements within the last century. We
 are informed by Sallust, that Catiline's army was much augmented by the
 accession of the highwaymen about Rome; though I believe, that all of
 that profession who are at present dispersed over Europe would not
 amount to a regiment. In Cicero's pleadings for Milo, I find this
 argument, among others, made use of to prove that his client had not
 assassinated Clodius. Had Milo, said he, intended to have killed
 Clodius, he had not attacked him in the daytime, and at such a distance
 from the city; he had waylaid him at night, near the suburbs, where it
 might have been pretended that he was killed by robbers; and the
 frequency of the accident would have favoured the deceit. This is a
 surprising proof of the loose policy of Rome, and of the number and
 force of these robbers, since Clodius was at that time attended by
 thirty slaves, who were completely armed, and sufficiently accustomed to
 blood and danger in the frequent tumults excited by that seditious
 tribune.
 
 But though all kinds of government be improved in modern times, yet
 monarchical government seems to have made the greatest advances towards
 perfection. It may now be affirmed of civilized monarchies, what was
 formerly said in praise of republics alone, _that they are a government
 of Laws, not of Men._ They are found susceptible of order, method, and
 constancy, to a surprising degree. Property is there secure, industry
 encouraged, the arts flourish, and the prince lives secure among his
 subjects, like a father among his children. There are, perhaps, and have
 been for two centuries, near two hundred absolute princes, great and
 small, in Europe; and allowing twenty years to each reign, we may
 suppose, that there have been in the whole two thousand monarchs, or
 tyrants, as the Greeks would have called them; yet of these there has
 not been one, not even Philip II of Spain, so bad as Tiberius, Caligula,
 Nero, or Domitian, who were four in twelve among the Roman emperors. It
 must, however, be confessed, that though monarchical governments have
 approached nearer to popular ones in gentleness and stability, they are
 still inferior. Our modern education and customs instil more humanity
 and moderation than the ancient; but have not as yet been able to
 overcome entirely the disadvantages of that form of government.
 
 But here I must beg leave to advance a conjecture, which seems probable,
 but which posterity alone can fully judge of. I am apt to think, that in
 monarchical governments there is a source of improvement, and in popular
 governments a source of degeneracy, which in time will bring these
 species of civil polity still nearer an equality. The greatest abuses
 which arise in France, the most perfect model of pure monarchy, proceed
 not from the number or weight of the taxes, beyond what are to be met
 with in free countries; but from the expensive, unequal, arbitrary, and
 intricate method of levying them, by which the industry of the poor,
 especially of the peasants and farmers, is in a great measure
 discouraged, and agriculture rendered a beggarly and slavish employment.
 But to whose advantage do these abuses tend? If to that of the nobility,
 they might be esteemed inherent in that form of government, since the
 nobility are the true supports of monarchy; and it is natural their
 interest should be more consulted in such a constitution, than that of
 the people. But the nobility are, in reality, the chief losers by this
 oppression, since it ruins their estates, and beggars their tenants. The
 only gainers by it are the _Financiers_, a race of men rather odious to
 the nobility and the whole kingdom. If a prince or minister, therefore,
 should arise, endowed with sufficient discernment to know his own and
 the public interest, and with sufficient force of mind to break through
 ancient customs, we might expect to see these abuses remedied; in which
 case, the difference between that absolute government and our free one
 would not appear so considerable as at present.
 
 The source of degeneracy which may be remarked in free governments,
 consists in the practice of contracting debt, and mortgaging the public
 revenues, by which taxes may, in time, become altogether intolerable,
 and all the property of the state be brought into the hands of the
 public The practice is of modern date. The Athenians, though governed by
 a republic, paid near two hundred per cent. for those sums of money
 which any emergence made it necessary for them to borrow; as we learn
 from Xenophon. Among the moderns, the Dutch first introduced the
 practice of borrowing great sums at low interest, and have wellnigh
 ruined themselves by it. Absolute princes have also contracted debt; but
 as an absolute prince may make a bankruptcy when he pleases, his people
 can never be oppressed by his debts. In popular governments, the people,
 and chiefly those who have the highest offices, being commonly the
 public creditors, it is difficult for the state to make use of tills
 remedy, which, however it may sometimes be necessary, is always cruel
 and barbarous. This, therefore, seems to be an inconvenience which
 nearly threatens all free governments, especially our own, at the
 present juncture of affairs. And what a strong motive is this to
 increase our frugality of public money, lest, for want of it, we be
 reduced, by the multiplicity of taxes, or, what is worse, by our public
 impotence and inability for defence, to curse our very liberty, and wish
 ourselves in the same state of servitude with all the nations who
 surround us?

 OF ELOQUENCE
 
 
 Those who consider the periods and revolutions of human kind, as
 represented in history, are entertained with a spectacle full of
 pleasure and variety, and see with surprise the manners, customs, and
 opinions of the same species susceptible of such prodigious changes in
 different periods of time. It may, however, be observed, that, in
 _civil_ history, there is found a much greater uniformity than in the
 history of learning and science, and that the wars, negotiations, and
 politics of one age, resemble more those of another than the taste, wit,
 and speculative principles. Interest and ambition, honour and shame,
 friendship and enmity, gratitude and revenge, are the prime movers in
 all public transactions; and these passions are of a very stubborn and
 untractable nature, in comparison of the sentiments and understanding,
 which are easily varied by education and example. The Goths were much
 more inferior to the Romans in taste and science than in courage and
 virtue.
 
 But not to compare together nations so widely different, it may be
 observed, that even this latter period of human learning is, in many
 respects, of an opposite character to the ancient; and that, if we be
 superior in philosophy, we are still, notwithstanding all our
 refinements, much inferior in eloquence.
 
 In ancient times, no work of genius was thought to require so great
 parts and capacity as the speaking in public; and some eminent writers
 have pronounced the talents even of a great poet or philosopher to be of
 an inferior nature to those which are requisite for such an undertaking.
 Greece and Rome produced, each of them, but one accomplished orator;
 and, whatever praises the other celebrated speakers might merit, they
 were still esteemed much inferior to those great models of eloquence. It
 is observable, that the ancient critics could scarcely find two orators
 in any age who deserved to be placed precisely in the same rank, and
 possessed the same degree of merit. Calvus, Caelius, Curio, Hortensius,
 Caesar, rose one above another: but the greatest of that age was inferior
 to Cicero, the most eloquent speaker that had ever appeared in Rome.
 Those of fine taste, however, pronounced this judgment of the Roman
 orator, as well as of the Grecian, that both of them surpassed in
 eloquence all that had ever appeared, but that they were far from
 reaching the perfection of their art, which was infinite, and not only
 exceeded human force to attain, but human imagination to conceive.
 Cicero declares himself dissatisfied with his own performances, nay,
 even with those of Demosthenes. _Ita sunt avidae et capaces meae aures,_
 says he, _et semper aliquid immensum infinitumque desiderant._
 
 Of all the polite and learned nations, England alone possesses a popular
 government, or admits into the legislature such numerous assemblies as
 can be supposed to lie under the dominion of eloquence. But what has
 England to boast of in this particular? In enumerating the great men who
 have done honour to our country, we exult in our poets and philosophers;
 but what orators are ever mentioned? or where are the monuments of their
 genius to be met with? There are found, indeed, in our histories, the
 names of several, who directed the resolutions of our parliament: but
 neither themselves nor others have taken the pains to preserve their
 speeches, and the authority, which they possessed, seems to have been
 owing to their experience, wisdom, or power, more than to their talents
 for oratory. At present there are above half a dozen speakers in the two
 Houses, who, in the judgment of the public, have reached very near the
 same pitch of eloquence; and no man pretends to give any one the
 preference above the rest. This seems to me a certain proof, that none
 of them have attained much beyond a mediocrity in their art, and that
 the species of eloquence, which they aspire to, gives no exercise to the
 sublimer faculties of the mind, but may be reached by ordinary talents
 and a slight application. A hundred cabinet-makers in London can work a
 table or a chair equally well; but no one poet can write verses with
 such spirit and elegance as Mr. Pope.
 
 We are told, that, when Demosthenes was to plead, all ingenious men
 flocked to Athens from the most remote parts of Greece, as to the most
 celebrated spectacle of the world. At London, you may see men sauntering
 in the court of requests, while the most important debate is carrying on
 in the two Houses; and many do not think themselves sufficiently
 compensated for the losing of their dinners, by all the eloquence of our
 most celebrated speakers. When old Cibber is to act, the curiosity of
 several is more excited, than when our prime minister is to defend
 himself from a motion for his removal or impeachment.
 
 Even a person, unacquainted with the noble remains of ancient orators,
 may judge, from a few strokes, that the style or species of their
 eloquence was infinitely more sublime than that which modern orators
 aspire to. How absurd would it appear, in our temperate and calm
 speakers, to make use of an _Apostrophe_, like that noble one of
 Demosthenes, so much celebrated by Quintilian and Longinus, when,
 justifying the unsuccessful battle of Chaeronea, he breaks out, 'No, my
 fellow-citizens. No: you have not erred. I swear by the _manes_ of those
 heroes, who fought for the same cause in the plains of Marathon and
 Plataea.' Who could now endure such a bold and poetical figure as that
 which Cicero employs, after describing, in the most tragical terms, the
 crucifixion of a Roman citizen? 'Should I paint the horrors of this
 scene, not to Roman citizens, not to the allies of our state, not to
 those who have ever heard of the Roman name, not even to men, but to
 brute creatures; or, to go further, should I lift up my voice in the
 most desolate solitude, to the rocks and mountains, yet should I surely
 see those rude and inanimate parts of nature moved with horror and
 indignation at the recital of so enormous an action.' With what a blaze
 of eloquence must such a sentence be surrounded to give it grace, or
 cause it to make any impression on the hearers! And what noble art and
 sublime talents are requisite to arrive, by just degrees, at a sentiment
 so bold and excessive! To inflame the audience, so as to make them
 accompany the speaker in such violent passions, and such elevated
 conceptions; and to conceal, under a torrent of eloquence, the artifice
 by which all this is effectuated! Should this sentiment even appear to
 us excessive, as perhaps justly it may, it will at least serve to give
 an idea of the style of ancient eloquence, where such swelling
 expressions were not rejected as wholly monstrous and gigantic.
 
 Suitable to this vehemence of thought and expression, was the vehemence
 of action, observed in the ancient orators. The _supplosio pedis_, or
 stamping with the foot, was one of the most usual and moderate gestures
 which they made use of; though that is now esteemed too violent, either
 for the senate, bar, or pulpit, and is only admitted into the theatre
 to accompany the most violent passions which are there represented.
 
 One is somewhat at a loss to what cause we may ascribe so sensible a
 decline of eloquence in latter ages. The genius of mankind, at all
 times, is perhaps equal: the moderns have applied themselves, with great
 industry and success, to all the other arts and sciences: and a learned
 nation possesses a popular government; a circumstance which seems
 requisite for the full display of these noble talents: but
 notwithstanding all these advantages, our progress in eloquence is very
 inconsiderable, in comparison of the advances which we have made in all
 other parts of learning.
 
 Shall we assert, that the strains of ancient eloquence are unsuitable to
 our age, and ought not to be imitated by modern orators? Whatever
 reasons may be made use of to prove this, I am persuaded they will be
 found, upon examination, to be unsound and unsatisfactory.
 
 _First_, It may be said, that, in ancient times, during the flourishing
 period of Greek and Roman learning, the municipal laws, in every state,
 were but few and simple, and the decision of causes was, in a great
 measure, left to the equity and common sense of the judges. The study of
 the laws was not then a laborious occupation, requiring the drudgery of
 a whole life to finish it, and incompatible with every other study or
 profession. The great statesmen and generals among the Romans were all
 lawyers; and Cicero, to show the facility of acquiring this science,
 declares, that in the midst of all his occupations, he would undertake,
 in a few days, to make himself a complete civilian. Now, where a pleader
 addresses himself to the equity of his judges, he has much more room to
 display his eloquence, than where he must draw his arguments from strict
 laws, statutes, and precedents. In the former case many circumstances
 must be taken in, many personal considerations regarded, and even favour
 and inclination, which it belongs to the orator, by his art and
 eloquence, to conciliate, may be disguised under the appearance of
 equity. But how shall a modern lawyer have leisure to quit his toilsome
 occupations, in order to gather the flowers of Parnassus? Or what
 opportunity shall we have of displaying them, amidst the rigid and
 subtile arguments, objections, and replies, which he is obliged to make
 use of? The greatest genius, and greatest orator, who should pretend to
 plead before the _Chancellor_, after a month's study of the laws, would
 only labour to make himself ridiculous.
 
 I am ready to own, that this circumstance, of the multiplicity and
 intricacy of laws, is a discouragement to eloquence in modern times; but
 I assert, that it will not entirely account for the decline of that
 noble art. It may banish oratory from Westminster Hall, but not from
 either house of Parliament. Among the Athenians, the Areopagites
 expressly forbade all allurements of eloquence; and some have
 pretended, that in the Greek orations, written in the _judiciary_ form,
 there is not so bold and rhetorical a style as appears in the Roman. But
 to what a pitch did the Athenians carry their eloquence in the
 _deliberative_ kind, when affairs of state were canvassed, and the
 liberty, happiness, and honour of the republic, were the subject of
 debate! Disputes of this nature elevate the genius above all others, and
 give the fullest scope to eloquence; and such disputes are very frequent
 in this nation.
 
 _Secondly_, It may be pretended, that the decline of eloquence is owing
 to the superior good sense of the moderns, who reject with disdain all
 those rhetorical tricks employed to seduce the judges, and will admit of
 nothing but solid argument in any debate or deliberation. If a man be
 accused of murder, the fact must be proved by witnesses and evidence,
 and the laws will afterwards determine the punishment of the criminal.
 It would be ridiculous to describe, in strong colours, the horror and
 cruelty of the action; to introduce the relations of the dead, and, at a
 signal, make them throw themselves at the feet of the judges, imploring
 justice, with tears and lamentations: and still more ridiculous would it
 be, to employ a picture representing the bloody deed, in order to move
 the judges by the display of so tragical a spectacle, though we know
 that this artifice was sometimes practised by the pleaders of old. Now,
 banish the pathetic from public discourses, and you reduce the speakers
 merely to modern eloquence; that is, to good sense, delivered in proper
 expressions.
 
 Perhaps it may be acknowledged, that our modern customs, or our superior
 good sense, if you will, should make our orators more cautious and
 reserved than the ancient, in attempting to inflame the passions, or
 elevate the imagination of their audience; but I see no reason why it
 should make them despair absolutely of succeeding in that attempt. It
 should make them redouble their art, not abandon it entirely. The
 ancient orators seem also to have been on their guard against this
 jealousy of their audience; but they took a different way of eluding it.
 They hurried away with such a torrent of sublime and pathetic, that they
 left their hearers no leisure to perceive the artifice by which they
 were deceived. Nay, to consider the matter aright, they were not
 deceived by any artifice. The orator, by the force of his own genius and
 eloquence, first inflamed himself with anger, indignation, pity, sorrow;
 and then communicated those impetuous movements to his audience.
 
 Does any man pretend to have more good sense than Julius Caesar?; yet
 that haughty conqueror, we know, was so subdued by the charms of
 Cicero's eloquence, that he was, in a manner, constrained to change his
 settled purpose and resolution, and to absolve a criminal, whom, before
 that orator pleaded, he was determined to condemn.
 
 Some objections, I own, notwithstanding his vast success, may lie
 against some passages of the Roman orator. He is too florid and
 rhetorical: his figures are too striking and palpable: the divisions of
 his discourse are drawn chiefly from the rules of the schools: and his
 wit disdains not always the artifice even of a pun, rhyme, or jingle of
 words. The Grecian addressed himself to an audience much less refined
 than the Roman senate or judges. The lowest vulgar of Athens were his
 sovereigns, and the arbiters of his eloquence. Yet is his manner more
 chaste and austere than that of the other. Could it be copied, its
 success would be infallible over a modern assembly. It is rapid harmony,
 exactly adjusted to the sense; it is vehement reasoning, without any
 appearance of art: it is disdain, anger, boldness, freedom, involved in
 a continued stream of argument: and, of all human productions, the
 orations of Demosthenes present to us the models which approach the
 nearest to perfection.
 
 _Thirdly_, It may be pretended, that the disorders of the ancient
 governments, and the enormous crimes of which the citizens were often
 guilty, afforded much ampler matter for eloquence than can be met with
 among the moderns. Were there no Verres or Catiline, there would be no
 Cicero. But that this reason can have no great influence, is evident. It
 would be easy to find a Philip in modern times, but where shall we find
 a Demosthenes?
 
 What remains, then, but that we lay the blame on the want of genius, or
 of judgment, in our speakers, who either found themselves incapable of
 reaching the heights of ancient eloquence, or rejected all such
 endeavours, as unsuitable to the spirit of modern assemblies? A few
 successful attempts of this nature might rouse the genius of the nation,
 excite the emulation of the youth, and accustom our ears to a more
 sublime and more pathetic elocution, than what we have been hitherto
 entertained with. There is certainly something accidental in the first
 rise and progress of the arts in any nation. I doubt whether a very
 satisfactory reason can be given why ancient Rome, though it received
 all its refinements from Greece, could attain only to a relish for
 statuary, painting, and architecture, without reaching the practice of
 these arts. While modern Rome has been excited by a few remains found
 among the ruins of antiquity, and has produced artists of the greatest
 eminence and distinction. Had such a cultivated genius for oratory, as
 Waller's for poetry, arisen during the civil wars, when liberty began to
 be fully established, and popular assemblies to enter into all the most
 material points of government, I am persuaded so illustrious an example
 would have given a quite different turn to British eloquence, and made
 us reach the perfection of the ancient model. Our orators would then
 have done honour to their country, as well as our poets, geometers, and
 philosophers; and British Ciceros have appeared, as well as British
 Archimedeses and Virgils.[1]
 
 It is seldom or never found, when a false taste in poetry or eloquence
 prevails among any people, that it has been preferred to a true, upon
 comparison and reflection. It commonly prevails merely from ignorance of
 the true, and from the want of perfect models to lead men into a juster
 apprehension, and more refined relish of those productions of genius.
 When _these_ appear, they soon unite all suffrages in their favour, and,
 by their natural and powerful charms, gain over even the most
 prejudiced to the love and admiration of them. The principles of every
 passion, and of every sentiment, is in every man; and, when touched
 properly, they rise to life, and warm the heart, and convey that
 satisfaction, by which a work of genius is distinguished from the
 adulterate beauties of a capricious wit and fancy. And, if this
 observation be true, with regard to all the liberal arts, it must be
 peculiarly so with regard to eloquence; which, being merely calculated
 for the public, and for men of the world, cannot, without any pretence
 of reason, appeal from the people to more refined judges, but must
 submit to the public verdict without reserve or limitation. Whoever,
 upon comparison, is deemed by a common audience the greatest orator,
 ought most certainly to be pronounced such by men of science and
 erudition. And though an indifferent speaker may triumph for a long
 time, and be esteemed altogether perfect by the vulgar, who are
 satisfied with his accomplishments, and know not in what he is
 defective; yet, whenever the true genius arises, he draws to him the
 attention of every one, and immediately appears superior to his rival.
 
 Now, to judge by this rule, ancient eloquence, that is, the sublime and
 passionate, is of a much juster taste than the modern, or the
 argumentative and rational, and, if properly executed, will always have
 more command and authority over mankind. We are satisfied with our
 mediocrity, because we have had no experience of any thing better: but
 the ancients had experience of both; and upon comparison, gave the
 preference to that kind of which they have left us such applauded
 models. For, if I mistake not, our modern eloquence is of the same style
 or species with that which ancient critics denominated Attic eloquence,
 that is, calm, elegant, and subtile, which instructed the reason more
 than affected the passions, and never raised its tone above argument or
 common discourse. Such was the eloquence of Lysias among the Athenians,
 and of Calvus among the Romans. These were esteemed in their time; but,
 when compared with Demosthenes and Cicero, were eclipsed like a taper
 when set in the rays of a meridian sun. Those latter orators possessed
 the same elegance, and subtilty, and force of argument with the former;
 but, what rendered them chiefly admirable, was that pathetic and
 sublime, which, on proper occasions, they threw into their discourse,
 and by which they commanded the resolution of their audience.
 
 Of this species of eloquence we have scarcely had any instance in
 England, at least in our public speakers. In our writers, we have had
 some instances which have met with great applause, and might assure our
 ambitious youth of equal or superior glory in attempts for the revival
 of ancient eloquence. Lord Bolingbroke's productions, with all their
 defects in argument, method, and precision, contain a force and energy
 which our orators scarcely ever aim at; though it is evident that such
 an elevated style has much better grace in a speaker than in a writer,
 and is assured of more prompt and more astonishing success. It is there
 seconded by the graces of voice and action: the movements are mutually
 communicated between the orator and the audience: and the very aspect of
 a large assembly, attentive to the discourse of one man, must inspire
 him with a peculiar elevation, sufficient to give a propriety to the
 strongest figures and expressions. It is true, there is a great
 prejudice against _set speeches_; and a man cannot escape ridicule, who
 repeats a discourse as a schoolboy does his lesson, and takes no notice
 of any thing that has been advanced in the course of the debate. But
 where is the necessity of falling into this absurdity? A public speaker
 must know beforehand the question under debate. He may compose all the
 arguments, objections, and answers, such as he thinks will be most
 proper for his discourse. If any thing new occur, he may supply it from
 his own invention; nor will the difference be very apparent between his
 elaborate and his extemporary compositions. The mind naturally continues
 with the same _impetus_ or _force_, which it has acquired by its motion
 as a vessel, once impelled by the oars, carries on its course for some
 time when the original impulse is suspended.
 
 I shall conclude this subject with observing, that, even though our
 modern orators should not elevate their style, or aspire to a rivalship
 with the ancient; yet there is, in most of their speeches, a material
 defect which they might correct, without departing from that composed
 air of argument and reasoning to which they limit their ambition. Their
 great affectation of extemporary discourses has made them reject all
 order and method, which seems so requisite to argument, and without
 which it is scarcely possible to produce an entire conviction on the
 mind. It is not that one would recommend many divisions in a public
 discourse, unless the subject very evidently offer them: but it is easy,
 without this formality, to observe a method, and make that method
 conspicuous to the hearers, who will be infinitely pleased to see the
 arguments rise naturally from one another, and will retain a more
 thorough persuasion than can arise from the strongest reasons which are
 thrown together in confusion.
 
 
 [1] I have confessed that there is something accidental in the origin
 and progress of the arts in any nation; and yet I cannot forbear
 thinking, that if the other learned and polite nations of Europe had
 possessed the same advantages of a popular government, they would
 probably have carried eloquence to a greater height than it has yet
 reached in Britain. The French sermons, especially those of Flechier and
 Bourdaloue, are much superior to the English in this particular; and in
 Flechier there are many strokes of the most sublime poetry. His funeral
 sermon on the Marechal de Turenne, is a good instance. None but private
 causes in that country, are ever debated before their Parliament or
 Courts of Judicature; but, notwithstanding this disadvantage, there
 appears a spirit of eloquence in many of their lawyers, which, with
 proper cultivation and encouragement, might rise to the greatest
 heights. The pleadings of Patru are very elegant, and give us room to
 imagine what so fine a genius could have performed in questions
 concerning public liberty or slavery, peace or war, who exerts himself
 with such success in debates concerning the price of an old horse, or
 the gossiping story of a quarrel betwixt an abbess and her nuns. For it
 is remarkable, that this polite writer, though esteemed by all the men
 of wit in his time, was never employed in the most considerable causes
 of their courts of judicature, but lived and died in poverty; from an
 ancient prejudice industriously propagated by the Dunces in all
 countries, _That a man of genius is unfit for business._ The disorders
 produced by the ministry of Cardinal Mazarine, made the Parliament of
 Paris enter into the discussion of public affairs; and during that short
 interval, there appeared many symptoms of the revival of ancient
 eloquence. The Avocat-General, Talon, in an oration, invoked on his
 knees the spirit of St Louis to look down with compassion on his divided
 and unhappy people, and to inspire them, from above, with the love of
 concord and unanimity. The members of the French Academy have attempted
 to give us models of eloquence in their harangues at their admittance;
 but having no subject to discourse upon, they have run altogether into a
 fulsome strain of panegyric and flattery, the most barren of all
 subjects. Their style, however, is commonly, on these occasions, very
 elevated and sublime, and might reach the greatest heights, were it
 employed on a subject more favourable and engaging.
 
 There are some circumstances in the English temper and genius, which are
 disadvantageous to the progress of eloquence, and render all attempts of
 that kind more dangerous and difficult among them, than among any other
 nation in the universe. The English are conspicuous for good sense,
 which makes them very jealous of any attempts to deceive them, by the
 flowers of rhetoric and elocution. They are also peculiarly _modest_;
 which makes them consider it as a piece of arrogance to offer any thing
 but reason to public assemblies, or attempt to guide them by passion or
 fancy. I may, perhaps, be allowed to add that the people in general are
 not remarkable for delicacy of taste, or for sensibility to the charms
 of the Muses. Their musical parts, to use the expression of a noble
 author, are but indifferent. Hence their comic poets, to move them, must
 have recourse to obscenity; their tragic poets to blood and slaughter.
 And hence, their orators, being deprived of any such resource, have
 abandoned altogether the hopes of moving them, and have confined
 themselves to plain argument and reasoning.
 
 These circumstances, joined to particular accidents, may, perhaps, have
 retarded the growth of eloquence in this kingdom; but will not be able
 to prevent its success, if ever it appear amongst us. And one may safely
 pronounce, that this is a field in which the most flourishing laurels
 may yet be gathered, if any youth of accomplished genius, thoroughly
 acquainted with all the polite arts, and not ignorant of public
 business, should appear in Parliament, and accustom our ears to an
 eloquence more commanding and pathetic. And to confirm me in this
 opinion, there occur two considerations, the one derived from ancient,
 the other from modern times.

 Most of the principles, and reasonings, contained in this volume,
 
     [Footnote: Volume II. of the posthumous edition of Hume's works
 published in 1777 and containing, besides the present ENQUIRY,
 A DISSERTATION ON THE PASSIONS, and AN ENQUIRY CONCERNING HUMAN

 were published in a work in three volumes, called A TREATISE OF HUMAN
 NATURE: A work which the Author had projected before he left College,
 and which he wrote and published not long after. But not finding it
 successful, he was sensible of his error in going to the press too
 early, and he cast the whole anew in the following pieces, where some
 negligences in his former reasoning and more in the expression, are,
 he hopes, corrected. Yet several writers who have honoured the Author's
 Philosophy with answers, have taken care to direct all their batteries
 against that juvenile work, which the author never acknowledged, and
 have affected to triumph in any advantages, which, they imagined, they
 had obtained over it: A practice very contrary to all rules of candour
 and fair-dealing, and a strong instance of those polemical artifices
 which a bigotted zeal thinks itself authorized to employ. Henceforth,
 the Author desires, that the following Pieces may alone be regarded as
 containing his philosophical sentiments and principles.

 AN ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE PRINCIPLES OF MORALS
 
 
 
 
 SECTION I. OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MORALS.
 
 
 
 DISPUTES with men, pertinaciously obstinate in their principles, are,
 of all others, the most irksome; except, perhaps, those with persons,
 entirely disingenuous, who really do not believe the opinions they
 defend, but engage in the controversy, from affectation, from a spirit
 of opposition, or from a desire of showing wit and ingenuity, superior
 to the rest of mankind. The same blind adherence to their own arguments
 is to be expected in both; the same contempt of their antagonists; and
 the same passionate vehemence, in inforcing sophistry and falsehood.
 And as reasoning is not the source, whence either disputant derives his
 tenets; it is in vain to expect, that any logic, which speaks not to the
 affections, will ever engage him to embrace sounder principles.
 
 Those who have denied the reality of moral distinctions, may be ranked
 among the disingenuous disputants; nor is it conceivable, that any human
 creature could ever seriously believe, that all characters and actions
 were alike entitled to the affection and regard of everyone. The
 difference, which nature has placed between one man and another, is
 so wide, and this difference is still so much farther widened, by
 education, example, and habit, that, where the opposite extremes come at
 once under our apprehension, there is no scepticism so scrupulous,
 and scarce any assurance so determined, as absolutely to deny all
 distinction between them. Let a man's insensibility be ever so great,
 he must often be touched with the images of Right and Wrong; and let
 his prejudices be ever so obstinate, he must observe, that others are
 susceptible of like impressions. The only way, therefore, of converting
 an antagonist of this kind, is to leave him to himself. For, finding
 that nobody keeps up the controversy with him, it is probable he will,
 at last, of himself, from mere weariness, come over to the side of
 common sense and reason.
 
 There has been a controversy started of late, much better worth
 examination, concerning the general foundation of Morals; whether
 they be derived from Reason, or from Sentiment; whether we attain
 the knowledge of them by a chain of argument and induction, or by an
 immediate feeling and finer internal sense; whether, like all sound
 judgement of truth and falsehood, they should be the same to every
 rational intelligent being; or whether, like the perception of beauty
 and deformity, they be founded entirely on the particular fabric and
 constitution of the human species.
 
 The ancient philosophers, though they often affirm, that virtue is
 nothing but conformity to reason, yet, in general, seem to consider
 morals as deriving their existence from taste and sentiment. On the
 other hand, our modern enquirers, though they also talk much of the
 beauty of virtue, and deformity of vice, yet have commonly endeavoured
 to account for these distinctions by metaphysical reasonings, and by
 deductions from the most abstract principles of the understanding. Such
 confusion reigned in these subjects, that an opposition of the greatest
 consequence could prevail between one system and another, and even in
 the parts of almost each individual system; and yet nobody, till very
 lately, was ever sensible of it. The elegant Lord Shaftesbury, who first
 gave occasion to remark this distinction, and who, in general, adhered
 to the principles of the ancients, is not, himself, entirely free from
 the same confusion.
 
 It must be acknowledged, that both sides of the question are susceptible
 of specious arguments. Moral distinctions, it may be said, are
 discernible by pure reason: else, whence the many disputes that reign in
 common life, as well as in philosophy, with regard to this subject: the
 long chain of proofs often produced on both sides; the examples cited,
 the authorities appealed to, the analogies employed, the fallacies
 detected, the inferences drawn, and the several conclusions adjusted to
 their proper principles. Truth is disputable; not taste: what exists
 in the nature of things is the standard of our judgement; what each
 man feels within himself is the standard of sentiment. Propositions in
 geometry may be proved, systems in physics may be controverted; but the
 harmony of verse, the tenderness of passion, the brilliancy of wit, must
 give immediate pleasure. No man reasons concerning another's beauty; but
 frequently concerning the justice or injustice of his actions. In every
 criminal trial the first object of the prisoner is to disprove the facts
 alleged, and deny the actions imputed to him: the second to prove, that,
 even if these actions were real, they might be justified, as innocent
 and lawful. It is confessedly by deductions of the understanding, that
 the first point is ascertained: how can we suppose that a different
 faculty of the mind is employed in fixing the other? On the other hand,
 those who would resolve all moral determinations into sentiment,
 may endeavour to show, that it is impossible for reason ever to draw
 conclusions of this nature. To virtue, say they, it belongs to be
 amiable, and vice odious. This forms their very nature or essence. But
 can reason or argumentation distribute these different epithets to any
 subjects, and pronounce beforehand, that this must produce love,
 and that hatred? Or what other reason can we ever assign for these
 affections, but the original fabric and formation of the human mind,
 which is naturally adapted to receive them?
 
 The end of all moral speculations is to teach us our duty; and, by
 proper representations of the deformity of vice and beauty of virtue,
 beget correspondent habits, and engage us to avoid the one, and
 embrace the other. But is this ever to be expected from inferences and
 conclusions of the understanding, which of themselves have no hold of
 the affections or set in motion the active powers of men? They discover
 truths: but where the truths which they discover are indifferent, and
 beget no desire or aversion, they can have no influence on conduct and
 behaviour. What is honourable, what is fair, what is becoming, what is
 noble, what is generous, takes possession of the heart, and animates us
 to embrace and maintain it. What is intelligible, what is evident,
 what is probable, what is true, procures only the cool assent of the
 understanding; and gratifying a speculative curiosity, puts an end to
 our researches.
 
 Extinguish all the warm feelings and prepossessions in favour of virtue,
 and all disgust or aversion to vice: render men totally indifferent
 towards these distinctions; and morality is no longer a practical study,
 nor has any tendency to regulate our lives and actions.
 
 These arguments on each side (and many more might be produced) are so
 plausible, that I am apt to suspect, they may, the one as well as the
 other, be solid and satisfactory, and that reason and sentiment concur
 in almost all moral determinations and conclusions. The final sentence,
 it is probable, which pronounces characters and actions amiable or
 odious, praise-worthy or blameable; that which stamps on them the mark
 of honour or infamy, approbation or censure; that which renders morality
 an active principle and constitutes virtue our happiness, and vice our
 misery; it is probable, I say, that this final sentence depends on some
 internal sense or feeling, which nature has made universal in the whole
 species. For what else can have an influence of this nature? But
 in order to pave the way for such a sentiment, and give a proper
 discernment of its object, it is often necessary, we find, that
 much reasoning should precede, that nice distinctions be made, just
 conclusions drawn, distant comparisons formed, complicated relations
 examined, and general facts fixed and ascertained. Some species of
 beauty, especially the natural kinds, on their first appearance, command
 our affection and approbation; and where they fail of this effect, it is
 impossible for any reasoning to redress their influence, or adapt
 them better to our taste and sentiment. But in many orders of beauty,
 particularly those of the finer arts, it is requisite to employ much
 reasoning, in order to feel the proper sentiment; and a false relish
 may frequently be corrected by argument and reflection. There are just
 grounds to conclude, that moral beauty partakes much of this latter
 species, and demands the assistance of our intellectual faculties, in
 order to give it a suitable influence on the human mind.
 
 But though this question, concerning the general principles of morals,
 be curious and important, it is needless for us, at present, to employ
 farther care in our researches concerning it. For if we can be so happy,
 in the course of this enquiry, as to discover the true origin of morals,
 it will then easily appear how far either sentiment or reason enters
 into all determinations of this nature [Footnote: See Appendix I]. In
 order to attain this purpose, we shall endeavour to follow a very simple
 method: we shall analyse that complication of mental qualities, which
 form what, in common life, we call Personal Merit: we shall consider
 every attribute of the mind, which renders a man an object either
 of esteem and affection, or of hatred and contempt; every habit or
 sentiment or faculty, which, if ascribed to any person, implies either
 praise or blame, and may enter into any panegyric or satire of his
 character and manners. The quick sensibility, which, on this head, is so
 universal among mankind, gives a philosopher sufficient assurance, that
 he can never be considerably mistaken in framing the catalogue, or incur
 any danger of misplacing the objects of his contemplation: he needs only
 enter into his own breast for a moment, and consider whether or not he
 should desire to have this or that quality ascribed to him, and whether
 such or such an imputation would proceed from a friend or an enemy.
 The very nature of language guides us almost infallibly in forming a
 judgement of this nature; and as every tongue possesses one set of words
 which are taken in a good sense, and another in the opposite, the least
 acquaintance with the idiom suffices, without any reasoning, to direct
 us in collecting and arranging the estimable or blameable qualities of
 men. The only object of reasoning is to discover the circumstances
 on both sides, which are common to these qualities; to observe that
 particular in which the estimable qualities agree on the one hand,
 and the blameable on the other; and thence to reach the foundation of
 ethics, and find those universal principles, from which all censure or
 approbation is ultimately derived. As this is a question of fact, not
 of abstract science, we can only expect success, by following the
 experimental method, and deducing general maxims from a comparison
 of particular instances. The other scientific method, where a general
 abstract principle is first established, and is afterwards branched out
 into a variety of inferences and conclusions, may be more perfect in
 itself, but suits less the imperfection of human nature, and is a common
 source of illusion and mistake in this as well as in other subjects.
 Men are now cured of their passion for hypotheses and systems in natural
 philosophy, and will hearken to no arguments but those which are derived
 from experience. It is full time they should attempt a like reformation
 in all moral disquisitions; and reject every system of ethics, however
 subtle or ingenious, which is not founded on fact and observation.
 
 We shall begin our enquiry on this head by the consideration of the
 social virtues, Benevolence and Justice. The explication of them will
 probably give us an opening by which the others may be accounted for.
 
 
 
 
 SECTION II. OF BENEVOLENCE.
 
 
 
 PART I.
 
 
 
 It may be esteemed, perhaps, a superfluous task to prove, that the
 benevolent or softer affections are estimable; and wherever they appear,
 engage the approbation and good-will of mankind. The epithets
 SOCIABLE, GOOD-NATURED, HUMANE, MERCIFUL, GRATEFUL, FRIENDLY, GENEROUS,
 BENEFICENT, or their equivalents, are known in all languages, and
 universally express the highest merit, which HUMAN NATURE is capable
 of attaining. Where these amiable qualities are attended with birth
 and power and eminent abilities, and display themselves in the good
 government or useful instruction of mankind, they seem even to raise
 the possessors of them above the rank of HUMAN NATURE, and make them
 approach in some measure to the divine. Exalted capacity, undaunted
 courage, prosperous success; these may only expose a hero or politician
 to the envy and ill-will of the public: but as soon as the praises are
 added of humane and beneficent; when instances are displayed of lenity,
 tenderness or friendship; envy itself is silent, or joins the general
 voice of approbation and applause.
 
 When Pericles, the great Athenian statesman and general, was on his
 death-bed, his surrounding friends, deeming him now insensible, began to
 indulge their sorrow for their expiring patron, by enumerating his great
 qualities and successes, his conquests and victories, the unusual length
 of his administration, and his nine trophies erected over the enemies of
 the republic. YOU FORGET, cries the dying hero, who had heard all, YOU
 FORGET THE MOST EMINENT OF MY PRAISES, WHILE YOU DWELL SO MUCH ON THOSE
 VULGAR ADVANTAGES, IN WHICH FORTUNE HAD A PRINCIPAL SHARE. YOU HAVE
 NOT OBSERVED THAT NO CITIZEN HAS EVER YET WORNE MOURNING ON MY ACCOUNT.
 [Plut. in Pericle]
 
 In men of more ordinary talents and capacity, the social virtues become,
 if possible, still more essentially requisite; there being nothing
 eminent, in that case, to compensate for the want of them, or preserve
 the person from our severest hatred, as well as contempt. A high
 ambition, an elevated courage, is apt, says Cicero, in less perfect
 characters, to degenerate into a turbulent ferocity. The more social and
 softer virtues are there chiefly to be regarded. These are always good
 and amiable [Cic. de Officiis, lib. I].
 
 The principal advantage, which Juvenal discovers in the extensive
 capacity of the human species, is that it renders our benevolence also
 more extensive, and gives us larger opportunities of spreading our
 kindly influence than what are indulged to the inferior creation [Sat.
 XV. 139 and seq.]. It must, indeed, be confessed, that by doing good
 only, can a man truly enjoy the advantages of being eminent. His exalted
 station, of itself but the more exposes him to danger and tempest.
 His sole prerogative is to afford shelter to inferiors, who repose
 themselves under his cover and protection.
 
 But I forget, that it is not my present business to recommend generosity
 and benevolence, or to paint, in their true colours, all the genuine
 charms of the social virtues. These, indeed, sufficiently engage every
 heart, on the first apprehension of them; and it is difficult to abstain
 from some sally of panegyric, as often as they occur in discourse or
 reasoning. But our object here being more the speculative, than the
 practical part of morals, it will suffice to remark, (what will readily,
 I believe, be allowed) that no qualities are more intitled to the
 general good-will and approbation of mankind than beneficence and
 humanity, friendship and gratitude, natural affection and public spirit,
 or whatever proceeds from a tender sympathy with others, and a generous
 concern for our kind and species. These wherever they appear seem to
 transfuse themselves, in a manner, into each beholder, and to call
 forth, in their own behalf, the same favourable and affectionate
 sentiments, which they exert on all around.
 
 
 
 PART II.
 
 
 
 We may observe that, in displaying the praises of any humane, beneficent
 man, there is one circumstance which never fails to be amply insisted
 on, namely, the happiness and satisfaction, derived to society from
 his intercourse and good offices. To his parents, we are apt to say, he
 endears himself by his pious attachment and duteous care still more than
 by the connexions of nature. His children never feel his authority,
 but when employed for their advantage. With him, the ties of love are
 consolidated by beneficence and friendship. The ties of friendship
 approach, in a fond observance of each obliging office, to those of
 love and inclination. His domestics and dependants have in him a sure
 resource; and no longer dread the power of fortune, but so far as she
 exercises it over him. From him the hungry receive food, the naked
 clothing, the ignorant and slothful skill and industry. Like the sun, an
 inferior minister of providence he cheers, invigorates, and sustains the
 surrounding world.
 
 If confined to private life, the sphere of his activity is narrower;
 but his influence is all benign and gentle. If exalted into a higher
 station, mankind and posterity reap the fruit of his labours.
 
 As these topics of praise never fail to be employed, and with success,
 where we would inspire esteem for any one; may it not thence be
 concluded, that the utility, resulting from the social virtues, forms,
 at least, a PART of their merit, and is one source of that approbation
 and regard so universally paid to them?
 
 When we recommend even an animal or a plant as USEFUL and BENEFICIAL, we
 give it an applause and recommendation suited to its nature. As, on the
 other hand, reflection on the baneful influence of any of these inferior
 beings always inspires us with the sentiment of aversion. The eye is
 pleased with the prospect of corn-fields and loaded vine-yards;
 horses grazing, and flocks pasturing: but flies the view of briars and
 brambles, affording shelter to wolves and serpents.
 
 A machine, a piece of furniture, a vestment, a house well contrived
 for use and conveniency, is so far beautiful, and is contemplated with
 pleasure and approbation. An experienced eye is here sensible to many
 excellencies, which escape persons ignorant and uninstructed.
 
 Can anything stronger be said in praise of a profession, such as
 merchandize or manufacture, than to observe the advantages which it
 procures to society; and is not a monk and inquisitor enraged when we
 treat his order as useless or pernicious to mankind?
 
 The historian exults in displaying the benefit arising from his labours.
 The writer of romance alleviates or denies the bad consequences ascribed
 to his manner of composition.
 
 In general, what praise is implied in the simple epithet USEFUL! What
 reproach in the contrary!
 
 Your Gods, says Cicero [De Nat. Deor. lib. i.], in opposition to the
 Epicureans, cannot justly claim any worship or adoration, with whatever
 imaginary perfections you may suppose them endowed. They are totally
 useless and inactive. Even the Egyptians, whom you so much ridicule,
 never consecrated any animal but on account of its utility.
 
 The sceptics assert [Sext. Emp. adrersus Math. lib. viii.], though
 absurdly, that the origin of all religious worship was derived from the
 utility of inanimate objects, as the sun and moon, to the support
 and well-being of mankind. This is also the common reason assigned by
 historians, for the deification of eminent heroes and legislators [Diod.
 Sic. passim.].
 
 To plant a tree, to cultivate a field, to beget children; meritorious
 acts, according to the religion of Zoroaster.
 
 In all determinations of morality, this circumstance of public utility
 is ever principally in view; and wherever disputes arise, either in
 philosophy or common life, concerning the bounds of duty, the question
 cannot, by any means, be decided with greater certainty, than by
 ascertaining, on any side, the true interests of mankind. If any false
 opinion, embraced from appearances, has been found to prevail; as soon
 as farther experience and sounder reasoning have given us juster notions
 of human affairs, we retract our first sentiment, and adjust anew the
 boundaries of moral good and evil.
 
 Giving alms to common beggars is naturally praised; because it seems
 to carry relief to the distressed and indigent: but when we observe the
 encouragement thence arising to idleness and debauchery, we regard that
 species of charity rather as a weakness than a virtue.
 
 Tyrannicide, or the assassination of usurpers and oppressive princes,
 was highly extolled in ancient times; because it both freed mankind from
 many of these monsters, and seemed to keep the others in awe, whom the
 sword or poinard could not reach. But history and experience having
 since convinced us, that this practice increases the jealousy and
 cruelty of princes, a Timoleon and a Brutus, though treated with
 indulgence on account of the prejudices of their times, are now
 considered as very improper models for imitation.
 
 Liberality in princes is regarded as a mark of beneficence, but when
 it occurs, that the homely bread of the honest and industrious is often
 thereby converted into delicious cates for the idle and the prodigal, we
 soon retract our heedless praises. The regrets of a prince, for having
 lost a day, were noble and generous: but had he intended to have spent
 it in acts of generosity to his greedy courtiers, it was better lost
 than misemployed after that manner.
 
 Luxury, or a refinement on the pleasures and conveniences of life, had
 not long been supposed the source of every corruption in government, and
 the immediate cause of faction, sedition, civil wars, and the total loss
 of liberty. It was, therefore, universally regarded as a vice, and was
 an object of declamation to all satirists, and severe moralists. Those,
 who prove, or attempt to prove, that such refinements rather tend to the
 increase of industry, civility, and arts regulate anew our MORAL as well
 as POLITICAL sentiments, and represent, as laudable or innocent, what
 had formerly been regarded as pernicious and blameable.
 
 Upon the whole, then, it seems undeniable, THAT nothing can bestow more
 merit on any human creature than the sentiment of benevolence in an
 eminent degree; and THAT a PART, at least, of its merit arises from its
 tendency to promote the interests of our species, and bestow happiness
 on human society. We carry our view into the salutary consequences
 of such a character and disposition; and whatever has so benign an
 influence, and forwards so desirable an end, is beheld with complacency
 and pleasure. The social virtues are never regarded without their
 beneficial tendencies, nor viewed as barren and unfruitful. The
 happiness of mankind, the order of society, the harmony of families, the
 mutual support of friends, are always considered as the result of their
 gentle dominion over the breasts of men.
 
 How considerable a PART of their merit we ought to ascribe to their
 utility, will better appear from future disquisitions; [Footnote: Sect.
 III. and IV.] as well as the reason, why this circumstance has such a
 command over our esteem and approbation. [Footnote: Sect. V.]
 
 
 
 
 SECTION III. OF JUSTICE.
 
 
 
 PART I.
 
 
 
 THAT Justice is useful to society, and consequently that PART of its
 merit, at least, must arise from that consideration, it would be a
 superfluous undertaking to prove. That public utility is the SOLE origin
 of justice, and that reflections on the beneficial consequences of this
 virtue are the SOLE foundation of its merit; this proposition, being
 more curious and important, will better deserve our examination and
 enquiry.
 
 Let us suppose that nature has bestowed on the human race such profuse
 ABUNDANCE of all EXTERNAL conveniencies, that, without any uncertainty
 in the event, without any care or industry on our part, every individual
 finds himself fully provided with whatever his most voracious appetites
 can want, or luxurious imagination wish or desire. His natural beauty,
 we shall suppose, surpasses all acquired ornaments: the perpetual
 clemency of the seasons renders useless all clothes or covering: the
 raw herbage affords him the most delicious fare; the clear fountain,
 the richest beverage. No laborious occupation required: no tillage: no
 navigation. Music, poetry, and contemplation form his sole business:
 conversation, mirth, and friendship his sole amusement. It seems evident
 that, in such a happy state, every other social virtue would flourish,
 and receive tenfold increase; but the cautious, jealous virtue of
 justice would never once have been dreamed of. For what purpose make a
 partition of goods, where every one has already more than enough? Why
 give rise to property, where there cannot possibly be any injury? Why
 call this object MINE, when upon the seizing of it by another, I need
 but stretch out my hand to possess myself to what is equally valuable?
 Justice, in that case, being totally useless, would be an idle
 ceremonial, and could never possibly have place in the catalogue of
 virtues.
 
 We see, even in the present necessitous condition of mankind, that,
 wherever any benefit is bestowed by nature in an unlimited abundance,
 we leave it always in common among the whole human race, and make no
 subdivisions of right and property. Water and air, though the most
 necessary of all objects, are not challenged as the property of
 individuals; nor can any man commit injustice by the most lavish use and
 enjoyment of these blessings. In fertile extensive countries, with few
 inhabitants, land is regarded on the same footing. And no topic is so
 much insisted on by those, who defend the liberty of the seas, as the
 unexhausted use of them in navigation. Were the advantages, procured
 by navigation, as inexhaustible, these reasoners had never had any
 adversaries to refute; nor had any claims ever been advanced of a
 separate, exclusive dominion over the ocean.
 
 It may happen, in some countries, at some periods, that there be
 established a property in water, none in land [Footnote: Genesis, chaps.
 xiii. and xxi.]; if the latter be in greater abundance than can be used
 by the inhabitants, and the former be found, with difficulty, and in
 very small quantities.
 
 Again; suppose, that, though the necessities of human race continue the
 same as at present, yet the mind is so enlarged, and so replete with
 friendship and generosity, that every man has the utmost tenderness for
 every man, and feels no more concern for his own interest than for that
 of his fellows; it seems evident, that the use of justice would, in
 this case, be suspended by such an extensive benevolence, nor would the
 divisions and barriers of property and obligation have ever been thought
 of. Why should I bind another, by a deed or promise, to do me any
 good office, when I know that he is already prompted, by the strongest
 inclination, to seek my happiness, and would, of himself, perform the
 desired service; except the hurt, he thereby receives, be greater than
 the benefit accruing to me? in which case, he knows, that, from my
 innate humanity and friendship, I should be the first to oppose myself
 to his imprudent generosity. Why raise landmarks between my neighbour's
 field and mine, when my heart has made no division between our
 interests; but shares all his joys and sorrows with the same force and
 vivacity as if originally my own? Every man, upon this supposition,
 being a second self to another, would trust all his interests to the
 discretion of every man; without jealousy, without partition, without
 distinction. And the whole human race would form only one family; where
 all would lie in common, and be used freely, without regard to property;
 but cautiously too, with as entire regard to the necessities of each
 individual, as if our own interests were most intimately concerned.
 
 In the present disposition of the human heart, it would, perhaps, be
 difficult to find complete instances of such enlarged affections; but
 still we may observe, that the case of families approaches towards it;
 and the stronger the mutual benevolence is among the individuals, the
 nearer it approaches; till all distinction of property be, in a great
 measure, lost and confounded among them. Between married persons, the
 cement of friendship is by the laws supposed so strong as to abolish all
 division of possessions; and has often, in reality, the force ascribed
 to it. And it is observable, that, during the ardour of new enthusiasms,
 when every principle is inflamed into extravagance, the community of
 goods has frequently been attempted; and nothing but experience of its
 inconveniencies, from the returning or disguised selfishness of men,
 could make the imprudent fanatics adopt anew the ideas of justice and of
 separate property. So true is it, that this virtue derives its existence
 entirely from its necessary USE to the intercourse and social state of
 mankind.
 
 To make this truth more evident, let us reverse the foregoing
 suppositions; and carrying everything to the opposite extreme, consider
 what would be the effect of these new situations. Suppose a society to
 fall into such want of all common necessaries, that the utmost frugality
 and industry cannot preserve the greater number from perishing, and the
 whole from extreme misery; it will readily, I believe, be admitted, that
 the strict laws of justice are suspended, in such a pressing
 emergence, and give place to the stronger motives of necessity and
 self-preservation. Is it any crime, after a shipwreck, to seize whatever
 means or instrument of safety one can lay hold of, without regard to
 former limitations of property? Or if a city besieged were perishing
 with hunger; can we imagine, that men will see any means of preservation
 before them, and lose their lives, from a scrupulous regard to what, in
 other situations, would be the rules of equity and justice? The use
 and tendency of that virtue is to procure happiness and security, by
 preserving order in society: but where the society is ready to perish
 from extreme necessity, no greater evil can be dreaded from violence and
 injustice; and every man may now provide for himself by all the means,
 which prudence can dictate, or humanity permit. The public, even in less
 urgent necessities, opens granaries, without the consent of proprietors;
 as justly supposing, that the authority of magistracy may, consistent
 with equity, extend so far: but were any number of men to assemble,
 without the tie of laws or civil jurisdiction; would an equal partition
 of bread in a famine, though effected by power and even violence, be
 regarded as criminal or injurious?
 
 Suppose likewise, that it should be a virtuous man's fate to fall
 into the society of ruffians, remote from the protection of laws and
 government; what conduct must he embrace in that melancholy situation?
 He sees such a desperate rapaciousness prevail; such a disregard
 to equity, such contempt of order, such stupid blindness to future
 consequences, as must immediately have the most tragical conclusion,
 and must terminate in destruction to the greater number, and in a total
 dissolution of society to the rest. He, meanwhile, can have no other
 expedient than to arm himself, to whomever the sword he seizes, or
 the buckler, may belong: To make provision of all means of defence and
 security: And his particular regard to justice being no longer of use
 to his own safety or that of others, he must consult the dictates of
 self-preservation alone, without concern for those who no longer merit
 his care and attention.
 
 When any man, even in political society, renders himself by his crimes,
 obnoxious to the public, he is punished by the laws in his goods and
 person; that is, the ordinary rules of justice are, with regard to him,
 suspended for a moment, and it becomes equitable to inflict on him, for
 the BENEFIT of society, what otherwise he could not suffer without wrong
 or injury.
 
 The rage and violence of public war; what is it but a suspension of
 justice among the warring parties, who perceive, that this virtue is now
 no longer of any USE or advantage to them? The laws of war, which then
 succeed to those of equity and justice, are rules calculated for the
 ADVANTAGE and UTILITY of that particular state, in which men are
 now placed. And were a civilized nation engaged with barbarians, who
 observed no rules even of war, the former must also suspend their
 observance of them, where they no longer serve to any purpose; and must
 render every action or recounter as bloody and pernicious as possible to
 the first aggressors.
 
 Thus, the rules of equity or justice depend entirely on the particular
 state and condition in which men are placed, and owe their origin and
 existence to that utility, which results to the public from their strict
 and regular observance. Reverse, in any considerable circumstance,
 the condition of men: Produce extreme abundance or extreme necessity:
 Implant in the human breast perfect moderation and humanity, or perfect
 rapaciousness and malice: By rendering justice totally USELESS, you
 thereby totally destroy its essence, and suspend its obligation upon
 mankind. The common situation of society is a medium amidst all these
 extremes. We are naturally partial to ourselves, and to our friends; but
 are capable of learning the advantage resulting from a more equitable
 conduct. Few enjoyments are given us from the open and liberal hand of
 nature; but by art, labour, and industry, we can extract them in great
 abundance. Hence the ideas of property become necessary in all civil
 society: Hence justice derives its usefulness to the public: And hence
 alone arises its merit and moral obligation.
 
 These conclusions are so natural and obvious, that they have not escaped
 even the poets, in their descriptions of the felicity attending the
 golden age or the reign of Saturn. The seasons, in that first period of
 nature, were so temperate, if we credit these agreeable fictions, that
 there was no necessity for men to provide themselves with clothes and
 houses, as a security against the violence of heat and cold: The
 rivers flowed with wine and milk: The oaks yielded honey; and nature
 spontaneously produced her greatest delicacies. Nor were these the
 chief advantages of that happy age. Tempests were not alone removed from
 nature; but those more furious tempests were unknown to human breasts,
 which now cause such uproar, and engender such confusion. Avarice,
 ambition, cruelty, selfishness, were never heard of: Cordial affection,
 compassion, sympathy, were the only movements with which the mind was
 yet acquainted. Even the punctilious distinction of MINE and THINE was
 banished from among the happy race of mortals, and carried with it the
 very notion of property and obligation, justice and injustice.
 
 This POETICAL fiction of the GOLDEN AGE, is in some respects, of a piece
 with the PHILOSOPHICAL fiction of the STATE OF NATURE; only that the
 former is represented as the most charming and most peaceable condition,
 which can possibly be imagined; whereas the latter is painted out as
 a state of mutual war and violence, attended with the most extreme
 necessity. On the first origin of mankind, we are told, their ignorance
 and savage nature were so prevalent, that they could give no mutual
 trust, but must each depend upon himself and his own force or cunning
 for protection and security. No law was heard of: No rule of justice
 known: No distinction of property regarded: Power was the only measure
 of right; and a perpetual war of all against all was the result of men's
 untamed selfishness and barbarity.
 
 
      [Footnote: This fiction of a state of nature, as a state of war,
 was not first started by Mr. Hobbes, as is commonly imagined. Plato
 endeavours to refute an hypothesis very like it in the second, third,
 and fourth books de republica. Cicero, on the contrary, supposes it
 certain and universally acknowledged in the following passage. 'Quis
 enim vestrum, judices, ignorat, ita naturam rerum tulisse, ut quodam
 tempore homines, nondum neque naturali neque civili jure descripto,
 fusi per agros ac dispersi vagarentur tantumque haberent quantum manu ac
 viribus, per caedem ac vulnera, aut eripere aut retinere potuissent?
 Qui igitur primi virtute & consilio praestanti extiterunt, ii perspecto
 genere humanae docilitatis atque ingenii, dissipatos unum in locum
 congregarunt, eosque ex feritate illa ad justitiam ac mansuetudinem
 transduxerunt. Tum res ad communem utilitatem, quas publicas appellamus,
 tum conventicula hominum, quae postea civitates nominatae sunt, tum
 domicilia conjuncta, quas urbes dicamus, invento & divino & humano jure
 moenibus sepserunt. Atque inter hanc vitam, perpolitam humanitate, &
 llam immanem, nihil tam interest quam JUS atque VIS. Horum utro uti
 nolimus, altero est utendum. Vim volumus extingui. Jus valeat necesse
 est, idi est, judicia, quibus omne jus continetur. Judicia displicent,
 ant nulla sunt. Vis dominetur necesse est. Haec vident omnes.' Pro Sext.
 sec. 42.]
 
 Whether such a condition of human nature could ever exist, or if it
 did, could continue so long as to merit the appellation of a STATE,
 may justly be doubted. Men are necessarily born in a family-society, at
 least; and are trained up by their parents to some rule of conduct and
 behaviour. But this must be admitted, that, if such a state of mutual
 war and violence was ever real, the suspension of all laws of
 justice, from their absolute inutility, is a necessary and infallible
 consequence.
 
 The more we vary our views of human life, and the newer and more unusual
 the lights are in which we survey it, the more shall we be convinced,
 that the origin here assigned for the virtue of justice is real and
 satisfactory.
 
 Were there a species of creatures intermingled with men, which, though
 rational, were possessed of such inferior strength, both of body and
 mind, that they were incapable of all resistance, and could never, upon
 the highest provocation, make us feel the effects of their resentment;
 the necessary consequence, I think, is that we should be bound by the
 laws of humanity to give gentle usage to these creatures, but should
 not, properly speaking, lie under any restraint of justice with regard
 to them, nor could they possess any right or property, exclusive of such
 arbitrary lords. Our intercourse with them could not be called society,
 which supposes a degree of equality; but absolute command on the one
 side, and servile obedience on the other. Whatever we covet, they must
 instantly resign: Our permission is the only tenure, by which they hold
 their possessions: Our compassion and kindness the only check, by which
 they curb our lawless will: And as no inconvenience ever results from
 the exercise of a power, so firmly established in nature, the restraints
 of justice and property, being totally USELESS, would never have place
 in so unequal a confederacy.
 
 This is plainly the situation of men, with regard to animals; and
 how far these may be said to possess reason, I leave it to others to
 determine. The great superiority of civilized Europeans above barbarous
 Indians, tempted us to imagine ourselves on the same footing with regard
 to them, and made us throw off all restraints of justice, and even of
 humanity, in our treatment of them. In many nations, the female sex are
 reduced to like slavery, and are rendered incapable of all property, in
 opposition to their lordly masters. But though the males, when united,
 have in all countries bodily force sufficient to maintain this severe
 tyranny, yet such are the insinuation, address, and charms of their fair
 companions, that women are commonly able to break the confederacy, and
 share with the other sex in all the rights and privileges of society.
 
 Were the human species so framed by nature as that each individual
 possessed within himself every faculty, requisite both for his own
 preservation and for the propagation of his kind: Were all society and
 intercourse cut off between man and man, by the primary intention of the
 supreme Creator: It seems evident, that so solitary a being would be
 as much incapable of justice, as of social discourse and conversation.
 Where mutual regards and forbearance serve to no manner of purpose,
 they would never direct the conduct of any reasonable man. The headlong
 course of the passions would be checked by no reflection on future
 consequences. And as each man is here supposed to love himself alone,
 and to depend only on himself and his own activity for safety and
 happiness, he would, on every occasion, to the utmost of his power,
 challenge the preference above every other being, to none of which he
 is bound by any ties, either of nature or of interest. But suppose
 the conjunction of the sexes to be established in nature, a family
 immediately arises; and particular rules being found requisite for
 its subsistence, these are immediately embraced; though without
 comprehending the rest of mankind within their prescriptions. Suppose
 that several families unite together into one society, which is totally
 disjoined from all others, the rules, which preserve peace and order,
 enlarge themselves to the utmost extent of that society; but becoming
 then entirely useless, lose their force when carried one step farther.
 But again suppose, that several distinct societies maintain a kind of
 intercourse for mutual convenience and advantage, the boundaries of
 justice still grow larger, in proportion to the largeness of men's
 views, and the force of their mutual connexions. History, experience,
 reason sufficiently instruct us in this natural progress of human
 sentiments, and in the gradual enlargement of our regards to justice,
 in proportion as we become acquainted with the extensive utility of that
 virtue.
 
 
 
 PART II.
 
 
 
 If we examine the PARTICULAR laws, by which justice is directed,
 and property determined; we shall still be presented with the same
 conclusion. The good of mankind is the only object of all these laws
 and regulations. Not only is it requisite, for the peace and interest
 of society, that men's possessions should be separated; but the rules,
 which we follow, in making the separation, are such as can best be
 contrived to serve farther the interests of society.
 
 We shall suppose that a creature, possessed of reason, but unacquainted
 with human nature, deliberates with himself what rules of justice or
 property would best promote public interest, and establish peace and
 security among mankind: His most obvious thought would be, to assign the
 largest possessions to the most extensive virtue, and give every one
 the power of doing good, proportioned to his inclination. In a perfect
 theocracy, where a being, infinitely intelligent, governs by particular
 volitions, this rule would certainly have place, and might serve to the
 wisest purposes: But were mankind to execute such a law; so great is
 the uncertainty of merit, both from its natural obscurity, and from the
 self-conceit of each individual, that no determinate rule of conduct
 would ever result from it; and the total dissolution of society must
 be the immediate consequence. Fanatics may suppose, THAT DOMINION IS
 FOUNDED ON GRACE, and THAT SAINTS ALONE INHERIT THE EARTH; but the civil
 magistrate very justly puts these sublime theorists on the same footing
 with common robbers, and teaches them by the severest discipline, that a
 rule, which, in speculation, may seem the most advantageous to society,
 may yet be found, in practice, totally pernicious and destructive.
 
 That there were RELIGIOUS fanatics of this kind in England, during
 the civil wars, we learn from history; though it is probable, that the
 obvious TENDENCY of these principles excited such horror in mankind, as
 soon obliged the dangerous enthusiasts to renounce, or at least conceal
 their tenets. Perhaps the LEVELLERS, who claimed an equal distribution
 of property, were a kind of POLITICAL fanatics, which arose from the
 religious species, and more openly avowed their pretensions; as carrying
 a more plausible appearance, of being practicable in themselves, as well
 as useful to human society. It must, indeed, be confessed, that nature
 is so liberal to mankind, that, were all her presents equally divided
 among the species, and improved by art and industry, every individual
 would enjoy all the necessaries, and even most of the comforts of life;
 nor would ever be liable to any ills but such as might accidentally
 arise from the sickly frame and constitution of his body. It must also
 be confessed, that, wherever we depart from this equality, we rob the
 poor of more satisfaction than we add to the rich, and that the slight
 gratification of a frivolous vanity, in one individual, frequently costs
 more than bread to many families, and even provinces. It may appear
 withal, that the rule of equality, as it would be highly USEFUL, is not
 altogether IMPRACTICABLE; but has taken place, at least in an imperfect
 degree, in some republics; particularly that of Sparta; where it was
 attended, it is said, with the most beneficial consequences. Not to
 mention that the Agrarian laws, so frequently claimed in Rome, and
 carried into execution in many Greek cities, proceeded, all of them,
 from a general idea of the utility of this principle.
 
 But historians, and even common sense, may inform us, that, however
 specious these ideas of PERFECT equality may seem, they are really,
 at bottom, IMPRACTICABLE; and were they not so, would be extremely
 PERNICIOUS to human society. Render possessions ever so equal, men's
 different degrees of art, care, and industry will immediately break that
 equality. Or if you check these virtues, you reduce society to the most
 extreme indigence; and instead of preventing want and beggary in a
 few, render it unavoidable to the whole community. The most rigorous
 inquisition too is requisite to watch every inequality on its first
 appearance; and the most severe jurisdiction, to punish and redress it.
 But besides, that so much authority must soon degenerate into tyranny,
 and be exerted with great partialities; who can possibly be possessed
 of it, in such a situation as is here supposed? Perfect equality
 of possessions, destroying all subordination, weakens extremely the
 authority of magistracy, and must reduce all power nearly to a level, as
 well as property.
 
 We may conclude, therefore, that, in order to establish laws for the
 regulation of property, we must be acquainted with the nature and
 situation of man; must reject appearances, which may be false, though
 specious; and must search for those rules, which are, on the whole, most
 USEFUL and BENEFICIAL. Vulgar sense and slight experience are sufficient
 for this purpose; where men give not way to too selfish avidity, or too
 extensive enthusiasm.
 
 Who sees not, for instance, that whatever is produced or improved by a
 man's art or industry ought, for ever, to be secured to him, in order to
 give encouragement to such USEFUL habits and accomplishments? That the
 property ought also to descend to children and relations, for the same
 USEFUL purpose? That it may be alienated by consent, in order to beget
 that commerce and intercourse, which is so BENEFICIAL to human society?
 And that all contracts and promises ought carefully to be fulfilled,
 in order to secure mutual trust and confidence, by which the general
 INTEREST of mankind is so much promoted?
 
 Examine the writers on the laws of nature; and you will always find,
 that, whatever principles they set out with, they are sure to terminate
 here at last, and to assign, as the ultimate reason for every rule which
 they establish, the convenience and necessities of mankind. A concession
 thus extorted, in opposition to systems, has more authority than if it
 had been made in prosecution of them.
 
 What other reason, indeed, could writers ever give, why this must be
 MINE and that YOURS; since uninstructed nature surely never made any
 such distinction? The objects which receive those appellations are, of
 themselves, foreign to us; they are totally disjoined and separated
 from us; and nothing but the general interests of society can form the
 connexion.
 
 Sometimes the interests of society may require a rule of justice in
 a particular case; but may not determine any particular rule, among
 several, which are all equally beneficial. In that case, the slightest
 analogies are laid hold of, in order to prevent that indifference and
 ambiguity, which would be the source of perpetual dissension. Thus
 possession alone, and first possession, is supposed to convey property,
 where no body else has any preceding claim and pretension. Many of the
 reasonings of lawyers are of this analogical nature, and depend on very
 slight connexions of the imagination.
 
 Does any one scruple, in extraordinary cases, to violate all regard to
 the private property of individuals, and sacrifice to public interest
 a distinction which had been established for the sake of that interest?
 The safety of the people is the supreme law: All other particular laws
 are subordinate to it, and dependent on it: And if, in the COMMON course
 of things, they be followed and regarded; it is only because the
 public safety and interest COMMONLY demand so equal and impartial an
 administration.
 
 Sometimes both UTILITY and ANALOGY fail, and leave the laws of justice
 in total uncertainty. Thus, it is highly requisite, that prescription
 or long possession should convey property; but what number of days or
 months or years should be sufficient for that purpose, it is impossible
 for reason alone to determine. CIVIL LAWS here supply the place of the
 natural CODE, and assign different terms for prescription, according to
 the different UTILITIES, proposed by the legislator. Bills of exchange
 and promissory notes, by the laws of most countries, prescribe sooner
 than bonds, and mortgages, and contracts of a more formal nature.
 
 In general we may observe that all questions of property are subordinate
 to the authority of civil laws, which extend, restrain, modify,
 and alter the rules of natural justice, according to the particular
 CONVENIENCE of each community. The laws have, or ought to have, a
 constant reference to the constitution of government, the manners, the
 climate, the religion, the commerce, the situation of each society. A
 late author of genius, as well as learning, has prosecuted this subject
 at large, and has established, from these principles, a system of
 political knowledge, which abounds in ingenious and brilliant thoughts,
 and is not wanting in solidity.
 
 
      [Footnote: The author of L'ESPRIT DES LOIX, This illustrious
      writer, however, sets out with a different theory, and
      supposes all right to be founded on certain RAPPORTS or
      relations; which is a system, that, in my opinion, never
      will be reconciled with true philosophy. Father Malebranche,
      as far as I can learn, was the first that started this
      abstract theory of morals, which was afterwards adopted by
      Cudworth, Clarke, and others; and as it excludes all
      sentiment, and pretends to found everything on reason, it
      has not wanted followers in this philosophic age. See
      Section I, Appendix I. With regard to justice, the virtue
      here treated of, the inference against this theory seems
      short and conclusive. Property is allowed to be dependent on
      civil laws; civil laws are allowed to have no other object,
      but the interest of society: This therefore must be allowed
      to be the sole foundation of property and justice. Not to
      mention, that our obligation itself to obey the magistrate
      and his laws is founded on nothing but the interests of
      society. If the ideas of justice, sometimes, do not follow
      the dispositions of civil law; we shall find, that these
      cases, instead of objections, are confirmations of the
      theory delivered above. Where a civil law is so perverse as
      to cross all the interests of society, it loses all its
      authority, and men judge by the ideas of natural justice,
      which are conformable to those interests. Sometimes also
      civil laws, for useful purposes, require a ceremony or form
      to any deed; and where that is wanting, their decrees run
      contrary to the usual tenour of justice; but one who takes
      advantage of such chicanes, is not commonly regarded as an
      honest man. Thus, the interests of society require, that
      contracts be fulfilled; and there is not a more material
      article either of natural or civil justice: But the omission
      of a trifling circumstance will often, by law, invalidate a
      contract, in foro humano, but not in foro conscientiae, as
      divines express themselves. In these cases, the magistrate
      is supposed only to withdraw his power of enforcing the
      right, not to have altered the right. Where his intention
      extends to the right, and is conformable to the interests of
      society; it never fails to alter the right; a clear proof of
      the origin of justice and of property, as assigned above.]
 
 
 WHAT IS A MAN'S PROPERTY? Anything which it is lawful for him, and for
 him alone, to use. BUT WHAT RULE HAVE WE, BY WHICH WE CAN DISTINGUISH
 THESE OBJECTS? Here we must have recourse to statutes, customs,
 precedents, analogies, and a hundred other circumstances; some of
 which are constant and inflexible, some variable and arbitrary. But the
 ultimate point, in which they all professedly terminate, is the
 interest and happiness of human society. Where this enters not into
 consideration, nothing can appear more whimsical, unnatural, and even
 superstitious, than all or most of the laws of justice and of property.
 
 Those who ridicule vulgar superstitions, and expose the folly of
 particular regards to meats, days, places, postures, apparel, have an
 easy task; while they consider all the qualities and relations of the
 objects, and discover no adequate cause for that affection or antipathy,
 veneration or horror, which have so mighty an influence over a
 considerable part of mankind. A Syrian would have starved rather than
 taste pigeon; an Egyptian would not have approached bacon: But if these
 species of food be examined by the senses of sight, smell, or taste,
 or scrutinized by the sciences of chemistry, medicine, or physics, no
 difference is ever found between them and any other species, nor
 can that precise circumstance be pitched on, which may afford a just
 foundation for the religious passion. A fowl on Thursday is lawful
 food; on Friday abominable: Eggs in this house and in this diocese,
 are permitted during Lent; a hundred paces farther, to eat them is a
 damnable sin. This earth or building, yesterday was profane; to-day,
 by the muttering of certain words, it has become holy and sacred. Such
 reflections as these, in the mouth of a philosopher, one may safely
 say, are too obvious to have any influence; because they must always,
 to every man, occur at first sight; and where they prevail not, of
 themselves, they are surely obstructed by education, prejudice, and
 passion, not by ignorance or mistake.
 
 It may appear to a careless view, or rather a too abstracted reflection,
 that there enters a like superstition into all the sentiments of
 justice; and that, if a man expose its object, or what we call property,
 to the same scrutiny of sense and science, he will not, by the most
 accurate enquiry, find any foundation for the difference made by moral
 sentiment. I may lawfully nourish myself from this tree; but the fruit
 of another of the same species, ten paces off, it is criminal for me to
 touch. Had I worn this apparel an hour ago, I had merited the severest
 punishment; but a man, by pronouncing a few magical syllables, has now
 rendered it fit for my use and service. Were this house placed in the
 neighbouring territory, it had been immoral for me to dwell in it;
 but being built on this side the river, it is subject to a different
 municipal law, and by its becoming mine I incur no blame or censure.
 The same species of reasoning it may be thought, which so successfully
 exposes superstition, is also applicable to justice; nor is it possible,
 in the one case more than in the other, to point out, in the object,
 that precise quality or circumstance, which is the foundation of the
 sentiment.
 
 But there is this material difference between SUPERSTITION and JUSTICE,
 that the former is frivolous, useless, and burdensome; the latter is
 absolutely requisite to the well-being of mankind and existence of
 society. When we abstract from this circumstance (for it is too apparent
 ever to be overlooked) it must be confessed, that all regards to right
 and property, seem entirely without foundation, as much as the grossest
 and most vulgar superstition. Were the interests of society nowise
 concerned, it is as unintelligible why another's articulating certain
 sounds implying consent, should change the nature of my actions with
 regard to a particular object, as why the reciting of a liturgy by a
 priest, in a certain habit and posture, should dedicate a heap of brick
 and timber, and render it, thenceforth and for ever, sacred.
 
 
      [Footnote: It is evident, that the will or consent alone never
 transfers property, nor causes the obligation of a promise (for the same
 reasoning extends to both), but the will must be expressed by words or
 signs, in order to impose a tie upon any man. The expression being once
 brought in as subservient to the will, soon becomes the principal part
 of the promise; nor will a man be less bound by his word, though he
 secretly give a different direction to his intention, and withhold the
 assent of his mind. But though the expression makes, on most occasions,
 the whole of the promise, yet it does not always so; and one who should
 make use of any expression, of which he knows not the meaning, and which
 he uses without any sense of the consequences, would not certainly be
 bound by it. Nay, though he know its meaning, yet if he use it in jest
 only, and with such signs as evidently show, that he has no serious
 intention of binding himself, he would not lie under any obligation of
 performance; but it is necessary, that the words be a perfect expression
 of the will, without any contrary signs. Nay, even this we must
 not carry so far as to imagine, that one, whom, by our quickness of
 understanding, we conjecture, from certain signs, to have an intention
 of deceiving us, is not bound by his expression or verbal promise, if
 we accept of it; but must limit this conclusion to those cases where
 the signs are of a different nature from those of deceit. All these
 contradictions are easily accounted for, if justice arise entirely from
 its usefulness to society; but will never be explained on any other
 hypothesis.
 
    It is remarkable that the moral decisions of the JESUITS and other
 relaxed casuists, were commonly formed in prosecution of some such
 subtilties of reasoning as are here pointed out, and proceed as much
 from the habit of scholastic refinement as from any corruption of
 the heart, if we may follow the authority of Mons. Bayle. See his
 Dictionary, article Loyola. And why has the indignation of mankind risen
 so high against these casuists; but because every one perceived, that
 human society could not subsist were such practices authorized, and that
 morals must always be handled with a view to public interest, more than
 philosophical regularity? If the secret direction of the intention, said
 every man of sense, could invalidate a contract; where is our security?
 And yet a metaphysical schoolman might think, that, where an intention
 was supposed to be requisite, if that intention really had not place,
 no consequence ought to follow, and no obligation be imposed. The
 casuistical subtilties may not be greater than the snbtilties of
 lawyers, hinted at above; but as the former are PERNICIOUS, and the
 latter INNOCENT and even NECESSARY, this is the reason of the very
 different reception they meet with from the world.
 
    It is a doctrine of the Church of Rome, that the priest, by a secret
 direction of his intention, can invalidate any sacrament. This position
 is derived from a strict and regular prosecution of the obvious truth,
 that empty words alone, without any meaning or intention in the speaker,
 can never be attended with any effect. If the same conclusion be not
 admitted in reasonings concerning civil contracts, where the affair is
 allowed to be of so much less consequence than the eternal salvation
 of thousands, it proceeds entirely from men's sense of the danger and
 inconvenience of the doctrine in the former case: And we may
 thence observe, that however positive, arrogant, and dogmatical any
 superstition may appear, it never can convey any thorough persuasion
 of the reality of its objects, or put them, in any degree, on a balance
 with the common incidents of life, which we learn from daily observation
 and experimental reasoning.]
 
 
 These reflections are far from weakening the obligations of justice, or
 diminishing anything from the most sacred attention to property. On
 the contrary, such sentiments must acquire new force from the present
 reasoning. For what stronger foundation can be desired or conceived for
 any duty, than to observe, that human society, or even human nature,
 could not subsist without the establishment of it; and will still arrive
 at greater degrees of happiness and perfection, the more inviolable the
 regard is, which is paid to that duty?
 
 The dilemma seems obvious: As justice evidently tends to promote public
 utility and to support civil society, the sentiment of justice is either
 derived from our reflecting on that tendency, or like hunger, thirst,
 and other appetites, resentment, love of life, attachment to offspring,
 and other passions, arises from a simple original instinct in the human
 breast, which nature has implanted for like salutary purposes. If the
 latter be the case, it follows, that property, which is the object of
 justice, is also distinguished by a simple original instinct, and is not
 ascertained by any argument or reflection. But who is there that ever
 heard of such an instinct? Or is this a subject in which new discoveries
 can be made? We may as well expect to discover, in the body, new senses,
 which had before escaped the observation of all mankind.
 
 But farther, though it seems a very simple proposition to say, that
 nature, by an instinctive sentiment, distinguishes property, yet in
 reality we shall find, that there are required for that purpose ten
 thousand different instincts, and these employed about objects of the
 greatest intricacy and nicest discernment. For when a definition of
 PROPERTY is required, that relation is found to resolve itself into
 any possession acquired by occupation, by industry, by prescription, by
 inheritance, by contract, &c. Can we think that nature, by an original
 instinct, instructs us in all these methods of acquisition?
 
 These words too, inheritance and contract, stand for ideas infinitely
 complicated; and to define them exactly, a hundred volumes of laws, and
 a thousand volumes of commentators, have not been found sufficient. Does
 nature, whose instincts in men are all simple, embrace such complicated
 and artificial objects, and create a rational creature, without trusting
 anything to the operation of his reason?
 
 But even though all this were admitted, it would not be satisfactory.
 Positive laws can certainly transfer property. It is by another original
 instinct, that we recognize the authority of kings and senates, and mark
 all the boundaries of their jurisdiction? Judges too, even though their
 sentence be erroneous and illegal, must be allowed, for the sake of
 peace and order, to have decisive authority, and ultimately to determine
 property. Have we original innate ideas of praetors and chancellors and
 juries? Who sees not, that all these institutions arise merely from the
 necessities of human society?
 
 All birds of the same species in every age and country, built their
 nests alike: In this we see the force of instinct. Men, in different
 times and places, frame their houses differently: Here we perceive
 the influence of reason and custom. A like inference may be drawn from
 comparing the instinct of generation and the institution of property.
 
 How great soever the variety of municipal laws, it must be confessed,
 that their chief outlines pretty regularly concur; because the purposes,
 to which they tend, are everywhere exactly similar. In like manner, all
 houses have a roof and walls, windows and chimneys; though diversified
 in their shape, figure, and materials. The purposes of the latter,
 directed to the conveniencies of human life, discover not more plainly
 their origin from reason and reflection, than do those of the former,
 which point all to a like end.
 
 I need not mention the variations, which all the rules of property
 receive from the finer turns and connexions of the imagination, and from
 the subtilties and abstractions of law-topics and reasonings. There is
 no possibility of reconciling this observation to the notion of original
 instincts.
 
 What alone will beget a doubt concerning the theory, on which I insist,
 is the influence of education and acquired habits, by which we are
 so accustomed to blame injustice, that we are not, in every instance,
 conscious of any immediate reflection on the pernicious consequences of
 it. The views the most familiar to us are apt, for that very reason,
 to escape us; and what we have very frequently performed from certain
 motives, we are apt likewise to continue mechanically, without
 recalling, on every occasion, the reflections, which first determined
 us. The convenience, or rather necessity, which leads to justice is so
 universal, and everywhere points so much to the same rules, that the
 habit takes place in all societies; and it is not without some scrutiny,
 that we are able to ascertain its true origin. The matter, however,
 is not so obscure, but that even in common life we have every moment
 recourse to the principle of public utility, and ask, WHAT MUST BECOME
 OF THE WORLD, IF SUCH PRACTICES PREVAIL? HOW COULD SOCIETY SUBSIST
 UNDER SUCH DISORDERS? Were the distinction or separation of possessions
 entirely useless, can any one conceive, that it ever should have
 obtained in society?
 
 Thus we seem, upon the whole, to have attained a knowledge of the force
 of that principle here insisted on, and can determine what degree
 of esteem or moral approbation may result from reflections on public
 interest and utility. The necessity of justice to the support of society
 is the sole foundation of that virtue; and since no moral excellence
 is more highly esteemed, we may conclude that this circumstance of
 usefulness has, in general, the strongest energy, and most entire
 command over our sentiments. It must, therefore, be the source of
 a considerable part of the merit ascribed to humanity, benevolence,
 friendship, public spirit, and other social virtues of that stamp; as it
 is the sole source of the moral approbation paid to fidelity, justice,
 veracity, integrity, and those other estimable and useful qualities and
 principles. It is entirely agreeable to the rules of philosophy, and
 even of common reason; where any principle has been found to have a
 great force and energy in one instance, to ascribe to it a like
 energy in all similar instances. This indeed is Newton's chief rule of
 philosophizing [Footnote: Principia. Lib. iii.].
 
 
 
 SECTION IV.
 
 OF POLITICAL SOCIETY.
 
 
 
 Had every man sufficient SAGACITY to perceive, at all times, the strong
 interest which binds him to the observance of justice and equity, and
 STRENGTH OF MIND sufficient to persevere in a steady adherence to a
 general and a distant interest, in opposition to the allurements of
 present pleasure and advantage; there had never, in that case, been any
 such thing as government or political society, but each man, following
 his natural liberty, had lived in entire peace and harmony with all
 others. What need of positive law where natural justice is, of itself,
 a sufficient restraint? Why create magistrates, where there never arises
 any disorder or iniquity? Why abridge our native freedom, when, in every
 instance, the utmost exertion of it is found innocent and beneficial?
 It is evident, that, if government were totally useless, it never could
 have place, and that the sole foundation of the duty of allegiance is
 the ADVANTAGE, which it procures to society, by preserving peace and
 order among mankind.
 
 When a number of political societies are erected, and maintain a great
 intercourse together, a new set of rules are immediately discovered to
 be USEFUL in that particular situation; and accordingly take place under
 the title of Laws of Nations. Of this kind are, the sacredness of the
 person of ambassadors, abstaining from poisoned arms, quarter in war,
 with others of that kind, which are plainly calculated for the ADVANTAGE
 of states and kingdoms in their intercourse with each other.
 
 The rules of justice, such as prevail among individuals, are not
 entirely suspended among political societies. All princes pretend a
 regard to the rights of other princes; and some, no doubt, without
 hypocrisy. Alliances and treaties are every day made between independent
 states, which would only be so much waste of parchment, if they were not
 found by experience to have SOME influence and authority. But here is
 the difference between kingdoms and individuals. Human nature cannot
 by any means subsist, without the association of individuals; and that
 association never could have place, were no regard paid to the laws of
 equity and justice. Disorder, confusion, the war of all against all, are
 the necessary consequences of such a licentious conduct. But nations
 can subsist without intercourse. They may even subsist, in some degree,
 under a general war. The observance of justice, though useful among
 them, is not guarded by so strong a necessity as among individuals;
 and the moral obligation holds proportion with the USEFULNESS. All
 politicians will allow, and most philosophers, that reasons of state
 may, in particular emergencies, dispense with the rules of justice, and
 invalidate any treaty or alliance, where the strict observance of
 it would be prejudicial, in a considerable degree, to either of the
 contracting parties. But nothing less than the most extreme necessity,
 it is confessed, can justify individuals in a breach of promise, or an
 invasion of the properties of others.
 
 In a confederated commonwealth, such as the Achaean republic of old, or
 the Swiss Cantons and United Provinces in modern times; as the league
 has here a peculiar UTILITY, the conditions of union have a peculiar
 sacredness and authority, and a violation of them would be regarded as
 no less, or even as more criminal, than any private injury or injustice.
 
 The long and helpless infancy of man requires the combination of parents
 for the subsistence of their young; and that combination requires the
 virtue of chastity or fidelity to the marriage bed. Without such a
 UTILITY, it will readily be owned, that such a virtue would never have
 been thought of.
 
 
      [Footnote: The only solution, which Plato gives to all the
 objections that might be raised against the community of women,
 established in his imaginary commonwealth, is, [Greek quotation here].
 Scite enim istud et dicitur et dicetur, Id quod utile sit honestum esse,
 quod autem inutile sit turpe esse. [De Rep lib v p 457 ex edit Ser]. And
 this maxim will admit of no doubt, where public utility is concerned,
 which is Plato's meaning. And indeed to what other purpose do all the
 ideas of chastity and modesty serve? "Nisi utile est quod facimus,
 frustra est gloria," says Phaedrus. [Greek quotation here], says
 Plutarch, de vitioso pudore. "Nihil eorum quae damnosa sunt, pulchrum
 est." The same was the opinion of the Stoics [Greek quotation here; from
 Sept. Emp lib III cap 20].
 
 An infidelity of this nature is much more PERNICIOUS in WOMEN than in
 MEN. Hence the laws of chastity are much stricter over the one sex than
 over the other.
 
 These rules have all a reference to generation; and yet women past
 child-bearing are no more supposed to be exempted from them than
 those in the flower of their youth and beauty. GENERAL RULES are often
 extended beyond the principle whence they first arise; and this in all
 matters of taste and sentiment. It is a vulgar story at Paris, that,
 during the rage of the Mississippi, a hump-backed fellow went every
 day into the Rue de Quincempoix, where the stock-jobbers met in great
 crowds, and was well paid for allowing them to make use of his hump as a
 desk, in order to sign their contracts upon it. Would the fortune, which
 he raised by this expedient, make him a handsome fellow; though it be
 confessed, that personal beauty arises very much from ideas of utility?
 The imagination is influenced by associations of ideas; which, though
 they arise at first from the judgement, are not easily altered by every
 particular exception that occurs to us. To which we may add, in
 the present case of chastity, that the example of the old would be
 pernicious to the young; and that women, continually foreseeing that a
 certain time would bring them the liberty of indulgence, would naturally
 advance that period, and think more lightly of this whole duty, so
 requisite to society.
 
 Those who live in the same family have such frequent opportunities of
 licence of this kind, that nothing could prevent purity of manners, were
 marriage allowed, among the nearest relations, or any intercourse of
 love between them ratified by law and custom. Incest, therefore, being
 PERNICIOUS in a superior degree, has also a superior turpitude and moral
 deformity annexed to it.
 
 What is the reason, why, by the Athenian laws, one might marry a
 half-sister by the father, but not by the mother? Plainly this:
 The manners of the Athenians were so reserved, that a man was never
 permitted to approach the women's apartment, even in the same family,
 unless where he visited his own mother. His step-mother and her children
 were as much shut up from him as the woman of any other family, and
 there was as little danger of any criminal correspondence between them.
 Uncles and nieces, for a like reason, might marry at Athens; but neither
 these, nor half-brothers and sisters, could contract that alliance at
 Rome, where the intercourse was more open between the sexes. Public
 utility is the cause of all these variations.
 
 To repeat, to a man's prejudice, anything that escaped him in private
 conversation, or to make any such use of his private letters, is highly
 blamed. The free and social intercourse of minds must be extremely
 checked, where no such rules of fidelity are established.
 
 Even in repeating stories, whence we can foresee no ill consequences
 to result, the giving of one's author is regarded as a piece of
 indiscretion, if not of immorality. These stories, in passing from hand
 to hand, and receiving all the usual variations, frequently come about
 to the persons concerned, and produce animosities and quarrels among
 people, whose intentions are the most innocent and inoffensive.
 
 To pry into secrets, to open or even read the letters of others, to
 play the spy upon their words and looks and actions; what habits more
 inconvenient in society? What habits, of consequence, more blameable?
 
 This principle is also the foundation of most of the laws of good
 manners; a kind of lesser morality, calculated for the ease of company
 and conversation. Too much or too little ceremony are both blamed, and
 everything, which promotes ease, without an indecent familiarity, is
 useful and laudable.
 
 Constancy in friendships, attachments, and familiarities, is
 commendable, and is requisite to support trust and good correspondence
 in society. But in places of general, though casual concourse, where
 the pursuit of health and pleasure brings people promiscuously together,
 public conveniency has dispensed with this maxim; and custom there
 promotes an unreserved conversation for the time, by indulging the
 privilege of dropping afterwards every indifferent acquaintance, without
 breach of civility or good manners.
 
 Even in societies, which are established on principles the most immoral,
 and the most destructive to the interests of the general society, there
 are required certain rules, which a species of false honour, as well as
 private interest, engages the members to observe. Robbers and pirates,
 it has often been remarked, could not maintain their pernicious
 confederacy, did they not establish a pew distributive justice among
 themselves, and recall those laws of equity, which they have violated
 with the rest of mankind.
 
 I hate a drinking companion, says the Greek proverb, who never forgets.
 The follies of the last debauch should be buried in eternal oblivion, in
 order to give full scope to the follies of the next.
 
 Among nations, where an immoral gallantry, if covered with a thin veil
 of mystery, is, in some degree, authorized by custom, there immediately
 arise a set of rules, calculated for the conveniency of that attachment.
 The famous court or parliament of love in Provence formerly decided all
 difficult cases of this nature.
 
 In societies for play, there are laws required for the conduct of the
 game; and these laws are different in each game. The foundation, I own,
 of such societies is frivolous; and the laws are, in a great measure,
 though not altogether, capricious and arbitrary. So far is there a
 material difference between them and the rules of justice, fidelity, and
 loyalty. The general societies of men are absolutely requisite for the
 subsistence of the species; and the public conveniency, which regulates
 morals, is inviolably established in the nature of man, and of the
 world, in which he lives. The comparison, therefore, in these respects,
 is very imperfect. We may only learn from it the necessity of rules,
 wherever men have any intercourse with each other.
 
 They cannot even pass each other on the road without rules. Waggoners,
 coachmen, and postilions have principles, by which they give the way;
 and these are chiefly founded on mutual ease and convenience. Sometimes
 also they are arbitrary, at least dependent on a kind of capricious
 analogy like many of the reasonings of lawyers.
 
 
      [Footnote: That the lighter machine yield to the heavier, and, in
 machines of the same kind, that the empty yield to the loaded; this rule
 is founded on convenience. That those who are going to the capital take
 place of those who are coming from it; this seems to be founded on some
 idea of dignity of the great city, and of the preference of the future
 to the past. From like reasons, among foot-walkers, the right-hand
 entitles a man to the wall, and prevents jostling, which peaceable
 people find very disagreeable and inconvenient.]
 
 To carry the matter farther, we may observe, that it is impossible for
 men so much as to murder each other without statutes, and maxims, and an
 idea of justice and honour. War has its laws as well as peace; and
 even that sportive kind of war, carried on among wrestlers, boxers,
 cudgel-players, gladiators, is regulated by fixed principles. Common
 interest and utility beget infallibly a standard of right and wrong
 among the parties concerned.
 
 
 
 SECTION V. WHY UTILITY PLEASES.
 
 
 
 PART I.
 
 
 
 It seems so natural a thought to ascribe to their utility the praise,
 which we bestow on the social virtues, that one would expect to meet
 with this principle everywhere in moral writers, as the chief foundation
 of their reasoning and enquiry. In common life, we may observe, that the
 circumstance of utility is always appealed to; nor is it supposed, that
 a greater eulogy can be given to any man, than to display his usefulness
 to the public, and enumerate the services, which he has performed to
 mankind and society. What praise, even of an inanimate form, if the
 regularity and elegance of its parts destroy not its fitness for any
 useful purpose! And how satisfactory an apology for any disproportion
 or seeming deformity, if we can show the necessity of that particular
 construction for the use intended! A ship appears more beautiful to an
 artist, or one moderately skilled in navigation, where its prow is wide
 and swelling beyond its poop, than if it were framed with a precise
 geometrical regularity, in contradiction to all the laws of mechanics. A
 building, whose doors and windows were exact squares, would hurt the
 eye by that very proportion; as ill adapted to the figure of a human
 creature, for whose service the fabric was intended.
 
 What wonder then, that a man, whose habits and conduct are hurtful to
 society, and dangerous or pernicious to every one who has an intercourse
 with him, should, on that account, be an object of disapprobation, and
 communicate to every spectator the strongest sentiment of disgust and
 hatred.
 
 
      [Footnote: We ought not to imagine, because an inanimate object
 may be useful as well as a man, that therefore it ought also, according
 to this system, to merit he appellation of VIRTUOUS. The sentiments,
 excited by utility, are, in the two cases, very different; and the one
 is mixed with affection, esteem, approbation, &c., and not the other. In
 like manner, an inanimate object may have good colour and proportions
 as well as a human figure. But can we ever be in love with the former?
 There are a numerous set of passions and sentiments, of which thinking
 rational beings are, by the original constitution of nature, the only
 proper objects: and though the very same qualities be transferred to an
 insensible, inanimate being, they will not excite the same sentiments.
 The beneficial qualities of herbs and minerals are, indeed, sometimes
 called their VIRTUES; but this is an effect of the caprice of language,
 which out not to be regarded in reasoning. For though there be a species
 of approbation attending even inanimate objects, when beneficial, yet
 this sentiment is so weak, and so different from that which is directed
 to beneficent magistrates or statesman; that they ought not to be ranked
 under the same class or appellation.
 
    A very small variation of the object, even where the same qualities are
 preserved, will destroy a sentiment. Thus, the same beauty, transferred
 to a different sex, excites no amorous passion, where nature is not
 extremely perverted.]
 
 
 But perhaps the difficulty of accounting for these effects of
 usefulness, or its contrary, has kept philosophers from admitting them
 into their systems of ethics, and has induced them rather to employ any
 other principle, in explaining the origin of moral good and evil. But it
 is no just reason for rejecting any principle, confirmed by experience,
 that we cannot give a satisfactory account of its origin, nor are able
 to resolve it into other more general principles. And if we would
 employ a little thought on the present subject, we need be at no loss to
 account for the influence of utility, and to deduce it from principles,
 the most known and avowed in human nature.
 
 From the apparent usefulness of the social virtues, it has readily
 been inferred by sceptics, both ancient and modern, that all moral
 distinctions arise from education, and were, at first, invented, and
 afterwards encouraged, by the art of politicians, in order to render
 men tractable, and subdue their natural ferocity and selfishness, which
 incapacitated them for society. This principle, indeed, of precept and
 education, must so far be owned to have a powerful influence, that it
 may frequently increase or diminish, beyond their natural standard,
 the sentiments of approbation or dislike; and may even, in particular
 instances, create, without any natural principle, a new sentiment of
 this kind; as is evident in all superstitious practices and observances:
 But that ALL moral affection or dislike arises from this origin, will
 never surely be allowed by any judicious enquirer. Had nature made no
 such distinction, founded on the original constitution of the mind, the
 words, HONOURABLE and SHAMEFUL, LOVELY and ODIOUS, NOBLE and DESPICABLE,
 had never had place in any language; nor could politicians, had they
 invented these terms, ever have been able to render them intelligible,
 or make them convey any idea to the audience. So that nothing can be
 more superficial than this paradox of the sceptics; and it were well,
 if, in the abstruser studies of logic and metaphysics, we could as
 easily obviate the cavils of that sect, as in the practical and more
 intelligible sciences of politics and morals.
 
 The social virtues must, therefore, be allowed to have a natural
 beauty and amiableness, which, at first, antecedent to all precept or
 education, recommends them to the esteem of uninstructed mankind, and
 engages their affections. And as the public utility of these virtues is
 the chief circumstance, whence they derive their merit, it follows,
 that the end, which they have a tendency to promote, must be some
 way agreeable to us, and take hold of some natural affection. It must
 please, either from considerations of self-interest, or from more
 generous motives and regards.
 
 It has often been asserted, that, as every man has a strong connexion
 with society, and perceives the impossibility of his solitary
 subsistence, he becomes, on that account, favourable to all those habits
 or principles, which promote order in society, and insure to him the
 quiet possession of so inestimable a blessing, As much as we value
 our own happiness and welfare, as much must we applaud the practice
 of justice and humanity, by which alone the social confederacy can
 be maintained, and every man reap the fruits of mutual protection and
 assistance.
 
 This deduction of morals from self-love, or a regard to private
 interest, is an obvious thought, and has not arisen wholly from the
 wanton sallies and sportive assaults of the sceptics. To mention no
 others, Polybius, one of the gravest and most judicious, as well as most
 moral writers of antiquity, has assigned this selfish origin to all our
 sentiments of virtue. [Footnote: Undutifulness to parents is disapproved
 of by mankind, [Greek quotation inserted here]. Ingratitude for a like
 reason (though he seems there to mix a more generous regard) [Greek
 quotation inserted here] Lib. vi cap. 4. (Ed. Gronorius.) Perhaps the
 historian only meant, that our sympathy and humanity was more enlivened,
 by our considering the similarity of our case with that of the person
 suffering; which is a just sentiment.] But though the solid practical
 sense of that author, and his aversion to all vain subtilties, render
 his authority on the present subject very considerable; yet is not
 this an affair to be decided by authority, and the voice of nature and
 experience seems plainly to oppose the selfish theory.
 
 We frequently bestow praise on virtuous actions, performed in very
 distant ages and remote countries; where the utmost subtilty of
 imagination would not discover any appearance of self-interest, or
 find any connexion of our present happiness and security with events so
 widely separated from us.
 
 A generous, a brave, a noble deed, performed by an adversary, commands
 our approbation; while in its consequences it may be acknowledged
 prejudicial to our particular interest.
 
 Where private advantage concurs with general affection for virtue, we
 readily perceive and avow the mixture of these distinct sentiments,
 which have a very different feeling and influence on the mind. We
 praise, perhaps, with more alacrity, where the generous humane action
 contributes to our particular interest: But the topics of praise, which
 we insist on, are very wide of this circumstance. And we may attempt to
 bring over others to our sentiments, without endeavouring to convince
 them, that they reap any advantage from the actions which we recommend
 to their approbation and applause.
 
 Frame the model of a praiseworthy character, consisting of all the most
 amiable moral virtues: Give instances, in which these display themselves
 after an eminent and extraordinary manner: You readily engage the esteem
 and approbation of all your audience, who never so much as enquire
 in what age and country the person lived, who possessed these noble
 qualities: A circumstance, however, of all others, the most material
 to self-love, or a concern for our own individual happiness. Once on a
 time, a statesman, in the shock and contest of parties, prevailed so far
 as to procure, by his eloquence, the banishment of an able adversary;
 whom he secretly followed, offering him money for his support during his
 exile, and soothing him with topics of consolation in his misfortunes.
 ALAS! cries the banished statesman, WITH WHAT REGRET MUST I LEAVE MY
 FRIENDS IN THIS CITY, WHERE EVEN ENEMIES ARE SO GENEROUS! Virtue, though
 in an enemy, here pleased him: And we also give it the just tribute
 of praise and approbation; nor do we retract these sentiments, when we
 hear, that the action passed at Athens, about two thousand years ago,
 and that the persons' names were Eschines and Demosthenes.
 
 WHAT IS THAT TO ME? There are few occasions, when this question is not
 pertinent: And had it that universal, infallible influence supposed,
 it would turn into ridicule every composition, and almost every
 conversation, which contain any praise or censure of men and manners.
 
 It is but a weak subterfuge, when pressed by these facts and arguments,
 to say, that we transport ourselves, by the force of imagination, into
 distant ages and countries, and consider the advantage, which we should
 have reaped from these characters, had we been contemporaries, and
 had any commerce with the persons. It is not conceivable, how a REAL
 sentiment or passion can ever arise from a known IMAGINARY interest;
 especially when our REAL interest is still kept in view, and is often
 acknowledged to be entirely distinct from the imaginary, and even
 sometimes opposite to it.
 
 A man, brought to the brink of a precipice, cannot look down without
 trembling; and the sentiment of IMAGINARY danger actuates him, in
 opposition to the opinion and belief of REAL safety. But the imagination
 is here assisted by the presence of a striking object; and yet prevails
 not, except it be also aided by novelty, and the unusual appearance of
 the object. Custom soon reconciles us to heights and precipices, and
 wears off these false and delusive terrors. The reverse is observable in
 the estimates which we form of characters and manners; and the more we
 habituate ourselves to an accurate scrutiny of morals, the more delicate
 feeling do we acquire of the most minute distinctions between vice and
 virtue. Such frequent occasion, indeed, have we, in common life, to
 pronounce all kinds of moral determinations, that no object of this kind
 can be new or unusual to us; nor could any FALSE views or prepossessions
 maintain their ground against an experience, so common and familiar.
 Experience being chiefly what forms the associations of ideas, it is
 impossible that any association could establish and support itself, in
 direct opposition to that principle.
 
 Usefulness is agreeable, and engages our approbation. This is a matter
 of fact, confirmed by daily observation. But, USEFUL? For what? For
 somebody's interest, surely. Whose interest then? Not our own only: For
 our approbation frequently extends farther. It must, therefore, be the
 interest of those, who are served by the character or action approved
 of; and these we may conclude, however remote, are not totally
 indifferent to us. By opening up this principle, we shall discover one
 great source of moral distinctions.
 
 
 
 PART II.
 
 
 
 Self-love is a principle in human nature of such extensive energy, and
 the interest of each individual is, in general, so closely connected
 with that of the community, that those philosophers were excusable, who
 fancied that all our concern for the public might be resolved into a
 concern for our own happiness and preservation. They saw every moment,
 instances of approbation or blame, satisfaction or displeasure
 towards characters and actions; they denominated the objects of these
 sentiments, VIRTUES, or VICES; they observed, that the former had
 a tendency to increase the happiness, and the latter the misery of
 mankind; they asked, whether it were possible that we could have any
 general concern for society, or any disinterested resentment of the
 welfare or injury of others; they found it simpler to consider all
 these sentiments as modifications of self-love; and they discovered a
 pretence, at least, for this unity of principle, in that close union of
 interest, which is so observable between the public and each individual.
 
 But notwithstanding this frequent confusion of interests, it is easy
 to attain what natural philosophers, after Lord Bacon, have affected to
 call the experimentum crucis, or that experiment which points out the
 right way in any doubt or ambiguity. We have found instances, in
 which private interest was separate from public; in which it was
 even contrary: And yet we observed the moral sentiment to continue,
 notwithstanding this disjunction of interests. And wherever these
 distinct interests sensibly concurred, we always found a sensible
 increase of the sentiment, and a more warm affection to virtue, and
 detestation of vice, or what we properly call, GRATITUDE and REVENGE.
 Compelled by these instances, we must renounce the theory, which
 accounts for every moral sentiment by the principle of self-love. We
 must adopt a more public affection, and allow, that the interests of
 society are not, even on their own account, entirely indifferent to
 us. Usefulness is only a tendency to a certain end; and it is a
 contradiction in terms, that anything pleases as means to an end, where
 the end itself no wise affects us. If usefulness, therefore, be a source
 of moral sentiment, and if this usefulness be not always considered with
 a reference to self; it follows, that everything, which contributes to
 the happiness of society, recommends itself directly to our approbation
 and good-will. Here is a principle, which accounts, in great part, for
 the origin of morality: And what need we seek for abstruse and remote
 systems, when there occurs one so obvious and natural?
 
 [FOOTNOTE: It is needless to push our researches so far as to ask, why
 we have humanity or a fellow-feeling with others. It is sufficient,
 that this is experienced to be a principle in human nature. We must stop
 somewhere in our examination of causes; and there are, in every science,
 some general principles, beyond which we cannot hope to find any
 principle more general. No man is absolutely indifferent to the
 happiness and misery of others. The first has a natural tendency to give
 pleasure; the second, pain. This every one may find in himself. It is
 not probable, that these principles can be resolved into principles
 more simple and universal, whatever attempts may have been made to that
 purpose. But if it were possible, it belongs not to the present subject;
 and we may here safely consider these principles as original; happy, if
 we can render all the consequences sufficiently plain and perspicuous!]
 
 Have we any difficulty to comprehend the force of humanity and
 benevolence? Or to conceive, that the very aspect of happiness,
 joy, prosperity, gives pleasure; that of pain, suffering, sorrow,
 communicates uneasiness? The human countenance, says Horace ['Uti
 ridentibus arrident, ita flentibus adflent Humani vultus,'--Hor.],
 borrows smiles or tears from the human countenance. Reduce a person to
 solitude, and he loses all enjoyment, except either of the sensual or
 speculative kind; and that because the movements of his heart are not
 forwarded by correspondent movements in his fellow-creatures. The signs
 of sorrow and mourning, though arbitrary, affect us with melancholy; but
 the natural symptoms, tears and cries and groans, never fail to infuse
 compassion and uneasiness. And if the effects of misery touch us in so
 lively a manner; can we be supposed altogether insensible or indifferent
 towards its causes; when a malicious or treacherous character and
 behaviour are presented to us?
 
 We enter, I shall suppose, into a convenient, warm, well-contrived
 apartment: We necessarily receive a pleasure from its very survey;
 because it presents us with the pleasing ideas of ease, satisfaction,
 and enjoyment. The hospitable, good-humoured, humane landlord appears.
 This circumstance surely must embellish the whole; nor can we easily
 forbear reflecting, with pleasure, on the satisfaction which results to
 every one from his intercourse and good-offices.
 
 His whole family, by the freedom, ease, confidence, and calm enjoyment,
 diffused over their countenances, sufficiently express their happiness.
 I have a pleasing sympathy in the prospect of so much joy, and can never
 consider the source of it, without the most agreeable emotions.
 
 He tells me, that an oppressive and powerful neighbour had attempted
 to dispossess him of his inheritance, and had long disturbed all his
 innocent and social pleasures. I feel an immediate indignation arise in
 me against such violence and injury.
 
 But it is no wonder, he adds, that a private wrong should proceed from a
 man, who had enslaved provinces, depopulated cities, and made the field
 and scaffold stream with human blood. I am struck with horror at the
 prospect of so much misery, and am actuated by the strongest antipathy
 against its author.
 
 In general, it is certain, that, wherever we go, whatever we reflect on
 or converse about, everything still presents us with the view of human
 happiness or misery, and excites in our breast a sympathetic movement
 of pleasure or uneasiness. In our serious occupations, in our careless
 amusements, this principle still exerts its active energy.
 
 A man who enters the theatre, is immediately struck with the view of
 so great a multitude, participating of one common amusement; and
 experiences, from their very aspect, a superior sensibility or
 disposition of being affected with every sentiment, which he shares with
 his fellow-creatures.
 
 He observes the actors to be animated by the appearance of a full
 audience, and raised to a degree of enthusiasm, which they cannot
 command in any solitary or calm moment.
 
 Every movement of the theatre, by a skilful poet, is communicated, as
 it were by magic, to the spectators; who weep, tremble, resent, rejoice,
 and are inflamed with all the variety of passions, which actuate the
 several personages of the drama.
 
 Where any event crosses our wishes, and interrupts the happiness of the
 favourite characters, we feel a sensible anxiety and concern. But where
 their sufferings proceed from the treachery, cruelty, or tyranny of an
 enemy, our breasts are affected with the liveliest resentment against
 the author of these calamities. It is here esteemed contrary to the
 rules of art to represent anything cool and indifferent. A distant
 friend, or a confident, who has no immediate interest in the
 catastrophe, ought, if possible, to be avoided by the poet; as
 communicating a like indifference to the audience, and checking the
 progress of the passions.
 
 Few species of poetry are more entertaining than PASTORAL; and every
 one is sensible, that the chief source of its pleasure arises from those
 images of a gentle and tender tranquillity, which it represents in its
 personages, and of which it communicates a like sentiment to the reader.
 Sannazarius, who transferred the scene to the sea-shore, though he
 presented the most magnificent object in nature, is confessed to have
 erred in his choice. The idea of toil, labour, and danger, suffered by
 the fishermen, is painful; by an unavoidable sympathy, which attends
 every conception of human happiness or misery.
 
 When I was twenty, says a French poet, Ovid was my favourite: Now I am
 forty, I declare for Horace. We enter, to be sure, more readily into
 sentiments, which resemble those we feel every day: But no passion, when
 well represented, can be entirely indifferent to us; because there is
 none, of which every man has not, within him, at least the seeds and
 first principles. It is the business of poetry to bring every affection
 near to us by lively imagery and representation, and make it look like
 truth and reality: A certain proof, that, wherever that reality is
 found, our minds are disposed to be strongly affected by it.
 
 Any recent event or piece of news, by which the fate of states,
 provinces, or many individuals is affected, is extremely interesting
 even to those whose welfare is not immediately engaged. Such
 intelligence is propagated with celerity, heard with avidity, and
 enquired into with attention and concern. The interest of society
 appears, on this occasion, to be in some degree the interest of each
 individual. The imagination is sure to be affected; though the passions
 excited may not always be so strong and steady as to have great
 influence on the conduct and behaviour.
 
 The perusal of a history seems a calm entertainment; but would be
 no entertainment at all, did not our hearts beat with correspondent
 movements to those which are described by the historian.
 
 Thucydides and Guicciardin support with difficulty our attention; while
 the former describes the trivial encounters of the small cities of
 Greece, and the latter the harmless wars of Pisa. The few persons
 interested and the small interest fill not the imagination, and engage
 not the affections. The deep distress of the numerous Athenian army
 before Syracuse; the danger which so nearly threatens Venice; these
 excite compassion; these move terror and anxiety.
 
 The indifferent, uninteresting style of Suetonius, equally with the
 masterly pencil of Tacitus, may convince us of the cruel depravity of
 Nero or Tiberius: But what a difference of sentiment! While the former
 coldly relates the facts; and the latter sets before our eyes the
 venerable figures of a Soranus and a Thrasea, intrepid in their fate,
 and only moved by the melting sorrows of their friends and kindred. What
 sympathy then touches every human heart! What indignation against the
 tyrant, whose causeless fear or unprovoked malice gave rise to such
 detestable barbarity!
 
 If we bring these subjects nearer: If we remove all suspicion of fiction
 and deceit: What powerful concern is excited, and how much superior,
 in many instances, to the narrow attachments of self-love and private
 interest! Popular sedition, party zeal, a devoted obedience to factious
 leaders; these are some of the most visible, though less laudable
 effects of this social sympathy in human nature.
 
 The frivolousness of the subject too, we may observe, is not able to
 detach us entirely from what carries an image of human sentiment and
 affection.
 
 When a person stutters, and pronounces with difficulty, we even
 sympathize with this trivial uneasiness, and suffer for him. And it is a
 rule in criticism, that every combination of syllables or letters, which
 gives pain to the organs of speech in the recital, appears also from a
 species of sympathy harsh and disagreeable to the ear. Nay, when we
 run over a book with our eye, we are sensible of such unharmonious
 composition; because we still imagine, that a person recites it to us,
 and suffers from the pronunciation of these jarring sounds. So delicate
 is our sympathy!
 
 Easy and unconstrained postures and motions are always beautiful: An
 air of health and vigour is agreeable: Clothes which warm, without
 burthening the body; which cover, without imprisoning the limbs, are
 well-fashioned. In every judgement of beauty, the feelings of the person
 affected enter into consideration, and communicate to the spectator
 similar touches of pain or pleasure.
 
 
      [Footnote: 'Decentior equus cujus astricta suntilia; sed idem
 velocior. Pulcher aspectu sit athleta, cujus lacertos execitatio
 expressit; idem certamini paratior nunquam enim SPECIES ab UTILITATE
 dividitur. Sed hoc quidem discernere modici judicii est.'--Quintilian,
 Inst. lib. viii. cap. 3.]
 
 What wonder, then, if we can pronounce no judgement concerning the
 character and conduct of men, without considering the tendencies of
 their actions, and the happiness or misery which thence arises to
 society? What association of ideas would ever operate, were that
 principle here totally unactive.
 
 
      [Footnote: In proportion to the station which a man possesses,
 according to the relations in which he is placed; we always expect from
 him a greater or less degree of good, and when disappointed, blame his
 inutility; and much more do we blame him, if any ill or prejudice
 arise from his conduct and behaviour. When the interests of one country
 interfere with those of another, we estimate the merits of a statesman
 by the good or ill, which results to his own country from his measures
 and councils, without regard to the prejudice which he brings on its
 enemies and rivals. His fellow-citizens are the objects, which lie
 nearest the eye, while we determine his character. And as nature has
 implanted in every one a superior affection to his own country, we never
 expect any regard to distant nations, where a competition arises. Not to
 mention, that, while every man consults the good of his own community,
 we are sensible, that the general interest of mankind is better
 promoted, than any loose indeterminate views to the good of a species,
 whence no beneficial action could ever result, for want of a duly
 limited object, on which they could exert themselves.]
 
 If any man from a cold insensibility, or narrow selfishness of temper,
 is unaffected with the images of human happiness or misery, he must be
 equally indifferent to the images of vice and virtue: As, on the other
 hand, it is always found, that a warm concern for the interests of our
 species is attended with a delicate feeling of all moral distinctions;
 a strong resentment of injury done to men; a lively approbation of their
 welfare. In this particular, though great superiority is observable
 of one man above another; yet none are so entirely indifferent to the
 interest of their fellow-creatures, as to perceive no distinctions
 of moral good and evil, in consequence of the different tendencies of
 actions and principles. How, indeed, can we suppose it possible in any
 one, who wears a human heart, that if there be subjected to his censure,
 one character or system of conduct, which is beneficial, and another
 which is pernicious to his species or community, he will not so much
 as give a cool preference to the former, or ascribe to it the smallest
 merit or regard? Let us suppose such a person ever so selfish; let
 private interest have ingrossed ever so much his attention; yet in
 instances, where that is not concerned, he must unavoidably feel SOME
 propensity to the good of mankind, and make it an object of choice, if
 everything else be equal. Would any man, who is walking along, tread as
 willingly on another's gouty toes, whom he has no quarrel with, as on
 the hard flint and pavement? There is here surely a difference in the
 case. We surely take into consideration the happiness and misery of
 others, in weighing the several motives of action, and incline to the
 former, where no private regards draw us to seek our own promotion or
 advantage by the injury of our fellow-creatures. And if the principles
 of humanity are capable, in many instances, of influencing our actions,
 they must, at all times, have some authority over our sentiments, and
 give us a general approbation of what is useful to society, and blame of
 what is dangerous or pernicious. The degrees of these sentiments may
 be the subject of controversy; but the reality of their existence, one
 should think, must be admitted in every theory or system.
 
 A creature, absolutely malicious and spiteful, were there any such in
 nature, must be worse than indifferent to the images of vice and virtue.
 All his sentiments must be inverted, and directly opposite to those,
 which prevail in the human species. Whatever contributes to the good of
 mankind, as it crosses the constant bent of his wishes and desires, must
 produce uneasiness and disapprobation; and on the contrary, whatever is
 the source of disorder and misery in society, must, for the same reason,
 be regarded with pleasure and complacency. Timon, who probably from
 his affected spleen more than an inveterate malice, was denominated the
 manhater, embraced Alcibiades with great fondness. GO ON, MY BOY! cried
 he, ACQUIRE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE: YOU WILL ONE DAY, I FORESEE,
 BE THE CAUSE OF GREAT CALAMITIES TO THEM [Footnote: Plutarch fit vita
 Ale.]. Could we admit the two principles of the Manicheans, it is an
 infallible consequence, that their sentiments of human actions, as well
 as of everything else, must be totally opposite, and that every instance
 of justice and humanity, from its necessary tendency, must please the
 one deity and displease the other. All mankind so far resemble the good
 principle, that, where interest or revenge or envy perverts not our
 disposition, we are always inclined, from our natural philanthropy, to
 give the preference to the happiness of society, and consequently to
 virtue above its opposite. Absolute, unprovoked, disinterested malice
 has never perhaps place in any human breast; or if it had, must there
 pervert all the sentiments of morals, as well as the feelings of
 humanity. If the cruelty of Nero be allowed entirely voluntary, and not
 rather the effect of constant fear and resentment; it is evident that
 Tigellinus, preferably to Seneca or Burrhus, must have possessed his
 steady and uniform approbation.
 
 A statesman or patriot, who serves our own country in our own time, has
 always a more passionate regard paid to him, than one whose beneficial
 influence operated on distant ages or remote nations; where the good,
 resulting from his generous humanity, being less connected with us,
 seems more obscure, and affects us with a less lively sympathy. We may
 own the merit to be equally great, though our sentiments are not raised
 to an equal height, in both cases. The judgement here corrects the
 inequalities of our internal emotions and perceptions; in like manner,
 as it preserves us from error, in the several variations of images,
 presented to our external senses. The same object, at a double distance,
 really throws on the eye a picture of but half the bulk; yet we imagine
 that it appears of the same size in both situations; because we know
 that on our approach to it, its image would expand on the eye, and that
 the difference consists not in the object itself, but in our
 position with regard to it. And, indeed, without such a correction of
 appearances, both in internal and external sentiment, men could
 never think or talk steadily on any subject; while their fluctuating
 situations produce a continual variation on objects, and throw them into
 such different and contrary lights and positions.
 
 
      [Footnote: For a little reason, the tendencies of actions and
 characters, not their real accidental consequences, are alone regarded
 in our more determinations or general judgements; though in our real
 feeling or sentiment, we cannot help paying greater regard to one whose
 station, joined to virtue, renders him really useful to society, then
 to one, who exerts the social virtues only in good intentions and
 benevolent affections. Separating the character from the furtone, by an
 easy and necessary effort of thought, we pronounce these persons alike,
 and give them the appearance: But is not able entirely to prevail our
 sentiment.
 
    Why is this peach-tree said to be better than that other; but because
 it produces more or better fruit? And would not the same praise be given
 it, though snails or vermin had destroyed the peaches, before they came
 to full maturity? In morals too, is not THE TREE KNOWN BY THE FRUIT?
 And cannot we easily distinguish between nature and accident, in the one
 case as well as in the other?]
 
 
 
 The more we converse with mankind, and the greater social intercourse we
 maintain, the more shall we be familiarized to these general preferences
 and distinctions, without which our conversation and discourse could
 scarcely be rendered intelligible to each other. Every man's interest
 is peculiar to himself, and the aversions and desires, which result
 from it, cannot be supposed to affect others in a like degree. General
 language, therefore, being formed for general use, must be moulded on
 some more general views, and must affix the epithets of praise or blame,
 in conformity to sentiments, which arise from the general interests of
 the community. And if these sentiments, in most men, be not so strong as
 those, which have a reference to private good; yet still they must make
 some distinction, even in persons the most depraved and selfish; and
 must attach the notion of good to a beneficent conduct, and of evil to
 the contrary. Sympathy, we shall allow, is much fainter than our concern
 for ourselves, and sympathy with persons remote from us much fainter
 than that with persons near and contiguous; but for this very reason it
 is necessary for us, in our calm judgements and discourse concerning
 the characters of men, to neglect all these differences, and render
 our sentiments more public and social. Besides, that we ourselves often
 change our situation in this particular, we every day meet with persons
 who are in a situation different from us, and who could never converse
 with us were we to remain constantly in that position and point of
 view, which is peculiar to ourselves. The intercourse of sentiments,
 therefore, in society and conversation, makes us form some general
 unalterable standard, by which we may approve or disapprove of
 characters and manners. And though the heart takes not part entirely
 with those general notions, nor regulates all its love and hatred by
 the universal abstract differences of vice and virtue, without regard
 to self, or the persons with whom we are more intimately connected;
 yet have these moral differences a considerable influence, and being
 sufficient, at least for discourse, serve all our purposes in company,
 in the pulpit, on the theatre, and in the schools.
 
 
      [Footnote: It is wisely ordained by nature, that private
 connexions should commonly prevail over univeral views and
 considerations; otherwise our affections and actions would be dissopated
 and lost, for want of a proper limited object. Thus a small benefit done
 to ourselves, or our near friends, excites more lively sentiments
 of love and approbation than a great benefit done to a distant
 commonwealth: But still we know here, as in all the senses, to correct
 these inequalities by reflection, and retain a general standard of vice
 and virtue, founded chiefly on a general usefulness.]
 
 Thus, in whatever light we take this subject, the merit, ascribed to
 the social virtues, appears still uniform, and arises chiefly from that
 regard, which the natural sentiment of benevolence engages us to pay to
 the interests of mankind and society. If we consider the principles of
 the human make, such as they appear to daily experience and observation,
 we must, A PRIORI, conclude it impossible for such a creature as man to
 be totally indifferent to the well or ill-being of his fellow-creatures,
 and not readily, of himself, to pronounce, where nothing gives him any
 particular bias, that what promotes their happiness is good, what tends
 to their misery is evil, without any farther regard or consideration.
 Here then are the faint rudiments, at least, or outlines, of a GENERAL
 distinction between actions; and in proportion as the humanity of the
 person is supposed to increase, his connexion with those who are injured
 or benefited, and his lively conception of their misery or happiness;
 his consequent censure or approbation acquires proportionable vigour.
 There is no necessity, that a generous action, barely mentioned in an
 old history or remote gazette, should communicate any strong feelings
 of applause and admiration. Virtue, placed at such a distance, is like a
 fixed star, which, though to the eye of reason it may appear as luminous
 as the sun in his meridian, is so infinitely removed as to affect the
 senses, neither with light nor heat. Bring this virtue nearer, by our
 acquaintance or connexion with the persons, or even by an eloquent
 recital of the case; our hearts are immediately caught, our sympathy
 enlivened, and our cool approbation converted into the warmest
 sentiments of friendship and regard. These seem necessary and infallible
 consequences of the general principles of human nature, as discovered in
 common life and practice.
 
 Again; reverse these views and reasonings: Consider the matter a
 posteriori; and weighing the consequences, enquire if the merit of
 social virtue be not, in a great measure, derived from the feelings of
 humanity, with which it affects the spectators. It appears to be matter
 of fact, that the circumstance of UTILITY, in all subjects, is a source
 of praise and approbation: That it is constantly appealed to in all
 moral decisions concerning the merit and demerit of actions: That it is
 the SOLE source of that high regard paid to justice, fidelity, honour,
 allegiance, and chastity: That it is inseparable from all the other
 social virtues, humanity, generosity, charity, affability, lenity,
 mercy, and moderation: And, in a word, that it is a foundation of
 the chief part of morals, which has a reference to mankind and our
 fellow-creatures.
 
 It appears also, that, in our general approbation of characters and
 manners, the useful tendency of the social virtues moves us not by any
 regards to self-interest, but has an influence much more universal
 and extensive. It appears that a tendency to public good, and to the
 promoting of peace, harmony, and order in society, does always, by
 affecting the benevolent principles of our frame, engage us on the side
 of the social virtues. And it appears, as an additional confirmation,
 that these principles of humanity and sympathy enter so deeply into all
 our sentiments, and have so powerful an influence, as may enable them
 to excite the strongest censure and applause. The present theory is the
 simple result of all these inferences, each of which seems founded on
 uniform experience and observation.
 
 Were it doubtful, whether there were any such principle in our nature
 as humanity or a concern for others, yet when we see, in numberless
 instances, that whatever has a tendency to promote the interests of
 society, is so highly approved of, we ought thence to learn the force of
 the benevolent principle; since it is impossible for anything to please
 as means to an end, where the end is totally indifferent. On the other
 hand, were it doubtful, whether there were, implanted in our nature, any
 general principle of moral blame and approbation, yet when we see, in
 numberless instances, the influence of humanity, we ought thence to
 conclude, that it is impossible, but that everything which promotes the
 interest of society must communicate pleasure, and what is pernicious
 give uneasiness. But when these different reflections and observations
 concur in establishing the same conclusion, must they not bestow an
 undisputed evidence upon it?
 
 It is however hoped, that the progress of this argument will bring a
 farther confirmation of the present theory, by showing the rise of other
 sentiments of esteem and regard from the same or like principles.
 
 
 
 
 SECTION VI. OF QUALITIES USEFUL TO OURSELVES.
 
 
 
 PART I.
 
 
 
 IT seems evident, that where a quality or habit is subjected to our
 examination, if it appear in any respect prejudicial to the person
 possessed of it, or such as incapacitates him for business and action,
 it is instantly blamed, and ranked among his faults and imperfections.
 Indolence, negligence, want of order and method, obstinacy, fickleness,
 rashness, credulity; these qualities were never esteemed by any one
 indifferent to a character; much less, extolled as accomplishments or
 virtues. The prejudice, resulting from them, immediately strikes our
 eye, and gives us the sentiment of pain and disapprobation.
 
 No quality, it is allowed, is absolutely either blameable or
 praiseworthy. It is all according to its degree. A due medium, says
 the Peripatetics, is the characteristic of virtue. But this medium is
 chiefly determined by utility. A proper celerity, for instance, and
 dispatch in business, is commendable. When defective, no progress is
 ever made in the execution of any purpose: When excessive, it engages
 us in precipitate and ill-concerted measures and enterprises: By such
 reasonings, we fix the proper and commendable mediocrity in all moral
 and prudential disquisitions; and never lose view of the advantages,
 which result from any character or habit. Now as these advantages
 are enjoyed by the person possessed of the character, it can never
 be SELF-LOVE which renders the prospect of them agreeable to us,
 the spectators, and prompts our esteem and approbation. No force of
 imagination can convert us into another person, and make us fancy, that
 we, being that person, reap benefit from those valuable qualities,
 which belong to him. Or if it did, no celerity of imagination could
 immediately transport us back, into ourselves, and make us love and
 esteem the person, as different from us. Views and sentiments, so
 opposite to known truth and to each other, could never have place, at
 the same time, in the same person. All suspicion, therefore, of selfish
 regards, is here totally excluded. It is a quite different principle,
 which actuates our bosom, and interests us in the felicity of the person
 whom we contemplate. Where his natural talents and acquired abilities
 give us the prospect of elevation, advancement, a figure in life,
 prosperous success, a steady command over fortune, and the execution of
 great or advantageous undertakings; we are struck with such agreeable
 images, and feel a complacency and regard immediately arise towards him.
 The ideas of happiness, joy, triumph, prosperity, are connected with
 every circumstance of his character, and diffuse over our minds a
 pleasing sentiment of sympathy and humanity.
 
 
      [Footnote: One may venture to affirm, that there is no human
 nature, to whom the appearance of happiness (where envy or revenge has
 no place) does not give pleasure, that of misery, uneasiness. This
 seems inseparable from our make and constitution. But they are only more
 generous minds, that are thence prompted to seek zealously the good of
 others, and to have a real passion for their welfare. With men of narrow
 and ungenerous spirits, this sympathy goes not beyond a slight
 feeling of the imagination, which serves only to excite sentiments
 of complacency or ensure, and makes them apply to the object either
 honorable or dishonorable appellations. A griping miser, for instance,
 praises extremely INDUSTRY and FRUGALITY even in others, and sets them,
 in his estimation, above all the other virtues. He knows the good that
 results from them, and feels that species of happiness with a more
 lively sympathy, than any other you could represent to him; though
 perhaps he would not part with a shilling to make the fortune of the
 industrious man, whom he praises so highly.]
 
 Let us suppose a person originally framed so as to have no manner of
 concern for his fellow-creatures, but to regard the happiness and
 misery of all sensible beings with greater indifference than even two
 contiguous shades of the same colour. Let us suppose, if the prosperity
 of nations were laid on the one hand, and their ruin on the other, and
 he were desired to choose; that he would stand like the schoolman's ass,
 irresolute and undetermined, between equal motives; or rather, like the
 same ass between two pieces of wood or marble, without any inclination
 or propensity to either side. The consequence, I believe, must be
 allowed just, that such a person, being absolutely unconcerned, either
 for the public good of a community or the private utility of others,
 would look on every quality, however pernicious, or however beneficial,
 to society, or to its possessor, with the same indifference as on the
 most common and uninteresting object.
 
 But if, instead of this fancied monster, we suppose a MAN to form
 a judgement or determination in the case, there is to him a plain
 foundation of preference, where everything else is equal; and however
 cool his choice may be, if his heart be selfish, or if the persons
 interested be remote from him; there must still be a choice or
 distinction between what is useful, and what is pernicious. Now this
 distinction is the same in all its parts, with the MORAL DISTINCTION,
 whose foundation has been so often, and so much in vain, enquired after.
 The same endowments of the mind, in every circumstance, are agreeable
 to the sentiment of morals and to that of humanity; the same temper is
 susceptible of high degrees of the one sentiment and of the other;
 and the same alteration in the objects, by their nearer approach or
 by connexions, enlivens the one and the other. By all the rules of
 philosophy, therefore, we must conclude, that these sentiments are
 originally the same; since, in each particular, even the most minute,
 they are governed by the same laws, and are moved by the same objects.
 
 Why do philosophers infer, with the greatest certainty, that the moon is
 kept in its orbit by the same force of gravity, that makes bodies fall
 near the surface of the earth, but because these effects are, upon
 computation, found similar and equal? And must not this argument bring
 as strong conviction, in moral as in natural disquisitions?
 
 To prove, by any long detail, that all the qualities, useful to
 the possessor, are approved of, and the contrary censured, would be
 superfluous. The least reflection on what is every day experienced in
 life, will be sufficient. We shall only mention a few instances, in
 order to remove, if possible, all doubt and hesitation.
 
 The quality, the most necessary for the execution of any useful
 enterprise, is discretion; by which we carry on a safe intercourse with
 others, give due attention to our own and to their character, weigh each
 circumstance of the business which we undertake, and employ the
 surest and safest means for the attainment of any end or purpose. To a
 Cromwell, perhaps, or a De Retz, discretion may appear an alderman-like
 virtue, as Dr. Swift calls it; and being incompatible with those vast
 designs, to which their courage and ambition prompted them, it might
 really, in them, be a fault or imperfection. But in the conduct of
 ordinary life, no virtue is more requisite, not only to obtain success,
 but to avoid the most fatal miscarriages and disappointments. The
 greatest parts without it, as observed by an elegant writer, may be
 fatal to their owner; as Polyphemus, deprived of his eye, was only the
 more exposed, on account of his enormous strength and stature.
 
 The best character, indeed, were it not rather too perfect for
 human nature, is that which is not swayed by temper of any kind; but
 alternately employs enterprise and caution, as each is useful to the
 particular purpose intended. Such is the excellence which St. Evremond
 ascribes to Mareschal Turenne, who displayed every campaign, as he grew
 older, more temerity in his military enterprises; and being now, from
 long experience, perfectly acquainted with every incident in war, he
 advanced with greater firmness and security, in a road so well known to
 him. Fabius, says Machiavel, was cautious; Scipio enterprising: And
 both succeeded, because the situation of the Roman affairs, during the
 command of each, was peculiarly adapted to his genius; but both would
 have failed, had these situations been reversed. He is happy, whose
 circumstances suit his temper; but he is more excellent, who can suit
 his temper to any circumstances.
 
 What need is there to display the praises of industry, and to extol its
 advantages, in the acquisition of power and riches, or in raising what
 we call a FORTUNE in the world? The tortoise, according to the fable, by
 his perseverance, gained the race of the hare, though possessed of
 much superior swiftness. A man's time, when well husbanded, is like a
 cultivated field, of which a few acres produce more of what is useful to
 life, than extensive provinces, even of the richest soil, when over-run
 with weeds and brambles.
 
 But all prospect of success in life, or even of tolerable subsistence,
 must fail, where a reasonable frugality is wanting. The heap, instead
 of increasing, diminishes daily, and leaves its possessor so much more
 unhappy, as, not having been able to confine his expences to a large
 revenue, he will still less be able to live contentedly on a small one.
 The souls of men, according to Plato [Footnote: Phaedo.], inflamed with
 impure appetites, and losing the body, which alone afforded means of
 satisfaction, hover about the earth, and haunt the places, where their
 bodies are deposited; possessed with a longing desire to recover the
 lost organs of sensation. So may we see worthless prodigals, having
 consumed their fortune in wild debauches, thrusting themselves into
 every plentiful table, and every party of pleasure, hated even by the
 vicious, and despised even by fools.
 
 The one extreme of frugality is avarice, which, as it both deprives a
 man of all use of his riches, and checks hospitality and every social
 enjoyment, is justly censured on a double account. PRODIGALITY, the
 other extreme, is commonly more hurtful to a man himself; and each of
 these extremes is blamed above the other, according to the temper of the
 person who censures, and according to his greater or less sensibility to
 pleasure, either social or sensual.
 
 Qualities often derive their merit from complicated sources. Honesty,
 fidelity, truth, are praised for their immediate tendency to promote the
 interests of society; but after those virtues are once established upon
 this foundation, they are also considered as advantageous to the person
 himself, and as the source of that trust and confidence, which can alone
 give a man any consideration in life. One becomes contemptible, no less
 than odious, when he forgets the duty, which, in this particular, he
 owes to himself as well as to society.
 
 Perhaps, this consideration is one CHIEF source of the high blame, which
 is thrown on any instance of failure among women in point of CHASTITY.
 The greatest regard, which can be acquired by that sex, is derived from
 their fidelity; and a woman becomes cheap and vulgar, loses her rank,
 and is exposed to every insult, who is deficient in this particular. The
 smallest failure is here sufficient to blast her character. A female
 has so many opportunities of secretly indulging these appetites, that
 nothing can give us security but her absolute modesty and reserve; and
 where a breach is once made, it can scarcely ever be fully repaired.
 If a man behave with cowardice on one occasion, a contrary conduct
 reinstates him in his character. But by what action can a woman, whose
 behaviour has once been dissolute, be able to assure us, that she has
 formed better resolutions, and has self-command enough to carry them
 into execution?
 
 All men, it is allowed, are equally desirous of happiness; but few
 are successful in the pursuit: One considerable cause is the want of
 strength of mind, which might enable them to resist the temptation of
 present ease or pleasure, and carry them forward in the search of more
 distant profit and enjoyment. Our affections, on a general prospect of
 their objects, form certain rules of conduct, and certain measures of
 preference of one above another: and these decisions, though really
 the result of our calm passions and propensities, (for what else can
 pronounce any object eligible or the contrary?) are yet said, by a
 natural abuse of terms, to be the determinations of pure REASON and
 reflection. But when some of these objects approach nearer to us, or
 acquire the advantages of favourable lights and positions, which
 catch the heart or imagination; our general resolutions are frequently
 confounded, a small enjoyment preferred, and lasting shame and sorrow
 entailed upon us. And however poets may employ their wit and eloquence,
 in celebrating present pleasure, and rejecting all distant views to
 fame, health, or fortune; it is obvious, that this practice is the
 source of all dissoluteness and disorder, repentance and misery. A man
 of a strong and determined temper adheres tenaciously to his general
 resolutions, and is neither seduced by the allurements of pleasure, nor
 terrified by the menaces of pain; but keeps still in view those distant
 pursuits, by which he, at once, ensures his happiness and his honour.
 
 Self-satisfaction, at least in some degree, is an advantage, which
 equally attends the fool and the wise man: But it is the only one; nor
 is there any other circumstance in the conduct of life, where they are
 upon an equal footing. Business, books, conversation; for all of these,
 a fool is totally incapacitated, and except condemned by his station
 to the coarsest drudgery, remains a useless burthen upon the earth.
 Accordingly, it is found, that men are extremely jealous of their
 character in this particular; and many instances are seen of profligacy
 and treachery, the most avowed and unreserved; none of bearing patiently
 the imputation of ignorance and stupidity. Dicaearchus, the Macedonian
 general, who, as Polybius tells us [Footnote: Lib. xvi. Cap. 35.],
 openly erected one altar to impiety, another to injustice, in order to
 bid defiance to mankind; even he, I am well assured, would have started
 at the epithet of FOOL, and have meditated revenge for so injurious an
 appellation. Except the affection of parents, the strongest and most
 indissoluble bond in nature, no connexion has strength sufficient to
 support the disgust arising from this character. Love itself, which
 can subsist under treachery, ingratitude, malice, and infidelity, is
 immediately extinguished by it, when perceived and acknowledged; nor
 are deformity and old age more fatal to the dominion of that passion.
 So dreadful are the ideas of an utter incapacity for any purpose or
 undertaking, and of continued error and misconduct in life!
 
 When it is asked, whether a quick or a slow apprehension be most
 valuable? Whether one, that, at first view, penetrates far into a
 subject, but can perform nothing upon study; or a contrary character,
 which must work out everything by dint of application? Whether a
 clear head or a copious invention? Whether a profound genius or a sure
 judgement? In short, what character, or peculiar turn of understanding,
 is more excellent than another? It is evident, that we can answer
 none of these questions, without considering which of those qualities
 capacitates a man best for the world, and carries him farthest in any
 undertaking.
 
 If refined sense and exalted sense be not so USEFUL as common sense,
 their rarity, their novelty, and the nobleness of their objects make
 some compensation, and render them the admiration of mankind: As gold,
 though less serviceable than iron, acquires from its scarcity a value
 which is much superior.
 
 The defects of judgement can be supplied by no art or invention; but
 those of memory frequently may, both in business and in study, by method
 and industry, and by diligence in committing everything to writing;
 and we scarcely ever hear a short memory given as a reason for a man's
 failure in any undertaking. But in ancient times, when no man could make
 a figure without the talent of speaking, and when the audience were too
 delicate to bear such crude, undigested harangues as our extemporary
 orators offer to public assemblies; the faculty of memory was then of
 the utmost consequence, and was accordingly much more valued than at
 present. Scarce any great genius is mentioned in antiquity, who is not
 celebrated for this talent; and Cicero enumerates it among the other
 sublime qualities of Caesar himself. [Footnote: Fruit in Illo Ingenium,
 ratio, memoria, literae, cura, cogitatio, diligentia &c. Phillip. 2.].
 
 Particular customs and manners alter the usefulness of qualities: they
 also alter their merit. Particular situations and accidents have, in
 some degree, the same influence. He will always be more esteemed, who
 possesses those talents and accomplishments, which suit his station and
 profession, than he whom fortune has misplaced in the part which she has
 assigned him. The private or selfish virtues are, in this respect,
 more arbitrary than the public and social. In other respects they are,
 perhaps, less liable to doubt and controversy.
 
 In this kingdom, such continued ostentation, of late years, has
 prevailed among men in ACTIVE life with regard to PUBLIC SPIRIT, and
 among those in SPECULATIVE with regard to BENEVOLENCE; and so many false
 pretensions to each have been, no doubt, detected, that men of the world
 are apt, without any bad intention, to discover a sullen incredulity
 on the head of those moral endowments, and even sometimes absolutely to
 deny their existence and reality. In like manner I find, that, of old,
 the perpetual cant of the STOICS and CYNICS concerning VIRTUE, their
 magnificent professions and slender performances, bred a disgust in
 mankind; and Lucian, who, though licentious with regard to pleasure,
 is yet in other respects a very moral writer, cannot sometimes talk of
 virtue, so much boasted without betraying symptoms of spleen and irony.
 But surely this peevish delicacy, whence-ever it arises can never be
 carried so far as to make us deny the existence of every species of
 merit, and all distinction of manners and behaviour. Besides DISCRETION,
 CAUTION, ENTERPRISE, INDUSTRY, ASSIDUITY, FRUGALITY, ECONOMY,
 GOOD-SENSE, PRUDENCE, DISCERNMENT; besides these endowments, I say,
 whose very names force an avowal of their merit, there are many others,
 to which the most determined scepticism cannot for a moment refuse
 the tribute of praise and approbation. TEMPERANCE, SOBRIETY, PATIENCE,
 CONSTANCY, PERSEVERANCE, FORETHOUGHT, CONSIDERATENESS, SECRECY, ORDER,
 INSINUATION, ADDRESS, PRESENCE OF MIND, QUICKNESS OF CONCEPTION,
 FACILITY OF EXPRESSION, these, and a thousand more of the same kind, no
 man will ever deny to be excellencies and perfections. As their merit
 consists in their tendency to serve the person, possessed of them,
 without any magnificent claim to public and social desert, we are the
 less jealous of their pretensions, and readily admit them into the
 catalogue of laudable qualities. We are not sensible that, by this
 concession, we have paved the way for all the other moral excellencies,
 and cannot consistently hesitate any longer, with regard to
 disinterested benevolence, patriotism, and humanity.
 
 It seems, indeed, certain, that first appearances are here, as usual,
 extremely deceitful, and that it is more difficult, in a speculative
 way, to resolve into self-love the merit which we ascribe to the selfish
 virtues above mentioned, than that even of the social virtues, justice
 and beneficence. For this latter purpose, we need but say, that whatever
 conduct promotes the good of the community is loved, praised, and
 esteemed by the community, on account of that utility and interest, of
 which every one partakes; and though this affection and regard be,
 in reality, gratitude, not self-love, yet a distinction, even of this
 obvious nature, may not readily be made by superficial reasoners; and
 there is room, at least, to support the cavil and dispute for a moment.
 But as qualities, which tend only to the utility of their possessor,
 without any reference to us, or to the community, are yet esteemed and
 valued; by what theory or system can we account for this sentiment from
 self-love, or deduce it from that favourite origin? There seems here a
 necessity for confessing that the happiness and misery of others are not
 spectacles entirely indifferent to us; but that the view of the former,
 whether in its causes or effects, like sunshine or the prospect
 of well-cultivated plains (to carry our pretensions no higher),
 communicates a secret joy and satisfaction; the appearance of the
 latter, like a lowering cloud or barren landscape, throws a melancholy
 damp over the imagination. And this concession being once made, the
 difficulty is over; and a natural unforced interpretation of the
 phenomena of human life will afterwards, we may hope, prevail among all
 speculative enquirers.
 
 
 
 PART II.
 
 
 
 It may not be improper, in this place, to examine the influence of
 bodily endowments, and of the goods of fortune, over our sentiments of
 regard and esteem, and to consider whether these phenomena fortify
 or weaken the present theory. It will naturally be expected, that the
 beauty of the body, as is supposed by all ancient moralists, will be
 similar, in some respects, to that of the mind; and that every kind
 of esteem, which is paid to a man, will have something similar in
 its origin, whether it arise from his mental endowments, or from the
 situation of his exterior circumstances.
 
 It is evident, that one considerable source of BEAUTY in all animals
 is the advantage which they reap from the particular structure of their
 limbs and members, suitably to the particular manner of life, to which
 they are by nature destined. The just proportions of a horse, described
 by Xenophon and Virgil, are the same that are received at this day by
 our modern jockeys; because the foundation of them is the same, namely,
 experience of what is detrimental or useful in the animal.
 
 Broad shoulders, a lank belly, firm joints, taper legs; all these are
 beautiful in our species, because signs of force and vigour. Ideas of
 utility and its contrary, though they do not entirely determine what is
 handsome or deformed, are evidently the source of a considerable part of
 approbation or dislike.
 
 In ancient times, bodily strength and dexterity, being of greater USE
 and importance in war, was also much more esteemed and valued, than
 at present. Not to insist on Homer and the poets, we may observe,
 that historians scruple not to mention FORCE OF BODY among the other
 accomplishments even of Epaminondas, whom they acknowledge to be the
 greatest hero, statesman, and general of all the Greeks. [Footnote: CUM
 ALACRIBUS, SALTU; CUMM VELOCIBUS, CURSU; CUM VALIDIS RECTE CERTABATA.
 Sallust apud Veget.] A like praise is given to Pompey, one of the
 greatest of the Romans. [Footnote: Diodorus Siculus, lib. xv. It may
 be improper to give the character of Epaminondas, as drawn by the
 historian, in order to show the idea of perfect merit, which prevailed
 in those ages. In other illustrious men, say he, you will observe, that
 each possessed some one shining quality, which was the foundation of his
 fame: In Epaminondas all the VIRTUES are found united; force of body.
 eloquence of expression, vigour of mind, contempt of riches, gentleness
 of disposition, and what is chiefly to be regarded, courage and conduct
 of war.] This instance is similar to what we observed above with regard
 to memory.
 
 What derision and contempt, with both sexes, attend IMPOTENCE; while the
 unhappy object is regarded as one deprived of so capital a pleasure in
 life, and at the same time, as disabled from communicating it to others.
 BARRENNESS in women, being also a species of INUTILITY, is a reproach,
 but not in the same degree: of which the reason is very obvious,
 according to the present theory.
 
 There is no rule in painting or statuary more indispensible than that of
 balancing the figures, and placing them with the greatest exactness on
 their proper centre of gravity. A figure, which is not justly balanced,
 is ugly; because it conveys the disagreeable ideas of fall, harm, and
 pain.
 
 
 
 [Footenote: All men are equally liable to pain and disease and sickness;
 and may again recover health and ease. These circumstances, as they make
 no distinction between one man and another, are no source of pride or
 humility, regard or contempt. But comparing our own species to superior
 ones, it is a very mortifying consideration, that we should all be so
 liable to diseases and infirmities; and divines accordingly employ this
 topic, in order to depress self-conceit and vanity. They would have more
 success, if the common bent of our thoughts were not perpetually turned
 to compare ourselves with others.
 
    The infirmities of old age are mortifying; because a comparison with
 the young may take place. The king's evil is industriously concealed,
 because it affects others, and is often transmitted to posterity. The
 case is nearly the same with such diseases as convey any nauseous or
 frightful images; the epilepsy, for instance, ulcers, sores, scabs, &c.]
 
 
 
 A disposition or turn of mind, which qualifies a man to rise in the
 world and advance his fortune, is entitled to esteem and regard, as has
 already been explained. It may, therefore, naturally be supposed, that
 the actual possession of riches and authority will have a considerable
 influence over these sentiments.
 
 Let us examine any hypothesis by which we can account for the regard
 paid to the rich and powerful; we shall find none satisfactory, but that
 which derives it from the enjoyment communicated to the spectator by
 the images of prosperity, happiness, ease, plenty, authority, and the
 gratification of every appetite. Self-love, for instance, which some
 affect so much to consider as the source of every sentiment, is plainly
 insufficient for this purpose. Where no good-will or friendship appears,
 it is difficult to conceive on what we can found our hope of advantage
 from the riches of others; though we naturally respect the rich, even
 before they discover any such favourable disposition towards us.
 
 We are affected with the same sentiments, when we lie so much out of the
 sphere of their activity, that they cannot even be supposed to possess
 the power of serving us. A prisoner of war, in all civilized nations,
 is treated with a regard suited to his condition; and riches, it is
 evident, go far towards fixing the condition of any person. If birth
 and quality enter for a share, this still affords us an argument to our
 present purpose. For what is it we call a man of birth, but one who is
 descended from a long succession of rich and powerful ancestors, and who
 acquires our esteem by his connexion with persons whom we esteem? His
 ancestors, therefore, though dead, are respected, in some measure,
 on account of their riches; and consequently, without any kind of
 expectation.
 
 But not to go so far as prisoners of war or the dead, to find instances
 of this disinterested regard for riches; we may only observe, with
 a little attention, those phenomena which occur in common life and
 conversation. A man, who is himself, we shall suppose, of a competent
 fortune, and of no profession, being introduced to a company of
 strangers, naturally treats them with different degrees of respect, as
 he is informed of their different fortunes and conditions; though it
 is impossible that he can so suddenly propose, and perhaps he would
 not accept of, any pecuniary advantage from them. A traveller is always
 admitted into company, and meets with civility, in proportion as his
 train and equipage speak him a man of great or moderate fortune. In
 short, the different ranks of men are, in a great measure, regulated
 by riches; and that with regard to superiors as well as inferiors,
 strangers as well as acquaintance.
 
 What remains, therefore, but to conclude, that, as riches are desired
 for ourselves only as the means of gratifying our appetites, either at
 present or in some imaginary future period, they beget esteem in others
 merely from their having that influence. This indeed is their very
 nature or offence: they have a direct reference to the commodities,
 conveniences, and pleasures of life. The bill of a banker, who is broke,
 or gold in a desert island, would otherwise be full as valuable. When we
 approach a man who is, as we say, at his ease, we are presented with the
 pleasing ideas of plenty, satisfaction, cleanliness, warmth; a cheerful
 house, elegant furniture, ready service, and whatever is desirable in
 meat, drink, or apparel. On the contrary, when a poor man appears,
 the disagreeable images of want, penury, hard labour, dirty furniture,
 coarse or ragged clothes, nauseous meat and distasteful liquor,
 immediately strike our fancy. What else do we mean by saying that one
 is rich, the other poor? And as regard or contempt is the natural
 consequence of those different situations in life, it is easily seen
 what additional light and evidence this throws on our preceding theory,
 with regard to all moral distinctions.
 
 
      [Footnote: There is something extraordinary, and seemingly
 unaccountable in the operation of our passions, when we consider the
 fortune and situation of others. Very often another's advancement and
 prosperity produces envy, which has a strong mixture of hatred, and
 arises chiefly from the comparison of ourselves with the person. At the
 very same time, or at least in very short intervals, we may feel the
 passion of respect, which is a species of affection or good-will, with
 a mixture of humility. On the other hand, the misfortunes of our fellows
 often cause pity, which has in it a strong mixture of good-will. This
 sentiment of pity is nearly allied to contempt, which is a species of
 dislike, with a mixture of pride. I only point out these phenomena, as
 a subject of speculation to such as are curious with regard to moral
 enquiries. It is sufficient for the present purpose to observe in
 general, that power and riches commonly cause respect, poverty and
 meanness contempt, though particular views and incidents may sometimes
 raise the passions of envy and of pity.]
 
 A man who has cured himself of all ridiculous pre-possessions, and is
 fully, sincerely, and steadily convinced, from experience as well as
 philosophy, that the difference of fortune makes less difference in
 happiness than is vulgarly imagined; such a one does not measure out
 degrees of esteem according to the rent-rolls of his acquaintance. He
 may, indeed, externally pay a superior deference to the great lord above
 the vassal; because riches are the most convenient, being the most fixed
 and determinate, source of distinction. But his internal sentiments are
 more regulated by the personal characters of men, than by the accidental
 and capricious favours of fortune.
 
 In most countries of Europe, family, that is, hereditary riches, marked
 with titles and symbols from the sovereign, is the chief source of
 distinction. In England, more regard is paid to present opulence and
 plenty. Each practice has its advantages and disadvantages. Where birth
 is respected, unactive, spiritless minds remain in haughty indolence,
 and dream of nothing but pedigrees and genealogies: the generous and
 ambitious seek honour and authority, and reputation and favour. Where
 riches are the chief idol, corruption, venality, rapine prevail: arts,
 manufactures, commerce, agriculture flourish. The former prejudice,
 being favourable to military virtue, is more suited to monarchies.
 The latter, being the chief spur to industry, agrees better with a
 republican government. And we accordingly find that each of these forms
 of government, by varying the utility of those customs, has commonly a
 proportionable effect on the sentiments of mankind.
 
 
 
 SECTION VII.
 
 OF QUALITIES IMMEDIATELY AGREEABLE TO OURSELVES.
 
 
 
 Whoever has passed an evening with serious melancholy people, and
 has observed how suddenly the conversation was animated, and what
 sprightliness diffused itself over the countenance, discourse, and
 behaviour of every one, on the accession of a good-humoured, lively
 companion; such a one will easily allow that cheerfulness carries great
 merit with it, and naturally conciliates the good-will of mankind. No
 quality, indeed, more readily communicates itself to all around; because
 no one has a greater propensity to display itself, in jovial talk and
 pleasant entertainment. The flame spreads through the whole circle; and
 the most sullen and morose are often caught by it. That the melancholy
 hate the merry, even though Horace says it, I have some difficulty
 to allow; because I have always observed that, where the jollity is
 moderate and decent, serious people are so much the more delighted,
 as it dissipates the gloom with which they are commonly oppressed, and
 gives them an unusual enjoyment.
 
 From this influence of cheerfulness, both to communicate itself and to
 engage approbation, we may perceive that there is another set of mental
 qualities, which, without any utility or any tendency to farther good,
 either of the community or of the possessor, diffuse a satisfaction
 on the beholders, and procure friendship and regard. Their immediate
 sensation, to the person possessed of them, is agreeable. Others enter
 into the same humour, and catch the sentiment, by a contagion or natural
 sympathy; and as we cannot forbear loving whatever pleases, a kindly
 emotion arises towards the person who communicates so much satisfaction.
 He is a more animating spectacle; his presence diffuses over us more
 serene complacency and enjoyment; our imagination, entering into his
 feelings and disposition, is affected in a more agreeable manner than
 if a melancholy, dejected, sullen, anxious temper were presented to us.
 Hence the affection and probation which attend the former: the aversion
 and disgust with which we regard the latter.
 
 
      [Footnote: There is no man, who, on particular occasions, is not
 affected with all the disagreeable passions, fear, anger, dejection,
 grief, melancholy, anxiety, &c. But these, so far as they are natural,
 and universal, make no difference between one man and another, and can
 never be the object of blame. It is only when the disposition gives a
 PROPENSITY to any of these disagreeable passions, that they disfigure
 the character, and by giving uneasiness, convey the sentiment of
 disapprobation to the spectator.]
 
 Few men would envy the character which Caesar gives of Cassius:
 
  He loves no play,
  As thou do'st, Anthony: he hears no music:
  Seldom he smiles; and smiles in such a sort,
  As if he mock'd himself, and scorn'd his spirit
  That could be mov'd to smile at any thing.
 
 Not only such men, as Caesar adds, are commonly DANGEROUS, but also,
 having little enjoyment within themselves, they can never become
 agreeable to others, or contribute to social entertainment. In all
 polite nations and ages, a relish for pleasure, if accompanied with
 temperance and decency, is esteemed a considerable merit, even in the
 greatest men; and becomes still more requisite in those of inferior rank
 and character. It is an agreeable representation, which a French writer
 gives of the situation of his own mind in this particular, VIRTUE I
 LOVE, says he, WITHOUT AUSTERITY: PLEASURE WITHOUT EFFEMINACY: AND LIFE,
 WITHOUT FEARING ITS END. [Footnote: 'J'aime la vertu, sans rudesse;
 J'aime le plaisir, sans molesse; J'aime la vie, et n'en crains point la
 fin.'-ST. EVREMONT.]
 
 Who is not struck with any signal instance of greatness of mind or
 dignity of character; with elevation of sentiment, disdain of slavery,
 and with that noble pride and spirit, which arises from conscious
 virtue? The sublime, says Longinus, is often nothing but the echo or
 image of magnanimity; and where this quality appears in any one,
 even though a syllable be not uttered, it excites our applause and
 admiration; as may be observed of the famous silence of Ajax in the
 Odyssey, which expresses more noble disdain and resolute indignation
 than any language can convey [Footnote: Cap. 9.].
 
 WERE I Alexander, said Parmenio, I WOULD ACCEPT OF THESE OFFERS MADE BY
 DARIUS. SO WOULD I TOO, replied Alexander, WERE I PARMENIO. This saying
 is admirable, says Longinus, from a like principle. [Footnote: Idem.]
 
 GO! cries the same hero to his soldiers, when they refused to follow
 him to the Indies, GO TELL YOUR COUNTRYMEN, THAT YOU LEFT Alexander
 COMPLETING THE CONQUEST OF THE WORLD. 'Alexander,' said the Prince of
 Conde, who always admired this passage, 'abandoned by his soldiers,
 among barbarians, not yet fully subdued, felt in himself such a dignity
 and right of empire, that he could not believe it possible that any one
 would refuse to obey him. Whether in Europe or in Asia, among Greeks or
 Persians, all was indifferent to him: wherever he found men, he fancied
 he should find subjects.'
 
 The confident of Medea in the tragedy recommends caution and submission;
 and enumerating all the distresses of that unfortunate heroine, asks
 her, what she has to support her against her numerous and implacable
 enemies. MYSELF, replies she; MYSELF I SAY, AND IT IS ENOUGH. Boileau
 justly recommends this passage as an instance of true sublime [Footnote:
 Reflexion 10 sur Longin.].
 
 When Phocion, the modest, the gentle Phocion, was led to execution, he
 turned to one of his fellow-sufferers, who was lamenting his own
 hard fate, IS IT NOT GLORY ENOUGH FOR YOU, says he, THAT YOU DIE WITH
 PHOCION? [Footnote: Plutarch in Phoc.]
 
 Place in opposition the picture which Tacitus draws of Vitellius, fallen
 from empire, prolonging his ignominy from a wretched love of life,
 delivered over to the merciless rabble; tossed, buffeted, and kicked
 about; constrained, by their holding a poinard under his chin, to raise
 his head, and expose himself to every contumely. What abject infamy!
 What low humiliation! Yet even here, says the historian, he discovered
 some symptoms of a mind not wholly degenerate. To a tribune, who
 insulted him, he replied, I AM STILL YOUR EMPEROR.
 
 
      [Footnote: Tacit. hist. lib. iii. The author entering upon the
 narration, says, LANIATA VESTE, FOEDUM SPECACULUM DUCEBATUR, MULTIS
 INCREPANTIBUS, NULLO INLACRIMANTE: deformatitas exitus misericordiam
 abstulerat. To enter thoroughly into this method of thinking, we must
 make allowance for the ancient maxims, that no one ought to prolong his
 life after it became dishonourable; but, as he had always a right to
 dispose of it, it then became a duty to part with it.]
 
 We never excuse the absolute want of spirit and dignity of character, or
 a proper sense of what is due to one's self, in society and the common
 intercourse of life. This vice constitutes what we properly call
 MEANNESS; when a man can submit to the basest slavery, in order to
 gain his ends; fawn upon those who abuse him; and degrade himself by
 intimacies and familiarities with undeserving inferiors. A certain
 degree of generous pride or self-value is so requisite, that the absence
 of it in the mind displeases, after the same manner as the want of a
 nose, eye, or any of the most material feature of the face or member of
 the body.
 
 
      [Footnote: The absence of virtue may often be a vice; and that of
 the highest kind; as in the instance of ingratitude, as well as
 meanness. Where we expect a beauty, the disappointment gives an uneasy
 sensation, and produces a real deformity. An abjectness of character,
 likewise, is disgustful and contemptible in another view. Where a man
 has no sense of value in himself, we are not likely to have any higher
 esteem of him. And if the same person, who crouches to his superiors,
 is insolent to his inferiors (as often happens), this contrariety
 of behaviour, instead of correcting the former vice, aggravates it
 extremely by the addition of a vice still more odious. See Sect. VIII.]
 
 The utility of courage, both to the public and to the person possessed
 of it, is an obvious foundation of merit. But to any one who duly
 considers of the matter, it will appear that this quality has a peculiar
 lustre, which it derives wholly from itself, and from that noble
 elevation inseparable from it. Its figure, drawn by painters and by
 poets, displays, in each feature, a sublimity and daring confidence;
 which catches the eye, engages the affections, and diffuses, by
 sympathy, a like sublimity of sentiment over every spectator.
 
 Under what shining colours does Demosthenes [Footnote: De
 Corona.] represent Philip; where the orator apologizes for his own
 administration, and justifies that pertinacious love of liberty, with
 which he had inspired the Athenians. 'I beheld Philip,' says he, 'he
 with whom was your contest, resolutely, while in pursuit of empire
 and dominion, exposing himself to every wound; his eye gored, his neck
 wrested, his arm, his thigh pierced, what ever part of his body fortune
 should seize on, that cheerfully relinquishing; provided that, with what
 remained, he might live in honour and renown. And shall it be said
 that he, born in Pella, a place heretofore mean and ignoble, should
 be inspired with so high an ambition and thirst of fame: while you,
 Athenians, &c.' These praises excite the most lively admiration; but
 the views presented by the orator, carry us not, we see, beyond the hero
 himself, nor ever regard the future advantageous consequences of his
 valour.
 
 The material temper of the Romans, inflamed by continual wars, had
 raised their esteem of courage so high, that, in their language, it was
 called VIRTUE, by way of excellence and of distinction from all other
 moral qualities. THE Suevi, in the opinion of Tacitus, tus, [Footnote:
 De moribus Germ.] DRESSED THEIR HAIR WITH A LAUDIBLE INTENT: NOT
 FOR THE PURPOSE OF LOVING OR BEING LOVES; THEY DORNED THEMSELVES ONLY
 FOR THEIR ENEMIES, AND IN ORDER TO APPEAR MORE TERRIBLE. A sentiment
 of the historian, which would sound a little oddly in other nations and
 other ages.
 
 The Scythians, according to Herodotus, [Footnote: Lib. iv.] after
 scalping their enemies, dressed the skin like leather, and used it as a
 towel; and whoever had the most of those towels was most esteemed among
 them. So much had martial bravery, in that nation, as well as in many
 others, destroyed the sentiments of humanity; a virtue surely much more
 useful and engaging.
 
 It is indeed observable, that, among all uncultivated nations, who have
 not as yet had full experience of the advantages attending beneficence,
 justice, and the social virtues, courage is the predominant excellence;
 what is most celebrated by poets, recommended by parents and
 instructors, and admired by the public in general. The ethics of Homer
 are, in this particular, very different from those of Fenelon, his
 elegant imitator; and such as were well suited to an age, when one hero,
 as remarked by Thucydides [Lib.i.], could ask another, without offence,
 whether he were a robber or not. Such also very lately was the system
 of ethics which prevailed in many barbarous parts of Ireland; if we may
 credit Spencer, in his judicious account of the state of that kingdom.
 
 
      [Footnote from Spencer: It is a common use, says he, amongst
 their gentlemen's sons, that, as soon as they are able to use their
 weapons, they strait gather to themselves three or four stragglers or
 kern, with whom wandering a while up and down idly the country, taking
 only meat, he at last falleth into some bad occasion, that shall be
 offered; which being once made known, he is thenceforth counted a man of
 worth, in whom there is courage.]
 
 Of the same class of virtues with courage is that undisturbed
 philosophical tranquillity, superior to pain, sorrow, anxiety, and
 each assault of adverse fortune. Conscious of his own virtue, say the
 philosophers, the sage elevates himself above every accident of life;
 and securely placed in the temple of wisdom, looks down on inferior
 mortals engaged in pursuit of honours, riches, reputation, and every
 frivolous enjoyment. These pretentious, no doubt, when stretched to
 the utmost, are by far too magnificent for human nature. They carry,
 however, a grandeur with them, which seizes the spectator, and strikes
 him with admiration. And the nearer we can approach in practice to this
 sublime tranquillity and indifference (for we must distinguish it from a
 stupid insensibility), the more secure enjoyment shall we attain within
 ourselves, and the more greatness of mind shall we discover to the
 world. The philosophical tranquillity may, indeed, be considered only as
 a branch of magnanimity.
 
 Who admires not Socrates; his perpetual serenity and contentment, amidst
 the greatest poverty and domestic vexations; his resolute contempt of
 riches, and his magnanimous care of preserving liberty, while he refused
 all assistance from his friends and disciples, and avoided even the
 dependence of an obligation? Epictetus had not so much as a door to his
 little house or hovel; and therefore, soon lost his iron lamp, the only
 furniture which he had worth taking. But resolving to disappoint all
 robbers for the future, he supplied its place with an earthen lamp, of
 which he very peacefully kept possession ever after.
 
 Among the ancients, the heroes in philosophy, as well as those in war
 and patriotism, have a grandeur and force of sentiment, which
 astonishes our narrow souls, and is rashly rejected as extravagant and
 supernatural. They, in their turn, I allow, would have had equal
 reason to consider as romantic and incredible, the degree of humanity,
 clemency, order, tranquillity, and other social virtues, to which, in
 the administration of government, we have attained in modern times, had
 any one been then able to have made a fair representation of them. Such
 is the compensation, which nature, or rather education, has made in the
 distribution of excellencies and virtues, in those different ages.
 
 The merit of benevolence, arising from its utility, and its tendency
 to promote the good of mankind has been already explained, and is, no
 doubt, the source of a CONSIDERABLE part of that esteem, which is so
 universally paid to it. But it will also be allowed, that the very
 softness and tenderness of the sentiment, its engaging endearments, its
 fond expressions, its delicate attentions, and all that flow of mutual
 confidence and regard, which enters into a warm attachment of love
 and friendship: it will be allowed, I say, that these feelings,
 being delightful in themselves, are necessarily communicated to the
 spectators, and melt them into the same fondness and delicacy. The tear
 naturally starts in our eye on the apprehension of a warm sentiment of
 this nature: our breast heaves, our heart is agitated, and every humane
 tender principle of our frame is set in motion, and gives us the purest
 and most satisfactory enjoyment.
 
 When poets form descriptions of Elysian fields, where the blessed
 inhabitants stand in no need of each other's assistance, they yet
 represent them as maintaining a constant intercourse of love and
 friendship, and sooth our fancy with the pleasing image of these soft
 and gentle passions. The idea of tender tranquillity in a pastoral
 Arcadia is agreeable from a like principle, as has been observed above.
 [Footnote: Sect. v. Part 2.]
 
 Who would live amidst perpetual wrangling, and scolding, and mutual
 reproaches? The roughness and harshness of these emotions disturb and
 displease us: we suffer by contagion and sympathy; nor can we remain
 indifferent spectators, even though certain that no pernicious
 consequences would ever follow from such angry passions.
 
 As a certain proof that the whole merit of benevolence is not derived
 from its usefulness, we may observe, that in a kind way of blame, we
 say, a person is TOO GOOD; when he exceeds his part in society, and
 carries his attention for others beyond the proper bounds. In
 like manner, we say, a man is too HIGH-SPIRITED, TOO INTREPID, TOO
 INDIFFERENT ABOUT FORTUNE: reproaches, which really, at bottom, imply
 more esteem than many panegyrics. Being accustomed to rate the merit and
 demerit of characters chiefly by their useful or pernicious tendencies,
 we cannot forbear applying the epithet of blame, when we discover a
 sentiment, which rises to a degree, that is hurtful; but it may happen,
 at the same time, that its noble elevation, or its engaging tenderness
 so seizes the heart, as rather to increase our friendship and concern
 for the person.
 
 
      [Footnote: Cheerfulness could scarce admit of blame from its
 excess, were it not that dissolute mirth, without a proper cause or
 subject, is a sure symptom and characteristic of folly, and on that
 account disgustful.]
 
 The amours and attachments of Harry the IVth of France, during the civil
 wars of the league, frequently hurt his interest and his cause; but all
 the young, at least, and amorous, who can sympathize with the tender
 passions, will allow that this very weakness, for they will readily call
 it such, chiefly endears that hero, and interests them in his fortunes.
 
 The excessive bravery and resolute inflexibility of Charles the XIIth
 ruined his own country, and infested all his neighbours; but have
 such splendour and greatness in their appearance, as strikes us with
 admiration; and they might, in some degree, be even approved of, if they
 betrayed not sometimes too evident symptoms of madness and disorder.
 
 The Athenians pretended to the first invention of agriculture and of
 laws: and always valued themselves extremely on the benefit thereby
 procured to the whole race of mankind. They also boasted, and with
 reason, of their war like enterprises; particularly against those
 innumerable fleets and armies of Persians, which invaded Greece during
 the reigns of Darius and Xerxes. But though there be no comparison in
 point of utility, between these peaceful and military honours; yet we
 find, that the orators, who have writ such elaborate panegyrics on
 that famous city, have chiefly triumphed in displaying the warlike
 achievements. Lysias, Thucydides, Plato, and Isocrates discover, all of
 them, the same partiality; which, though condemned by calm reason and
 reflection, appears so natural in the mind of man.
 
 It is observable, that the great charm of poetry consists in lively
 pictures of the sublime passions, magnanimity, courage, disdain of
 fortune; or those of the tender affections, love and friendship; which
 warm the heart, and diffuse over it similar sentiments and emotions. And
 though all kinds of passion, even the most disagreeable, such as
 grief and anger, are observed, when excited by poetry, to convey a
 satisfaction, from a mechanism of nature, not easy to be explained: Yet
 those more elevated or softer affections have a peculiar influence, and
 please from more than one cause or principle. Not to mention that
 they alone interest us in the fortune of the persons represented, or
 communicate any esteem and affection for their character.
 
 And can it possibly be doubted, that this talent itself of poets, to
 move the passions, this pathetic and sublime of sentiment, is a very
 considerable merit; and being enhanced by its extreme rarity, may exalt
 the person possessed of it, above every character of the age in which
 he lives? The prudence, address, steadiness, and benign government of
 Augustus, adorned with all the splendour of his noble birth and imperial
 crown, render him but an unequal competitor for fame with Virgil, who
 lays nothing into the opposite scale but the divine beauties of his
 poetical genius.
 
 The very sensibility to these beauties, or a delicacy of taste, is
 itself a beauty in any character; as conveying the purest, the most
 durable, and most innocent of all enjoyments.
 
 These are some instances of the several species of merit, that are
 valued for the immediate pleasure which they communicate to the
 person possessed of them. No views of utility or of future beneficial
 consequences enter into this sentiment of approbation; yet is it of
 a kind similar to that other sentiment, which arises from views of a
 public or private utility. The same social sympathy, we may observe, or
 fellow-feeling with human happiness or misery, gives rise to both; and
 this analogy, in all the parts of the present theory, may justly be
 regarded as a confirmation of it.
 
 
 
 SECTION VIII.
 
 OF QUALITIES IMMEDIATELY AGREEABLE TO OTHERS.
 
 
 
 
      [Footnote: It is the nature and, indeed, the definition of
 virtue, that it is A QUALITY OF THE MIND AGREEABLE TO OR APPROVED OF BY
 EVERY ONE WHO CONSIDERS OR CONTEMPLATES IT. But some qualities produce
 pleasure, because they are useful to society, or useful or agreeable
 to the person himself; others produce it more immediately, which is the
 case with the class of virtues here considered.]
 
 AS the mutual shocks, in SOCIETY, and the oppositions of interest and
 self-love have constrained mankind to establish the laws of JUSTICE, in
 order to preserve the advantages of mutual assistance and protection: in
 like manner, the eternal contrarieties, in COMPANY, of men's pride and
 self-conceit, have introduced the rules of Good Manners or Politeness,
 in order to facilitate the intercourse of minds, and an undisturbed
 commerce and conversation. Among well-bred people, a mutual deference is
 affected; contempt of others disguised; authority concealed; attention
 given to each in his turn; and an easy stream of conversation
 maintained, without vehemence, without interruption, without eagerness
 for victory, and without any airs of superiority. These attentions
 and regards are immediately AGREEABLE to others, abstracted from any
 consideration of utility or beneficial tendencies: they conciliate
 affection, promote esteem, and extremely enhance the merit of the person
 who regulates his behaviour by them.
 
 Many of the forms of breeding are arbitrary and casual; but the thing
 expressed by them is still the same. A Spaniard goes out of his own
 house before his guest, to signify that he leaves him master of all.
 In other countries, the landlord walks out last, as a common mark of
 deference and regard.
 
 But, in order to render a man perfect GOOD COMPANY, he must have Wit and
 Ingenuity as well as good manners. What wit is, it may not be easy
 to define; but it is easy surely to determine that it is a quality
 immediately AGREEABLE to others, and communicating, on its first
 appearance, a lively joy and satisfaction to every one who has any
 comprehension of it. The most profound metaphysics, indeed, might be
 employed in explaining the various kinds and species of wit; and many
 classes of it, which are now received on the sole testimony of taste and
 sentiment, might, perhaps, be resolved into more general principles. But
 this is sufficient for our present purpose, that it does affect taste
 and sentiment, and bestowing an immediate enjoyment, is a sure source of
 approbation and affection.
 
 In countries where men pass most of their time in conversation, and
 visits, and assemblies, these COMPANIONABLE qualities, so to speak,
 are of high estimation, and form a chief part of personal merit. In
 countries where men live a more domestic life, and either are employed
 in business, or amuse themselves in a narrower circle of acquaintance,
 the more solid qualities are chiefly regarded. Thus, I have often
 observed, that, among the French, the first questions with regard to a
 stranger are, IS HE POLITE? HAS HE WIT? In our own country, the chief
 praise bestowed is always that of a GOOD-NATURED, SENSIBLE FELLOW.
 
 In conversation, the lively spirit of dialogue is AGREEABLE, even to
 those who desire not to have any share in the discourse: hence the
 teller of long stories, or the pompous declaimer, is very little
 approved of. But most men desire likewise their turn in the
 conversation, and regard, with a very evil eye, that LOQUACITY which
 deprives them of a right they are naturally so jealous of.
 
 There is a sort of harmless LIARS, frequently to be met with in company,
 who deal much in the marvellous. Their usual intention is to please and
 entertain; but as men are most delighted with what they conceive to be
 truth, these people mistake extremely the means of pleasing, and incur
 universal blame. Some indulgence, however, to lying or fiction is
 given in HUMOROUS stories; because it is there really agreeable and
 entertaining, and truth is not of any importance.
 
 Eloquence, genius of all kinds, even good sense, and sound reasoning,
 when it rises to an eminent degree, and is employed upon subjects of
 any considerable dignity and nice discernment; all these endowments seem
 immediately agreeable, and have a merit distinct from their usefulness.
 Rarity, likewise, which so much enhances the price of every thing, must
 set an additional value on these noble talents of the human mind.
 
 Modesty may be understood in different senses, even abstracted from
 chastity, which has been already treated of. It sometimes means that
 tenderness and nicety of honour, that apprehension of blame, that dread
 of intrusion or injury towards others, that Pudor, which is the proper
 guardian of every kind of virtue, and a sure preservative against vice
 and corruption. But its most usual meaning is when it is opposed
 to IMPUDENCE and ARROGANCE, and expresses a diffidence of our own
 judgement, and a due attention and regard for others. In young men
 chiefly, this quality is a sure sign of good sense; and is also the
 certain means of augmenting that endowment, by preserving their ears
 open to instruction, and making them still grasp after new attainments.
 But it has a further charm to every spectator; by flattering every man's
 vanity, and presenting the appearance of a docile pupil, who receives,
 with proper attention and respect, every word they utter.
 
 Men have, in general, a much greater propensity to overvalue than
 undervalue themselves; notwithstanding the opinion of Aristotle
 [Footnote: Ethic. ad Nicomachum.]. This makes us more jealous of the
 excess on the former side, and causes us to regard, with a peculiar
 indulgence, all tendency to modesty and self-diffidence; as esteeming
 the danger less of falling into any vicious extreme of that nature. It
 is thus in countries where men's bodies are apt to exceed in corpulency,
 personal beauty is placed in a much greater degree of slenderness, than
 in countries where that is the most usual defect. Being so often struck
 with instances of one species of deformity, men think they can never
 keep at too great a distance from it, and wish always to have a
 leaning to the opposite side. In like manner, were the door opened to
 self-praise, and were Montaigne's maxim observed, that one should say as
 frankly, I HAVE SENSE, I HAVE LEARNING, I HAVE COURAGE, BEAUTY, OR WIT,
 as it is sure we often think so; were this the case, I say, every one
 is sensible that such a flood of impertinence would break in upon us,
 as would render society wholly intolerable. For this reason custom
 has established it as a rule, in common societies, that men should not
 indulge themselves in self-praise, or even speak much of themselves;
 and it is only among intimate friends or people of very manly behaviour,
 that one is allowed to do himself justice. Nobody finds fault with
 Maurice, Prince of Orange, for his reply to one who asked him, whom he
 esteemed the first general of the age, THE MARQUIS OF SPINOLA, said he,
 IS THE SECOND. Though it is observable, that the self-praise implied is
 here better implied, than if it had been directly expressed, without any
 cover or disguise.
 
 He must be a very superficial thinker, who imagines that all instances
 of mutual deference are to be understood in earnest, and that a man
 would be more esteemable for being ignorant of his own merits and
 accomplishments. A small bias towards modesty, even in the internal
 sentiment, is favourably regarded, especially in young people; and a
 strong bias is required in the outward behaviour; but this excludes not
 a noble pride and spirit, which may openly display itself in its full
 extent, when one lies under calumny or oppression of any kind. The
 generous contumacy of Socrates, as Cicero calls it, has been highly
 celebrated in all ages; and when joined to the usual modesty of his
 behaviour, forms a shining character. Iphicrates, the Athenian, being
 accused of betraying the interests of his country, asked his accuser,
 WOULD YOU, says he, HAVE, ON A LIKE OCCASION, BEEN GUILTY OF THAT CRIME?
 BY NO MEANS, replied the other. AND CAN YOU THEN IMAGINE, cried the
 hero, that Iphicrates WOULD BE GUILTY? [Footnote: Quinctil. lib. v. cap.
 12.]--In short, a generous spirit and self-value, well founded, decently
 disguised, and courageously supported under distress and calumny, is a
 great excellency, and seems to derive its merit from the noble elevation
 of its sentiment, or its immediate agreeableness to its possessor. In
 ordinary characters, we approve of a bias towards modesty, which is
 a quality immediately agreeable to others: the vicious excess of
 the former virtue, namely, insolence or haughtiness, is immediately
 disagreeable to others; the excess of the latter is so to the possessor.
 Thus are the boundaries of these duties adjusted.
 
 A desire of fame, reputation, or a character with others, is so far
 from being blameable, that it seems inseparable from virtue, genius,
 capacity, and a generous or noble disposition. An attention even to
 trivial matters, in order to please, is also expected and demanded by
 society; and no one is surprised, if he find a man in company to observe
 a greater elegance of dress and more pleasant flow of conversation, than
 when he passes his time at home, and with his own family. Wherein, then,
 consists Vanity, which is so justly regarded as a fault or imperfection.
 It seems to consist chiefly in such an intemperate display of our
 advantages, honours, and accomplishments; in such an importunate and
 open demand of praise and admiration, as is offensive to others, and
 encroaches too far on their secret vanity and ambition. It is besides a
 sure symptom of the want of true dignity and elevation of mind, which is
 so great an ornament in any character. For why that impatient desire
 of applause; as if you were not justly entitled to it, and might not
 reasonably expect that it would for ever at tend you? Why so anxious to
 inform us of the great company which you have kept; the obliging things
 which were said to you; the honours, the distinctions which you met
 with; as if these were not things of course, and what we could readily,
 of ourselves, have imagined, without being told of them?
 
 Decency, or a proper regard to age, sex, character, and station in the
 world, may be ranked among the qualities which are immediately agreeable
 to others, and which, by that means, acquire praise and approbation. An
 effeminate behaviour in a man, a rough manner in a woman; these are ugly
 because unsuitable to each character, and different from the qualities
 which we expect in the sexes. It is as if a tragedy abounded in comic
 beauties, or a comedy in tragic. The disproportions hurt the eye, and
 convey a disagreeable sentiment to the spectators, the source of blame
 and disapprobation. This is that INDECORUM, which is explained so much
 at large by Cicero in his Offices.
 
 Among the other virtues, we may also give Cleanliness a place; since
 it naturally renders us agreeable to others, and is no inconsiderable
 source of love and affection. No one will deny, that a negligence in
 this particular is a fault; and as faults are nothing but smaller vices,
 and this fault can have no other origin than the uneasy sensation which
 it excites in others; we may, in this instance, seemingly so trivial,
 clearly discover the origin of moral distinctions, about which the
 learned have involved themselves in such mazes of perplexity and error.
 
 But besides all the AGREEABLE qualities, the origin of whose beauty
 we can, in some degree, explain and account for, there still remains
 something mysterious and inexplicable, which conveys an immediate
 satisfaction to the spectator, but how, or why, or for what reason,
 he cannot pretend to determine. There is a manner, a grace, an ease, a
 genteelness, an I-know-not-what, which some men possess above others,
 which is very different from external beauty and comeliness, and which,
 however, catches our affection almost as suddenly and powerfully. And
 though this MANNER be chiefly talked of in the passion between the
 sexes, where the concealed magic is easily explained, yet surely much
 of it prevails in all our estimation of characters, and forms no
 inconsiderable part of personal merit. This class of accomplishments,
 therefore, must be trusted entirely to the blind, but sure testimony of
 taste and sentiment; and must be considered as a part of ethics, left by
 nature to baffle all the pride of philosophy, and make her sensible of
 her narrow boundaries and slender acquisitions.
 
 We approve of another, because of his wit, politeness, modesty, decency,
 or any agreeable quality which he possesses; although he be not of our
 acquaintance, nor has ever given us any entertainment, by means of
 these accomplishments. The idea, which we form of their effect on his
 acquaintance, has an agreeable influence on our imagination, and gives
 us the sentiment of approbation. This principle enters into all the
 judgements which we form concerning manners and characters.
 
 
 
 
 SECTION IX. CONCLUSION.
 
 
 
 PART I.
 
 
 
 IT may justly appear surprising that any man in so late an age, should
 find it requisite to prove, by elaborate reasoning, that Personal Merit
 consists altogether in the possession of mental qualities, USEFUL or
 AGREEABLE to the PERSON HIMSELF or to OTHERS. It might be expected that
 this principle would have occurred even to the first rude, unpractised
 enquirers concerning morals, and been received from its own evidence,
 without any argument or disputation. Whatever is valuable in any kind,
 so naturally classes itself under the division of USEFUL or AGREEABLE,
 the UTILE or the DULCE, that it is not easy to imagine why we should
 ever seek further, or consider the question as a matter of nice research
 or inquiry. And as every thing useful or agreeable must possess these
 qualities with regard either to the PERSON HIMSELF or to OTHERS, the
 complete delineation or description of merit seems to be performed as
 naturally as a shadow is cast by the sun, or an image is reflected upon
 water. If the ground, on which the shadow is cast, be not broken and
 uneven; nor the surface from which the image is reflected, disturbed
 and confused; a just figure is immediately presented, without any art
 or attention. And it seems a reasonable presumption, that systems and
 hypotheses have perverted our natural understanding, when a theory,
 so simple and obvious, could so long have escaped the most elaborate
 examination.
 
 But however the case may have fared with philosophy, in common life
 these principles are still implicitly maintained; nor is any other topic
 of praise or blame ever recurred to, when we employ any panegyric or
 satire, any applause or censure of human action and behaviour. If we
 observe men, in every intercourse of business or pleasure, in every
 discourse and conversation, we shall find them nowhere, except the
 schools, at any loss upon this subject. What so natural, for instance,
 as the following dialogue? You are very happy, we shall suppose one to
 say, addressing himself to another, that you have given your daughter
 to Cleanthes. He is a man of honour and humanity. Every one, who has
 any intercourse with him, is sure of FAIR and KIND treatment. [Footnote:
 Qualities useful to others.] I congratulate you too, says another,
 on the promising expectations of this son-in-law; whose assiduous
 application to the study of the laws, whose quick penetration and early
 knowledge both of men and business, prognosticate the greatest honours
 and advancement. [Footnote: Qualities useful to the person himself.]
 You surprise me, replies a third, when you talk of Cleanthes as a man
 of business and application. I met him lately in a circle of the gayest
 company, and he was the very life and soul of our conversation: so much
 wit with good manners; so much gallantry without affectation; so much
 ingenious knowledge so genteelly delivered, I have never before observed
 in any one. [Footnote: Qualities immediately agreeable to others,]
 You would admire him still more, says a fourth, if you knew him more
 familiarly. That cheerfulness, which you might remark in him, is not a
 sudden flash struck out by company: it runs through the whole tenor of
 his life, and preserves a perpetual serenity on his countenance, and
 tranquillity in his soul. He has met with severe trials, misfortunes as
 well as dangers; and by his greatness of mind, was still superior to
 all of them [Footnote: Qualities immediately agreeable to the person
 himself]. The image, gentlemen, which you have here delineated of
 Cleanthes, cried I, is that of accomplished merit. Each of you has given
 a stroke of the pencil to his figure; and you have unawares exceeded all
 the pictures drawn by Gratian or Castiglione. A philosopher might select
 this character as a model of perfect virtue.
 
 And as every quality which is useful or agreeable to ourselves or others
 is, in common life, allowed to be a part of personal merit; so no other
 will ever be received, where men judge of things by their natural,
 unprejudiced reason, without the delusive glosses of superstition and
 false religion. Celibacy, fasting, penance, mortification, self-denial,
 humility, silence, solitude, and the whole train of monkish virtues; for
 what reason are they everywhere rejected by men of sense, but because
 they serve to no manner of purpose; neither advance a man's fortune in
 the world, nor render him a more valuable member of society; neither
 qualify him for the entertainment of company, nor increase his power of
 self-enjoyment? We observe, on the contrary, that they cross all these
 desirable ends; stupify the understanding and harden the heart, obscure
 the fancy and sour the temper. We justly, therefore, transfer them to
 the opposite column, and place them in the catalogue of vices; nor has
 any superstition force sufficient among men of the world, to pervert
 entirely these natural sentiments. A gloomy, hair-brained enthusiast,
 after his death, may have a place in the calendar; but will scarcely
 ever be admitted, when alive, into intimacy and society, except by those
 who are as delirious and dismal as himself.
 
 It seems a happiness in the present theory, that it enters not into that
 vulgar dispute concerning the DEGREES of benevolence or self-love, which
 prevail in human nature; a dispute which is never likely to have any
 issue, both because men, who have taken part, are not easily convinced,
 and because the phenomena, which can be produced on either side, are so
 dispersed, so uncertain, and subject to so many interpretations, that it
 is scarcely possible accurately to compare them, or draw from them any
 determinate inference or conclusion. It is sufficient for our present
 purpose, if it be allowed, what surely, without the greatest absurdity
 cannot be disputed, that there is some benevolence, however small,
 infused into our bosom; some spark of friendship for human kind; some
 particle of the dove kneaded into our frame, along with the elements of
 the wolf and serpent. Let these generous sentiments be supposed ever
 so weak; let them be insufficient to move even a hand or finger of our
 body, they must still direct the determinations of our mind, and where
 everything else is equal, produce a cool preference of what is useful
 and serviceable to mankind, above what is pernicious and dangerous. A
 MORAL DISTINCTION, therefore, immediately arises; a general sentiment of
 blame and approbation; a tendency, however faint, to the objects of the
 one, and a proportionable aversion to those of the other. Nor will those
 reasoners, who so earnestly maintain the predominant selfishness of
 human kind, be any wise scandalized at hearing of the weak sentiments of
 virtue implanted in our nature. On the contrary, they are found as ready
 to maintain the one tenet as the other; and their spirit of satire (for
 such it appears, rather than of corruption) naturally gives rise to
 both opinions; which have, indeed, a great and almost an indissoluble
 connexion together.
 
 Avarice, ambition, vanity, and all passions vulgarly, though improperly,
 comprised under the denomination of SELF-LOVE, are here excluded from
 our theory concerning the origin of morals, not because they are too
 weak, but because they have not a proper direction for that purpose.
 The notion of morals implies some sentiment common to all mankind, which
 recommends the same object to general approbation, and makes every man,
 or most men, agree in the same opinion or decision concerning it. It
 also implies some sentiment, so universal and comprehensive as to extend
 to all mankind, and render the actions and conduct, even of the persons
 the most remote, an object of applause or censure, according as they
 agree or disagree with that rule of right which is established. These
 two requisite circumstances belong alone to the sentiment of humanity
 here insisted on. The other passions produce in every breast, many
 strong sentiments of desire and aversion, affection and hatred; but
 these neither are felt so much in common, nor are so comprehensive, as
 to be the foundation of any general system and established theory of
 blame or approbation.
 
 When a man denominates another his ENEMY, his RIVAL, his ANTAGONIST, his
 ADVERSARY, he is understood to speak the language of self-love, and to
 express sentiments, peculiar to himself, and arising from his particular
 circumstances and situation. But when he bestows on any man the epithets
 of VICIOUS or ODIOUS or DEPRAVED, he then speaks another language, and
 expresses sentiments, in which he expects all his audience are to
 concur with him. He must here, therefore, depart from his private and
 particular situation, and must choose a point of view, common to him
 with others; he must move some universal principle of the human frame,
 and touch a string to which all mankind have an accord and symphony. If
 he mean, therefore, to express that this man possesses qualities, whose
 tendency is pernicious to society, he has chosen this common point of
 view, and has touched the principle of humanity, in which every man, in
 some degree, concurs. While the human heart is compounded of the same
 elements as at present, it will never be wholly indifferent to public
 good, nor entirely unaffected with the tendency of characters and
 manners. And though this affection of humanity may not generally be
 esteemed so strong as vanity or ambition, yet, being common to all men,
 it can alone be the foundation of morals, or of any-general system of
 blame or praise. One man's ambition is not another's ambition, nor will
 the same event or object satisfy both; but the humanity of one man is
 the humanity of every one, and the same object touches this passion in
 all human creatures.
 
 But the sentiments, which arise from humanity, are not only the same in
 all human creatures, and produce the same approbation or censure; but
 they also comprehend all human creatures; nor is there any one whose
 conduct or character is not, by their means, an object to every one of
 censure or approbation. On the contrary, those other passions,
 commonly denominated selfish, both produce different sentiments in each
 individual, according to his particular situation; and also contemplate
 the greater part of mankind with the utmost indifference and unconcern.
 Whoever has a high regard and esteem for me flatters my vanity; whoever
 expresses contempt mortifies and displeases me; but as my name is known
 but to a small part of mankind, there are few who come within the sphere
 of this passion, or excite, on its account, either my affection or
 disgust. But if you represent a tyrannical, insolent, or barbarous
 behaviour, in any country or in any age of the world, I soon carry my
 eye to the pernicious tendency of such a conduct, and feel the sentiment
 of repugnance and displeasure towards it. No character can be so remote
 as to be, in this light, wholly indifferent to me. What is beneficial
 to society or to the person himself must still be preferred. And every
 quality or action, of every human being, must, by this means, be ranked
 under some class or denomination, expressive of general censure or
 applause.
 
 What more, therefore, can we ask to distinguish the sentiments,
 dependent on humanity, from those connected with any other passion, or
 to satisfy us, why the former are the origin of morals, not the latter?
 Whatever conduct gains my approbation, by touching my humanity, procures
 also the applause of all mankind, by affecting the same principle in
 them; but what serves my avarice or ambition pleases these passions
 in me alone, and affects not the avarice and ambition of the rest of
 mankind. There is no circumstance of conduct in any man, provided
 it have a beneficial tendency, that is not agreeable to my humanity,
 however remote the person; but every man, so far removed as neither
 to cross nor serve my avarice and ambition, is regarded as wholly
 indifferent by those passions. The distinction, therefore, between these
 species of sentiment being so great and evident, language must soon be
 moulded upon it, and must invent a peculiar set of terms, in order to
 express those universal sentiments of censure or approbation, which
 arise from humanity, or from views of general usefulness and its
 contrary. Virtue and Vice become then known; morals are recognized;
 certain general ideas are framed of human conduct and behaviour; such
 measures are expected from men in such situations. This action is
 determined to be conformable to our abstract rule; that other, contrary.
 And by such universal principles are the particular sentiments of
 self-love frequently controlled and limited.
 
 
      [Footnote: It seems certain, both from reason and experience,
 that a rude, untaught savage regulates chiefly his love and hatred by
 the ideas of private utility and injury, and has but faint conceptions
 of a general rule or system of behaviour. The man who stands opposite
 to him in battle, he hates heartedly, not only for the present moment,
 which is almost unavoidable, but for ever after; nor is he satisfied
 without the most extreme punishment and vengeance. But we, accustomed
 to society, and to more enlarged reflections, consider, that this man
 is serving his own country and community; that any man, in the same
 situation, would do the same; that we ourselves, in like circumstances,
 observe a like conduct; that; in general, human society is best
 supported on such maxims: and by these suppositions and views, we
 correct, in some measure, our ruder and narrower positions. And though
 much of our friendship and enemity be still regulated by private
 considerations of benefit and harm, we pay, at least, this homage to
 general rules, which we are accustomed to respect, that we commonly
 perver our adversary's conduct, by imputing malice or injustice to him,
 in order to give vent to those passions, which arise from self-love
 and private interest. When the heart is full of rage, it never wants
 pretences of this nature; though sometimes as frivolous, as those from
 which Horace, being almost crushed by the fall of a tree, effects to
 accuse of parricide the first planter of it.]
 
 From instances of popular tumults, seditions, factions, panics, and
 of all passions, which are shared with a multitude, we may learn the
 influence of society in exciting and supporting any emotion; while the
 most ungovernable disorders are raised, we find, by that means, from the
 slightest and most frivolous occasions. Solon was no very cruel, though,
 perhaps, an unjust legislator, who punished neuters in civil wars; and
 few, I believe, would, in such cases, incur the penalty, were their
 affection and discourse allowed sufficient to absolve them. No
 selfishness, and scarce any philosophy, have there force sufficient to
 support a total coolness and indifference; and he must be more or less
 than man, who kindles not in the common blaze. What wonder then, that
 moral sentiments are found of such influence in life; though springing
 from principles, which may appear, at first sight, somewhat small
 and delicate? But these principles, we must remark, are social and
 universal; they form, in a manner, the PARTY of humankind against vice
 or disorder, its common enemy. And as the benevolent concern for others
 is diffused, in a greater or less degree, over all men, and is the same
 in all, it occurs more frequently in discourse, is cherished by society
 and conversation, and the blame and approbation, consequent on it, are
 thereby roused from that lethargy into which they are probably lulled,
 in solitary and uncultivated nature. Other passions, though perhaps
 originally stronger, yet being selfish and private, are often
 overpowered by its force, and yield the dominion of our breast to those
 social and public principles.
 
 Another spring of our constitution, that brings a great addition of
 force to moral sentiments, is the love of fame; which rules, with such
 uncontrolled authority, in all generous minds, and is often the grand
 object of all their designs and undertakings. By our continual and
 earnest pursuit of a character, a name, a reputation in the world, we
 bring our own deportment and conduct frequently in review, and consider
 how they appear in the eyes of those who approach and regard us. This
 constant habit of surveying ourselves, as it were, in reflection,
 keeps alive all the sentiments of right and wrong, and begets, in noble
 natures, a certain reverence for themselves as well as others, which
 is the surest guardian of every virtue. The animal conveniencies and
 pleasures sink gradually in their value; while every inward beauty and
 moral grace is studiously acquired, and the mind is accomplished in
 every perfection, which can adorn or embellish a rational creature.
 
 Here is the most perfect morality with which we are acquainted: here is
 displayed the force of many sympathies. Our moral sentiment is itself
 a feeling chiefly of that nature, and our regard to a character with
 others seems to arise only from a care of preserving a character with
 ourselves; and in order to attain this end, we find it necessary to prop
 our tottering judgement on the correspondent approbation of mankind.
 
 But, that we may accommodate matters, and remove if possible every
 difficulty, let us allow all these reasonings to be false. Let us allow
 that, when we resolve the pleasure, which arises from views of utility,
 into the sentiments of humanity and sympathy, we have embraced a wrong
 hypothesis. Let us confess it necessary to find some other explication
 of that applause, which is paid to objects, whether inanimate, animate,
 or rational, if they have a tendency to promote the welfare and
 advantage of mankind. However difficult it be to conceive that an object
 is approved of on account of its tendency to a certain end, while the
 end itself is totally indifferent: let us swallow this absurdity,
 and consider what are the consequences. The preceding delineation
 or definition of Personal Merit must still retain its evidence and
 authority: it must still be allowed that every quality of the mind,
 which is USEFUL or AGREEABLE to the PERSON HIMSELF or to OTHERS,
 communicates a pleasure to the spectator, engages his esteem, and is
 admitted under the honourable denomination of virtue or merit. Are not
 justice, fidelity, honour, veracity, allegiance, chastity, esteemed
 solely on account of their tendency to promote the good of society?
 Is not that tendency inseparable from humanity, benevolence, lenity,
 generosity, gratitude, moderation, tenderness, friendship, and all
 the other social virtues? Can it possibly be doubted that industry,
 discretion, frugality, secrecy, order, perseverance, forethought,
 judgement, and this whole class of virtues and accomplishments, of which
 many pages would not contain the catalogue; can it be doubted, I
 say, that the tendency of these qualities to promote the interest and
 happiness of their possessor, is the sole foundation of their merit?
 Who can dispute that a mind, which supports a perpetual serenity and
 cheerfulness, a noble dignity and undaunted spirit, a tender affection
 and good-will to all around; as it has more enjoyment within itself,
 is also a more animating and rejoicing spectacle, than if dejected with
 melancholy, tormented with anxiety, irritated with rage, or sunk into
 the most abject baseness and degeneracy? And as to the qualities,
 immediately AGREEABLE to OTHERS, they speak sufficiently for themselves;
 and he must be unhappy, indeed, either in his own temper, or in his
 situation and company, who has never perceived the charms of a facetious
 wit or flowing affability, of a delicate modesty or decent genteelness
 of address and manner.
 
 I am sensible, that nothing can be more unphilosophical than to be
 positive or dogmatical on any subject; and that, even if excessive
 scepticism could be maintained, it would not be more destructive to all
 just reasoning and inquiry. I am convinced that, where men are the most
 sure and arrogant, they are commonly the most mistaken, and have there
 given reins to passion, without that proper deliberation and suspense,
 which can alone secure them from the grossest absurdities. Yet, I must
 confess, that this enumeration puts the matter in so strong a light,
 that I cannot, at PRESENT, be more assured of any truth, which I learn
 from reasoning and argument, than that personal merit consists entirely
 in the usefulness or agreeableness of qualities to the person himself
 possessed of them, or to others, who have any intercourse with him. But
 when I reflect that, though the bulk and figure of the earth have been
 measured and delineated, though the motions of the tides have been
 accounted for, the order and economy of the heavenly bodies subjected to
 their proper laws, and Infinite itself reduced to calculation; yet men
 still dispute concerning the foundation of their moral duties. When I
 reflect on this, I say, I fall back into diffidence and scepticism, and
 suspect that an hypothesis, so obvious, had it been a true one, would,
 long ere now, have been received by the unanimous suffrage and consent
 of mankind.
 
 
 
 PART II.
 
 
 
 Having explained the moral APPROBATION attending merit or virtue, there
 remains nothing but briefly to consider our interested OBLIGATION to
 it, and to inquire whether every man, who has any regard to his own
 happiness and welfare, will not best find his account in the practice of
 every moral duty. If this can be clearly ascertained from the foregoing
 theory, we shall have the satisfaction to reflect, that we have
 advanced principles, which not only, it is hoped, will stand the test
 of reasoning and inquiry, but may contribute to the amendment of men's
 lives, and their improvement in morality and social virtue. And though
 the philosophical truth of any proposition by no means depends on its
 tendency to promote the interests of society; yet a man has but a bad
 grace, who delivers a theory, however true, which, he must confess,
 leads to a practice dangerous and pernicious. Why rake into those
 corners of nature which spread a nuisance all around? Why dig up the
 pestilence from the pit in which it is buried? The ingenuity of your
 researches may be admired, but your systems will be detested; and
 mankind will agree, if they cannot refute them, to sink them, at least,
 in eternal silence and oblivion. Truths which are pernicious to society,
 if any such there be, will yield to errors which are salutary and
 ADVANTAGEOUS.
 
 But what philosophical truths can be more advantageous to society, than
 those here delivered, which represent virtue in all her genuine and most
 engaging charms, and makes us approach her with ease, familiarity, and
 affection? The dismal dress falls off, with which many divines, and
 some philosophers, have covered her; and nothing appears but gentleness,
 humanity, beneficence, affability; nay, even at proper intervals, play,
 frolic, and gaiety. She talks not of useless austerities and rigours,
 suffering and self-denial. She declares that her sole purpose is to make
 her votaries and all mankind, during every instant of their existence,
 if possible, cheerful and happy; nor does she ever willingly part with
 any pleasure but in hopes of ample compensation in some other period
 of their lives. The sole trouble which she demands, is that of just
 calculation, and a steady preference of the greater happiness. And if
 any austere pretenders approach her, enemies to joy and pleasure, she
 either rejects them as hypocrites and deceivers; or, if she admit them
 in her train, they are ranked, however, among the least favoured of her
 votaries.
 
 And, indeed, to drop all figurative expression, what hopes can we
 ever have of engaging mankind to a practice which we confess full of
 austerity and rigour? Or what theory of morals can ever serve any useful
 purpose, unless it can show, by a particular detail, that all the duties
 which it recommends, are also the true interest of each individual?
 The peculiar advantage of the foregoing system seems to be, that it
 furnishes proper mediums for that purpose.
 
 That the virtues which are immediately USEFUL or AGREEABLE to the person
 possessed of them, are desirable in a view to self-interest, it would
 surely be superfluous to prove. Moralists, indeed, may spare themselves
 all the pains which they often take in recommending these duties.
 To what purpose collect arguments to evince that temperance is
 advantageous, and the excesses of pleasure hurtful, when it appears that
 these excesses are only denominated such, because they are hurtful;
 and that, if the unlimited use of strong liquors, for instance, no more
 impaired health or the faculties of mind and body than the use of air or
 water, it would not be a whit more vicious or blameable?
 
 It seems equally superfluous to prove, that the COMPANIONABLE virtues of
 good manners and wit, decency and genteelness, are more desirable than
 the contrary qualities. Vanity alone, without any other consideration,
 is a sufficient motive to make us wish for the possession of these
 accomplishments. No man was ever willingly deficient in this particular.
 All our failures here proceed from bad education, want of capacity, or a
 perverse and unpliable disposition. Would you have your company coveted,
 admired, followed; rather than hated, despised, avoided? Can any one
 seriously deliberate in the case? As no enjoyment is sincere, without
 some reference to company and society; so no society can be agreeable,
 or even tolerable, where a man feels his presence unwelcome, and
 discovers all around him symptoms of disgust and aversion.
 
 But why, in the greater society or confederacy of mankind, should not
 the case be the same as in particular clubs and companies? Why is
 it more doubtful, that the enlarged virtues of humanity, generosity,
 beneficence, are desirable with a view of happiness and self-interest,
 than the limited endowments of ingenuity and politeness? Are we
 apprehensive lest those social affections interfere, in a greater and
 more immediate degree than any other pursuits, with private utility,
 and cannot be gratified, without some important sacrifice of honour and
 advantage? If so, we are but ill-instructed in the nature of the human
 passions, and are more influenced by verbal distinctions than by real
 differences.
 
 Whatever contradiction may vulgarly be supposed between the SELFISH and
 SOCIAL sentiments or dispositions, they are really no more opposite than
 selfish and ambitious, selfish and revengeful, selfish and vain. It is
 requisite that there be an original propensity of some kind, in order
 to be a basis to self-love, by giving a relish to the objects of
 its pursuit; and none more fit for this purpose than benevolence
 or humanity. The goods of fortune are spent in one gratification or
 another: the miser who accumulates his annual income, and lends it out
 at interest, has really spent it in the gratification of his avarice.
 And it would be difficult to show why a man is more a loser by a
 generous action, than by any other method of expense; since the utmost
 which he can attain by the most elaborate selfishness, is the indulgence
 of some affection.
 
 Now if life, without passion, must be altogether insipid and tiresome;
 let a man suppose that he has full power of modelling his own
 disposition, and let him deliberate what appetite or desire he would
 choose for the foundation of his happiness and enjoyment. Every
 affection, he would observe, when gratified by success, gives a
 satisfaction proportioned to its force and violence; but besides this
 advantage, common to all, the immediate feeling of benevolence and
 friendship, humanity and kindness, is sweet, smooth, tender, and
 agreeable, independent of all fortune and accidents. These virtues are
 besides attended with a pleasing consciousness or remembrance, and keep
 us in humour with ourselves as well as others; while we retain the
 agreeable reflection of having done our part towards mankind and
 society. And though all men show a jealousy of our success in the
 pursuits of avarice and ambition; yet are we almost sure of their
 good-will and good wishes, so long as we persevere in the paths of
 virtue, and employ ourselves in the execution of generous plans and
 purposes. What other passion is there where we shall find so many
 advantages united; an agreeable sentiment, a pleasing consciousness, a
 good reputation? But of these truths, we may observe, men are, of
 themselves, pretty much convinced; nor are they deficient in their duty
 to society, because they would not wish to be generous, friendly, and
 humane; but because they do not feel themselves such.
 
 Treating vice with the greatest candour, and making it all possible
 concessions, we must acknowledge that there is not, in any instance, the
 smallest pretext for giving it the preference above virtue, with a view
 of self-interest; except, perhaps, in the case of justice, where a man,
 taking things in a certain light, may often seem to be a loser by his
 integrity. And though it is allowed that, without a regard to property,
 no society could subsist; yet according to the imperfect way in which
 human affairs are conducted, a sensible knave, in particular incidents,
 may think that an act of iniquity or infidelity will make a considerable
 addition to his fortune, without causing any considerable breach in the
 social union and confederacy. That HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY, may be
 a good general rule, but is liable to many exceptions; and he, it may
 perhaps be thought, conducts himself with most wisdom, who observes the
 general rule, and takes advantage of all the exceptions. I must confess
 that, if a man think that this reasoning much requires an answer,
 it would be a little difficult to find any which will to him appear
 satisfactory and convincing. If his heart rebel not against such
 pernicious maxims, if he feel no reluctance to the thoughts of villainy
 or baseness, he has indeed lost a considerable motive to virtue; and we
 may expect that this practice will be answerable to his speculation. But
 in all ingenuous natures, the antipathy to treachery and roguery is
 too strong to be counter-balanced by any views of profit or pecuniary
 advantage. Inward peace of mind, consciousness of integrity, a
 satisfactory review of our own conduct; these are circumstances, very
 requisite to happiness, and will be cherished and cultivated by every
 honest man, who feels the importance of them.
 
 Such a one has, besides, the frequent satisfaction of seeing knaves,
 with all their pretended cunning and abilities, betrayed by their own
 maxims; and while they purpose to cheat with moderation and secrecy, a
 tempting incident occurs, nature is frail, and they give into the snare;
 whence they can never extricate themselves, without a total loss of
 reputation, and the forfeiture of all future trust and confidence with
 mankind.
 
 But were they ever so secret and successful, the honest man, if he has
 any tincture of philosophy, or even common observation and reflection,
 will discover that they themselves are, in the end, the greatest dupes,
 and have sacrificed the invaluable enjoyment of a character, with
 themselves at least, for the acquisition of worthless toys and gewgaws.
 How little is requisite to supply the necessities of nature? And in a
 view to pleasure, what comparison between the unbought satisfaction of
 conversation, society, study, even health and the common beauties of
 nature, but above all the peaceful reflection on one's own conduct; what
 comparison, I say, between these and the feverish, empty amusements of
 luxury and expense? These natural pleasures, indeed, are really without
 price; both because they are below all price in their attainment, and
 above it in their enjoyment.
 
 
 
 
 APPENDIX I. CONCERNING MORAL SENTIMENT
 
 
 
 IF the foregoing hypothesis be received, it will now be easy for us to
 determine the question first started, [FOOTNOTE: Sect. 1.] concerning
 the general principles of morals; and though we postponed the
 decision of that question, lest it should then involve us in intricate
 speculations, which are unfit for moral discourses, we may resume it at
 present, and examine how far either REASON or SENTIMENT enters into all
 decisions of praise or censure.
 
 One principal foundation of moral praise being supposed to lie in the
 usefulness of any quality or action, it is evident that REASON must
 enter for a considerable share in all decisions of this kind; since
 nothing but that faculty can instruct us in the tendency of qualities
 and actions, and point out their beneficial consequences to society
 and to their possessor. In many cases this is an affair liable to great
 controversy: doubts may arise; opposite interests may occur; and a
 preference must be given to one side, from very nice views, and a small
 overbalance of utility. This is particularly remarkable in questions
 with regard to justice; as is, indeed, natural to suppose, from that
 species of utility which attends this virtue [Footnote: See App. II.].
 Were every single instance of justice, like that of benevolence, useful
 to society; this would be a more simple state of the case, and seldom
 liable to great controversy. But as single instances of justice are
 often pernicious in their first and immediate tendency, and as the
 advantage to society results only from the observance of the general
 rule, and from the concurrence and combination of several persons in
 the same equitable conduct; the case here becomes more intricate and
 involved. The various circumstances of society; the various consequences
 of any practice; the various interests which may be proposed; these,
 on many occasions, are doubtful, and subject to great discussion and
 inquiry. The object of municipal laws is to fix all the questions
 with regard to justice: the debates of civilians; the reflections of
 politicians; the precedents of history and public records, are all
 directed to the same purpose. And a very accurate REASON or JUDGEMENT is
 often requisite, to give the true determination, amidst such intricate
 doubts arising from obscure or opposite utilities.
 
 But though reason, when fully assisted and improved, be sufficient
 to instruct us in the pernicious or useful tendency of qualities and
 actions; it is not alone sufficient to produce any moral blame or
 approbation. Utility is only a tendency to a certain end; and were the
 end totally indifferent to us, we should feel the same indifference
 towards the means. It is requisite a SENTIMENT should here display
 itself, in order to give a preference to the useful above the pernicious
 tendencies. This SENTIMENT can be no other than a feeling for the
 happiness of mankind, and a resentment of their misery; since these are
 the different ends which virtue and vice have a tendency to promote.
 Here therefore REASON instructs us in the several tendencies of actions,
 and HUMANITY makes a distinction in favour of those which are useful and
 beneficial.
 
 This partition between the faculties of understanding and sentiment, in
 all moral decisions, seems clear from the preceding hypothesis. But I
 shall suppose that hypothesis false: it will then be requisite to look
 out for some other theory that may be satisfactory; and I dare venture
 to affirm that none such will ever be found, so long as we suppose
 reason to be the sole source of morals. To prove this, it will be proper
 t o weigh the five following considerations.
 
 I. It is easy for a false hypothesis to maintain some appearance of
 truth, while it keeps wholly in generals, makes use of undefined terms,
 and employs comparisons, instead of instances. This is particularly
 remarkable in that philosophy, which ascribes the discernment of
 all moral distinctions to reason alone, without the concurrence of
 sentiment. It is impossible that, in any particular instance, this
 hypothesis can so much as be rendered intelligible, whatever specious
 figure it may make in general declamations and discourses. Examine the
 crime of INGRATITUDE, for instance; which has place, wherever we observe
 good-will, expressed and known, together with good-offices performed, on
 the one side, and a return of ill-will or indifference, with ill-offices
 or neglect on the other: anatomize all these circumstances, and examine,
 by your reason alone, in what consists the demerit or blame. You never
 will come to any issue or conclusion.
 
 Reason judges either of MATTER OF FACT or of RELATIONS. Enquire then,
 first, where is that matter of fact which we here call crime; point
 it out; determine the time of its existence; describe its essence or
 nature; explain the sense or faculty to which it discovers itself. It
 resides in the mind of the person who is ungrateful. He must, therefore,
 feel it, and be conscious of it. But nothing is there, except the
 passion of ill-will or absolute indifference. You cannot say that these,
 of themselves, always, and in all circumstances, are crimes. No, they
 are only crimes when directed towards persons who have before expressed
 and displayed good-will towards us. Consequently, we may infer, that the
 crime of ingratitude is not any particular individual FACT; but arises
 from a complication of circumstances, which, being presented to the
 spectator, excites the SENTIMENT of blame, by the particular structure
 and fabric of his mind.
 
 This representation, you say, is false. Crime, indeed, consists not in
 a particular FACT, of whose reality we are assured by reason; but it
 consists in certain MORAL RELATIONS, discovered by reason, in the same
 manner as we discover by reason the truths of geometry or algebra.
 But what are the relations, I ask, of which you here talk? In the case
 stated above, I see first good-will and good-offices in one person;
 then ill-will and ill-offices in the other. Between these, there is a
 relation of CONTARIETY. Does the crime consist in that relation? But
 suppose a person bore me ill-will or did me ill-offices; and I, in
 return, were indifferent towards him, or did him good offices. Here is
 the same relation of CONTRARIETY; and yet my conduct is often highly
 laudable. Twist and turn this matter as much as you will, you can never
 rest the morality on relation; but must have recourse to the decisions
 of sentiment.
 
 When it is affirmed that two and three are equal to the half of ten,
 this relation of equality I understand perfectly. I conceive, that if
 ten be divided into two parts, of which one has as many units as the
 other; and if any of these parts be compared to two added to three, it
 will contain as many units as that compound number. But when you draw
 thence a comparison to moral relations, I own that I am altogether at a
 loss to understand you. A moral action, a crime, such as ingratitude, is
 a complicated object. Does the morality consist in the relation of its
 parts to each other? How? After what manner? Specify the relation: be
 more particular and explicit in your propositions, and you will easily
 see their falsehood.
 
 No, say you, the morality consists in the relation of actions to the
 rule of right; and they are denominated good or ill, according as they
 agree or disagree with it. What then is this rule of right? In what does
 it consist? How is it determined? By reason, you say, which examines the
 moral relations of actions. So that moral relations are determined
 by the comparison of action to a rule. And that rule is determined by
 considering the moral relations of objects. Is not this fine reasoning?
 
 All this is metaphysics, you cry. That is enough; there needs nothing
 more to give a strong presumption of falsehood. Yes, reply I, here
 are metaphysics surely; but they are all on your side, who advance an
 abstruse hypothesis, which can never be made intelligible, nor quadrate
 with any particular instance or illustration. The hypothesis which we
 embrace is plain. It maintains that morality is determined by sentiment.
 It defines virtue to be WHATEVER MENTAL ACTION OR QUALITY GIVES TO A
 SPECTATOR THE PLEASING SENTIMENT OF APPROBATION; and vice the contrary.
 We then proceed to examine a plain matter of fact, to wit, what actions
 have this influence. We consider all the circumstances in which these
 actions agree, and thence endeavour to extract some general observations
 with regard to these sentiments. If you call this metaphysics, and find
 anything abstruse here, you need only conclude that your turn of mind is
 not suited to the moral sciences.
 
 II. When a man, at any time, deliberates concerning his own conduct (as,
 whether he had better, in a particular emergence, assist a brother or
 a benefactor), he must consider these separate relations, with all the
 circumstances and situations of the persons, in order to determine the
 superior duty and obligation; and in order to determine the proportion
 of lines in any triangle, it is necessary to examine the nature of that
 figure, and the relation which its several parts bear to each other. But
 notwithstanding this appearing similarity in the two cases, there is,
 at bottom, an extreme difference between them. A speculative reasoner
 concerning triangles or circles considers the several known and given
 relations of the parts of these figures; and thence infers some unknown
 relation, which is dependent on the former. But in moral deliberations
 we must be acquainted beforehand with all the objects, and all their
 relations to each other; and from a comparison of the whole, fix our
 choice or approbation. No new fact to be ascertained; no new relation to
 be discovered. All the circumstances of the case are supposed to be laid
 before us, ere we can fix any sentence of blame or approbation. If any
 material circumstance be yet unknown or doubtful, we must first employ
 our inquiry or intellectual faculties to assure us of it; and must
 suspend for a time all moral decision or sentiment. While we are
 ignorant whether a man were aggressor or not, how can we determine
 whether the person who killed him be criminal or innocent? But after
 every circumstance, every relation is known, the understanding has no
 further room to operate, nor any object on which it could employ itself.
 The approbation or blame which then ensues, cannot be the work of the
 judgement, but of the heart; and is not a speculative proposition or
 affirmation, but an active feeling or sentiment. In the disquisitions of
 the understanding, from known circumstances and relations, we infer some
 new and unknown. In moral decisions, all the circumstances and relations
 must be previously known; and the mind, from the contemplation of the
 whole, feels some new impression of affection or disgust, esteem or
 contempt, approbation or blame.
 
 Hence the great difference between a mistake of FACT and one of RIGHT;
 and hence the reason why the one is commonly criminal and not the other.
 When Oedipus killed Laius, he was ignorant of the relation, and from
 circumstances, innocent and involuntary, formed erroneous opinions
 concerning the action which he committed. But when Nero killed
 Agrippina, all the relations between himself and the person, and all the
 circumstances of the fact, were previously known to him; but the motive
 of revenge, or fear, or interest, prevailed in his savage heart over the
 sentiments of duty and humanity. And when we express that detestation
 against him to which he himself, in a little time, became insensible,
 it is not that we see any relations, of which he was ignorant; but that,
 for the rectitude of our disposition, we feel sentiments against which
 he was hardened from flattery and a long perseverance in the most
 enormous crimes.
 
 In these sentiments then, not in a discovery of relations of any kind,
 do all moral determinations consist. Before we can pretend to form any
 decision of this kind, everything must be known and ascertained on the
 side of the object or action. Nothing remains but to feel, on our part,
 some sentiment of blame or approbation; whence we pronounce the action
 criminal or virtuous.
 
 III. This doctrine will become still more evident, if we compare moral
 beauty with natural, to which in many particulars it bears so near a
 resemblance. It is on the proportion, relation, and position of parts,
 that all natural beauty depends; but it would be absurd thence to
 infer, that the perception of beauty, like that of truth in geometrical
 problems, consists wholly in the perception of relations, and was
 performed entirely by the understanding or intellectual faculties. In
 all the sciences, our mind from the known relations investigates the
 unknown. But in all decisions of taste or external beauty, all the
 relations are beforehand obvious to the eye; and we thence proceed to
 feel a sentiment of complacency or disgust, according to the nature of
 the object, and disposition of our organs.
 
 Euclid has fully explained all the qualities of the circle; but has not
 in any proposition said a word of its beauty. The reason is evident. The
 beauty is not a quality of the circle. It lies not in any part of the
 line, whose parts are equally distant from a common centre. It is only
 the effect which that figure produces upon the mind, whose peculiar
 fabric of structure renders it susceptible of such sentiments. In vain
 would you look for it in the circle, or seek it, either by your senses
 or by mathematical reasoning, in all the properties of that figure.
 
 Attend to Palladio and Perrault, while they explain all the parts and
 proportions of a pillar. They talk of the cornice, and frieze, and base,
 and entablature, and shaft, and architrave; and give the description and
 position of each of these members. But should you ask the description
 and position of its beauty, they would readily reply, that the beauty
 is not in any of the parts or members of a pillar, but results from the
 whole, when that complicated figure is presented to an intelligent mind,
 susceptible to those finer sensations. Till such a spectator appear,
 there is nothing but a figure of such particular dimensions and
 proportions: from his sentiments alone arise its elegance and beauty.
 
 Again; attend to Cicero, while he paints the crimes of a Verres or a
 Catiline. You must acknowledge that the moral turpitude results, in the
 same manner, from the contemplation of the whole, when presented to a
 being whose organs have such a particular structure and formation. The
 orator may paint rage, insolence, barbarity on the one side; meekness,
 suffering, sorrow, innocence on the other. But if you feel no
 indignation or compassion arise in you from this complication of
 circumstances, you would in vain ask him, in what consists the crime or
 villainy, which he so vehemently exclaims against? At what time, or
 on what subject it first began to exist? And what has a few months
 afterwards become of it, when every disposition and thought of all the
 actors is totally altered or annihilated? No satisfactory answer can be
 given to any of these questions, upon the abstract hypothesis of morals;
 and we must at last acknowledge, that the crime or immorality is
 no particular fact or relation, which can be the object of the
 understanding, but arises entirely from the sentiment of disapprobation,
 which, by the structure of human nature, we unavoidably feel on the
 apprehension of barbarity or treachery.
 
 IV. Inanimate objects may bear to each other all the same relations
 which we observe in moral agents; though the former can never be the
 object of love or hatred, nor are consequently susceptible of merit or
 iniquity. A young tree, which over-tops and destroys its parent, stands
 in all the same relations with Nero, when he murdered Agrippina; and
 if morality consisted merely in relations, would no doubt be equally
 criminal.
 
 V. It appears evident that--the ultimate ends of human actions can
 never, in any case, be accounted for by reason, but recommend themselves
 entirely to the sentiments and affections of mankind, without any
 dependance on the intellectual faculties. Ask a man WHY HE USES
 EXERCISE; he will answer, BECAUSE HE DESIRES TO KEEP HIS HEALTH. If
 you then enquire, WHY HE DESIRES HEALTH, he will readily reply, BECAUSE
 SICKNESS IS PAINFUL. If you push your enquiries farther, and desire a
 reason WHY HE HATES PAIN, it is impossible he can ever give any. This is
 an ultimate end, and is never referred to any other object.
 
 Perhaps to your second question, WHY HE DESIRES HEALTH, he may also
 reply, that IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE EXERCISE OF HIS CALLING. If you ask,
 WHY HE IS ANXIOUS ON THAT HEAD, he will answer, BECAUSE HE DESIRES TO
 GET MONEY. If you demand WHY? IT IS THE INSTRUMENT OF PLEASURE, says he.
 And beyond this it is an absurdity to ask for a reason. It is impossible
 there can be a progress IN INFINITUM; and that one thing can always be a
 reason why another is desired. Something must be desirable on its own
 account, and because of its immediate accord or agreement with human
 sentiment and affection.
 
 Now as virtue is an end, and is desirable on its own account, without
 fee and reward, merely for the immediate satisfaction which it conveys;
 it is requisite that there should be some sentiment which it touches,
 some internal taste or feeling, or whatever you may please to call it,
 which distinguishes moral good and evil, and which embraces the one and
 rejects the other.
 
 Thus the distinct boundaries and offices of REASON and of TASTE are
 easily ascertained. The former conveys the knowledge of truth and
 falsehood: the latter gives the sentiment of beauty and deformity, vice
 and virtue. The one discovers objects as they really stand in nature,
 without addition and diminution: the other has a productive faculty, and
 gilding or staining all natural objects with the colours, borrowed from
 internal sentiment, raises in a manner a new creation. Reason being cool
 and disengaged, is no motive to action, and directs only the impulse
 received from appetite or inclination, by showing us the means of
 attaining happiness or avoiding misery: Taste, as it gives pleasure or
 pain, and thereby constitutes happiness or misery, becomes a motive to
 action, and is the first spring or impulse to desire and volition. From
 circumstances and relations, known or supposed, the former leads us to
 the discovery of the concealed and unknown: after all circumstances and
 relations are laid before us, the latter makes us feel from the whole
 a new sentiment of blame or approbation. The standard of the one, being
 founded on the nature of things, is eternal and inflexible, even by the
 will of the Supreme Being: the standard of the other arising from the
 eternal frame and constitution of animals, is ultimately derived from
 that Supreme Will, which bestowed on each being its peculiar nature, and
 arranged the several classes and orders of existence.
 
 
 
 
 APPENDIX II. OF SELF-LOVE.
 
 
 
 THERE is a principle, supposed to prevail among many, which is utterly
 incompatible with all virtue or moral sentiment; and as it can proceed
 from nothing but the most depraved disposition, so in its turn it tends
 still further to encourage that depravity. This principle is, that
 all BENEVOLENCE is mere hypocrisy, friendship a cheat, public spirit a
 farce, fidelity a snare to procure trust and confidence; and that while
 all of us, at bottom, pursue only our private interest, we wear these
 fair disguises, in order to put others off their guard, and expose them
 the more to our wiles and machinations. What heart one must be possessed
 of who possesses such principles, and who feels no internal sentiment
 that belies so pernicious a theory, it is easy to imagine: and also what
 degree of affection and benevolence he can bear to a species whom he
 represents under such odious colours, and supposes so little susceptible
 of gratitude or any return of affection. Or if we should not ascribe
 these principles wholly to a corrupted heart, we must at least account
 for them from the most careless and precipitate examination. Superficial
 reasoners, indeed, observing many false pretences among mankind, and
 feeling, perhaps, no very strong restraint in their own disposition,
 might draw a general and a hasty conclusion that all is equally
 corrupted, and that men, different from all other animals, and indeed
 from all other species of existence, admit of no degrees of good or bad,
 but are, in every instance, the same creatures under different disguises
 and appearances.
 
 There is another principle, somewhat resembling the former; which has
 been much insisted on by philosophers, and has been the foundation of
 many a system; that, whatever affection one may feel, or imagine he
 feels for others, no passion is, or can be disinterested; that the most
 generous friendship, however sincere, is a modification of self-love;
 and that, even unknown to ourselves, we seek only our own gratification,
 while we appear the most deeply engaged in schemes for the liberty
 and happiness of mankind. By a turn of imagination, by a refinement of
 reflection, by an enthusiasm of passion, we seem to take part in the
 interests of others, and imagine ourselves divested of all selfish
 considerations: but, at bottom, the most generous patriot and most
 niggardly miser, the bravest hero and most abject coward, have, in every
 action, an equal regard to their own happiness and welfare.
 
 Whoever concludes from the seeming tendency of this opinion, that those,
 who make profession of it, cannot possibly feel the true sentiments
 of benevolence, or have any regard for genuine virtue, will often find
 himself, in practice, very much mistaken. Probity and honour were no
 strangers to Epicurus and his sect. Atticus and Horace seem to have
 enjoyed from nature, and cultivated by reflection, as generous and
 friendly dispositions as any disciple of the austerer schools. And
 among the modern, Hobbes and Locke, who maintained the selfish system of
 morals, lived irreproachable lives; though the former lay not under any
 restraint of religion which might supply the defects of his philosophy.
 
 An epicurean or a Hobbist readily allows, that there is such a thing as
 a friendship in the world, without hypocrisy or disguise; though he may
 attempt, by a philosophical chymistry, to resolve the elements of this
 passion, if I may so speak, into those of another, and explain every
 affection to be self-love, twisted and moulded, by a particular turn
 of imagination, into a variety of appearances. But as the same turn of
 imagination prevails not in every man, nor gives the same direction to
 the original passion; this is sufficient even according to the selfish
 system to make the widest difference in human characters, and denominate
 one man virtuous and humane, another vicious and meanly interested. I
 esteem the man whose self-love, by whatever means, is so directed as to
 give him a concern for others, and render him serviceable to society:
 as I hate or despise him, who has no regard to any thing beyond his
 own gratifications and enjoyments. In vain would you suggest that these
 characters, though seemingly opposite, are at bottom the same, and that
 a very inconsiderable turn of thought forms the whole difference between
 them. Each character, notwithstanding these inconsiderable differences,
 appears to me, in practice, pretty durable and untransmutable. And
 I find not in this more than in other subjects, that the natural
 sentiments arising from the general appearances of things are easily
 destroyed by subtile reflections concerning the minute origin of these
 appearances. Does not the lively, cheerful colour of a countenance
 inspire me with complacency and pleasure; even though I learn from
 philosophy that all difference of complexion arises from the most minute
 differences of thickness, in the most minute parts of the skin; by
 means of which a superficies is qualified to reflect one of the original
 colours of light, and absorb the others?
 
 But though the question concerning the universal or partial selfishness
 of man be not so material as is usually imagined to morality and
 practice, it is certainly of consequence in the speculative science of
 human nature, and is a proper object of curiosity and enquiry. It
 may not, therefore, be unsuitable, in this place, to bestow a few
 reflections upon it.
 
 
      [Footnote: Benevolence naturally divides into two kinds, the
 GENERAL and the PARTICULAR. The first is, where we have no friendship
 or connexion or esteem for the person, but feel only a general sympathy
 with him or a compassion for his pains, and a congratulation with his
 pleasures. The other species of benevolence is founded on an opinion
 of virtue, on services done us, or on some particular connexions. Both
 these sentiments must be allowed real in human nature: but whether they
 will resolve into some nice considerations of self-love, is a question
 more curious than important. The former sentiment, to wit, that of
 general benevolence, or humanity, or sympathy, we shall have occasion
 frequently to treat of in the course of this inquiry; and I assume it as
 real, from general experience, without any other proof.]
 
 The most obvious objection to the selfish hypothesis is, that, as it is
 contrary to common feeling and our most unprejudiced notions, there is
 required the highest stretch of philosophy to establish so extraordinary
 a paradox. To the most careless observer there appear to be such
 dispositions as benevolence and generosity; such affections as love,
 friendship, compassion, gratitude. These sentiments have their causes,
 effects, objects, and operations, marked by common language and
 observation, and plainly distinguished from those of the selfish
 passions. And as this is the obvious appearance of things, it must
 be admitted, till some hypothesis be discovered, which by penetrating
 deeper into human nature, may prove the former affections to be nothing
 but modifications of the latter. All attempts of this kind have hitherto
 proved fruitless, and seem to have proceeded entirely from that love
 of SIMPLICITY which has been the source of much false reasoning in
 philosophy. I shall not here enter into any detail on the present
 subject. Many able philosophers have shown the insufficiency of these
 systems. And I shall take for granted what, I believe, the smallest
 reflection will make evident to every impartial enquirer.
 
 But the nature of the subject furnishes the strongest presumption, that
 no better system will ever, for the future, be invented, in order to
 account for the origin of the benevolent from the selfish affections,
 and reduce all the various emotions of the human mind to a perfect
 simplicity. The case is not the same in this species of philosophy as
 in physics. Many an hypothesis in nature, contrary to first appearances,
 has been found, on more accurate scrutiny, solid and satisfactory.
 Instances of this kind are so frequent that a judicious, as well as
 witty philosopher, [Footnote: Mons. Fontenelle.] has ventured to affirm,
 if there be more than one way in which any phenomenon may be produced,
 that there is general presumption for its arising from the causes which
 are the least obvious and familiar. But the presumption always lies on
 the other side, in all enquiries concerning the origin of our passions,
 and of the internal operations of the human mind. The simplest and
 most obvious cause which can there be assigned for any phenomenon, is
 probably the true one. When a philosopher, in the explication of his
 system, is obliged to have recourse to some very intricate and refined
 reflections, and to suppose them essential to the production of any
 passion or emotion, we have reason to be extremely on our guard against
 so fallacious an hypothesis. The affections are not susceptible of any
 impression from the refinements of reason or imagination; and it
 is always found that a vigorous exertion of the latter faculties,
 necessarily, from the narrow capacity of the human mind, destroys all
 activity in the former. Our predominant motive or intention is, indeed,
 frequently concealed from ourselves when it is mingled and confounded
 with other motives which the mind, from vanity or self-conceit, is
 desirous of supposing more prevalent: but there is no instance that a
 concealment of this nature has ever arisen from the abstruseness and
 intricacy of the motive. A man that has lost a friend and patron may
 flatter himself that all his grief arises from generous sentiments,
 without any mixture of narrow or interested considerations: but a
 man that grieves for a valuable friend, who needed his patronage and
 protection; how can we suppose, that his passionate tenderness arises
 from some metaphysical regards to a self-interest, which has no
 foundation or reality? We may as well imagine that minute wheels and
 springs, like those of a watch, give motion to a loaded waggon, as
 account for the origin of passion from such abstruse reflections.
 
 Animals are found susceptible of kindness, both to their own species and
 to ours; nor is there, in this case, the least suspicion of disguise or
 artifice. Shall we account for all THEIR sentiments, too, from refined
 deductions of self-interest? Or if we admit a disinterested benevolence
 in the inferior species, by what rule of analogy can we refuse it in the
 superior?
 
 Love between the sexes begets a complacency and good-will, very distinct
 from the gratification of an appetite. Tenderness to their offspring,
 in all sensible beings, is commonly able alone to counter-balance the
 strongest motives of self-love, and has no manner of dependance on that
 affection. What interest can a fond mother have in view, who loses
 her health by assiduous attendance on her sick child, and afterwards
 languishes and dies of grief, when freed, by its death, from the slavery
 of that attendance?
 
 Is gratitude no affection of the human breast, or is that a word merely,
 without any meaning or reality? Have we no satisfaction in one man's
 company above another's, and no desire of the welfare of our friend,
 even though absence or death should prevent us from all participation in
 it? Or what is it commonly, that gives us any participation in it, even
 while alive and present, but our affection and regard to him?
 
 These and a thousand other instances are marks of a general benevolence
 in human nature, where no REAL interest binds us to the object. And how
 an IMAGINARY interest known and avowed for such, can be the origin of
 any passion or emotion, seems difficult to explain. No satisfactory
 hypothesis of this kind has yet been discovered; nor is there the
 smallest probability that the future industry of men will ever be
 attended with more favourable success.
 
 But farther, if we consider rightly of the matter, we shall find that
 the hypothesis which allows of a disinterested benevolence, distinct
 from self-love, has really more SIMPLICITY in it, and is more
 conformable to the analogy of nature than that which pretends to resolve
 all friendship and humanity into this latter principle. There are bodily
 wants or appetites acknowledged by every one, which necessarily precede
 all sensual enjoyment, and carry us directly to seek possession of the
 object. Thus, hunger and thirst have eating and drinking for their end;
 and from the gratification of these primary appetites arises a pleasure,
 which may become the object of another species of desire or inclination
 that is secondary and interested. In the same manner there are mental
 passions by which we are impelled immediately to seek particular
 objects, such as fame or power, or vengeance without any regard to
 interest; and when these objects are attained a pleasing enjoyment
 ensues, as the consequence of our indulged affections. Nature must,
 by the internal frame and constitution of the mind, give an original
 propensity to fame, ere we can reap any pleasure from that acquisition,
 or pursue it from motives of self-love, and desire of happiness. If I
 have no vanity, I take no delight in praise: if I be void of ambition,
 power gives me no enjoyment: if I be not angry, the punishment of an
 adversary is totally indifferent to me. In all these cases there is a
 passion which points immediately to the object, and constitutes it
 our good or happiness; as there are other secondary passions which
 afterwards arise, and pursue it as a part of our happiness, when once it
 is constituted such by our original affections. Were there no appetite
 of any kind antecedent to self-love, that propensity could scarcely ever
 exert itself; because we should, in that case, have felt few and slender
 pains or pleasures, and have little misery or happiness to avoid or to
 pursue.
 
 Now where is the difficulty in conceiving, that this may likewise be the
 case with benevolence and friendship, and that, from the original frame
 of our temper, we may feel a desire of another's happiness or good,
 which, by means of that affection, becomes our own good, and is
 afterwards pursued, from the combined motives of benevolence and
 self-enjoyments? Who sees not that vengeance, from the force alone of
 passion, may be so eagerly pursued, as to make us knowingly neglect
 every consideration of ease, interest, or safety; and, like some
 vindictive animals, infuse our very souls into the wounds we give an
 enemy; [Footnote: Animasque in vulnere ponunt. VIRG, Dum alteri noceat,
 sui negligens says Seneca of Anger. De Ira, I. i.] and what a malignant
 philosophy must it be, that will not allow to humanity and friendship
 the same privileges which are undisputably granted to the darker
 passions of enmity and resentment; such a philosophy is more like a
 satyr than a true delineation or description of human nature; and may
 be a good foundation for paradoxical wit and raillery, but is a very bad
 one for any serious argument or reasoning.
 
 
 
 
 APPENDIX III. SOME FARTHER CONSIDERATIONS WITH REGARD TO JUSTICE.
 
 
 
 The intention of this Appendix is to give some more particular
 explication of the origin and nature of Justice, and to mark some
 differences between it and the other virtues.
 
 The social virtues of humanity and benevolence exert their influence
 immediately by a direct tendency or instinct, which chiefly keeps in
 view the simple object, moving the affections, and comprehends not any
 scheme or system, nor the consequences resulting from the concurrence,
 imitation, or example of others. A parent flies to the relief of his
 child; transported by that natural sympathy which actuates him, and
 which affords no leisure to reflect on the sentiments or conduct of
 the rest of mankind in like circumstances. A generous man cheerfully
 embraces an opportunity of serving his friend; because he then feels
 himself under the dominion of the beneficent affections, nor is he
 concerned whether any other person in the universe were ever before
 actuated by such noble motives, or will ever afterwards prove their
 influence. In all these cases the social passions have in view a single
 individual object, and pursue the safety or happiness alone of the
 person loved and esteemed. With this they are satisfied: in this they
 acquiesce. And as the good, resulting from their benign influence, is
 in itself complete and entire, it also excites the moral sentiment of
 approbation, without any reflection on farther consequences, and without
 any more enlarged views of the concurrence or imitation of the other
 members of society. On the contrary, were the generous friend or
 disinterested patriot to stand alone in the practice of beneficence,
 this would rather enhance his value in our eyes, and join the praise of
 rarity and novelty to his other more exalted merits.
 
 The case is not the same with the social virtues of justice and
 fidelity. They are highly useful, or indeed absolutely necessary to the
 well-being of mankind: but the benefit resulting from them is not the
 consequence of every individual single act; but arises from the whole
 scheme or system concurred in by the whole, or the greater part of the
 society. General peace and order are the attendants of justice or a
 general abstinence from the possessions of others; but a particular
 regard to the particular right of one individual citizen may frequently,
 considered in itself, be productive of pernicious consequences. The
 result of the individual acts is here, in many instances, directly
 opposite to that of the whole system of actions; and the former may
 be extremely hurtful, while the latter is, to the highest degree,
 advantageous. Riches, inherited from a parent, are, in a bad man's
 hand, the instrument of mischief. The right of succession may, in one
 instance, be hurtful. Its benefit arises only from the observance of the
 general rule; and it is sufficient, if compensation be thereby made for
 all the ills and inconveniences which flow from particular characters
 and situations.
 
 Cyrus, young and unexperienced, considered only the individual case
 before him, and reflected on a limited fitness and convenience, when he
 assigned the long coat to the tall boy, and the short coat to the other
 of smaller size. His governor instructed him better, while he pointed
 out more enlarged views and consequences, and informed his pupil of the
 general, inflexible rules, necessary to support general peace and order
 in society.
 
 The happiness and prosperity of mankind, arising from the social virtue
 of benevolence and its subdivisions, may be compared to a wall, built by
 many hands, which still rises by each stone that is heaped upon it,
 and receives increase proportional to the diligence and care of each
 workman. The same happiness, raised by the social virtue of justice and
 its subdivisions, may be compared to the building of a vault, where each
 individual stone would, of itself, fall to the ground; nor is the whole
 fabric supported but by the mutual assistance and combination of its
 corresponding parts.
 
 All the laws of nature, which regulate property, as well as all civil
 laws, are general, and regard alone some essential circumstances of the
 case, without taking into consideration the characters, situations, and
 connexions of the person concerned, or any particular consequences which
 may result from the determination of these laws in any particular case
 which offers. They deprive, without scruple, a beneficent man of all his
 possessions, if acquired by mistake, without a good title; in order to
 bestow them on a selfish miser, who has already heaped up immense stores
 of superfluous riches. Public utility requires that property should be
 regulated by general inflexible rules; and though such rules are adopted
 as best serve the same end of public utility, it is impossible for them
 to prevent all particular hardships, or make beneficial consequences
 result from every individual case. It is sufficient, if the whole plan
 or scheme be necessary to the support of civil society, and if the
 balance of good, in the main, do thereby preponderate much above that of
 evil. Even the general laws of the universe, though planned by infinite
 wisdom, cannot exclude all evil or inconvenience in every particular
 operation.
 
 It has been asserted by some, that justice arises from Human
 Conventions, and proceeds from the voluntary choice, consent, or
 combination of mankind. If by CONVENTION be here meant a PROMISE (which
 is the most usual sense of the word) nothing can be more absurd than
 this position. The observance of promises is itself one of the most
 considerable parts of justice, and we are not surely bound to keep our
 word because we have given our word to keep it. But if by convention be
 meant a sense of common interest, which sense each man feels in his
 own breast, which he remarks in his fellows, and which carries him, in
 concurrence with others, into a general plan or system of actions, which
 tends to public utility; it must be owned, that, in this sense, justice
 arises from human conventions. For if it be allowed (what is, indeed,
 evident) that the particular consequences of a particular act of justice
 may be hurtful to the public as well as to individuals; it follows that
 every man, in embracing that virtue, must have an eye to the whole plan
 or system, and must expect the concurrence of his fellows in the same
 conduct and behaviour. Did all his views terminate in the consequences
 of each act of his own, his benevolence and humanity, as well as
 his self-love, might often prescribe to him measures of conduct very
 different from those which are agreeable to the strict rules of right
 and justice.
 
 Thus, two men pull the oars of a boat by common convention for common
 interest, without any promise or contract; thus gold and silver are made
 the measures of exchange; thus speech and words and language are fixed
 by human convention and agreement. Whatever is advantageous to two or
 more persons, if all perform their part; but what loses all advantage
 if only one perform, can arise from no other principle There would
 otherwise be no motive for any one of them to enter into that scheme of
 conduct.
 
 
      [Footnote: This theory concerning the origin of property, and
 consequently of justice, is, in the main, the same with that hinted at
 and adopted by Grotius, 'Hinc discimus, quae fuerit causa, ob quam a
 primaeva communione rerum primo mobilium, deinde et immobilinm discessum
 est: nimirum quod cum non contenti homines vesci sponte natis, antra
 habitare, corpore aut nudo agere, aut corticibus arborum ferarumve
 pellibus vestito, vitae genus exquisitius delegissent, industria opus
 fuit, quam singuli rebus singulls adhiberent. Quo minus autem fructus
 in commune conferrentur, primum obstitit locorum, in quae homines
 discesserunt, distantia, deinde justitiae et amoris defectus, per quem
 fiebat, ut nee in labore, nee in consumtione fructuum, quae debebat,
 aequalitas servaretur. Simul discimus, quomodo res in proprietatem
 iverint; non animi actu solo, neque enim scire alii poterant, quid alil
 suum esse vellent, ut eo abstinerent, et idem velle plures poterant;
 sed pacto quodam aut expresso, ut per divisionem, aut tacito, ut per
 occupationem.' De jure belli et pacis. Lib. ii. cap. 2. sec. 2. art. 4
 and 5.]
 
 The word NATURAL is commonly taken in so many senses and is of so
 loose a signification, that it seems vain to dispute whether justice
 be natural or not. If self-love, if benevolence be natural to man; if
 reason and forethought be also natural; then may the same epithet
 be applied to justice, order, fidelity, property, society. Men's
 inclination, their necessities, lead them to combine; their
 understanding and experience tell them that this combination is
 impossible where each governs himself by no rule, and pays no regard
 to the possessions of others: and from these passions and reflections
 conjoined, as soon as we observe like passions and reflections in
 others, the sentiment of justice, throughout all ages, has infallibly
 and certainly had place to some degree or other in every individual of
 the human species. In so sagacious an animal, what necessarily arises
 from the exertion of his intellectual faculties may justly be esteemed
 natural.
 
 
      [Footnote: Natural may be opposed, either to what is UNUSUAL,
 MIRACULOUS or ARTIFICIAL. In the two former senses, justice and property
 are undoubtedly natural. But as they suppose reason, forethought,
 design, and a social union and confederacy among men, perhaps that
 epithet cannot strictly, in the last sense, be applied to them. Had
 men lived without society, property had never been known, and neither
 justice nor injustice had ever existed. But society among human
 creatures had been impossible without reason and forethought. Inferior
 animals, that unite, are guided by instinct, which supplies the place
 for reason. But all these disputes are merely verbal.]
 
 Among all civilized nations it has been the constant endeavour to remove
 everything arbitrary and partial from the decision of property, and to
 fix the sentence of judges by such general views and considerations as
 may be equal to every member of society. For besides, that nothing
 could be more dangerous than to accustom the bench, even in the smallest
 instance, to regard private friendship or enmity; it is certain,
 that men, where they imagine that there was no other reason for the
 preference of their adversary but personal favour, are apt to entertain
 the strongest ill-will against the magistrates and judges. When natural
 reason, therefore, points out no fixed view of public utility by which
 a controversy of property can be decided, positive laws are often
 framed to supply its place, and direct the procedure of all courts
 of judicature. Where these too fail, as often happens, precedents are
 called for; and a former decision, though given itself without any
 sufficient reason, justly becomes a sufficient reason for a new
 decision. If direct laws and precedents be wanting, imperfect and
 indirect ones are brought in aid; and the controverted case is ranged
 under them by analogical reasonings and comparisons, and similitudes,
 and correspondencies, which are often more fanciful than real. In
 general, it may safely be affirmed that jurisprudence is, in this
 respect, different from all the sciences; and that in many of its nicer
 questions, there cannot properly be said to be truth or falsehood on
 either side. If one pleader bring the case under any former law or
 precedent, by a refined analogy or comparison; the opposite pleader
 is not at a loss to find an opposite analogy or comparison: and the
 preference given by the judge is often founded more on taste and
 imagination than on any solid argument. Public utility is the general
 object of all courts of judicature; and this utility too requires a
 stable rule in all controversies: but where several rules, nearly equal
 and indifferent, present themselves, it is a very slight turn of thought
 which fixes the decision in favour of either party.
 
 
 
      [Footnote: That there be a separation or distinction of
      possessions, and that this separation be steady and
      constant; this is absolutely required by the interests of
      society, and hence the origin of justice and property. What
      possessions are assigned to particular persons; this is,
      generally speaking, pretty indifferent; and is often
      determined by very frivolous views and considerations. We
      shall mention a few particulars.
 
      Were a society formed among several independent members, the
      most obvious rule, which could be agreed on, would be to
      annex property to PRESENT possession, and leave every one a
      right to what he at present enjoys. The relation of
      possession, which takes place between the person and the
      object, naturally draws on the relation of property.
 
      For a like reason, occupation or first possession becomes
      the foundation of property.
 
      Where a man bestows labour and industry upon any object,
      which before belonged to no body; as in cutting down and
      shaping a tree, in cultivating a field, &c., the
      alterations, which he produces, causes a relation between
      him and the object, and naturally engages us to annex it to
      him by the new relation of property. This cause here concurs
      with the public utility, which consists in the encouragement
      given to industry and labour.
 
      Perhaps too, private humanity towards the possessor concurs,
      in this instance, with the other motives, and engages us to
      leave with him what he has acquired by his sweat and labour;
      and what he has flattered himself in the constant enjoyment
      of. For though private humanity can, by no means, be the
      origin of justice; since the latter virtue so often
      contradicts the former; yet when the rule of separate and
      constant possession is once formed by the indispensable
      necessities of society, private humanity, and an aversion to
      the doing a hardship to another, may, in a particular
      instance, give rise to a particular rule of property.
 
      I am much inclined to think, that the right succession or
      inheritance much depends on those connexions of the
      imagination, and that the relation to a former proprietor
      begetting a relation to the object, is the cause why the
      property is transferred to a man after the death of his
      kinsman. It is true; industry is more encouraged by the
      transference of possession to children or near relations:
      but this consideration will only have place in a cultivated
      society; whereas the right of succession is regarded even
      among the greatest Barbarians.
 
      Acquisition of property by accession can be explained no way
      but by having recourse to the relations and connexions of
      the imaginations.
 
      The property of rivers, by the laws of most nations, and by
      the natural turn of our thoughts, is attributed to the
      proprietors of their banks, excepting such vast rivers as
      the Rhine or the Danube, which seem too large to follow as
      an accession to the property of the neighbouring fields. Yet
      even these rivers are considered as the property of that
      nation, through whose dominions they run; the idea of a
      nation being of a suitable bulk to correspond with them, and
      bear them such a relation in the fancy.
 
      The accessions, which are made to land, bordering upon
      rivers, follow the land, say the civilians, provided it be
      made by what they call alluvion, that is, insensibly and
      imperceptibly; which are circumstances, that assist the
      imagination in the conjunction.
 
      Where there is any considerable portion torn at once from
      one bank and added to another, it becomes not his property,
      whose land it falls on, till it unite with the land, and
      till the trees and plants have spread their roots into both.
      Before that, the thought does not sufficiently join them.
 
      In short, we must ever distinguish between the necessity of
      a separation and constancy in men's possession, and the
      rules, which assign particular objects to particular
      persons. The first necessity is obvious, strong, and
      invincible: the latter may depend on a public utility more
      light and frivolous, on the sentiment of private humanity
      and aversion to private hardship, on positive laws, on
      precedents, analogies, and very fine connexions and turns of
      the imagination.]
 
 
 We may just observe, before we conclude this subject, that after the
 laws of justice are fixed by views of general utility, the injury, the
 hardship, the harm, which result to any individual from a violation of
 them, enter very much into consideration, and are a great source of that
 universal blame which attends every wrong or iniquity. By the laws of
 society, this coat, this horse is mine, and OUGHT to remain perpetually
 in my possession: I reckon on the secure enjoyment of it: by depriving
 me of it, you disappoint my expectations, and doubly displease me, and
 offend every bystander. It is a public wrong, so far as the rules of
 equity are violated: it is a private harm, so far as an individual is
 injured. And though the second consideration could have no place, were
 not the former previously established: for otherwise the distinction of
 MINE and THINE would be unknown in society: yet there is no question
 but the regard to general good is much enforced by the respect to
 particular. What injures the community, without hurting any individual,
 is often more lightly thought of. But where the greatest public wrong
 is also conjoined with a considerable private one, no wonder the highest
 disapprobation attends so iniquitous a behaviour.
 
 
 
 
 APPENDIX IV. OF SOME VERBAL DISPUTES.
 
 
 
 Nothing is more usual than for philosophers to encroach upon the
 province of grammarians; and to engage in disputes of words, while they
 imagine that they are handling controversies of the deepest importance
 and concern. It was in order to avoid altercations, so frivolous and
 endless, that I endeavoured to state with the utmost caution the object
 of our present enquiry; and proposed simply to collect, on the one hand,
 a list of those mental qualities which are the object of love or esteem,
 and form a part of personal merit; and on the other hand, a catalogue of
 those qualities which are the object of censure or reproach, and which
 detract from the character of the person possessed of them; subjoining
 some reflections concerning the origin of these sentiments of praise or
 blame. On all occasions, where there might arise the least hesitation,
 I avoided the terms VIRTUE and VICE; because some of those qualities,
 which I classed among the objects of praise, receive, in the English
 language, the appellation of TALENTS, rather than of virtues; as some of
 the blameable or censurable qualities are often called defects, rather
 than vices. It may now, perhaps, be expected that before we conclude
 this moral enquiry, we should exactly separate the one from the other;
 should mark the precise boundaries of virtues and talents, vices and
 defects; and should explain the reason and origin of that distinction.
 But in order to excuse myself from this undertaking, which would,
 at last, prove only a grammatical enquiry, I shall subjoin the four
 following reflections, which shall contain all that I intend to say on
 the present subject.
 
 First, I do not find that in the English, or any other modern tongue,
 the boundaries are exactly fixed between virtues and talents, vices
 and defects, or that a precise definition can be given of the one as
 contradistinguished from the other. Were we to say, for instance, that
 the esteemable qualities alone, which are voluntary, are entitled to
 the appellations of virtues; we should soon recollect the qualities of
 courage, equanimity, patience, self-command; with many others, which
 almost every language classes under this appellation, though they depend
 little or not at all on our choice. Should we affirm that the qualities
 alone, which prompt us to act our part in society, are entitled to that
 honourable distinction; it must immediately occur that these are indeed
 the most valuable qualities, and are commonly denominated the SOCIAL
 virtues; but that this very epithet supposes that there are also virtues
 of another species. Should we lay hold of the distinction between
 INTELLECTUAL and MORAL endowments, and affirm the last alone to be the
 real and genuine virtues, because they alone lead to action; we should
 find that many of those qualities, usually called intellectual virtues,
 such as prudence, penetration, discernment, discretion, had also a
 considerable influence on conduct. The distinction between the heart and
 the head may also be adopted: the qualities of the first may be defined
 such as in their immediate exertion are accompanied with a feeling
 of sentiment; and these alone may be called the genuine virtues: but
 industry, frugality, temperance, secrecy, perseverance, and many other
 laudable powers or habits, generally stilled virtues are exerted without
 any immediate sentiment in the person possessed of them, and are only
 known to him by their effects. It is fortunate, amidst all this seeming
 perplexity, that the question, being merely verbal, cannot possibly be
 of any importance. A moral, philosophical discourse needs not enter
 into all these caprices of language, which are so variable in different
 dialects, and in different ages of the same dialect. But on the whole,
 it seems to me, that though it is always allowed, that there are virtues
 of many different kinds, yet, when a man is called virtuous, or is
 denominated a man of virtue, we chiefly regard his social qualities,
 which are, indeed, the most valuable. It is, at the same time, certain,
 that any remarkable defect in courage, temperance, economy, industry,
 understanding, dignity of mind, would bereave even a very good-natured,
 honest man of this honourable appellation. Who did ever say, except
 by way of irony, that such a one was a man of great virtue, but an
 egregious blockhead?
 
 But, Secondly, it is no wonder that languages should not be very
 precise in marking the boundaries between virtues and talents, vices
 and defects; since there is so little distinction made in our internal
 estimation of them. It seems indeed certain, that the SENTIMENT of
 conscious worth, the self-satisfaction proceeding from a review of a
 man's own conduct and character; it seems certain, I say, that this
 sentiment, which, though the most common of all others, has no proper
 name in our language,
 
 
      [Footnote: The term, pride, is commonly taken in a bad sense; but
 this sentiment seems indifferent, and may be either good or bad,
 according as it is well or ill founded, and according to the other
 circumstances which accompany it. The French express this sentiment by
 the term, AMOUR PROPRE, but as they also express self-love as well
 as vanity by the same term, there arises thence a great confusion in
 Rochefoucault, and many of their moral writers.]
 
 arises from the endowments of courage and capacity, industry and
 ingenuity, as well as from any other mental excellencies. Who, on the
 other hand, is not deeply mortified with reflecting on his own folly and
 dissoluteness, and feels not a secret sting or compunction whenever his
 memory presents any past occurrence, where he behaved with stupidity of
 ill-manners? No time can efface the cruel ideas of a man's own foolish
 conduct, or of affronts, which cowardice or impudence has brought
 upon him. They still haunt his solitary hours, damp his most aspiring
 thoughts, and show him, even to himself, in the most contemptible and
 most odious colours imaginable.
 
 What is there too we are more anxious to conceal from others than such
 blunders, infirmities, and meannesses, or more dread to have exposed by
 raillery and satire? And is not the chief object of vanity, our bravery
 or learning, our wit or breeding, our eloquence or address, our taste or
 abilities? These we display with care, if not with ostentation; and
 we commonly show more ambition of excelling in them, than even in the
 social virtues themselves, which are, in reality, of such superior
 excellence. Good-nature and honesty, especially the latter, are so
 indispensably required, that, though the greatest censure attends
 any violation of these duties, no eminent praise follows such common
 instances of them, as seem essential to the support of human society.
 And hence the reason, in my opinion, why, though men often extol so
 liberally the qualities of their heart, they are shy in commending the
 endowments of their head: because the latter virtues, being supposed
 more rare and extraordinary, are observed to be the more usual objects
 of pride and self-conceit; and when boasted of, beget a strong suspicion
 of these sentiments.
 
 It is hard to tell, whether you hurt a man's character most by calling
 him a knave or a coward, and whether a beastly glutton or drunkard be
 not as odious and contemptible, as a selfish, ungenerous miser. Give me
 my choice, and I would rather, for my own happiness and self-enjoyment,
 have a friendly, humane heart, than possess all the other virtues of
 Demosthenes and Philip united: but I would rather pass with the world
 for one endowed with extensive genius and intrepid courage, and should
 thence expect stronger instances of general applause and admiration. The
 figure which a man makes in life, the reception which he meets with in
 company, the esteem paid him by his acquaintance; all these advantages
 depend as much upon his good sense and judgement, as upon any other part
 of his character. Had a man the best intentions in the world, and were
 the farthest removed from all injustice and violence, he would never
 be able to make himself be much regarded, without a moderate share, at
 least, of parts and understanding.
 
 What is it then we can here dispute about? If sense and courage,
 temperance and industry, wisdom and knowledge confessedly form a
 considerable part of PERSONAL MERIT: if a man, possessed of these
 qualities, is both better satisfied with himself, and better entitled
 to the good-will, esteem, and services of others, than one entirely
 destitute of them; if, in short, the SENTIMENTS are similar which arise
 from these endowments and from the social virtues; is there any reason
 for being so extremely scrupulous about a WORD, or disputing whether
 they be entitled to the denomination of virtues? It may, indeed,
 be pretended, that the sentiment of approbation, which those
 accomplishments produce, besides its being INFERIOR, is also somewhat
 DIFFERENT from that which attends the virtues of justice and humanity.
 But this seems not a sufficient reason for ranking them entirely under
 different classes and appellations. The character of Caesar and that of
 Cato, as drawn by Sallust, are both of them virtuous, in the strictest
 and most limited sense of the word; but in a different way: nor are the
 sentiments entirely the same which arise from them. The one produces
 love, the other esteem: the one is amiable, the other awful: we should
 wish to meet the one character in a friend; the other we should be
 ambitious of in ourselves. In like manner the approbation, which attends
 temperance or industry or frugality, may be somewhat different from that
 which is paid to the social virtues, without making them entirely of a
 different species. And, indeed, we may observe, that these endowments,
 more than the other virtues, produce not, all of them, the same kind
 of approbation. Good sense and genius beget esteem and regard: wit and
 humour excite love and affection.
 
 
      [Footnote: Love and esteem are nearly the same passion, and arise
 from similar causes. The qualities, which produce both, are such as
 communicate pleasures. But where this pleasure is severe and serious;
 or where its object is great, and makes a strong impression, or where
 it produces any degree of humility and awe; in all these cases, the
 passion, which arises from the pleasure, is more properly denominated
 esteem than love. Benevolence attends both; but is connected with love
 in a more eminent degree. There seems to be still a stronger mixture of
 pride in contempt than of humility in esteem; and the reason would not
 be difficulty to one, who studied accurately the passions. All these
 various mixtures and compositions and appearances of sentiment from
 a very curious subject of speculation, but are wide for our present
 purpose. Throughout this enquiry, we always consider in general, what
 qualities are a subject of praise or of censure, without entering
 into all the minute differences of sentiment, which they excite. It is
 evident, that whatever is contemned, is also disliked, as well as what
 is hated; and we here endeavour to take objects, according to their most
 simple views and appearances. These sciences are but too apt to appear
 abstract to common readers, even with all the precautions which we can
 take to clear them from superfluous speculations, and bring them down to
 every capacity.]
 
 Most people, I believe, will naturally, without premeditation, assent to
 the definition of the elegant and judicious poet:
 
 Virtue (for mere good-nature is a fool) Is sense and spirit with
 humanity.
 
 
      [Footnote: The Art of preserving Health. Book 4]
 
 What pretensions has a man to our generous assistance or good offices,
 who has dissipated his wealth in profuse expenses, idle vanities,
 chimerical projects, dissolute pleasures or extravagant gaming? These
 vices (for we scruple not to call them such) bring misery unpitied, and
 contempt on every one addicted to them.
 
 Achaeus, a wise and prudent prince, fell into a fatal snare, which cost
 him his crown and life, after having used every reasonable precaution to
 guard himself against it. On that account, says the historian, he is a
 just object of regard and compassion: his betrayers alone of hatred and
 contempt [Footnote: Polybius, lib. iii. cap. 2].
 
 The precipitate flight and improvident negligence of Pompey, at the
 beginning of the civil wars, appeared such notorious blunders to Cicero,
 as quite palled his friendship towards that great man. In the same
 manner, says he, as want of cleanliness, decency, or discretion in
 a mistress are found to alienate our affections. For so he expresses
 himself, where he talks, not in the character of a philosopher, but in
 that of a statesman and man of the world, to his friend Atticus. [Lib.
 ix. epist. 10]. But the same Cicero, in imitation of all the ancient
 moralists, when he reasons as a philosopher, enlarges very much his
 ideas of virtue, and comprehends every laudable quality or endowment
 of the mind, under that honourable appellation. This leads to the
 THIRD reflection, which we proposed to make, to wit, that the ancient
 moralists, the best models, made no material distinction among the
 different species of mental endowments and defects, but treated
 all alike under the appellation of virtues and vices, and made them
 indiscriminately the object of their moral reasonings. The prudence
 explained in Cicero's Offices [Footnote: Lib. i. cap. 6.] is that
 sagacity, which leads to the discovery of truth, and preserves us from
 error and mistake. MAGNANIMITY, TEMPERANCE, DECENCY, are there also at
 large discoursed of. And as that eloquent moralist followed the common
 received division of the four cardinal virtues, our social duties form
 but one head, in the general distribution of his subject.
 
 
      [Footnote: The following passage of Cicero is worth quoting, as
 being the most clear and express to our purpose, that any thing can be
 imagined, and, in a dispute, which is chiefly verbal, must, on account
 of the author, carry an authority, from which there can be no appeal.
 
 'Virtus autem, quae est per se ipsa laudabilis, et sine qua nihil
 laudari potest, tamen habet plures partes, quarum alia est alia ad
 laudationem aptior. Sunt enim aliae virtutes, quae videntur in moribus
 hominum, et quadam comitate ac beneficentia positae: aliae quae
 in ingenii aliqua facultate, aut animi magnitudine ac robore. Nam
 clementia, justitia, benignitas, fides, fortitudo in periculis
 communibus, jucunda est auditu in laudationibus. Omnes enim hae virtutes
 non tam ipsis, qui eas in se habent, quam generi hominum fructuosae
 putantur. Sapientia et magnitude animi, qua omnes res humanae tenues
 et pro nihilo putantur, et in cogitando vis quaedam ingenii, et ipsa
 eloquentia admirationis habet non minus, jucunditatis minus. Ipsos enim
 magis videntur, quos laudamus, quam illos, apud quos laudamus ornare ac
 tueri: sed tamen in laudenda jungenda sunt eliam haec genera virtutum.
 Ferunt enim aures bominum, cum ilia quae jucunda et grata, tum etiam
 ilia, quae mirabilia sunt in virtute, laudari.' De orat. lib. ii. cap.
 84.
 
 I suppose, if Cicero were now alive, it would be found difficult to
 fetter his moral sentiments by narrow systems; or persuade him, that no
 qualities were to be admitted as virtues, or acknowledged to be a part
 of PERSONAL MERIT, but what were recommended by The Whole Duty of Man.]
 
 
 
 We need only peruse the titles of chapters in Aristotle's Ethics to be
 convinced that he ranks courage, temperance, magnificence, magnanimity,
 modesty, prudence, and a manly openness, among the virtues, as well as
 justice and friendship.
 
 To SUSTAIN and to ABSTAIN, that is, to be patient and continent,
 appeared to some of the ancients a summary comprehension of all morals.
 
 Epictetus has scarcely ever mentioned the sentiment of humanity and
 compassion, but in order to put his disciples on their guard against it.
 The virtue of the Stoics seems to consist chiefly in a firm temper and
 a sound understanding. With them, as with Solomon and the eastern
 moralists, folly and wisdom are equivalent to vice and virtue.
 
 Men will praise thee, says David, [Footnote: Psalm 49th.] when thou dost
 well unto thyself. I hate a wise man, says the Greek poet, who is
 not wise to himself [Footnote: Here, Hume quotes Euripedes in Greek].
 Plutarch is no more cramped by systems in his philosophy than in his
 history. Where he compares the great men of Greece and Rome, he fairly
 sets in opposition all their blemishes and accomplishments of whatever
 kind, and omits nothing considerable, which can either depress or exalt
 their characters. His moral discourses contain the same free and natural
 censure of men and manners.
 
 The character of Hannibal, as drawn by Livy, [Footnote: Lib. xxi. cap.
 4] is esteemed partial, but allows him many eminent virtues. Never
 was there a genius, says the historian, more equally fitted for those
 opposite offices of commanding and obeying; and it were, therefore,
 difficult to determine whether he rendered himself DEARER to the general
 or to the army. To none would Hasdrubal entrust more willingly the
 conduct of any dangerous enterprize; under none did the soldiers
 discover more courage and confidence. Great boldness in facing danger;
 great prudence in the midst of it. No labour could fatigue his body or
 subdue his mind. Cold and heat were indifferent to him: meat and
 drink he sought as supplies to the necessities of nature, not as
 gratifications of his voluptuous appetites. Waking or rest he used
 indiscriminately, by night or by day.--These great Virtues were balanced
 by great Vices; inhuman cruelty; perfidy more than punic; no truth, no
 faith, no regard to oaths, promises, or religion.
 
 
 The character of Alexander the Sixth, to be found in Guicciardin,
 [Footnote: Lib. i.] is pretty similar, but juster; and is a proof that
 even the moderns, where they speak naturally, hold the same language
 with the ancients. In this pope, says he, there was a singular capacity
 and judgement: admirable prudence; a wonderful talent of persuasion; and
 in all momentous enterprizes a diligence and dexterity incredible. But
 these VIRTUES were infinitely overbalanced by his VICES; no faith,
 no religion, insatiable avarice, exorbitant ambition, and a more than
 barbarous cruelty.
 
 Polybius, [Footnote: Lib. xii.] reprehending Timaeus for his partiality
 against Agathocles, whom he himself allows to be the most cruel and
 impious of all tyrants, says: if he took refuge in Syracuse, as asserted
 by that historian, flying the dirt and smoke and toil of his former
 profession of a potter; and if proceeding from such slender beginnings,
 he became master, in a little time, of all Sicily; brought the
 Carthaginian state into the utmost danger; and at last died in old age,
 and in possession of sovereign dignity: must he not be allowed something
 prodigious and extraordinary, and to have possessed great talents and
 capacity for business and action? His historian, therefore, ought not to
 have alone related what tended to his reproach and infamy; but also what
 might redound to his Praise and Honour.
 
 In general, we may observe, that the distinction of voluntary or
 involuntary was little regarded by the ancients in their moral
 reasonings; where they frequently treated the question as very doubtful,
 WHETHER VIRTUE COULD BE TAUGHT OR NOT [Vid. Plato in Menone, Seneca de
 otio sap. cap. 31. So also Horace, Virtutem doctrina paret, naturane
 donet, Epist. lib. I. ep. 18. Aeschines Socraticus, Dial. I.]? They
 justly considered that cowardice, meanness, levity, anxiety, impatience,
 folly, and many other qualities of the mind, might appear ridiculous and
 deformed, contemptible and odious, though independent of the will. Nor
 could it be supposed, at all times, in every man's power to attain every
 kind of mental more than of exterior beauty.
 
 And here there occurs the FOURTH reflection which I purposed to make,
 in suggesting the reason why modern philosophers have often followed a
 course in their moral enquiries so different from that of the ancients.
 In later times, philosophy of all kinds, especially ethics, have been
 more closely united with theology than ever they were observed to be
 among the heathens; and as this latter science admits of no terms of
 composition, but bends every branch of knowledge to its own purpose,
 without much regard to the phenomena of nature, or to the unbiassed
 sentiments of the mind, hence reasoning, and even language, have been
 warped from their natural course, and distinctions have been endeavoured
 to be established where the difference of the objects was, in a manner,
 imperceptible. Philosophers, or rather divines under that disguise,
 treating all morals as on a like footing with civil laws, guarded by the
 sanctions of reward and punishment, were necessarily led to render this
 circumstance, of VOLUNTARY or INVOLUNTARY, the foundation of their whole
 theory. Every one may employ TERMS in what sense he pleases: but
 this, in the mean time, must be allowed, that SENTIMENTS are every day
 experienced of blame and praise, which have objects beyond the dominion
 of the will or choice, and of which it behoves us, if not as moralists,
 as speculative philosophers at least, to give some satisfactory theory
 and explication.
 
 A blemish, a fault, a vice, a crime; these expressions seem to denote
 different degrees of censure and disapprobation; which are, however, all
 of them, at the bottom, pretty nearly all the same kind of species. The
 explication of one will easily lead us into a just conception of the
 others; and it is of greater consequence to attend to things than to
 verbal appellations. That we owe a duty to ourselves is confessed even
 in the most vulgar system of morals; and it must be of consequence to
 examine that duty, in order to see whether it bears any affinity to that
 which we owe to society. It is probable that the approbation attending
 the observance of both is of a similar nature, and arises from similar
 principles, whatever appellation we may give to either of these
 excellencies.

 My design in the present work is sufficiently explained in the
 Introduction. The reader must only observe, that all the subjects I have
 there planned out to myself, are not treated of in these two volumes.
 The subjects of the Understanding and Passions make a compleat chain
 of reasoning by themselves; and I was willing to take advantage of this
 natural division, in order to try the taste of the public. If I have the
 good fortune to meet with success, I shall proceed to the examination
 of Morals, Politics, and Criticism; which will compleat this Treatise of
 Human Nature. The approbation of the public I consider as the greatest
 reward of my labours; but am determined to regard its judgment, whatever
 it be, as my best instruction.
 
 
 
 
 INTRODUCTION.
 
 
 
 Nothing is more usual and more natural for those, who pretend to
 discover anything new to the world in philosophy and the sciences, than
 to insinuate the praises of their own systems, by decrying all those,
 which have been advanced before them. And indeed were they content with
 lamenting that ignorance, which we still lie under in the most important
 questions, that can come before the tribunal of human reason, there are
 few, who have an acquaintance with the sciences, that would not readily
 agree with them. It is easy for one of judgment and learning, to
 perceive the weak foundation even of those systems, which have obtained
 the greatest credit, and have carried their pretensions highest
 to accurate and profound reasoning. Principles taken upon trust,
 consequences lamely deduced from them, want of coherence in the parts,
 and of evidence in the whole, these are every where to be met with in
 the systems of the most eminent philosophers, and seem to have drawn
 disgrace upon philosophy itself.
 
 Nor is there required such profound knowledge to discover the present
 imperfect condition of the sciences, but even the rabble without doors
 may, judge from the noise and clamour, which they hear, that all goes
 not well within. There is nothing which is not the subject of debate,
 and in which men of learning are not of contrary opinions. The most
 trivial question escapes not our controversy, and in the most momentous
 we are not able to give any certain decision. Disputes are multiplied,
 as if every thing was uncertain; and these disputes are managed with the
 greatest warmth, as if every thing was certain. Amidst all this bustle
 it is not reason, which carries the prize, but eloquence; and no
 man needs ever despair of gaining proselytes to the most extravagant
 hypothesis, who has art enough to represent it in any favourable
 colours. The victory is not gained by the men at arms, who manage the
 pike and the sword; but by the trumpeters, drummers, and musicians of
 the army.
 
 From hence in my opinion arises that common prejudice against
 metaphysical reasonings of all kinds, even amongst those, who profess
 themselves scholars, and have a just value for every other part of
 literature. By metaphysical reasonings, they do not understand those on
 any particular branch of science, but every kind of argument, which is
 any way abstruse, and requires some attention to be comprehended. We
 have so often lost our labour in such researches, that we commonly
 reject them without hesitation, and resolve, if we must for ever be a
 prey to errors and delusions, that they shall at least be natural and
 entertaining. And indeed nothing but the most determined scepticism,
 along with a great degree of indolence, can justify this aversion to
 metaphysics. For if truth be at all within the reach of human capacity,
 it is certain it must lie very deep and abstruse: and to hope we shall
 arrive at it without pains, while the greatest geniuses have failed
 with the utmost pains, must certainly be esteemed sufficiently vain
 and presumptuous. I pretend to no such advantage in the philosophy I am
 going to unfold, and would esteem it a strong presumption against it,
 were it so very easy and obvious.
 
 It is evident, that all the sciences have a relation, greater or less,
 to human nature: and that however wide any of them may seem to run from
 it, they still return back by one passage or another. Even. Mathematics,
 Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, are in some measure dependent
 on the science of MAN; since the lie under the cognizance of men, and
 are judged of by their powers and faculties. It is impossible to tell
 what changes and improvements we might make in these sciences were we
 thoroughly acquainted with the extent and force of human understanding,
 and could explain the nature of the ideas we employ, and of the
 operations we perform in our reasonings. And these improvements are
 the more to be hoped for in natural religion, as it is not content with
 instructing us in the nature of superior powers, but carries its views
 farther, to their disposition towards us, and our duties towards them;
 and consequently we ourselves are not only the beings, that reason, but
 also one of the objects, concerning which we reason.
 
 If therefore the sciences of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and
 Natural Religion, have such a dependence on the knowledge of man, what
 may be expected in the other sciences, whose connexion with human nature
 is more close and intimate? The sole end of logic is to explain the
 principles and operations of our reasoning faculty, and the nature of
 our ideas: morals and criticism regard our tastes and sentiments: and
 politics consider men as united in society, and dependent on each other.
 In these four sciences of Logic, Morals, Criticism, and Politics, is
 comprehended almost everything, which it can any way import us to be
 acquainted with, or which can tend either to the improvement or ornament
 of the human mind.
 
 Here then is the only expedient, from which we can hope for success in
 our philosophical researches, to leave the tedious lingering method,
 which we have hitherto followed, and instead of taking now and then a
 castle or village on the frontier, to march up directly to the capital
 or center of these sciences, to human nature itself; which being once
 masters of, we may every where else hope for an easy victory. From this
 station we may extend our conquests over all those sciences, which more
 intimately concern human life, and may afterwards proceed at leisure
 to discover more fully those, which are the objects of pore curiosity.
 There is no question of importance, whose decision is not comprised in
 the science of man; and there is none, which can be decided with any
 certainty, before we become acquainted with that science. In pretending,
 therefore, to explain the principles of human nature, we in effect
 propose a compleat system of the sciences, built on a foundation almost
 entirely new, and the only one upon which they can stand with any
 security.
 
 And as the science of man is the-only solid foundation for the other
 sciences, so the only solid foundation we can give to this science
 itself must be laid on experience and observation. It is no astonishing
 reflection to consider, that the application of experimental philosophy
 to moral subjects should come after that to natural at the distance of
 above a whole century; since we find in fact, that there was about the
 same interval betwixt the origins of these sciences; and that reckoning
 from THALES to SOCRATES, the space of time is nearly equal to that
 betwixt, my Lord Bacon and some late philosophers [Mr. Locke, my Lord
 Shaftesbury, Dr. Mandeville, Mr. Hutchinson, Dr. Butler, etc.] in
 England, who have begun to put the science of man on a new footing, and
 have engaged the attention, and excited the curiosity of the public. So
 true it is, that however other nations may rival us in poetry, and
 excel us in some other agreeable arts, the improvements in reason and
 philosophy can only be owing to a land of toleration and of liberty.
 
 Nor ought we to think, that this latter improvement in the science of
 man will do less honour to our native country than the former in natural
 philosophy, but ought rather to esteem it a greater glory, upon account
 of the greater importance of that science, as well as the necessity it
 lay under of such a reformation. For to me it seems evident, that the
 essence of the mind being equally unknown to us with that of external
 bodies, it must be equally impossible to form any notion of its powers
 and qualities otherwise than from careful and exact experiments, and the
 observation of those particular effects, which result from its different
 circumstances and situations. And though we must endeavour to render all
 our principles as universal as possible, by tracing up our experiments
 to the utmost, and explaining all effects from the simplest and fewest
 causes, it is still certain we cannot go beyond experience; and any
 hypothesis, that pretends to discover the ultimate original qualities
 of human nature, ought at first to be rejected as presumptuous and
 chimerical.
 
 I do not think a philosopher, who would apply himself so earnestly to
 the explaining the ultimate principles of the soul, would show himself a
 great master in that very science of human nature, which he pretends to
 explain, or very knowing in what is naturally satisfactory to the mind
 of man. For nothing is more certain, than that despair has almost the
 same effect upon us with enjoyment, and that we are no sooner acquainted
 with the impossibility of satisfying any desire, than the desire itself
 vanishes. When we see, that we have arrived at the utmost extent of
 human reason, we sit down contented, though we be perfectly satisfied in
 the main of our ignorance, and perceive that we can give no reason for
 our most general and most refined principles, beside our experience
 of their reality; which is the reason of the mere vulgar, and what it
 required no study at first to have discovered for the most particular
 and most extraordinary phaenomenon. And as this impossibility of making
 any farther progress is enough to satisfy the reader, so the writer
 may derive a more delicate satisfaction from the free confession of his
 ignorance, and from his prudence in avoiding that error, into which so
 many have fallen, of imposing their conjectures and hypotheses on the
 world for the most certain principles. When this mutual contentment and
 satisfaction can be obtained betwixt the master and scholar, I know not
 what more we can require of our philosophy.
 
 But if this impossibility of explaining ultimate principles should be
 esteemed a defect in the science of man, I will venture to affirm, that
 it is a defect common to it with all the sciences, and all the arts, in
 which we can employ ourselves, whether they be such as are cultivated
 in the schools of the philosophers, or practised in the shops of the
 meanest artizans. None of them can go beyond experience, or establish
 any principles which are not founded on that authority. Moral philosophy
 has, indeed, this peculiar disadvantage, which is not found in natural,
 that in collecting its experiments, it cannot make them purposely, with
 premeditation, and after such a manner as to satisfy itself concerning
 every particular difficulty which may be. When I am at a loss to know
 the effects of one body upon another in any situation, I need only put
 them in that situation, and observe what results from it. But should
 I endeavour to clear up after the same manner any doubt in moral
 philosophy, by placing myself in the same case with that which I
 consider, it is evident this reflection and premeditation would so
 disturb the operation of my natural principles, as must render it
 impossible to form any just conclusion from the phenomenon. We must
 therefore glean up our experiments in this science from a cautious
 observation of human life, and take them as they appear in the common
 course of the world, by men's behaviour in company, in affairs, and
 in their pleasures. Where experiments of this kind are judiciously
 collected and compared, we may hope to establish on them a science which
 will not be inferior in certainty, and will be much superior in utility
 to any other of human comprehension.

 SECT. I. OF THE ORIGIN OF OUR IDEAS.
 
 
 All the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves into two
 distinct kinds, which I shall call IMPRESSIONS and IDEAS. The difference
 betwixt these consists in the degrees of force and liveliness, with
 which they strike upon the mind, and make their way into our thought
 or consciousness. Those perceptions, which enter with most force and
 violence, we may name impressions: and under this name I comprehend
 all our sensations, passions and emotions, as they make their first
 appearance in the soul. By ideas I mean the faint images of these in
 thinking and reasoning; such as, for instance, are all the perceptions
 excited by the present discourse, excepting only those which arise from
 the sight and touch, and excepting the immediate pleasure or uneasiness
 it may occasion. I believe it will not be very necessary to employ many
 words in explaining this distinction. Every one of himself will readily
 perceive the difference betwixt feeling and thinking. The common degrees
 of these are easily distinguished; though it is not impossible but in
 particular instances they may very nearly approach to each other. Thus
 in sleep, in a fever, in madness, or in any very violent emotions of
 soul, our ideas may approach to our impressions, As on the other hand
 it sometimes happens, that our impressions are so faint and low, that
 we cannot distinguish them from our ideas. But notwithstanding this near
 resemblance in a few instances, they are in general so very different,
 that no-one can make a scruple to rank them under distinct heads, and
 assign to each a peculiar name to mark the difference [Footnote 1.].
 
 
      [Footnote 1. I here make use of these terms, impression and
      idea, in a sense different from what is usual, and I hope
      this liberty will be allowed me. Perhaps I rather restore
      the word, idea, to its original sense, from which Mr LOCKE
      had perverted it, in making it stand for all our
      perceptions. By the terms of impression I would not be
      understood to express the manner, in which our lively
      perceptions are produced in the soul, but merely the
      perceptions themselves; for which there is no particular
      name either in the English or any other language, that I
      know of.]
 
 There is another division of our perceptions, which it will be
 convenient to observe, and which extends itself both to our impressions
 and ideas. This division is into SIMPLE and COMPLEX. Simple perceptions
 or impressions and ideas are such as admit of no distinction nor
 separation. The complex are the contrary to these, and may be
 distinguished into parts. Though a particular colour, taste, and smell,
 are qualities all united together in this apple, it is easy to perceive
 they are not the same, but are at least distinguishable from each other.
 
 Having by these divisions given an order and arrangement to our objects,
 we may now apply ourselves to consider with the more accuracy their
 qualities and relations. The first circumstance, that strikes my eye, is
 the great resemblance betwixt our impressions and ideas in every other
 particular, except their degree of force and vivacity. The one seem to
 be in a manner the reflexion of the other; so that all the perceptions
 of the mind are double, and appear both as impressions and ideas. When
 I shut my eyes and think of my chamber, the ideas I form are exact
 representations of the impressions I felt; nor is there any circumstance
 of the one, which is not to be found in the other. In running over my
 other perceptions, I find still the same resemblance and representation.
 Ideas and impressions appear always to correspond to each other. This
 circumstance seems to me remarkable, and engages my attention for a
 moment.
 
 Upon a more accurate survey I find I have been carried away too far by
 the first appearance, and that I must make use of the distinction of
 perceptions into simple and complex, to limit this general decision,
 that all our ideas and impressions are resembling. I observe, that many
 of our complex ideas never had impressions, that corresponded to them,
 and that many of our complex impressions never are exactly copied in
 ideas. I can imagine to myself such a city as the New Jerusalem, whose
 pavement is gold and walls are rubies, though I never saw any such.
 I have seen Paris; but shall I affirm I can form such an idea of that
 city, as will perfectly represent all its streets and houses in their
 real and just proportions?
 
 I perceive, therefore, that though there is in general a great,
 resemblance betwixt our complex impressions and ideas, yet the rule is
 not universally true, that they are exact copies of each other. We may
 next consider how the case stands with our simple, perceptions. After
 the most accurate examination, of which I am capable, I venture to
 affirm, that the rule here holds without any exception, and that every
 simple idea has a simple impression, which resembles it, and every
 simple impression a correspondent idea. That idea of red, which we form
 in the dark, and that impression which strikes our eyes in sun-shine,
 differ only in degree, not in nature. That the case is the same with
 all our simple impressions and ideas, it is impossible to prove by a
 particular enumeration of them. Every one may satisfy himself in this
 point by running over as many as he pleases. But if any one should deny
 this universal resemblance, I know no way of convincing him, but by
 desiring him to shew a simple impression, that has not a correspondent
 idea, or a simple idea, that has not a correspondent impression. If he
 does not answer this challenge, as it is certain he cannot, we may from
 his silence and our own observation establish our conclusion.
 
 Thus we find, that all simple ideas and impressions resemble each other;
 and as the complex are formed from them, we may affirm in general,
 that these two species of perception are exactly correspondent. Having
 discovered this relation, which requires no farther examination, I am
 curious to find some other of their qualities. Let us consider how they
 stand with regard to their existence, and which of the impressions and
 ideas are causes, and which effects.
 
 The full examination of this question is the subject of the present
 treatise; and therefore we shall here content ourselves with
 establishing one general proposition, THAT ALL OUR SIMPLE IDEAS IN
 THEIR FIRST APPEARANCE ARE DERIVED FROM SIMPLE IMPRESSIONS, WHICH ARE
 CORRESPONDENT TO THEM, AND WHICH THEY EXACTLY REPRESENT.
 
 In seeking for phenomena to prove this proposition, I find only those
 of two kinds; but in each kind the phenomena are obvious, numerous, and
 conclusive. I first make myself certain, by a new, review, of what I
 have already asserted, that every simple impression is attended with
 a correspondent idea, and every simple idea with a correspondent
 impression. From this constant conjunction of resembling perceptions
 I immediately conclude, that there is a great connexion betwixt our
 correspondent impressions and ideas, and that the existence of the one
 has a considerable influence upon that of the other. Such a constant
 conjunction, in such an infinite number of instances, can never arise
 from chance; but clearly proves a dependence of the impressions on the
 ideas, or of the ideas on the impressions. That I may know on which side
 this dependence lies, I consider the order of their first appearance;
 and find by constant experience, that the simple impressions always take
 the precedence of their correspondent ideas, but never appear in the
 contrary order. To give a child an idea of scarlet or orange, of sweet
 or bitter, I present the objects, or in other words, convey to him these
 impressions; but proceed not so absurdly, as to endeavour to produce
 the impressions by exciting the ideas. Our ideas upon their appearance
 produce not their correspondent impressions, nor do we perceive any
 colour, or feel any sensation merely upon thinking of them. On the
 other hand we find, that any impression either of the mind or body
 is constantly followed by an idea, which resembles it, and is only
 different in the degrees of force and liveliness, The constant
 conjunction of our resembling perceptions, is a convincing proof,
 that the one are the causes of the other; and this priority of the
 impressions is an equal proof, that our impressions are the causes of
 our ideas, not our ideas of our impressions.
 
 To confirm this I consider Another plain and convincing phaenomenon;
 which is, that, where-ever by any accident the faculties, which give
 rise to any impressions, are obstructed in their operations, as when one
 is born blind or deaf; not only the impressions are lost, but also their
 correspondent ideas; so that there never appear in the mind the least
 traces of either of them. Nor is this only true, where the organs of
 sensation are entirely destroyed, but likewise where they have never
 been put in action to produce a particular impression. We cannot form
 to ourselves a just idea of the taste of a pine apple, without having
 actually tasted it.
 
 There is however one contradictory phaenomenon, which may prove, that it
 is not absolutely impossible for ideas to go before their correspondent
 impressions. I believe it will readily be allowed that the several
 distinct ideas of colours, which enter by the eyes, or those of sounds,
 which are conveyed by the hearing, are really different from each other,
 though at the same time resembling. Now if this be true of different
 colours, it must be no less so of the different shades of the same
 colour, that each of them produces a distinct idea, independent of the
 rest. For if this should be denied, it is possible, by the continual
 gradation of shades, to run a colour insensibly into what is most remote
 from it; and if you will not allow any of the means to be different,
 you cannot without absurdity deny the extremes to be the same. Suppose
 therefore a person to have enjoyed his sight for thirty years, and
 to have become perfectly well acquainted with colours of all kinds,
 excepting one particular shade of blue, for instance, which it never
 has been his fortune to meet with. Let all the different shades of
 that colour, except that single one, be placed before him, descending
 gradually from the deepest to the lightest; it is plain, that he will
 perceive a blank, where that shade is wanting, said will be sensible,
 that there is a greater distance in that place betwixt the contiguous
 colours, than in any other. Now I ask, whether it is possible for him,
 from his own imagination, to supply this deficiency, and raise up to
 himself the idea of that particular shade, though it had never been
 conveyed to him by his senses? I believe there are few but will be
 of opinion that he can; and this may serve as a proof, that the simple
 ideas are not always derived from the correspondent impressions; though
 the instance is so particular and singular, that it is scarce worth
 our observing, and does not merit that for it alone we should alter our
 general maxim.
 
 But besides this exception, it may not be amiss to remark on this head,
 that the principle of the priority of impressions to ideas must be
 understood with another limitation, viz., that as our ideas are images
 of our impressions, so we can form secondary ideas, which are images of
 the primary; as appears from this very reasoning concerning them.
 This is not, properly speaking, an exception to the rule so much as
 an explanation of it. Ideas produce the images of themselves in
 new ideas; but as the first ideas are supposed to be derived from
 impressions, it still remains true, that all our simple ideas proceed
 either mediately or immediately, from their correspondent impressions.
 
 This then is the first principle I establish in the science of human
 nature; nor ought we to despise it because of the simplicity of its
 appearance. For it is remarkable, that the present question concerning
 the precedency of our impressions or ideas, is the same with what has
 made so much noise in other terms, when it has been disputed whether
 there be any INNATE IDEAS, or whether all ideas be derived from
 sensation and reflexion. We may observe, that in order to prove the
 ideas of extension and colour not to be innate, philosophers do nothing
 but shew that they are conveyed by our senses. To prove the ideas
 of passion and desire not to be innate, they observe that we have a
 preceding experience of these emotions in ourselves. Now if we carefully
 examine these arguments, we shall find that they prove nothing but that
 ideas are preceded by other more lively perceptions, from which the
 are derived, and which they represent. I hope this clear stating of the
 question will remove all disputes concerning it, and win render this
 principle of more use in our reasonings, than it seems hitherto to have
 been.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. II. DIVISION OF THE SUBJECT.
 
 
 Since it appears, that our simple impressions are prior to their
 correspondent ideas, and that the exceptions are very rare, method seems
 to require we should examine our impressions, before we consider our
 ideas. Impressions way be divided into two kinds, those Of SENSATION and
 those of REFLEXION. The first kind arises in the soul originally, from
 unknown causes. The second is derived in a great measure from our ideas,
 and that in the following order. An impression first strikes upon the
 senses, and makes us perceive heat or cold, thirst or hunger, pleasure
 or pain of some kind or other. Of this impression there is a copy taken
 by the mind, which remains after the impression ceases; and this we call
 an idea. This idea of pleasure or pain, when it returns upon the soul,
 produces the new impressions of desire and aversion, hope and fear,
 which may properly be called impressions of reflexion, because derived
 from it. These again are copied by the memory and imagination, and
 become ideas; which perhaps in their turn give rise to other impressions
 and ideas. So that the impressions of reflexion are only antecedent
 to their correspondent ideas; but posterior to those of sensation, and
 derived from them. The examination of our sensations belongs more to
 anatomists and natural philosophers than to moral; and therefore shall
 not at present be entered upon. And as the impressions of reflexion,
 viz. passions, desires, and emotions, which principally deserve our
 attention, arise mostly from ideas, it will be necessary to reverse that
 method, which at first sight seems most natural; and in order to explain
 the nature and principles of the human mind, give a particular account
 of ideas, before we proceed to impressions. For this reason I have here
 chosen to begin with ideas.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. III. OF THE IDEAS OF THE MEMORY AND IMAGINATION.
 
 
 We find by experience, that when any impression has been present with
 the mind, it again makes its appearance there as an idea; and this it
 may do after two different ways: either when in its new appearance it
 retains a considerable degree of its first vivacity, and is somewhat
 intermediate betwixt an impression and an idea: or when it entirely
 loses that vivacity, and is a perfect idea. The faculty, by which we
 repeat our impressions in the first manner, is called the MEMORY, and
 the other the IMAGINATION. It is evident at first sight, that the
 ideas of the memory are much more lively and strong than those of the
 imagination, and that the former faculty paints its objects in more
 distinct colours, than any which are employed by the latter. When we
 remember any past event, the idea of it flows in upon the mind in a
 forcible manner; whereas in the imagination the perception is faint and
 languid, and cannot without difficulty be preserved by the mind
 steddy and uniform for any considerable time. Here then is a sensible
 difference betwixt one species of ideas and another. But of this more
 fully hereafter.[Part II, Sect. 5.]
 
 There is another difference betwixt these two kinds of ideas, which is
 no less evident, namely that though neither the ideas, of the memory
 nor imagination, neither the lively nor faint ideas can make their
 appearance in the mind, unless their correspondent impressions have
 gone before to prepare the way for them, yet the imagination is not
 restrained to the same order and form with the original impressions;
 while the memory is in a manner tied down in that respect, without any
 power of variation.
 
 It is evident, that the memory preserves the original form, in which
 its objects were presented, and that where-ever we depart from it in
 recollecting any thing, it proceeds from some defect or imperfection
 in that faculty. An historian may, perhaps, for the more convenient
 Carrying on of his narration, relate an event before another, to which
 it was in fact posterior; but then he takes notice of this disorder, if
 he be exact; and by that means replaces the idea in its due position. It
 is the same case in our recollection of those places and persons, with
 which we were formerly acquainted. The chief exercise of the memory
 is not to preserve the simple ideas, but their order and position. In
 short, this principle is supported by such a number of common and vulgar
 phaenomena, that we may spare ourselves the trouble of insisting on it
 any farther.
 
 The same evidence follows us in our second principle, OF THE LIBERTY OF
 THE IMAGINATION TO TRANSPOSE AND CHANGE ITS IDEAS. The fables we meet
 with in poems and romances put this entirely out of the question. Nature
 there is totally confounded, and nothing mentioned but winged horses,
 fiery dragons, and monstrous giants. Nor will this liberty of the fancy
 appear strange, when we consider, that all our ideas are copyed from
 our impressions, and that there are not any two impressions which
 are perfectly inseparable. Not to mention, that this is an evident
 consequence of the division of ideas into simple and complex. Where-ever
 the imagination perceives a difference among ideas, it can easily
 produce a separation.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. IV. OF THE CONNEXION OR ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS.
 
 
 As all simple ideas may be separated by the imagination, and may
 be united again in what form it pleases, nothing would be more
 unaccountable than the operations of that faculty, were it not guided
 by some universal principles, which render it, in some measure, uniform
 with itself in all times and places. Were ideas entirely loose and
 unconnected, chance alone would join them; and it is impossible the same
 simple ideas should fall regularly into complex ones (as they Commonly
 do) without some bond of union among them, some associating quality,
 by which one idea naturally introduces another. This uniting principle
 among ideas is not to be considered as an inseparable connexion; for
 that has been already excluded from the imagination: Nor yet are we to
 conclude, that without it the mind cannot join two ideas; for nothing
 is more free than that faculty: but we are only to regard it as a
 gentle force, which commonly prevails, and is the cause why, among other
 things, languages so nearly correspond to each other; nature in a manner
 pointing out to every one those simple ideas, which are most proper to
 be united in a complex one. The qualities, from which this association
 arises, and by which the mind is after this manner conveyed from one
 idea to another, are three, viz. RESEMBLANCE, CONTIGUITY in time or
 place, and CAUSE and EFFECT.
 
 I believe it will not be very necessary to prove, that these qualities
 produce an association among ideas, and upon the appearance of one idea
 naturally introduce another. It is plain, that in the course of our
 thinking, and in the constant revolution of our ideas, our imagination
 runs easily from one idea to any other that resembles it, and that this
 quality alone is to the fancy a sufficient bond and association. It
 is likewise evident that as the senses, in changing their objects,
 are necessitated to change them regularly, and take them as they lie
 CONTIGUOUS to each other, the imagination must by long custom acquire
 the same method of thinking, and run along the parts of space and time
 in conceiving its objects. As to the connexion, that is made by the
 relation of cause and effect, we shall have occasion afterwards to
 examine it to the bottom, and therefore shall not at present insist
 upon it. It is sufficient to observe, that there is no relation, which
 produces a stronger connexion in the fancy, and makes one idea more
 readily recall another, than the relation of cause and effect betwixt
 their objects.
 
 That we may understand the full extent of these relations, we must
 consider, that two objects are connected together in the imagination,
 not only when the one is immediately resembling, contiguous to, or the
 cause of the other, but also when there is interposed betwixt them a
 third object, which bears to both of them any of these relations. This
 may be carried on to a great length; though at the same time we may
 observe, that each remove considerably weakens the relation. Cousins in
 the fourth degree are connected by causation, if I may be allowed to
 use that term; but not so closely as brothers, much less as child and
 parent. In general we may observe, that all the relations of blood
 depend upon cause and effect, and are esteemed near or remote, according
 to the number of connecting causes interposed betwixt the persons.
 
 Of the three relations above-mentioned this of causation is the most
 extensive. Two objects may be considered as placed in this relation,
 as well when one is the cause of any of the actions or motions of the
 other, as when the former is the cause of the existence of the
 latter. For as that action or motion is nothing but the object itself,
 considered in a certain light, and as the object continues the same
 in all its different situations, it is easy to imagine how such
 an influence of objects upon one another may connect them in the
 imagination.
 
 We may carry this farther, and remark, not only that two objects are
 connected by the relation of cause and effect, when the one produces
 a motion or any action in the other, but also when it has a power
 of producing it. And this we may observe to be the source of all the
 relation, of interest and duty, by which men influence each other in
 society, and are placed in the ties of government and subordination. A
 master is such-a-one as by his situation, arising either from force or
 agreement, has a power of directing in certain particulars the actions
 of another, whom we call servant. A judge is one, who in all disputed
 cases can fix by his opinion the possession or property of any thing
 betwixt any members of the society. When a person is possessed of any
 power, there is no more required to convert it into action, but the
 exertion of the will; and that in every case is considered as possible,
 and in many as probable; especially in the case of authority, where the
 obedience of the subject is a pleasure and advantage to the superior.
 
 These are therefore the principles of union or cohesion among our simple
 ideas, and in the imagination supply the place of that inseparable
 connexion, by which they are united in our memory. Here is a kind
 of ATTRACTION, which in the mental world will be found to have as
 extraordinary effects as in the natural, and to shew itself in as many
 and as various forms. Its effects are every where conspicuous; but as to
 its causes, they are mostly unknown, and must be resolved into original
 qualities of human nature, which I pretend not to explain. Nothing is
 more requisite for a true philosopher, than to restrain the intemperate
 desire of searching into causes, and having established any doctrine
 upon a sufficient number of experiments, rest contented with that, when
 he sees a farther examination would lead him into obscure and uncertain
 speculations. In that case his enquiry would be much better employed in
 examining the effects than the causes of his principle.
 
 Amongst the effects of this union or association of ideas, there are
 none more remarkable, than those complex ideas, which are the common
 subjects of our thoughts and reasoning, and generally arise from some
 principle of union among our simple ideas. These complex ideas may be
 divided into Relations, Modes, and Substances. We shall briefly examine
 each of these in order, and shall subjoin some considerations concerning
 our general and particular ideas, before we leave the present subject,
 which may be considered as the elements of this philosophy.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. V. OF RELATIONS.
 
 
 The word RELATION is commonly used in two senses considerably different
 from each other. Either for that quality, by which two ideas are
 connected together in the imagination, and the one naturally introduces
 the other, after the manner above-explained: or for that particular
 circumstance, in which, even upon the arbitrary union of two ideas in
 the fancy, we may think proper to compare them. In common language the
 former is always the sense, in which we use the word, relation; and it
 is only in philosophy, that we extend it to mean any particular subject
 of comparison, without a connecting principle. Thus distance will be
 allowed by philosophers to be a true relation, because we acquire an
 idea of it by the comparing of objects: But in a common way we say, THAT
 NOTHING CAN BE MORE DISTANT THAN SUCH OR SUCH THINGS FROM EACH OTHER,
 NOTHING CAN HAVE LESS RELATION: as if distance and relation were
 incompatible.
 
 It may perhaps be esteemed an endless task to enumerate all those
 qualities, which make objects admit of comparison, and by which the
 ideas of philosophical relation are produced. But if we diligently
 consider them, we shall find that without difficulty they may be
 comprised under seven general heads, which may be considered as the
 sources of all philosophical relation.
 
 (1) The first is RESEMBLANCE: And this is a relation, without which
 no philosophical relation can exist; since no objects will admit
 of comparison, but what have some degree of resemblance. But though
 resemblance be necessary to all philosophical relation, it does not
 follow, that it always produces a connexion or association of ideas.
 When a quality becomes very general, and is common to a great many
 individuals, it leads not the mind directly to any one of them; but
 by presenting at once too great a choice, does thereby prevent the
 imagination from fixing on any single object.
 
 (2) IDENTITY may be esteemed a second species of relation. This relation
 I here consider as applied in its strictest sense to constant and
 unchangeable objects; without examining the nature and foundation
 of personal identity, which shall find its place afterwards. Of all
 relations the most universal is that of identity, being common to every
 being whose existence has any duration.
 
 (3) After identity the most universal and comprehensive relations are
 those of SPACE and TIME, which are the sources of an infinite number of
 comparisons, such as distant, contiguous, above, below, before, after,
 etc.
 
 (4) All those objects, which admit of QUANTITY, or NUMBER, may be
 compared in that particular; which is another very fertile source of
 relation.
 
 (5) When any two objects possess the same QUALITY in common, the
 DEGREES, in which they possess it, form a fifth species of relation.
 Thus of two objects, which are both heavy, the one may be either of
 greater, or less weight than the other. Two colours, that are of the
 same kind, may yet be of different shades, and in that respect admit of
 comparison.
 
 (6) The relation of CONTRARIETY may at first sight be regarded as an
 exception to the rule, THAT NO RELATION OF ANY KIND CAN SUBSIST WITHOUT
 SOME DEGREE OF RESEMBLANCE. But let us consider, that no two ideas are
 in themselves contrary, except those of existence and non-existence,
 which are plainly resembling, as implying both of them an idea of the
 object; though the latter excludes the object from all times and places,
 in which it is supposed not to exist.
 
 (7) All other objects, such as fire and water, heat and cold, are only
 found to be contrary from experience, and from the contrariety of their
 causes or effects; which relation of cause and effect is a seventh
 philosophical relation, as well as a natural one. The resemblance
 implied in this relation, shall be explained afterwards.
 
 It might naturally be expected, that I should join DIFFERENCE to the
 other relations. But that I consider rather as a negation of relation,
 than as anything real or positive. Difference is of two kinds as opposed
 either to identity or resemblance. The first is called a difference of
 number; the other of KIND.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VI. OF MODES AND SUBSTANCES
 
 
 I would fain ask those philosophers, who found so much of their
 reasonings on the distinction of substance and accident, and imagine we
 have clear ideas of each, whether the idea of substance be derived from
 the impressions of sensation or of reflection? If it be conveyed to us
 by our senses, I ask, which of them; and after what manner? If it be
 perceived by the eyes, it must be a colour; if by the ears, a sound; if
 by the palate, a taste; and so of the other senses. But I believe none
 will assert, that substance is either a colour, or sound, or a taste.
 The idea, of substance must therefore be derived from an impression
 of reflection, if it really exist. But the impressions of reflection
 resolve themselves into our passions and emotions: none of which can
 possibly represent a substance. We have therefore no idea of substance,
 distinct from that of a collection of particular qualities, nor have we
 any other meaning when we either talk or reason concerning it.
 
 The idea of a substance as well as that of a mode, is nothing but a
 collection of Simple ideas, that are united by the imagination, and have
 a particular name assigned them, by which we are able to recall, either
 to ourselves or others, that collection. But the difference betwixt
 these ideas consists in this, that the particular qualities, which form
 a substance, are commonly referred to an unknown something, in which
 they are supposed to inhere; or granting this fiction should not take
 place, are at least supposed to be closely and inseparably connected by
 the relations of contiguity and causation. The effect of this is, that
 whatever new simple quality we discover to have the same connexion with
 the rest, we immediately comprehend it among them, even though it did
 not enter into the first conception of the substance. Thus our idea of
 gold may at first be a yellow colour, weight, malleableness, fusibility;
 but upon the discovery of its dissolubility in aqua regia, we join that
 to the other qualities, and suppose it to belong to the substance as
 much as if its idea had from the beginning made a part of the compound
 one. The principal of union being regarded as the chief part of the
 complex idea, gives entrance to whatever quality afterwards occurs, and
 is equally comprehended by it, as are the others, which first presented
 themselves.
 
 That this cannot take place in modes, is evident from considering their
 mature. The simple ideas of which modes are formed, either represent
 qualities, which are not united by contiguity and causation, but are
 dispersed in different subjects; or if they be all united together, the
 uniting principle is not regarded as the foundation of the complex idea.
 The idea of a dance is an instance of the first kind of modes; that
 of beauty of the second. The reason is obvious, why such complex
 ideas cannot receive any new idea, without changing the name, which
 distinguishes the mode.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VII. OF ABSTRACT IDEAS.
 
 
 A very material question has been started concerning ABSTRACT or GENERAL
 ideas, WHETHER THEY BE GENERAL OR PARTICULAR IN THE MIND'S CONCEPTION
 OF THEM. A great philosopher [Dr. Berkeley.] has disputed the received
 opinion in this particular, and has asserted, that all general ideas are
 nothing but particular ones, annexed to a certain term, which gives
 them a more extensive signification, and makes them recall upon occasion
 other individuals, which are similar to them. As I look upon this to be
 one of the greatest and most valuable discoveries that has been made of
 late years in the republic of letters, I shall here endeavour to confirm
 it by some arguments, which I hope will put it beyond all doubt and
 controversy.
 
 It is evident, that in forming most of our general ideas, if not all of
 them, we abstract from every particular degree of quantity and quality,
 and that an object ceases not to be of any particular species on
 account of every small alteration in its extension, duration and other
 properties. It may therefore be thought, that here is a plain dilemma,
 that decides concerning the nature of those abstract ideas, which have
 afforded so much speculation to philosophers. The abstract idea of a man
 represents men of all sizes and all qualities; which it is concluded it
 cannot do, but either by representing at once all possible sizes and all
 possible qualities, or by, representing no particular one at all. Now
 it having been esteemed absurd to defend the former proposition, as
 implying an infinite capacity in the mind, it has been commonly inferred
 in favour of the latter: and our abstract ideas have been supposed to
 represent no particular degree either of quantity or quality. But that
 this inference is erroneous, I shall endeavour to make appear, first,
 by proving, that it is utterly impossible to conceive any quantity or
 quality, without forming a precise notion of its degrees: And secondly
 by showing, that though the capacity of the mind be not infinite, yet
 we can at once form a notion of all possible degrees of quantity and
 quality, in such a manner at least, as, however imperfect, may serve all
 the purposes of reflection and conversation.
 
 To begin with the first proposition, THAT THE MIND CANNOT FORM ANY
 NOTION OF QUANTITY OR QUALITY WITHOUT FORMING A PRECISE NOTION OF
 DEGREES OF EACH; we may prove this by the three following arguments.
 First, We have observed, that whatever objects are different are
 distinguishable, and that whatever objects are distinguishable are
 separable by the thought and imagination. And we may here add, that
 these propositions are equally true in the inverse, and that whatever
 objects are separable are also distinguishable, and that whatever
 objects are distinguishable, are also different. For how is it possible
 we can separate what is not distinguishable, or distinguish what is not
 different? In order therefore to know, whether abstraction implies a
 separation, we need only consider it in this view, and examine, whether
 all the circumstances, which we abstract from in our general ideas, be
 such as are distinguishable and different from those, which we retain
 as essential parts of them. But it is evident at first sight, that the
 precise length of a line is not different nor distinguishable from the
 line itself nor the precise degree of any quality from the quality.
 These ideas, therefore, admit no more of separation than they do of
 distinction and difference. They are consequently conjoined with
 each other in the conception; and the general idea of a line,
 notwithstanding all our abstractions and refinements, has in its
 appearance in the mind a precise degree of quantity and quality; however
 it may be made to represent others, which have different degrees of
 both.
 
 Secondly, it is contest, that no object can appear to the senses; or in
 other words, that no impression can become present to the mind, without
 being determined in its degrees both of quantity and quality. The
 confusion, in which impressions are sometimes involved, proceeds only
 from their faintness and unsteadiness, not from any capacity in the mind
 to receive any impression, which in its real existence has no particular
 degree nor proportion. That is a contradiction in terms; and even
 implies the flattest of all contradictions, viz. that it is possible for
 the same thing both to be and not to be.
 
 Now since all ideas are derived from impressions, and are nothing but
 copies and representations of them, whatever is true of the one must be
 acknowledged concerning the other. Impressions and ideas differ only in
 their strength and vivacity. The foregoing conclusion is not founded on
 any particular degree of vivacity. It cannot therefore be affected by
 any variation in that particular. An idea is a weaker impression; and
 as a strong impression must necessarily have a determinate quantity and
 quality, the case must be the same with its copy or representative.
 
 Thirdly, it is a principle generally received in philosophy that
 everything in nature is individual, and that it is utterly absurd to
 suppose a triangle really existent, which has no precise proportion of
 sides and angles. If this therefore be absurd in fact and reality, it
 must also be absurd in idea; since nothing of which we can form a clear
 and distinct idea is absurd and impossible. But to form the idea of an
 object, and to form an idea simply, is the same thing; the reference
 of the idea to an object being an extraneous denomination, of which in
 itself it bears no mark or character. Now as it is impossible to form an
 idea of an object, that is possest of quantity and quality, and yet
 is possest of no precise degree of either; it follows that there is an
 equal impossibility of forming an idea, that is not limited and confined
 in both these particulars. Abstract ideas are therefore in themselves
 individual, however they may become general in their representation.
 The image in the mind is only that of a particular object, though the
 application of it in our reasoning be the same, as if it were universal.
 
 This application of ideas beyond their nature proceeds from our
 collecting all their possible degrees of quantity and quality in such an
 imperfect manner as may serve the purposes of life, which is the second
 proposition I proposed to explain. When we have found a resemblance
 [Footnote 2.] among several objects, that often occur to us, we apply
 the same name to all of them, whatever differences we may observe in the
 degrees of their quantity and quality, and whatever other differences
 may appear among them. After we have acquired a custom of this kind, the
 hearing of that name revives the idea of one of these objects, and makes
 the imagination conceive it with all its particular circumstances and
 proportions. But as the same word is supposed to have been frequently
 applied to other individuals, that are different in many respects from
 that idea, which is immediately present to the mind; the word not being
 able to revive the idea of all these individuals, but only touches the
 soul, if I may be allowed so to speak, and revives that custom, which we
 have acquired by surveying them. They are not really and in fact present
 to the mind, but only in power; nor do we draw them all out distinctly
 in the imagination, but keep ourselves in a readiness to survey any of
 them, as we may be prompted by a present design or necessity. The word
 raises up an individual idea, along with a certain custom; and that
 custom produces any other individual one, for which we may have
 occasion. But as the production of all the ideas, to which the name may
 be applied, is in most eases impossible, we abridge that work by a more
 partial consideration, and find but few inconveniences to arise in our
 reasoning from that abridgment.
 
 
      [Footnote 2. It is evident, that even different simple ideas
      may have a similarity or resemblance to each other; nor is
      it necessary, that the point or circumstance of resemblance
      shoud be distinct or separable from that in which they
      differ. BLUE and GREEN are different simple ideas, but are
      more resembling than BLUE and SCARLET; tho their perfect
      simplicity excludes all possibility of separation or
      distinction. It is the same case with particular sounds, and
      tastes and smells. These admit of infinite resemblances upon
      the general appearance and comparison, without having any
      common circumstance the same. And of this we may be certain,
      even from the very abstract terms SIMPLE IDEA. They
      comprehend all simple ideas under them. These resemble each
      other in their simplicity. And yet from their very nature,
      which excludes all composition, this circumstance, In which
      they resemble, Is not distinguishable nor separable from the
      rest. It is the same case with all the degrees In any
      quality. They are all resembling and yet the quality, In any
      individual, Is not distinct from the degree.]
 
 For this is one of the most extraordinary circumstances in the present
 affair, that after the mind has produced an individual idea, upon which
 we reason, the attendant custom, revived by the general or abstract
 term, readily suggests any other individual, if by chance we form any
 reasoning, that agrees not with it. Thus should we mention the
 word triangle, and form the idea of a particular equilateral one to
 correspond to it, and should we afterwards assert, that the three
 angles of a triangle are equal to each other, the other individuals of a
 scalenum and isosceles, which we overlooked at first, immediately crowd
 in upon us, and make us perceive the falshood of this proposition,
 though it be true with relation to that idea, which we had formed. If
 the mind suggests not always these ideas upon occasion, it proceeds
 from some imperfection in its faculties; and such a one as is often the
 source of false reasoning and sophistry. But this is principally the
 case with those ideas which are abstruse and compounded. On other
 occasions the custom is more entire, and it is seldom we run into such
 errors.
 
 Nay so entire is the custom, that the very same idea may be annext to
 several different words, and may be employed in different reasonings,
 without any danger of mistake. Thus the idea of an equilateral triangle
 of an inch perpendicular may serve us in talking of a figure, of a
 rectilinear figure, of a regular figure, of a triangle, and of an
 equilateral triangle. All these terms, therefore, are in this case
 attended with the same idea; but as they are wont to be applied in a
 greater or lesser compass, they excite their particular habits, and
 thereby keep the mind in a readiness to observe, that no conclusion be
 formed contrary to any ideas, which are usually comprized under them.
 
 Before those habits have become entirely perfect, perhaps the mind may
 not be content with forming the idea of only one individual, but may run
 over several, in order to make itself comprehend its own meaning, and
 the compass of that collection, which it intends to express by the
 general term. That we may fix the meaning of the word, figure, we may
 revolve in our mind the ideas of circles, squares, parallelograms,
 triangles of different sizes and proportions, and may not rest on one
 image or idea. However this may be, it is certain that we form the idea
 of individuals, whenever we use any general term; that we seldom or
 never can exhaust these individuals; and that those, which remain,
 are only represented by means of that habit, by which we recall them,
 whenever any present occasion requires it. This then is the nature of
 our abstract ideas and general terms; and it is after this manner we
 account for the foregoing paradox, THAT SOME IDEAS ARE PARTICULAR IN
 THEIR NATURE, BUT GENERAL IN THEIR REPRESENTATION. A particular idea
 becomes general by being annexed to a general term; that is, to a
 term, which from a customary conjunction has a relation to many other
 particular ideas, and readily recalls them in the imagination.
 
 The only difficulty, that can remain on this subject, must be with
 regard to that custom, which so readily recalls every particular idea,
 for which we may have occasion, and is excited by any word or sound, to
 which we commonly annex it. The most proper method, in my opinion,
 of giving a satisfactory explication of this act of the mind, is
 by producing other instances, which are analogous to it, and other
 principles, which facilitate its operation. To explain the ultimate
 causes of our mental actions is impossible. It is sufficient, if we can
 give any satisfactory account of them from experience and analogy.
 
 First then I observe, that when we mention any great number, such as
 a thousand, the mind has generally no adequate idea of it, but only a
 power of producing such an idea, by its adequate idea of the decimals,
 under which the number is comprehended. This imperfection, however,
 in our ideas, is never felt in our reasonings; which seems to be an
 instance parallel to the present one of universal ideas.
 
 Secondly, we have several instances of habits, which may be revived
 by one single word; as when a person, who has by rote any periods of a
 discourse, or any number of verses, will be put in remembrance of
 the whole, which he is at a loss to recollect, by that single word or
 expression, with which they begin.
 
 Thirdly, I believe every one, who examines the situation of his mind in
 reasoning will agree with me, that we do not annex distinct and compleat
 ideas to every term we make use of, and that in talking of government,
 church, negotiation, conquest, we seldom spread out in our minds all the
 simple ideas, of which these complex ones are composed. It is however
 observable, that notwithstanding this imperfection we may avoid talking
 nonsense on these subjects, and may perceive any repugnance among
 the ideas, as well as if we had a fall comprehension of them. Thus
 if instead of saying, that in war the weaker have always recourse to
 negotiation, we should say, that they have always recourse to conquest,
 the custom, which we have acquired of attributing certain relations to
 ideas, still follows the words, and makes us immediately perceive the
 absurdity of that proposition; in the same manner as one particular idea
 may serve us in reasoning concerning other ideas, however different from
 it in several circumstances.
 
 Fourthly, As the individuals are collected together, said placed under
 a general term with a view to that resemblance, which they bear to each
 other, this relation must facilitate their entrance in the imagination,
 and make them be suggested more readily upon occasion. And indeed if
 we consider the common progress of the thought, either in reflection
 or conversation, we shall find great reason to be satisfyed in this
 particular. Nothing is more admirable, than the readiness, with which
 the imagination suggests its ideas, and presents them at the very
 instant, in which they become necessary or useful. The fancy runs from
 one end of the universe to the other in collecting those ideas, which
 belong to any subject. One would think the whole intellectual world of
 ideas was at once subjected to our view, and that we did nothing but
 pick out such as were most proper for our purpose. There may not,
 however, be any present, beside those very ideas, that are thus
 collected by a kind of magical faculty in the soul, which, though it be
 always most perfect in the greatest geniuses, and is properly what we
 call a genius, is however inexplicable by the utmost efforts of human
 understanding.
 
 Perhaps these four reflections may help to remove an difficulties to
 the hypothesis I have proposed concerning abstract ideas, so contrary to
 that, which has hitherto prevailed in philosophy, But, to tell the truth
 I place my chief confidence in what I have already proved concerning
 the impossibility of general ideas, according to the common method of
 explaining them. We must certainly seek some new system on this head,
 and there plainly is none beside what I have proposed. If ideas be
 particular in their nature, and at the same time finite in their number,
 it is only by custom they can become general in their representation,
 and contain an infinite number of other ideas under them.
 
 Before I leave this subject I shall employ the same principles to
 explain that distinction of reason, which is so much talked of, and is
 so little understood, in the schools. Of this kind is the distinction
 betwixt figure and the body figured; motion and the body moved. The
 difficulty of explaining this distinction arises from the principle
 above explained, that all ideas, which are different, are separable. For
 it follows from thence, that if the figure be different from the body,
 their ideas must be separable as well as distinguishable: if they be
 not different, their ideas can neither be separable nor distinguishable.
 What then is meant by a distinction of reason, since it implies neither
 a difference nor separation.
 
 To remove this difficulty we must have recourse to the foregoing
 explication of abstract ideas. It is certain that the mind would never
 have dreamed of distinguishing a figure from the body figured, as being
 in reality neither distinguishable, nor different, nor separable; did it
 not observe, that even in this simplicity there might be contained many
 different resemblances and relations. Thus when a globe of white marble
 is presented, we receive only the impression of a white colour disposed
 in a certain form, nor are we able to separate and distinguish the
 colour from the form. But observing afterwards a globe of black marble
 and a cube of white, and comparing them with our former object, we
 find two separate resemblances, in what formerly seemed, and really is,
 perfectly inseparable. After a little more practice of this kind, we
 begin to distinguish the figure from the colour by a distinction of
 reason; that is, we consider the figure and colour together, since they
 are in effect the same and undistinguishable; but still view them in
 different aspects, according to the resemblances, of which they are
 susceptible. When we would consider only the figure of the globe of
 white marble, we form in reality an idea both of the figure and colour,
 but tacitly carry our eye to its resemblance with the globe of black
 marble: And in the same manner, when we would consider its colour only,
 we turn our view to its resemblance with the cube of white marble. By
 this means we accompany our ideas with a kind of reflection, of which
 custom renders us, in a great measure, insensible. A person, who desires
 us to consider the figure of a globe of white marble without thinking on
 its colour, desires an impossibility but his meaning is, that we should
 consider the figure and colour together, but still keep in our eye the
 resemblance to the globe of black marble, or that to any other globe of
 whatever colour or substance.
 
 
 
 
 
 PART II. OF THE IDEAS OF SPACE AND TIME.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. I. OF THE INFINITE DIVISIBILITY OF OUR IDEAS OF SPACE AND TIME.
 
 
 Whatever has the air of a paradox, and is contrary to the first and
 most unprejudiced notions of mankind, is often greedily embraced by
 philosophers, as shewing the superiority of their science, which coued
 discover opinions so remote from vulgar conception. On the other hand,
 anything proposed to us, which causes surprize and admiration, gives
 such a satisfaction to the mind, that it indulges itself in those
 agreeable emotions, and will never be persuaded that its pleasure is
 entirely without foundation. From these dispositions in philosophers and
 their disciples arises that mutual complaisance betwixt them; while the
 former furnish such plenty of strange and unaccountable opinions, and
 the latter so readily believe them. Of this mutual complaisance I
 cannot give a more evident instance than in the doctrine of infinite
 divisibility, with the examination of which I shall begin this subject
 of the ideas of space and time.
 
 It is universally allowed, that the capacity of the mind is limited, and
 can never attain a full and adequate conception of infinity: And though
 it were not allowed, it would be sufficiently evident from the plainest
 observation and experience. It is also obvious, that whatever is capable
 of being divided in infinitum, must consist of an infinite number of
 parts, and that it is impossible to set any bounds to the number of
 parts, without setting bounds at the same time to the division. It
 requires scarce any, induction to conclude from hence, that the idea,
 which we form of any finite quality, is not infinitely divisible, but
 that by proper distinctions and separations we may run up this idea
 to inferior ones, which will be perfectly simple and indivisible. In
 rejecting the infinite capacity of the mind, we suppose it may arrive at
 an end in the division of its ideas; nor are there any possible means of
 evading the evidence of this conclusion.
 
 It is therefore certain, that the imagination reaches a minimum, and
 may raise up to itself an idea, of which it cannot conceive any
 sub-division, and which cannot be diminished without a total
 annihilation. When you tell me of the thousandth and ten thousandth
 part of a grain of sand, I have a distinct idea of these numbers and of
 their different proportions; but the images, which I form in my mind to
 represent the things themselves, are nothing different from each other,
 nor inferior to that image, by which I represent the grain of sand
 itself, which is supposed so vastly to exceed them. What consists of
 parts is distinguishable into them, and what is distinguishable is
 separable. But whatever we may imagine of the thing, the idea of a grain
 of sand is not distinguishable, nor separable into twenty, much less
 into a thousand, ten thousand, or an infinite number of different ideas.
 
 It is the same case with the impressions of the senses as with the ideas
 of the imagination. Put a spot of ink upon paper, fix your eye upon that
 spot, and retire to such a distance, that, at last you lose sight of it;
 it is plain, that the moment before it vanished the image or impression
 was perfectly indivisible. It is not for want of rays of light striking
 on our eyes, that the minute parts of distant bodies convey not any
 sensible impression; but because they are removed beyond that distance,
 at which their impressions were reduced to a minimum, and were incapable
 of any farther diminution. A microscope or telescope, which renders them
 visible, produces not any new rays of light, but only spreads those,
 which always flowed from them; and by that means both gives parts to
 impressions, which to the naked eye appear simple and uncompounded, and
 advances to a minimum, what was formerly imperceptible.
 
 We may hence discover the error of the common opinion, that the capacity
 of the mind is limited on both sides, and that it is impossible for
 the imagination to form an adequate idea, of what goes beyond a certain
 degree of minuteness as well as of greatness. Nothing can be more
 minute, than some ideas, which we form in the fancy; and images, which
 appear to the senses; since there are ideas and images perfectly simple
 and indivisible. The only defect of our senses is, that they give
 us disproportioned images of things, and represent as minute and
 uncompounded what is really great and composed of a vast number of
 parts. This mistake we are not sensible of: but taking the impressions
 of those minute objects, which appear to the senses, to be equal or
 nearly equal to the objects, and finding by reason, that there are other
 objects vastly more minute, we too hastily conclude, that these are
 inferior to any idea of our imagination or impression of our senses.
 This however is certain, that we can form ideas, which shall be no
 greater than the smallest atom of the animal spirits of an insect a
 thousand times less than a mite: And we ought rather to conclude, that
 the difficulty lies in enlarging our conceptions so much as to form a
 just notion of a mite, or even of an insect a thousand times less than a
 mite. For in order to form a just notion of these animals, we must have
 a distinct idea representing every part of them, which, according to the
 system of infinite divisibility, is utterly impossible, and, recording
 to that of indivisible parts or atoms, is extremely difficult, by reason
 of the vast number and multiplicity of these parts.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. II. OF THE INFINITE DIVISIBILITY OF SPACE AND TIME.
 
 
 Wherever ideas are adequate representations of objects, the relations,
 contradictions and agreements of the ideas are all applicable to the
 objects; and this we may in general observe to be the foundation of all
 human knowledge. But our ideas are adequate representations of the
 most minute parts of extension; and through whatever divisions and
 subdivisions we may suppose these parts to be arrived at, they can never
 become inferior to some ideas, which we form. The plain consequence is,
 that whatever appears impossible and contradictory upon the comparison
 of these ideas, must be really impossible and contradictory, without any
 farther excuse or evasion.
 
 Every thing capable of being infinitely divided contains an infinite
 number of parts; otherwise the division would be stopt short by the
 indivisible parts, which we should immediately arrive at. If therefore
 any finite extension be infinitely divisible, it can be no contradiction
 to suppose, that a finite extension contains an infinite number of
 parts: And vice versa, if it be a contradiction to suppose, that
 a finite extension contains an infinite number of parts, no finite
 extension can be infinitely divisible. But that this latter supposition
 is absurd, I easily convince myself by the consideration of my clear
 ideas. I first take the least idea I can form of a part of extension,
 and being certain that there is nothing more minute than this idea, I
 conclude, that whatever I discover by its means must be a real quality
 of extension. I then repeat this idea once, twice, thrice, &c., and find
 the compound idea of extension, arising from its repetition, always
 to augment, and become double, triple, quadruple, &c., till at last it
 swells up to a considerable bulk, greater or smaller, in proportion as I
 repeat more or less the same idea. When I stop in the addition of parts,
 the idea of extension ceases to augment; and were I to carry on the
 addition in infinitum, I clearly perceive, that the idea of extension
 must also become infinite. Upon the whole, I conclude, that the idea of
 all infinite number of parts is individually the same idea with that of
 an infinite extension; that no finite extension is capable of containing
 an infinite number of parts; and consequently that no finite extension
 is infinitely divisible [Footnote 3.].
 
 
      [Footnote 3. It has been objected to me, that infinite
      divisibility supposes only an infinite number of
      PROPORTIONAL not of ALIQIOT parts, and that an infinite
      number of proportional parts does not form an infinite
      extension. But this distinction is entirely frivolous.
      Whether these parts be calld ALIQUOT or PROPORTIONAL, they
      cannot be inferior to those minute parts we conceive; and
      therefore cannot form a less extension by their
      conjunction.]
 
 I may subjoin another argument proposed by a noted author [Mons.
 MALEZIEU], which seems to me very strong and beautiful. It is evident,
 that existence in itself belongs only to unity, and is never applicable
 to number, but on account of the unites, of which the number is
 composed. Twenty men may be said to exist; but it is only because one,
 two, three, four, &c. are existent, and if you deny the existence of
 the latter, that of the former falls of course. It is therefore utterly
 absurd to suppose any number to exist, and yet deny the existence of
 unites; and as extension is always a number, according to the common
 sentiment of metaphysicians, and never resolves itself into any unite or
 indivisible quantity, it follows, that extension can never at all exist.
 It is in vain to reply, that any determinate quantity of extension is an
 unite; but such-a-one as admits of an infinite number of fractions, and
 is inexhaustible in its sub-divisions. For by the same rule these twenty
 men may be considered as a unit. The whole globe of the earth, nay
 the whole universe, may be considered as a unit. That term of unity
 is merely a fictitious denomination, which the mind may apply to any
 quantity of objects it collects together; nor can such an unity any more
 exist alone than number can, as being in reality a true number. But the
 unity, which can exist alone, and whose existence is necessary to that
 of all number, is of another kind, and must be perfectly indivisible,
 and incapable of being resolved into any lesser unity.
 
 All this reasoning takes place with regard to time; along with an
 additional argument, which it may be proper to take notice of. It is a
 property inseparable from time, and which in a manner constitutes its
 essence, that each of its parts succeeds another, and that none of them,
 however contiguous, can ever be co-existent. For the same reason, that
 the year 1737 cannot concur with the present year 1738 every moment must
 be distinct from, and posterior or antecedent to another. It is certain
 then, that time, as it exists, must be composed of indivisible moments.
 For if in time we could never arrive at an end of division, and if
 each moment, as it succeeds another, were not perfectly single and
 indivisible, there would be an infinite number of co-existent moments,
 or parts of time; which I believe will be allowed to be an arrant
 contradiction.
 
 The infinite divisibility of space implies that of time, as is evident
 from the nature of motion. If the latter, therefore, be impossible, the
 former must be equally so.
 
 I doubt not but, it will readily be allowed by the most obstinate
 defender of the doctrine of infinite divisibility, that these arguments
 are difficulties, and that it is impossible to give any answer to them
 which will be perfectly clear and satisfactory. But here we may
 observe, that nothing can be more absurd, than this custom of calling a
 difficulty what pretends to be a demonstration, and endeavouring by that
 means to elude its force and evidence. It is not in demonstrations as
 in probabilities, that difficulties can take place, and one argument
 counter-ballance another, and diminish its authority. A demonstration,
 if just, admits of no opposite difficulty; and if not just, it is a
 mere sophism, and consequently can never be a difficulty. It is either
 irresistible, or has no manner of force. To talk therefore of objections
 and replies, and ballancing of arguments in such a question as this, is
 to confess, either that human reason is nothing but a play of words, or
 that the person himself, who talks so, has not a Capacity equal to such
 subjects. Demonstrations may be difficult to be comprehended, because of
 abstractedness of the subject; but can never have such difficulties as
 will weaken their authority, when once they are comprehended.
 
 It is true, mathematicians are wont to say, that there are here equally
 strong arguments on the other side of the question, and that the
 doctrine of indivisible points is also liable to unanswerable
 objections. Before I examine these arguments and objections in detail,
 I will here take them in a body, and endeavour by a short and decisive
 reason to prove at once, that it is utterly impossible they can have any
 just foundation.
 
 It is an established maxim in metaphysics, That whatever the mind
 clearly conceives, includes the idea of possible existence, or in other
 words, that nothing we imagine is absolutely impossible. We can form the
 idea of a golden mountain, and from thence conclude that such a mountain
 may actually exist. We can form no idea of a mountain without a valley,
 and therefore regard it as impossible.
 
 Now it is certain we have an idea of extension; for otherwise why do we
 talk and reason concerning it? It is likewise certain that this idea,
 as conceived by the imagination, though divisible into parts or inferior
 ideas, is not infinitely divisible, nor consists of an infinite number
 of parts: For that exceeds the comprehension of our limited capacities.
 Here then is an idea of extension, which consists of parts or inferior
 ideas, that are perfectly, indivisible: consequently this idea implies
 no contradiction: consequently it is possible for extension really to
 exist conformable to it: and consequently all the arguments employed
 against the possibility of mathematical points are mere scholastick
 quibbles, and unworthy of our attention.
 
 These consequences we may carry one step farther, and conclude that all
 the pretended demonstrations for the infinite divisibility of extension
 are equally sophistical; since it is certain these demonstrations cannot
 be just without proving the impossibility of mathematical points; which
 it is an evident absurdity to pretend to.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. III. OF THE OTHER QUALITIES OF OUR IDEA OF SPACE AND TIME.
 
 
 No discovery coued have been made more happily for deciding all
 controversies concerning ideas, than that abovementioned, that
 impressions always take the precedency of them, and that every idea,
 with which the imagination is furnished, first makes its appearance in a
 correspondent impression. These latter perceptions are all so clear and
 evident, that they admit of no controversy; though many of our ideas are
 so obscure, that it is almost impossible even for the mind, which forms
 them, to tell exactly their nature and composition. Let us apply this
 principle, in order to discover farther the nature of our ideas of space
 and time.
 
 Upon opening my eyes, and turning them to the surrounding objects,
 I perceive many visible bodies; and upon shutting them again, and
 considering the distance betwixt these bodies, I acquire the idea of
 extension. As every idea is derived from some impression, which
 is exactly similar to it, the impressions similar to this idea of
 extension, must either be some sensations derived from the sight, or
 some internal impressions arising from these sensations.
 
 Our internal impressions are our passions, emotions, desires and
 aversions; none of which, I believe, will ever be asserted to be the
 model, from which the idea of space is derived. There remains therefore
 nothing but the senses, which can convey to us this original impression.
 Now what impression do oar senses here convey to us? This is the
 principal question, and decides without appeal concerning the nature of
 the idea.
 
 The table before me is alone sufficient by its view to give me the idea
 of extension. This idea, then, is borrowed from, and represents some
 impression, which this moment appears to the senses. But my senses
 convey to me only the impressions of coloured points, disposed in a
 certain manner. If the eye is sensible of any thing farther, I desire
 it may be pointed out to me. But if it be impossible to shew any thing
 farther, we may conclude with certainty, that the idea of extension is
 nothing but a copy of these coloured points, and of the manner of their
 appearance.
 
 Suppose that in the extended object, or composition of coloured points,
 from which we first received the idea of extension, the points were of
 a purple colour; it follows, that in every repetition of that idea we
 would not only place the points in the same order with respect to each
 other, but also bestow on them that precise colour, with which alone we
 are acquainted. But afterwards having experience of the other colours of
 violet, green, red, white, black, and of all the different compositions
 of these, and finding a resemblance in the disposition of coloured
 points, of which they are composed, we omit the peculiarities of
 colour, as far as possible, and found an abstract idea merely on that
 disposition of points, or manner of appearance, in which they agree. Nay
 even when the resemblance is carryed beyond the objects of one sense,
 and the impressions of touch are found to be Similar to those of sight
 in the disposition of their parts; this does not hinder the abstract
 idea from representing both, upon account of their resemblance. All
 abstract ideas are really nothing but particular ones, considered in
 a certain light; but being annexed to general terms, they are able to
 represent a vast variety, and to comprehend objects, which, as they are
 alike in some particulars, are in others vastly wide of each other.
 
 The idea of time, being derived from the succession of our perceptions
 of every kind, ideas as well as impressions, and impressions of
 reflection as well as of sensations will afford us an instance of an
 abstract idea, which comprehends a still greater variety than that of
 space, and yet is represented in the fancy by some particular individual
 idea of a determinate quantity and quality.
 
 As it is from the disposition of visible and tangible objects we receive
 the idea of space, so from the succession of ideas and impressions we
 form the idea of time, nor is it possible for time alone ever to make
 its appearance, or be taken notice of by the mind. A man in a sound
 sleep, or strongly occupyed with one thought, is insensible of time;
 and according as his perceptions succeed each other with greater or
 less rapidity, the same duration appears longer or shorter to his
 imagination. It has been remarked by a great philosopher, that our
 perceptions have certain bounds in this particular, which are fixed by
 the original nature and constitution of the mind, and beyond which no
 influence of external objects on the senses is ever able to hasten or
 retard our thought. If you wheel about a burning coal with rapidity, it
 will present to the senses an image of a circle of fire; nor will there
 seem to be any interval of time betwixt its revolutions; meerly because
 it is impossible for our perceptions to succeed each other with the same
 rapidity, that motion may be communicated to external objects. Wherever
 we have no successive perceptions, we have no notion of time, even
 though there be a real succession in the objects. From these phenomena,
 as well as from many others, we may conclude, that time cannot make
 its appearance to the mind, either alone, or attended with a steady
 unchangeable object, but is always discovered some PERCEIVABLE
 succession of changeable objects.
 
 To confirm this we may add the following argument, which to me seems
 perfectly decisive and convincing. It is evident, that time or duration
 consists of different parts: For otherwise we coued not conceive a
 longer or shorter duration. It is also evident, that these parts are not
 co-existent: For that quality of the co-existence of parts belongs to
 extension, and is what distinguishes it from duration. Now as time is
 composed of parts, that are not coexistent: an unchangeable object,
 since it produces none but coexistent impressions, produces none that
 can give us the idea of time; and consequently that idea must be
 derived from a succession of changeable objects, and time in its first
 appearance can never be severed from such a succession.
 
 Having therefore found, that time in its first appearance to the mind
 is always conjoined with a succession of changeable objects, and that
 otherwise it can never fall under our notice, we must now examine
 whether it can be conceived without our conceiving any succession
 of objects, and whether it can alone form a distinct idea in the
 imagination.
 
 In order to know whether any objects, which are joined in impression,
 be inseparable in idea, we need only consider, if they be different
 from each other; in which case, it is plain they may be conceived apart.
 Every thing, that is different is distinguishable: and everything,
 that is distinguishable, may be separated, according to the maxims
 above-explained. If on the contrary they be not different, they are
 not distinguishable: and if they be not distinguishable, they cannot be
 separated. But this is precisely the case with respect to time, compared
 with our successive perceptions. The idea of time is not derived from a
 particular impression mixed up with others, and plainly distinguishable
 from them; but arises altogether from the manner, in which impressions
 appear to the mind, without making one of the number. Five notes played
 on a flute give us the impression and idea of time; though time be not
 a sixth impression, which presents itself to the hearing or any other of
 the senses. Nor is it a sixth impression, which the mind by reflection
 finds in itself. These five sounds making their appearance in this
 particular manner, excite no emotion in the mind, nor produce an
 affection of any kind, which being observed by it can give rise to a new
 idea. For that is necessary to produce a new idea of reflection, nor can
 the mind, by revolving over a thousand times all its ideas of sensation,
 ever extract from them any new original idea, unless nature has so
 framed its faculties, that it feels some new original impression arise
 from such a contemplation. But here it only takes notice of the manner,
 in which the different sounds make their appearance; and that it may
 afterwards consider without considering these particular sounds, but
 may conjoin it with any other objects. The ideas of some objects it
 certainly must have, nor is it possible for it without these ideas ever
 to arrive at any conception of time; which since it, appears not as any
 primary distinct impression, can plainly be nothing but different
 ideas, or impressions, or objects disposed in a certain manner, that is,
 succeeding each other.
 
 I know there are some who pretend, that the idea of duration
 is applicable in a proper sense to objects, which are perfectly
 unchangeable; and this I take to be the common opinion of philosophers
 as well as of the vulgar. But to be convinced of its falsehood we need
 but reflect on the foregoing conclusion, that the idea of duration is
 always derived from a succession of changeable objects, and can never
 be conveyed to the mind by any thing stedfast and unchangeable. For it
 inevitably follows from thence, that since the idea of duration cannot
 be derived from such an object, it can never-in any propriety or
 exactness be applied to it, nor can any thing unchangeable be ever said
 to have duration. Ideas always represent the Objects or impressions,
 from which they are derived, and can never without a fiction represent
 or be applied to any other. By what fiction we apply the idea of time,
 even to what is unchangeable, and suppose, as is common, that duration
 is a measure of rest as well as of motion, we shall consider [Sect 5.]
 afterwards.
 
 There is another very decisive argument, which establishes the present
 doctrine concerning our ideas of space and time, and is founded only on
 that simple principle, that our ideas of them are compounded of parts,
 which are indivisible. This argument may be worth the examining.
 
 Every idea, that is distinguishable, being also separable, let us take
 one of those simple indivisible ideas, of which the compound one of
 extension is formed, and separating it from all others, and considering
 it apart, let us form a judgment of its nature and qualities.
 
 It is plain it is not the idea of extension. For the idea of extension
 consists of parts; and this idea, according to t-he supposition, is
 perfectly simple and indivisible. Is it therefore nothing? That is
 absolutely impossible. For as the compound idea of extension, which is
 real, is composed of such ideas; were these so many non-entities, there
 would be a real existence composed of non-entities; which is absurd.
 Here therefore I must ask, What is our idea of a simple and indivisible
 point? No wonder if my answer appear somewhat new, since the question
 itself has scarce ever yet been thought of. We are wont to dispute
 concerning the nature of mathematical points, but seldom concerning the
 nature of their ideas.
 
 The idea of space is conveyed to the mind by two senses, the sight
 and touch; nor does anything ever appear extended, that is not either
 visible or tangible. That compound impression, which represents
 extension, consists of several lesser impressions, that are indivisible
 to the eye or feeling, and may be called impressions of atoms or
 corpuscles endowed with colour and solidity. But this is not all. It is
 not only requisite, that these atoms should be coloured or tangible,
 in order to discover themselves to our senses; it is also necessary
 we should preserve the idea of their colour or tangibility in order to
 comprehend them by our imagination. There is nothing but the idea of
 their colour or tangibility, which can render them conceivable by the
 mind. Upon the removal of the ideas of these sensible qualities, they
 are utterly annihilated to the thought or imagination.
 
 Now such as the parts are, such is the whole. If a point be not
 considered as coloured or tangible, it can convey to us no idea; and
 consequently the idea of extension, which is composed of the ideas of
 these points, can never possibly exist. But if the idea of extension
 really can exist, as we are conscious it does, its parts must also
 exist; and in order to that, must be considered as coloured or tangible.
 We have therefore no idea of space or extension, but when we regard it
 as an object either of our sight or feeling.
 
 The same reasoning will prove, that the indivisible moments of time must
 be filled with some real object or existence, whose succession forms the
 duration, and makes it be conceivable by the mind.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. IV. OBJECTIONS ANSWERED.
 
 
 Our system concerning space and time consists of two parts, which
 are intimately connected together. The first depends on this chain of
 reasoning. The capacity of the mind is not infinite; consequently no
 idea of extension or duration consists of an infinite number of parts
 or inferior ideas, but of a finite number, and these simple and
 indivisible: It is therefore possible for space and time to exist
 conformable to this idea: And if it be possible, it is certain they
 actually do exist conformable to it; since their infinite divisibility
 is utterly impossible and contradictory.
 
 The other part of our system is a consequence of this. The parts, into
 which the ideas of space and time resolve themselves, become at last
 indivisible; and these indivisible parts, being nothing in themselves,
 are inconceivable when not filled with something real and existent. The
 ideas of space and time are therefore no separate or distinct ideas, but
 merely those of the manner or order, in which objects exist: Or in
 other words, it is impossible to conceive either a vacuum and extension
 without matter, or a time, when there was no succession or change in any
 real existence. The intimate connexion betwixt these parts of our system
 is the reason why we shall examine together the objections, which have
 been urged against both of them, beginning with those against the finite
 divisibility of extension.
 
 I. The first of these objections, which I shall take notice of, is more
 proper to prove this connexion and dependence of the one part upon the
 other, than to destroy either of them. It has often been maintained in
 the schools, that extension must be divisible, in infinitum, because
 the system of mathematical points is absurd; and that system is absurd,
 because a mathematical point is a non-entity, and consequently can never
 by its conjunction with others form a real existence. This would
 be perfectly decisive, were there no medium betwixt the infinite
 divisibility of matter, and the non-entity of mathematical points. But
 there is evidently a medium, viz. the bestowing a colour or solidity on
 these points; and the absurdity of both the extremes is a demonstration
 of the truth and reality of this medium. The system of physical points,
 which is another medium, is too absurd to need a refutation. A real
 extension, such as a physical point is supposed to be, can never exist
 without parts, different from each other; and wherever objects are
 different, they are distinguishable and separable by the imagination.
 
 II. The second objection is derived from the necessity there would be of
 PENETRATION, if extension consisted of mathematical points. A simple and
 indivisible atom, that touches another, must necessarily penetrate it;
 for it is impossible it can touch it by its external parts, from the
 very supposition of its perfect simplicity, which excludes all parts. It
 must therefore touch it intimately, and in its whole essence, SECUNDUM
 SE, TOTA, ET TOTALITER; which is the very definition of penetration.
 But penetration is impossible: Mathematical points are of consequence
 equally impossible.
 
 I answer this objection by substituting a juster idea of penetration.
 Suppose two bodies containing no void within their circumference, to
 approach each other, and to unite in such a manner that the body, which
 results from their union, is no more extended than either of them; it
 is this we must mean when we talk of penetration. But it is evident this
 penetration is nothing but the annihilation of one of these bodies, and
 the preservation of the other, without our being able to distinguish
 particularly which is preserved and which annihilated. Before the
 approach we have the idea of two bodies. After it we have the idea
 only of one. It is impossible for the mind to preserve any notion of
 difference betwixt two bodies of the same nature existing in the same
 place at the same time.
 
 Taking then penetration in this sense, for the annihilation of one body
 upon its approach to another, I ask any one, if he sees a necessity,
 that a coloured or tangible point should be annihilated upon the
 approach of another coloured or tangible point? On the contrary, does
 he not evidently perceive, that from the union of these points there
 results an object, which is compounded and divisible, and may be
 distinguished into two parts, of which each preserves its existence
 distinct and separate, notwithstanding its contiguity to the other? Let
 him aid his fancy by conceiving these points to be of different colours,
 the better to prevent their coalition and confusion. A blue and a red
 point may surely lie contiguous without any penetration or annihilation.
 For if they cannot, what possibly can become of them? Whether shall the
 red or the blue be annihilated? Or if these colours unite into one, what
 new colour will they produce by their union?
 
 What chiefly gives rise to these objections, and at the same time
 renders it so difficult to give a satisfactory answer to them, is the
 natural infirmity and unsteadiness both of our imagination and senses,
 when employed on such minute objects. Put a spot of ink upon paper, and
 retire to such a distance, that the spot becomes altogether invisible;
 you will find, that upon your return and nearer approach the spot
 first becomes visible by short intervals; and afterwards becomes always
 visible; and afterwards acquires only a new force in its colouring
 without augmenting its bulk; and afterwards, when it has encreased to
 such a degree as to be really extended, it is still difficult for
 the imagination to break it into its component parts, because of the
 uneasiness it finds in the conception of such a minute object as a
 single point. This infirmity affects most of our reasonings on the
 present subject, and makes it almost impossible to answer in an
 intelligible manner, and in proper expressions, many questions which may
 arise concerning it.
 
 III. There have been many objections drawn from the mathematics against
 the indivisibility of the parts of extension: though at first sight that
 science seems rather favourable to the present doctrine; and if it
 be contrary in its DEMONSTRATIONS, it is perfectly conformable in its
 definitions. My present business then must be to defend the definitions,
 and refute the demonstrations.
 
 A surface is DEFINed to be length and breadth without depth: A line
 to be length without breadth or depth: A point to be what has neither
 length, breadth nor depth. It is evident that all this is perfectly
 unintelligible upon any other supposition than that of the composition
 of extension by indivisible points or atoms. How else coued any thing
 exist without length, without breadth, or without depth?
 
 Two different answers, I find, have been made to this argument; neither
 of which is in my opinion satisfactory. The first is, that the objects
 of geometry, those surfaces, lines and points, whose proportions and
 positions it examines, are mere ideas in the mind; I and not only never
 did, but never can exist in nature. They never did exist; for no one
 will pretend to draw a line or make a surface entirely conformable to
 the definition: They never can exist; for we may produce demonstrations
 from these very ideas to prove, that they are impossible.
 
 But can anything be imagined more absurd and contradictory than this
 reasoning? Whatever can be conceived by a clear and distinct idea
 necessarily implies the possibility of existence; and he who pretends
 to prove the impossibility of its existence by any argument derived from
 the clear idea, in reality asserts, that we have no clear idea of
 it, because we have a clear idea. It is in vain to search for a
 contradiction in any thing that is distinctly conceived by the mind. Did
 it imply any contradiction, it is impossible it coued ever be conceived.
 
 There is therefore no medium betwixt allowing at least the possibility
 of indivisible points, and denying their idea; and it is on this latter
 principle, that the second answer to the foregoing argument is founded.
 It has been pretended [L'Art de penser.], that though it be impossible
 to conceive a length without any breadth, yet by an abstraction without
 a separation, we can consider the one without regarding the other; in
 the same manner as we may think of the length of the way betwixt two
 towns, and overlook its breadth. The length is inseparable from the
 breadth both in nature and in our minds; but this excludes not a partial
 consideration, and a distinction of reason, after the manner above
 explained.
 
 In refuting this answer I shall not insist on the argument, which I have
 already sufficiently explained, that if it be impossible for the mind
 to arrive at a minimum in its ideas, its capacity must be infinite, in
 order to comprehend the infinite number of parts, of which its idea of
 any extension would be composed. I shall here endeavour to find some new
 absurdities in this reasoning.
 
 A surface terminates a solid; a line terminates a surface; a point
 terminates a line; but I assert, that if the ideas of a point, line or
 surface were not indivisible, it is impossible we should ever conceive
 these terminations: For let these ideas be supposed infinitely
 divisible; and then let the fancy endeavour to fix itself on the idea of
 the last surface, line or point; it immediately finds this idea to break
 into parts; and upon its seizing the last of these parts, it loses its
 hold by a new division, and so on in infinitum, without any possibility
 of its arriving at a concluding idea. The number of fractions bring
 it no nearer the last division, than the first idea it formed. Every
 particle eludes the grasp by a new fraction; like quicksilver, when we
 endeavour to seize it. But as in fact there must be something, which
 terminates the idea of every finite quantity; and as this terminating
 idea cannot itself consist of parts or inferior ideas; otherwise it
 would be the last of its parts, which finished the idea, and so on; this
 is a clear proof, that the ideas of surfaces, lines and points admit
 not of any division; those of surfaces in depth; of lines in breadth and
 depth; and of points in any dimension.
 
 The school were so sensible of the force of this argument, that some of
 them maintained, that nature has mixed among those particles of matter,
 which are divisible in infinitum, a number of mathematical points, in
 order to give a termination to bodies; and others eluded the force of
 this reasoning by a heap of unintelligible cavils and distinctions. Both
 these adversaries equally yield the victory. A man who hides himself,
 confesses as evidently the superiority of his enemy, as another, who
 fairly delivers his arms.
 
 Thus it appears, that the definitions of mathematics destroy the
 pretended demonstrations; and that if we have the idea of indivisible
 points, lines and surfaces conformable to the definition, their
 existence is certainly possible: but if we have no such idea, it is
 impossible we can ever conceive the termination of any figure; without
 which conception there can be no geometrical demonstration.
 
 But I go farther, and maintain, that none of these demonstrations
 can have sufficient weight to establish such a principle, as this of
 infinite divisibility; and that because with regard to such minute
 objects, they are not properly demonstrations, being built on ideas,
 which are not exact, and maxims, which are not precisely true. When
 geometry decides anything concerning the proportions of quantity, we
 ought not to look for the utmost precision and exactness. None of its
 proofs extend so far. It takes the dimensions and proportions of
 figures justly; but roughly, and with some liberty. Its errors are never
 considerable; nor would it err at all, did it not aspire to such an
 absolute perfection.
 
 I first ask mathematicians, what they mean when they say one line or
 surface is EQUAL to, or GREATER or LESS than another? Let any of them
 give an answer, to whatever sect he belongs, and whether he maintains
 the composition of extension by indivisible points, or by quantities
 divisible in infinitum. This question will embarrass both of them.
 
 There are few or no mathematicians, who defend the hypothesis of
 indivisible points; and yet these have the readiest and justest answer
 to the present question. They need only reply, that lines or surfaces
 are equal, when the numbers of points in each are equal; and that as
 the proportion of the numbers varies, the proportion of the lines and
 surfaces is also varyed. But though this answer be just, as well as
 obvious; yet I may affirm, that this standard of equality is entirely
 useless, and that it never is from such a comparison we determine
 objects to be equal or unequal with respect to each other. For as the
 points, which enter into the composition of any line or surface, whether
 perceived by the sight or touch, are so minute and so confounded with
 each other, that it is utterly impossible for the mind to compute their
 number, such a computation will Never afford us a standard by which we
 may judge of proportions. No one will ever be able to determine by an
 exact numeration, that an inch has fewer points than a foot, or a foot
 fewer than an ell or any greater measure: for which reason we seldom or
 never consider this as the standard of equality or inequality.
 
 As to those, who imagine, that extension is divisible in infinitum, it
 is impossible they can make use of this answer, or fix the equality of
 any line or surface by a numeration of its component parts. For since,
 according to their hypothesis, the least as well as greatest figures
 contain an infinite number of parts; and since infinite numbers,
 properly speaking, can neither be equal nor unequal with respect to each
 other; the equality or inequality of any portions of space can never
 depend on any proportion in the number of their parts. It is true, it
 may be said, that the inequality of an ell and a yard consists in the
 different numbers of the feet, of which they are composed; and that of
 a foot and a yard in the number of the inches. But as that quantity we
 call an inch in the one is supposed equal to what we call an inch in
 the other, and as it is impossible for the mind to find this equality by
 proceeding in infinitum with these references to inferior quantities: it
 is evident, that at last we must fix some standard of equality different
 from an enumeration of the parts.
 
 There are some [See Dr. Barrow's mathematical lectures.], who pretend,
 that equality is best defined by congruity, and that any two figures
 are equal, when upon the placing of one upon the other, all their parts
 correspond to and touch each other. In order to judge of this definition
 let us consider, that since equality is a relation, it is not, strictly
 speaking, a property in the figures themselves, but arises merely from
 the comparison, which the mind makes betwixt them. If it consists,
 therefore, in this imaginary application and mutual contact of parts, we
 must at least have a distinct notion of these parts, and must conceive
 their contact. Now it is plain, that in this conception we would run up
 these parts to the greatest minuteness, which can possibly be conceived;
 since the contact of large parts would never render the figures equal.
 But the minutest parts we can conceive are mathematical points; and
 consequently this standard of equality is the same with that derived
 from the equality of the number of points; which we have already
 determined to be a just but an useless standard. We must therefore look
 to some other quarter for a solution of the present difficulty.
 
 There are many philosophers, who refuse to assign any standard of
 equality, but assert, that it is sufficient to present two objects, that
 are equal, in order to give us a just notion of this proportion. All
 definitions, say they, are fruitless, without the perception of such
 objects; and where we perceive such objects, we no longer stand in need
 of any definition. To this reasoning, I entirely agree; and assert, that
 the only useful notion of equality, or inequality, is derived from the
 whole united appearance and the comparison of particular objects.
 
 It is evident, that the eye, or rather the mind is often able at one
 view to determine the proportions of bodies, and pronounce them equal
 to, or greater or less than each other, without examining or comparing
 the number of their minute parts. Such judgments are not only common,
 but in many cases certain and infallible. When the measure of a yard and
 that of a foot are presented, the mind can no more question, that the
 first is longer than the second, than it can doubt of those principles,
 which are the most clear and self-evident.
 
 There are therefore three proportions, which the mind distinguishes
 in the general appearance of its objects, and calls by the names of
 greater, less and equal. But though its decisions concerning these
 proportions be sometimes infallible, they are not always so; nor are our
 judgments of this kind more exempt from doubt and error than those on
 any other subject. We frequently correct our first opinion by a review
 and reflection; and pronounce those objects to be equal, which at first
 we esteemed unequal; and regard an object as less, though before it
 appeared greater than another. Nor is this the only correction, which
 these judgments of our senses undergo; but we often discover our error
 by a juxtaposition of the objects; or where that is impracticable, by
 the use of some common and invariable measure, which being successively
 applied to each, informs us of their different proportions. And even
 this correction is susceptible of a new correction, and of different
 degrees of exactness, according to the nature of the instrument,
 by which we measure the bodies, and the care which we employ in the
 comparison.
 
 When therefore the mind is accustomed to these judgments and their
 corrections, and finds that the same proportion which makes two figures
 have in the eye that appearance, which we call equality, makes them also
 correspond to each other, and to any common measure, with which they
 are compared, we form a mixed notion of equality derived both from the
 looser and stricter methods of comparison. But we are not content with
 this. For as sound reason convinces us that there are bodies vastly more
 minute than those, which appear to the senses; and as a false reason
 would perswade us, that there are bodies infinitely more minute; we
 clearly perceive, that we are not possessed of any instrument or art of
 measuring, which can secure us from ill error and uncertainty. We are
 sensible, that the addition or removal of one of these minute parts,
 is not discernible either in the appearance or measuring; and as we
 imagine, that two figures, which were equal before, cannot be equal
 after this removal or addition, we therefore suppose some imaginary
 standard of equality, by which the appearances and measuring are exactly
 corrected, and the figures reduced entirely to that proportion. This
 standard is plainly imaginary. For as the very idea of equality is that
 of such a particular appearance corrected by juxtaposition or a common
 measure. The notion of any correction beyond what we have instruments
 and art to make, is a mere fiction of the mind, and useless as well
 as incomprehensible. But though this standard be only imaginary, the
 fiction however is very natural; nor is anything more usual, than for
 the mind to proceed after this manner with any action, even after the
 reason has ceased, which first determined it to begin. This appears very
 conspicuously with regard to time; where though it is evident we have no
 exact method of determining the proportions of parts, not even so exact
 as in extension, yet the various corrections of our measures, and their
 different degrees of exactness, have given as an obscure and implicit
 notion of a perfect and entire equality. The case is the same in many
 other subjects. A musician finding his ear becoming every day more
 delicate, and correcting himself by reflection and attention, proceeds
 with the same act of the mind, even when the subject fails him, and
 entertains a notion of a compleat TIERCE or OCTAVE, without being able
 to tell whence he derives his standard. A painter forms the same fiction
 with regard to colours. A mechanic with regard to motion. To the one
 light and shade; to the other swift and slow are imagined to be capable
 of an exact comparison and equality beyond the judgments of the senses.
 
 We may apply the same reasoning to CURVE and RIGHT lines. Nothing is
 more apparent to the senses, than the distinction betwixt a curve and a
 right line; nor are there any ideas we more easily form than the ideas
 of these objects. But however easily we may form these ideas, it is
 impossible to produce any definition of them, which will fix the precise
 boundaries betwixt them. When we draw lines upon paper, or any continued
 surface, there is a certain order, by which the lines run along from one
 point to another, that they may produce the entire impression of a
 curve or right line; but this order is perfectly unknown, and nothing
 is observed but the united appearance. Thus even upon the system of
 indivisible points, we can only form a distant notion of some unknown
 standard to these objects. Upon that of infinite divisibility we cannot
 go even this length; but are reduced meerly to the general appearance,
 as the rule by which we determine lines to be either curve or right
 ones. But though we can give no perfect definition of these lines, nor
 produce any very exact method of distinguishing the one from the other;
 yet this hinders us not from correcting the first appearance by a more
 accurate consideration, and by a comparison with some rule, of whose
 rectitude from repeated trials we have a greater assurance. And it is
 from these corrections, and by carrying on the same action of the mind,
 even when its reason fails us, that we form the loose idea of a perfect
 standard to these figures, without being able to explain or comprehend
 it.
 
 It is true, mathematicians pretend they give an exact definition of a
 right line, when they say, it is the shortest way betwixt two points.
 But in the first place I observe, that this is more properly the
 discovery of one of the properties of a right line, than a just
 deflation of it. For I ask any one, if upon mention of a right line he
 thinks not immediately on such a particular appearance, and if it is not
 by accident only that he considers this property? A right line can be
 comprehended alone; but this definition is unintelligible without a
 comparison with other lines, which we conceive to be more extended. In
 common life it is established as a maxim, that the straightest way is
 always the shortest; which would be as absurd as to say, the shortest
 way is always the shortest, if our idea of a right line was not
 different from that of the shortest way betwixt two points.
 
 Secondly, I repeat what I have already established, that we have no
 precise idea of equality and inequality, shorter and longer, more than
 of a right line or a curve; and consequently that the one can never
 afford us a perfect standard for the other. An exact idea can never be
 built on such as are loose and undetermined.
 
 The idea of a plain surface is as little susceptible of a precise
 standard as that of a right line; nor have we any other means of
 distinguishing such a surface, than its general appearance. It is in
 vain, that mathematicians represent a plain surface as produced by the
 flowing of a right line. It will immediately be objected, that our idea
 of a surface is as independent of this method of forming a surface, as
 our idea of an ellipse is of that of a cone; that the idea of a right
 line is no more precise than that of a plain surface; that a right line
 may flow irregularly, and by that means form a figure quite different
 from a plane; and that therefore we must suppose it to flow along two
 right lines, parallel to each other, and on the same plane; which is a
 description, that explains a thing by itself, and returns in a circle.
 
 It appears, then, that the ideas which are most essential to geometry,
 viz. those of equality and inequality, of a right line and a plain
 surface, are far from being exact and determinate, according to our
 common method of conceiving them. Not only we are incapable of telling,
 if the case be in any degree doubtful, when such particular figures are
 equal; when such a line is a right one, and such a surface a plain one;
 but we can form no idea of that proportion, or of these figures, which
 is firm and invariable. Our appeal is still to the weak and fallible
 judgment, which we make from the appearance of the objects, and correct
 by a compass or common measure; and if we join the supposition of
 any farther correction, it is of such-a-one as is either useless or
 imaginary. In vain should we have recourse to the common topic, and
 employ the supposition of a deity, whose omnipotence may enable him to
 form a perfect geometrical figure, and describe a right line without any
 curve or inflexion. As the ultimate standard of these figures is derived
 from nothing but the senses and imagination, it is absurd to talk of
 any perfection beyond what these faculties can judge of; since the true
 perfection of any thing consists in its conformity to its standard.
 
 Now since these ideas are so loose and uncertain, I would fain ask any
 mathematician what infallible assurance he has, not only of the more
 intricate, and obscure propositions of his science, but of the most
 vulgar and obvious principles? How can he prove to me, for instance,
 that two right lines cannot have one common segment? Or that it is
 impossible to draw more than one right line betwixt any two points?
 should he tell me, that these opinions are obviously absurd, and
 repugnant to our clear ideas; I would answer, that I do not deny, where
 two right lines incline upon each other with a sensible angle, but it is
 absurd to imagine them to have a common segment. But supposing these two
 lines to approach at the rate of an inch in twenty leagues, I perceive
 no absurdity in asserting, that upon their contact they become one. For,
 I beseech you, by what rule or standard do you judge, when you assert,
 that the line, in which I have supposed them to concur, cannot make
 the same right line with those two, that form so small an angle betwixt
 them? You must surely have some idea of a right line, to which this line
 does not agree. Do you therefore mean that it takes not the points in
 the same order and by the same rule, as is peculiar and essential to a
 right line? If so, I must inform you, that besides that in judging after
 this manner you allow, that extension is composed of indivisible points
 (which, perhaps, is more than you intend) besides this, I say, I must
 inform you, that neither is this the standard from which we form the
 idea of a right line; nor, if it were, is there any such firmness in our
 senses or imagination, as to determine when such an order is violated or
 preserved. The original standard of a right line is in reality nothing
 but a certain general appearance; and it is evident right lines may be
 made to concur with each other, and yet correspond to this standard,
 though corrected by all the means either practicable or imaginable.
 
 To whatever side mathematicians turn, this dilemma still meets them.
 If they judge of equality, or any other proportion, by the accurate and
 exact standard, viz. the enumeration of the minute indivisible parts,
 they both employ a standard, which is useless in practice, and actually
 establish the indivisibility of extension, which they endeavour to
 explode. Or if they employ, as is usual, the inaccurate standard,
 derived from a comparison of objects, upon their general appearance,
 corrected by measuring and juxtaposition; their first principles,
 though certain and infallible, are too coarse to afford any such subtile
 inferences as they commonly draw from them. The first principles are
 founded on the imagination and senses: The conclusion, therefore, can
 never go beyond, much less contradict these faculties.
 
 This may open our eyes a little, and let us see, that no geometrical
 demonstration for the infinite divisibility of extension can have so
 much force as what we naturally attribute to every argument, which is
 supported by such magnificent pretensions. At the same time we may learn
 the reason, why geometry falls of evidence in this single point, while
 all its other reasonings command our fullest assent and approbation.
 And indeed it seems more requisite to give the reason of this exception,
 than to shew, that we really must make such an exception, and regard
 all the mathematical arguments for infinite divisibility as utterly
 sophistical. For it is evident, that as no idea of quantity is
 infinitely divisible, there cannot be imagined a more glaring absurdity,
 than to endeavour to prove, that quantity itself admits of such a
 division; and to prove this by means of ideas, which are directly
 opposite in that particular. And as this absurdity is very glaring in
 itself, so there is no argument founded on it which is not attended
 with a new absurdity, and involves not an evident contradiction.
 
 I might give as instances those arguments for infinite divisibility,
 which are derived from the point of contact. I know there is no
 mathematician, who will not refuse to be judged by the diagrams he
 describes upon paper, these being loose draughts, as he will tell us,
 and serving only to convey with greater facility certain ideas, which
 are the true foundation of all our reasoning. This I am satisfyed with,
 and am willing to rest the controversy merely upon these ideas. I desire
 therefore our mathematician to form, as accurately as possible,
 the ideas of a circle and a right line; and I then ask, if upon the
 conception of their contact he can conceive them as touching in a
 mathematical point, or if he must necessarily imagine them to concur
 for some space. Whichever side he chuses, he runs himself into equal
 difficulties. If he affirms, that in tracing these figures in his
 imagination, he can imagine them to touch only in a point, he allows
 the possibility of that idea, and consequently of the thing. If he says,
 that in his conception of the contact of those lines he must make
 them concur, he thereby acknowledges the fallacy of geometrical
 demonstrations, when carryed beyond a certain degree of minuteness;
 since it is certain he has such demonstrations against the concurrence
 of a circle and a right line; that is, in other words, he can prove an
 idea, viz. that of concurrence, to be INCOMPATIBLE with two other
 ideas, those of a circle and right line; though at the same time he
 acknowledges these ideas to be inseparable.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. V. THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.
 
 
 If the second part of my system be true, that the idea of space
 or extension is nothing but the idea of visible or tangible points
 distributed in a certain order; it follows, that we can form no idea
 of a vacuum, or space, where there is nothing visible or tangible. This
 gives rise to three objections, which I shall examine together, because
 the answer I shall give to one is a consequence of that which I shall
 make use of for the others.
 
 First, It may be said, that men have disputed for many ages concerning
 a vacuum and a plenum, without being able to bring the affair to a
 final decision; and philosophers, even at this day, think themselves
 at liberty to take part on either side, as their fancy leads them. But
 whatever foundation there may be for a controversy concerning the things
 themselves, it may be pretended, that the very dispute is decisive
 concerning the idea, and that it is impossible men coued so long reason
 about a vacuum, and either refute or defend it, without having a notion
 of what they refuted or defended.
 
 Secondly, If this argument should be contested, the reality or at least
 the possibility of the idea of a vacuum may be proved by the following
 reasoning. Every idea is possible, which is a necessary and infallible
 consequence of such as are possible. Now though we allow the world to be
 at present a plenum, we may easily conceive it to be deprived of motion;
 and this idea will certainly be allowed possible. It must also be
 allowed possible, to conceive the annihilation of any part of matter by
 the omnipotence of the deity, while the other parts remain at rest. For
 as every idea, that is distinguishable, is separable by the imagination;
 and as every idea, that is separable by the imagination, may be
 conceived to be separately existent; it is evident, that the existence
 of one particle of matter, no more implies the existence of another,
 than a square figure in one body implies a square figure in every one.
 This being granted, I now demand what results from the concurrence of
 these two possible ideas of rest and annihilation, and what must we
 conceive to follow upon the annihilation of all the air and subtile
 matter in the chamber, supposing the walls to remain the same, without
 any motion or alteration? There are some metaphysicians, who answer,
 that since matter and extension are the same, the annihilation of one
 necessarily implies that of the other; and there being now no distance
 betwixt the walls of the chamber, they touch each other; in the same
 manner as my hand touches the paper, which is immediately before me.
 But though this answer be very common, I defy these metaphysicians to
 conceive the matter according to their hypothesis, or imagine the floor
 and roof, with all the opposite sides of the chamber, to touch each
 other, while they continue in rest, and preserve the same position. For
 how can the two walls, that run from south to north, touch each other,
 while they touch the opposite ends of two walls, that run from east
 to west? And how can the floor and roof ever meet, while they are
 separated by the four walls, that lie in a contrary position? If you
 change their position, you suppose a motion. If you conceive any thing
 betwixt them, you suppose a new creation. But keeping strictly to the
 two ideas of rest and annihilation, it is evident, that the idea, which
 results from them, is not that of a contact of parts, but something
 else; which is concluded to be the idea of a vacuum.
 
 The third objection carries the matter still farther, and not only
 asserts, that the idea of a vacuum is real and possible, but also
 necessary and unavoidable. This assertion is founded on the motion we
 observe in bodies, which, it is maintained, would be impossible and
 inconceivable without a vacuum, into which one body must move in order
 to make way for another.. I shall not enlarge upon this objection,
 because it principally belongs to natural philosophy, which lies without
 our present sphere.
 
 In order to answer these objections, we must take the matter pretty
 deep, and consider the nature and origin of several ideas, lest we
 dispute without understanding perfectly the subject of the controversy.
 It is evident the idea of darkness is no positive idea, but merely the
 negation of light, or more properly speaking, of coloured and visible
 objects. A man, who enjoys his sight, receives no other perception from
 turning his eyes on every side, when entirely deprived of light, than
 what is common to him with one born blind; and it is certain such-a-one
 has no idea either of light or darkness. The consequence of this is,
 that it is not from the mere removal of visible objects we receive
 the impression of extension without matter; and that the idea of utter
 darkness can never be the same with that of vacuum.
 
 Suppose again a man to be supported in the air, and to be softly
 conveyed along by some invisible power; it is evident he is sensible of
 nothing, and never receives the idea of extension, nor indeed any idea,
 from this invariable motion. Even supposing he moves his limbs to
 and fro, this cannot convey to him that idea. He feels in that case a
 certain sensation or impression, the parts of which are successive to
 each other, and may give him the idea of time: But certainly are not
 disposed in such a manner, as is necessary to convey the idea of space
 or the idea of space or extension.
 
 Since then it appears, that darkness and motion, with the utter removal
 of every thing visible and tangible, can never give us the idea of
 extension without matter, or of a vacuum; the next question is, whether
 they can convey this idea, when mixed with something visible and
 tangible?
 
 It is commonly allowed by philosophers, that all bodies, which discover
 themselves to the eye, appear as if painted on a plain surface, and that
 their different degrees of remoteness from ourselves are discovered
 more by reason than by the senses. When I hold up my hand before me, and
 spread my fingers, they are separated as perfectly by the blue colour
 of the firmament, as they coued be by any visible object, which I coued
 place betwixt them. In order, therefore, to know whether the sight can
 convey the impression and idea of a vacuum, we must suppose, that amidst
 an entire darkness, there are luminous bodies presented to us, whose
 light discovers only these bodies themselves, without giving us any
 impression of the surrounding objects.
 
 We must form a parallel supposition concerning the objects of our
 feeling. It is not proper to suppose a perfect removal of all tangible
 objects: we must allow something to be perceived by the feeling; and
 after an interval and motion of the hand or other organ of sensation,
 another object of the touch to be met with; and upon leaving that,
 another; and so on, as often as we please. The question is, whether
 these intervals do not afford us the idea of extension without body?
 
 To begin with the first case; it is evident, that when only two luminous
 bodies appear to the eye, we can perceive, whether they be conjoined or
 separate: whether they be separated by a great or small distance; and if
 this distance varies, we can perceive its increase or diminution, with
 the motion of the bodies. But as the distance is not in this case any
 thing coloured or visible, it may be thought that there is here a vacuum
 or pure extension, not only intelligible to the mind, but obvious to the
 very senses.
 
 This is our natural and most familiar way of thinking; but which we
 shall learn to correct by a little reflection. We may observe, that
 when two bodies present themselves, where there was formerly an entire
 darkness, the only change, that is discoverable, is in the appearance
 of these two objects, and that all the rest continues to be as before, a
 perfect negation of light, and of every coloured or visible object. This
 is not only true of what may be said to be remote from these bodies, but
 also of the very distance; which is interposed betwixt them; that being
 nothing but darkness, or the negation of light; without parts, without
 composition, invariable and indivisible. Now since this distance causes
 no perception different from what a blind man receives from his eyes, or
 what is conveyed to us in the darkest night, it must partake of the
 same properties: And as blindness and darkness afford us no ideas of
 extension, it is impossible that the dark and undistinguishable distance
 betwixt two bodies can ever produce that idea.
 
 The sole difference betwixt an absolute darkness and the appearance of
 two or more visible luminous objects consists, as I said, in the objects
 themselves, and in the manner they affect our senses. The angles, which
 the rays of light flowing from them, form with each other; the motion
 that is required in the eye, in its passage from one to the other; and
 the different parts of the organs, which are affected by them; these
 produce the only perceptions, from which we can judge of the distance.
 But as these perceptions are each of them simple and indivisible, they
 can never give us the idea of extension.
 
 We may illustrate this by considering the sense of feeling, and the
 imaginary distance or interval interposed betwixt tangible or solid
 objects. I suppose two cases, viz. that of a man supported in the air,
 and moving his limbs to and fro, without meeting any thing tangible; and
 that of a man, who feeling something tangible, leaves it, and after a
 motion, of which he is sensible, perceives another tangible object; and
 I then ask, wherein consists the difference betwixt these two cases?
 No one will make any scruple to affirm, that it consists meerly in the
 perceiving those objects, and that the sensation, which arises from the
 motion, is in both cases the same: And as that sensation is not capable
 of conveying to us an idea of extension, when unaccompanyed with some
 other perception, it can no more give us that idea, when mixed with
 the impressions of tangible objects; since that mixture produces no
 alteration upon it.
 
 But though motion and darkness, either alone, or attended with tangible
 and visible objects, convey no idea of a vacuum or extension without
 matter, yet they are the causes why we falsly imagine we can form such
 an idea. For there is a close relation betwixt that motion and darkness,
 and a real extension, or composition of visible and tangible objects.
 
 First, We may observe, that two visible objects appearing in the midst
 of utter darkness, affect the senses in the same manner, and form the
 same angle by the rays, which flow from them, and meet in the eye, as if
 the distance betwixt them were find with visible objects, that give us
 a true idea of extension. The sensation of motion is likewise the same,
 when there is nothing tangible interposed betwixt two bodies, as when
 we feel a compounded body, whose different parts are placed beyond each
 other.
 
 Secondly, We find by experience, that two bodies, which are so placed
 as to affect the senses in the same manner with two others, that have a
 certain extent of visible objects interposed betwixt them, are
 capable of receiving the same extent, without any sensible impulse or
 penetration, and without any change on that angle, under which they
 appear to the senses. In like manner, where there is one object, which
 we cannot feel after another without an interval, and the perceiving
 of that sensation we call motion in our hand or organ of sensation;
 experience shews us, that it is possible the same object may be felt
 with the same sensation of motion, along with the interposed impression
 of solid and tangible objects, attending the sensation. That is, in
 other words, an invisible and intangible distance may be converted into
 a visible and tangible one, without any change on the distant objects.
 
 Thirdly, We may observe, as another relation betwixt these two kinds
 of distance, that they have nearly the same effects on every natural
 phaenomenon. For as all qualities, such as heat, cold, light,
 attraction, &c. diminish in proportion to the distance; there is but
 little difference observed, whether this distance be marled out by
 compounded and sensible objects, or be known only by the manner, in
 which the distant objects affect the senses.
 
 Here then are three relations betwixt that distance, which conveys the
 idea of extension, and that other, which is not filled with any coloured
 or solid object. The distant objects affect the senses in the same
 manner, whether separated by the one distance or the other; the second
 species of distance is found capable of receiving the first; and they
 both equally diminish the force of every quality.
 
 These relations betwixt the two kinds of distance will afford us an easy
 reason, why the one has so often been taken for the other, and why we
 imagine we have an idea of extension without the idea of any object
 either of the sight or feeling. For we may establish it as a general
 maxim in this science of human nature, that wherever there is a close
 relation betwixt two ideas, the mind is very apt to mistake them, and
 in all its discourses and reasonings to use the one for the other. This
 phaenomenon occurs on so many occasions, and is of such consequence,
 that I cannot forbear stopping a moment to examine its causes. I shall
 only premise, that we must distinguish exactly betwixt the phaenomenon
 itself, and the causes, which I shall assign for it; and must not
 imagine from any uncertainty in the latter, that the former is also
 uncertain. The phaenomenon may be real, though my explication be
 chimerical. The falshood of the one is no consequence of that of the
 other; though at the same time we may observe, that it is very natural
 for us to draw such a consequence; which is an evident instance of that
 very principle, which I endeavour to explain.
 
 When I received the relations of resemblance, contiguity and causation,
 as principles of union among ideas, without examining into their causes,
 it was more in prosecution of my first maxim, that we must in the end
 rest contented with experience, than for want of something specious and
 plausible, which I might have displayed on that subject. It would have
 been easy to have made an imaginary dissection of the brain, and have
 shewn, why upon our conception of any idea, the animal spirits run
 into all the contiguous traces, and rouze up the other ideas, that are
 related to it. But though I have neglected any advantage, which I might
 have drawn from this topic in explaining the relations of ideas, I am
 afraid I must here have recourse to it, in order to account for the
 mistakes that arise from these relations. I shall therefore observe,
 that as the mind is endowed with a power of exciting any idea it
 pleases; whenever it dispatches the spirits into that region of the
 brain, in which the idea is placed; these spirits always excite the
 idea, when they run precisely into the proper traces, and rummage that
 cell, which belongs to the idea. But as their motion is seldom direct,
 and naturally turns a little to the one side or the other; for this
 reason the animal spirits, falling into the contiguous traces, present
 other related ideas in lieu of that, which the mind desired at first to
 survey. This change we are not always sensible of; but continuing
 still the same train of thought, make use of the related idea, which is
 presented to us, and employ it in our reasoning, as if it were the same
 with what we demanded. This is the cause of many mistakes and sophisms
 in philosophy; as will naturally be imagined, and as it would be easy to
 show, if there was occasion.
 
 Of the three relations above-mentioned that of resemblance is the most
 fertile source of error; and indeed there are few mistakes in reasoning,
 which do not borrow largely from that origin. Resembling ideas are not
 only related together, but the actions of the mind, which we employ
 in considering them, are so little different, that we are not able to
 distinguish them. This last circumstance is of great consequence, and we
 may in general observe, that wherever the actions of the mind in forming
 any two ideas are the same or resembling, we are very apt to confound
 these ideas, and take the one for the other. Of this we shall see many
 instances in the progress of this treatise. But though resemblance be
 the relation, which most readily produces a mistake in ideas, yet
 the others of causation and contiguity may also concur in the same
 influence. We might produce the figures of poets and orators, as
 sufficient proofs of this, were it as usual, as it is reasonable, in
 metaphysical subjects to draw our arguments from that quarter. But lest
 metaphysicians should esteem this below their dignity, I shall borrow
 a proof from an observation, which may be made on most of their own
 discourses, viz. that it is usual for men to use words for ideas, and
 to talk instead of thinking in their reasonings. We use words for ideas,
 because they are commonly so closely connected that the mind easily
 mistakes them. And this likewise is the reason, why we substitute
 the idea of a distance, which is not considered either as visible or
 tangible, in the room of extension, which is nothing but a composition
 of visible or tangible points disposed in a certain order. In
 causing this mistake there concur both the relations of causation and
 resemblance. As the first species of distance is found to be convertible
 into the second, it is in this respect a kind of cause; and the
 similarity of their manner of affecting the senses, and diminishing
 every quality, forms the relation of resemblance.
 
 After this chain of reasoning and explication of my principles, I am now
 prepared to answer all the objections that have been offered, whether
 derived from metaphysics or mechanics. The frequent disputes concerning
 a vacuum, or extension without matter prove not the reality of the idea,
 upon which the dispute turns; there being nothing more common, than to
 see men deceive themselves in this particular; especially when by means
 of any close relation, there is another idea presented, which may be the
 occasion of their mistake.
 
 We may make almost the same answer to the second objection, derived from
 the conjunction of the ideas of rest and annihilation. When every thing
 is annihilated in the chamber, and the walls continue immoveable, the
 chamber must be conceived much in the same manner as at present, when
 the air that fills it, is not an object of the senses. This annihilation
 leaves to the eye, that fictitious distance, which is discovered by the
 different parts of the organ, that are affected, and by the degrees of
 light and shade;--and to the feeling, that which consists in a sensation
 of motion in the hand, or other member of the body. In vain should we.
 search any farther. On whichever side we turn this subject, we shall
 find that these are the only impressions such an object can produce
 after the supposed annihilation; and it has already been remarked, that
 impressions can give rise to no ideas, but to such as resemble them.
 
 Since a body interposed betwixt two others may be supposed to be
 annihilated, without producing any change upon such as lie on each
 hand of it, it is easily conceived, how it may be created anew, and yet
 produce as little alteration. Now the motion of a body has much the same
 effect as its creation. The distant bodies are no more affected in the
 one case, than in the other. This suffices to satisfy the imagination,
 and proves there is no repugnance in such a motion. Afterwards
 experience comes in play to persuade us that two bodies, situated in the
 manner above-described, have really such a capacity of receiving body
 betwixt them, and that there is no obstacle to the conversion of the
 invisible and intangible distance into one that is visible and tangible.
 However natural that conversion may seem, we cannot be sure it is
 practicable, before we have had experience of it.
 
 Thus I seem to have answered the three objections above-mentioned;
 though at the same time I am sensible, that few will be satisfyed
 with these answers, but will immediately propose new objections and
 difficulties. It will probably be said, that my reasoning makes nothing
 to the matter in hands and that I explain only the manner in which
 objects affect the senses, without endeavouring to account for their
 real nature and operations. Though there be nothing visible or tangible
 interposed betwixt two bodies, yet we find BY EXPERIENCE, that the
 bodies may be placed in the same manner, with regard to the eye, and
 require the same motion of the hand in passing from one to the other,
 as if divided by something visible and tangible. This invisible and
 intangible distance is also found by experience to contain a capacity of
 receiving body, or of becoming visible and tangible. Here is the whole
 of my system; and in no part of it have I endeavoured to explain the
 cause, which separates bodies after this manner, and gives them a
 capacity of receiving others betwixt them, without any impulse or
 penetration.
 
 I answer this objection, by pleading guilty, and by confessing that my
 intention never was to penetrate into the nature of bodies, or explain
 the secret causes of their operations. For besides that this belongs not
 to my present purpose, I am afraid, that such an enterprise is beyond
 the reach of human understanding, and that we can never pretend to
 know body otherwise than by those external properties, which discover
 themselves to the senses. As to those who attempt any thing farther, I
 cannot approve of their ambition, till I see, in some one instance at
 least, that they have met with success. But at present I content myself
 with knowing perfectly the manner in which objects affect my senses, and
 their connections with each other, as far as experience informs me of
 them. This suffices for the conduct of life; and this also suffices for
 my philosophy, which pretends only to explain the nature and causes of
 our perceptions, or impressions and ideas [Footnote 4.].
 
 
      [Footnote 4. As long as we confine our speculations to the
      appearances of objects to our senses, without entering into
      disquisitions concerning their real nature and operations,
      we are safe from all difficulties, and can never be
      embarrassed by any question. Thus, if it be asked, if the
      invisible and intangible distance, interposed betwixt two
      objects, be something or nothing: It is easy to answer, that
      it is SOMETHING, VIZ. a property of the objects, which
      affect the SENSES after such a particular manner. If it be
      asked whether two objects, having such a distance betwixt
      them, touch or not: it may be answered, that this depends
      upon the definition of the word, TOUCH. If objects be said
      to touch, when there is nothing SENSIBLE interposed betwixt
      them, these objects touch: it objects be said to touch, when
      their IMAGES strike contiguous parts of the eye, and when
      the hand FEELS both objects successively, without any
      interposed motion, these objects do not touch. The
      appearances of objects to our senses are all consistent; and
      no difficulties can ever arise, but from the obscurity of
      the terms we make use of.
 
      If we carry our enquiry beyond the appearances of objects to
      the senses, I am afraid, that most of our conclusions will
      be full of scepticism and uncertainty. Thus if it be asked,
      whether or not the invisible and intangible distance be
      always full of body, or of something that by an improvement
      of our organs might become visible or tangible, I must
      acknowledge, that I find no very decisive arguments on
      either side; though I am inclined to the contrary opinion,
      as being more suitable to vulgar and popular notions. If THE
      NEWTONIAN philosophy be rightly understood, it will be found
      to mean no more. A vacuum is asserted: That is, bodies are
      said to be placed after such a manner, is to receive bodies
      betwixt them, without impulsion or penetration. The real
      nature of this position of bodies is unknown. We are only
      acquainted with its effects on the senses, and its power of
      receiving body. Nothing is more suitable to that philosophy,
      than a modest scepticism to a certain degree, and a fair
      confession of ignorance in subjects, that exceed all human
      capacity.]
 
 
 I shall conclude this subject of extension with a paradox, which will
 easily be explained from the foregoing reasoning. This paradox is, that
 if you are pleased to give to the in-visible and intangible distance,
 or in other words, to the capacity of becoming a visible and tangible
 distance, the name of a vacuum, extension and matter are the same, and
 yet there is a vacuum. If you will not give it that name, motion
 is possible in a plenum, without any impulse in infinitum, without
 returning in a circle, and without penetration. But however we may
 express ourselves, we must always confess, that we have no idea of any
 real extension without filling it with sensible objects, and conceiving
 its parts as visible or tangible.
 
 As to the doctrine, that time is nothing but the manner, in which
 some real objects exist; we may observe, that it is liable to the same
 objections as the similar doctrine with regard to extension. If it be a
 sufficient proof, that we have the idea of a vacuum, because we dispute
 and reason concerning it; we must for the same reason have the idea
 of time without any changeable existence; since there is no subject of
 dispute more frequent and common. But that we really have no such idea,
 is certain. For whence should it be derived? Does it arise from an
 impression of sensation or of reflection? Point it out distinctly to us,
 that we may know its nature and qualities. But if you cannot point
 out any such impression, you may be certain you are mistaken, when you
 imagine you have any such idea.
 
 But though it be impossible to shew the impression, from which the idea
 of time without a changeable existence is derived; yet we can easily
 point out those appearances, which make us fancy we have that idea. For
 we may observe, that there is a continual succession of perceptions in
 our mind; so that the idea of time being for ever present with us; when
 we consider a stedfast object at five-a-clock, and regard the same at
 six; we are apt to apply to it that idea in the same manner as if every
 moment were distinguished by a different position, or an alteration
 of the object. The first and second appearances of the object, being
 compared with the succession of our perceptions, seem equally removed as
 if the object had really changed. To which we may add, what experience
 shews us, that the object was susceptible of such a number of changes
 betwixt these appearances; as also that the unchangeable or rather
 fictitious duration has the same effect upon every quality, by
 encreasing or diminishing it, as that succession, which is obvious to
 the senses. From these three relations we are apt to confound our ideas,
 and imagine we can form the idea of a time and duration, without any
 change or succession.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VI. OF THE IDEA OF EXISTENCE, AND OF EXTERNAL EXISTENCE.
 
 
 It may not be amiss, before we leave this subject, to explain the ideas
 of existence and of external existence; which have their difficulties,
 as well as the ideas of space and time. By this means we shall be the
 better prepared for the examination of knowledge and probability, when
 we understand perfectly all those particular ideas, which may enter into
 our reasoning.
 
 There is no impression nor idea of any kind, of which we have any
 consciousness or memory, that is not conceived as existent; and it
 is evident, that from this consciousness the most perfect idea and
 assurance of being is derived. From hence we may form a dilemma, the
 most clear and conclusive that can be imagined, viz. that since we never
 remember any idea or impression without attributing existence to it,
 the idea of existence must either be derived from a distinct impression,
 conjoined with every perception or object of our thought, or must be the
 very same with the idea of the perception or object.
 
 As this dilemma is an evident consequence of the principle, that every
 idea arises from a similar impression, so our decision betwixt the
 propositions of the dilemma is no more doubtful. So far from there being
 any distinct impression, attending every impression and every idea,
 that I do not think there are any two distinct impressions, which are
 inseparably conjoined. Though certain sensations may at one time be
 united, we quickly find they admit of a separation, and may be presented
 apart. And thus, though every impression and idea we remember be
 considered as existent, the idea of existence is not derived from any
 particular impression.
 
 The idea of existence, then, is the very same with the idea of what we
 conceive to be existent. To reflect on any thing simply, and to reflect
 on it as existent, are nothing different from each other. That idea,
 when conjoined with the idea of any object, makes no addition to it.
 Whatever we conceive, we conceive to be existent. Any idea we please
 to form is the idea of a being; and the idea of a being is any idea we
 please to form.
 
 Whoever opposes this, must necessarily point out that distinct
 impression, from which the idea of entity is derived, and must prove,
 that this impression is inseparable from every perception we believe to
 be existent. This we may without hesitation conclude to be impossible.
 
 Our foregoing reasoning [Part I. Sect. 7.] concerning the distinction of
 ideas without any real difference will not here serve us in any stead.
 That kind of distinction is founded on the different resemblances, which
 the same simple idea may have to several different ideas. But no object
 can be presented resembling some object with respect to its existence,
 and different from others in the same particular; since every object,
 that is presented, must necessarily be existent.
 
 A like reasoning will account for the idea of external existence. We may
 observe, that it is universally allowed by philosophers, and is besides
 pretty obvious of itself, that nothing is ever really present with the
 mind but its perceptions or impressions and ideas, and that external
 objects become known to us only by those perceptions they occasion. To
 hate, to love, to think, to feel, to see; all this is nothing but to
 perceive.
 
 Now since nothing is ever present to the mind but perceptions, and since
 all ideas are derived from something antecedently present to the mind;
 it follows, that it is impossible for us so much as to conceive or form
 an idea of any thing specifically different from ideas and impressions.
 Let us fix our attention out of ourselves as much as possible: Let us
 chase our imagination to the heavens, or to the utmost limits of the
 universe; we never really advance a step beyond ourselves, nor can
 conceive any kind of existence, but those perceptions, which
 have appeared in that narrow compass. This is the universe of the
 imagination, nor have we any idea but what is there produced.
 
 The farthest we can go towards a conception of external objects, when
 supposed SPECIFICALLY different from our perceptions, is to form a
 relative idea of them, without pretending to comprehend the related
 objects. Generally speaking we do not suppose them specifically
 different; but only attribute to them different relations, connections
 and durations. But of this more fully hereafter.[Part IV, Sect. 2.]
 
 
 
 
 
 PART III. OF KNOWLEDGE AND PROBABILITY.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. I. OF KNOWLEDGE.
 
 
 There are seven [Part I. Sect. 5.] different kinds of philosophical
 relation, viz. RESEMBLANCE, IDENTITY, RELATIONS OF TIME AND PLACE,
 PROPORTION IN QUANTITY OR NUMBER, DEGREES IN ANY QUALITY, CONTRARIETY
 and CAUSATION. These relations may be divided into two classes; into
 such as depend entirely on the ideas, which we compare together, and
 such as may be changed without any change in the ideas. It is from the
 idea of a triangle, that we discover the relation of equality, which its
 three angles bear to two right ones; and this relation is invariable,
 as long as our idea remains the same. On the contrary, the relations of
 contiguity and distance betwixt two objects may be changed merely by an
 alteration of their place, without any change on the objects themselves
 or on their ideas; and the place depends on a hundred different
 accidents, which cannot be foreseen by the mind. It is the same case
 with identity and causation. Two objects, though perfectly resembling
 each other, and even appearing in the same place at different times, may
 be numerically different: And as the power, by which one object produces
 another, is never discoverable merely from their idea, it is evident
 cause and effect are relations, of which we receive information from
 experience, and not from any abstract reasoning or reflection. There is
 no single phaenomenon, even the most simple, which can be accounted for
 from the qualities of the objects, as they appear to us; or which we
 coued foresee without the help of our memory and experience.
 
 It appears, therefore, that of these seven philosophical relations,
 there remain only four, which depending solely upon ideas, can be
 the objects of knowledge and certainty. These four are RESEMBLANCE,
 CONTRARIETY, DEGREES IN QUALITY, and PROPORTIONS IN QUANTITY OR NUMBER.
 Three of these relations are discoverable at first sight, and fall more
 properly under the province of intuition than demonstration. When any
 objects resemble each other, the resemblance will at first strike the
 eye, or rather the mind; and seldom requires a second examination. The
 case is the same with contrariety, and with the degrees of any quality.
 No one can once doubt but existence and non-existence destroy each
 other, and are perfectly incompatible and contrary. And though it be
 impossible to judge exactly of the degrees of any quality, such as
 colour, taste, heat, cold, when the difference betwixt them is very
 small: yet it is easy to decide, that any of them is superior or
 inferior to another, when their difference is considerable. And this
 decision we always pronounce at first sight, without any enquiry or
 reasoning.
 
 We might proceed, after the same manner, in fixing the proportions
 of quantity or number, and might at one view observe a superiority
 or inferiority betwixt any numbers, or figures; especially where the
 difference is very great and remarkable. As to equality or any exact
 proportion, we can only guess at it from a single consideration; except
 in very short numbers, or very limited portions of extension; which are
 comprehended in an instant, and where we perceive an impossibility of
 falling into any considerable error. In all other cases we must settle
 the proportions with some liberty, or proceed in a more artificial
 manner.
 
 I have already observed, that geometry, or the art, by which we fix
 the proportions of figures; though it much excels both in universality
 and exactness, the loose judgments of the senses and imagination; yet
 never attains a perfect precision and exactness. It's first principles
 are still drawn from the general appearance of the objects; and that
 appearance can never afford us any security, when we examine, the
 prodigious minuteness of which nature is susceptible. Our ideas seem
 to give a perfect assurance, that no two right lines can have a common
 segment; but if we consider these ideas, we shall find, that they always
 suppose a sensible inclination of the two lines, and that where the
 angle they form is extremely small, we have no standard of a I @ right
 line so precise as to assure us of the truth of this proposition. It is
 the same case with most of the primary decisions of the mathematics.
 
 There remain, therefore, algebra and arithmetic as the only sciences, in
 which we can carry on a chain of reasoning to any degree of intricacy,
 and yet preserve a perfect exactness and certainty. We are possest of a
 precise standard, by which we can judge of the equality and proportion
 of numbers; and according as they correspond or not to that standard,
 we determine their relations, without any possibility of error. When two
 numbers are so combined, as that the one has always an unite answering
 to every unite of the other, we pronounce them equal; and it is for want
 of such a standard of equality in extension, that geometry can scarce be
 esteemed a perfect and infallible science.
 
 But here it may not be amiss to obviate a difficulty, which may arise
 from my asserting, that though geometry falls short of that perfect
 precision and certainty, which are peculiar to arithmetic and algebra,
 yet it excels the imperfect judgments of our senses and imagination. The
 reason why I impute any defect to geometry, is, because its original and
 fundamental principles are derived merely from appearances; and it may
 perhaps be imagined, that this defect must always attend it, and keep it
 from ever reaching a greater exactness in the comparison of objects or
 ideas, than what our eye or imagination alone is able to attain. I own
 that this defect so far attends it, as to keep it from ever aspiring to
 a full certainty: But since these fundamental principles depend on
 the easiest and least deceitful appearances, they bestow on their
 consequences a degree of exactness, of which these consequences are
 singly incapable. It is impossible for the eye to determine the angles
 of a chiliagon to be equal to 1996 right angles, or make any conjecture,
 that approaches this proportion; but when it determines, that right
 lines cannot concur; that we cannot draw more than one right line
 between two given points; it's mistakes can never be of any consequence.
 And this is the nature and use of geometry, to run us up to such
 appearances, as, by reason of their simplicity, cannot lead us into any
 considerable error.
 
 I shall here take occasion to propose a second observation concerning
 our demonstrative reasonings, which is suggested by the same subject of
 the mathematics. It is usual with mathematicians, to pretend, that
 those ideas, which are their objects, are of so refined and spiritual a
 nature, that they fall not under the conception of the fancy, but must
 be comprehended by a pure and intellectual view, of which the superior
 faculties of the soul are alone capable. The same notion runs through
 most parts of philosophy, and is principally made use of to explain oar
 abstract ideas, and to shew how we can form an idea of a triangle,
 for instance, which shall neither be an isoceles nor scalenum, nor be
 confined to any particular length and proportion of sides. It is easy to
 see, why philosophers are so fond of this notion of some spiritual
 and refined perceptions; since by that means they cover many of their
 absurdities, and may refuse to submit to the decisions of clear ideas,
 by appealing to such as are obscure and uncertain. But to destroy this
 artifice, we need but reflect on that principle so oft insisted on, that
 all our ideas are copyed from our impressions. For from thence we may
 immediately conclude, that since all impressions are clear and precise,
 the ideas, which are copyed from them, must be of the same nature, and
 can never, but from our fault, contain any thing so dark and intricate.
 An idea is by its very nature weaker and fainter than an impression;
 but being in every other respect the same, cannot imply any very great
 mystery. If its weakness render it obscure, it is our business to
 remedy that defect, as much as possible, by keeping the idea steady and
 precise; and till we have done so, it is in vain to pretend to reasoning
 and philosophy.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. II. OF PROBABILITY, AND OF THE IDEA OF CAUSE AND EFFECT.
 
 
 This is all I think necessary to observe concerning those four
 relations, which are the foundation of science; but as to the other
 three, which depend not upon the idea, and may be absent or present
 even while that remains the same, it will be proper to explain them more
 particularly. These three relations are identity, the situations in time
 and place, and causation.
 
 All kinds of reasoning consist in nothing but a comparison, and a
 discovery of those relations, either constant or inconstant, which two
 or more objects bear to each other. This comparison we may make, either
 when both the objects are present to the senses, or when neither of them
 is present, or when only one. When both the objects are present to the
 senses along with the relation, we call this perception rather than
 reasoning; nor is there in this case any exercise of the thought, or
 any action, properly speaking, but a mere passive admission of the
 impressions through the organs of sensation. According to this way of
 thinking, we ought not to receive as reasoning any of the observations
 we may make concerning identity, and the relations of time and place;
 since in none of them the mind can go beyond what is immediately present
 to the senses, either to discover the real existence or the relations
 of objects. It is only causation, which produces such a connexion, as
 to give us assurance from the existence or action of one object, that it
 was followed or preceded by any other existence or action; nor can the
 other two relations be ever made use of in reasoning, except so far
 as they either affect or are affected by it. There is nothing in any
 objects to perswade us, that they are either always remote or always
 contiguous; and when from experience and observation we discover, that
 their relation in this particular is invariable, we, always conclude
 there is some secret cause, which separates or unites them. The same
 reasoning extends to identity. We readily suppose an object may continue
 individually the same, though several times absent from and present
 to the senses; and ascribe to it an identity, notwithstanding the
 interruption of the perception, whenever we conclude, that if we had
 kept our eye or hand constantly upon it, it would have conveyed an
 invariable and uninterrupted perception. But this conclusion beyond the
 impressions of our senses can be founded only on the connexion of cause
 and effect; nor can we otherwise have any security, that the object is
 not changed upon us, however much the new object may resemble that which
 was formerly present to the senses. Whenever we discover such a perfect
 resemblance, we consider, whether it be common in that species of
 objects; whether possibly or probably any cause coued operate in
 producing the change and resemblance; and according as we determine
 concerning these causes and effects, we form our judgment concerning the
 identity of the object.
 
 Here then it appears, that of those three relations, which depend not
 upon the mere ideas, the only one, that can be traced beyond our senses
 and informs us of existences and objects, which we do not see or feel,
 is causation. This relation, therefore, we shall endeavour to explain
 fully before we leave the subject of the understanding.
 
 To begin regularly, we must consider the idea of causation, and see from
 what origin it is derived. It is impossible to reason justly, without
 understanding perfectly the idea concerning which we reason; and it is
 impossible perfectly to understand any idea, without tracing it up to
 its origin, and examining that primary impression, from which it arises.
 The examination of the impression bestows a clearness on the idea;
 and the examination of the idea bestows a like clearness on all our
 reasoning.
 
 Let us therefore cast our eye on any two objects, which we call
 cause and effect, and turn them on all sides, in order to find that
 impression, which produces an idea, of such prodigious consequence.
 At first sight I perceive, that I must not search for it in any of
 the particular qualities of the objects; since which-ever of these
 qualities I pitch on, I find some object, that is not possessed of it,
 and yet falls under the denomination of cause or effect. And indeed
 there is nothing existent, either externally or internally, which is
 not to be considered either as a cause or an effect; though it is plain
 there is no one quality, which universally belongs to all beings, and
 gives them a title to that denomination.
 
 The idea, then, of causation must be derived from some relation among
 objects; and that relation we must now endeavour to discover. I find
 in the first place, that whatever objects are considered as causes
 or effects, are contiguous; and that nothing can operate in a time or
 place, which is ever so little removed from those of its existence.
 Though distant objects may sometimes seem productive of each other, they
 are commonly found upon examination to be linked by a chain of causes,
 which are contiguous among themselves, and to the distant objects; and
 when in any particular instance we cannot discover this connexion, we
 still presume it to exist. We may therefore consider the relation of
 CONTIGUITY as essential to that of causation; at least may suppose it
 such, according to the general opinion, till we can find a more [Part
 IV. Sect. 5.] proper occasion to clear up this matter, by examining what
 objects are or are not susceptible of juxtaposition and conjunction.
 
 The second relation I shall observe as essential to causes and effects,
 is not so universally acknowledged, but is liable to some controversy.
 It is that of PRIORITY Of time in the cause before the effect. Some
 pretend that it is not absolutely necessary a cause should precede its
 effect; but that any object or action, in the very first moment of its
 existence, may exert its productive quality, and give rise to another
 object or action, perfectly co-temporary with itself. But beside that
 experience in most instances seems to contradict this opinion, we may
 establish the relation of priority by a kind of inference or reasoning.
 It is an established maxim both in natural and moral philosophy, that
 an object, which exists for any time in its full perfection without
 producing another, is not its sole cause; but is assisted by some other
 principle, which pushes it from its state of inactivity, and makes it
 exert that energy, of which it was secretly possest. Now if any cause
 may be perfectly co-temporary with its effect, it is certain, according
 to this maxim, that they must all of them be so; since any one of them,
 which retards its operation for a single moment, exerts not itself
 at that very individual time, in which it might have operated; and
 therefore is no proper cause. The consequence of this would be no less
 than the destruction of that succession of causes, which we observe in
 the world; and indeed, the utter annihilation of time. For if one cause
 were co-temporary with its effect, and this effect with its effect, and
 so on, it is plain there would be no such thing as succession, and all
 objects must be co-existent.
 
 If this argument appear satisfactory, it is well. If not, I beg the
 reader to allow me the same liberty, which I have used in the preceding
 case, of supposing it such. For he shall find, that the affair is of no
 great importance.
 
 Having thus discovered or supposed the two relations of contiguity and
 succession to be essential to causes and effects, I find I am stopt
 short, and can proceed no farther in considering any single instance
 of cause and effect. Motion in one body is regarded upon impulse as the
 cause of motion in another. When we consider these objects with utmost
 attention, we find only that the one body approaches the other; and that
 the motion of it precedes that of the other, but without any, sensible
 interval. It is in vain to rack ourselves with farther thought and
 reflection upon this subject. We can go no farther in considering this
 particular instance.
 
 Should any one leave this instance, and pretend to define a cause, by
 saying it is something productive of another, it is evident he would say
 nothing. For what does he mean by production? Can he give any definition
 of it, that will not be the same with that of causation? If he can; I
 desire it may be produced. If he cannot; he here runs in a circle, and
 gives a synonimous term instead of a definition.
 
 Shall we then rest contented with these two relations of contiguity and
 succession, as affording a complete idea of causation? By, no means. An
 object may be contiguous and prior to another, without being considered
 as its cause. There is a NECESSARY CONNEXION to be taken into
 consideration; and that relation is of much greater importance, than any
 of the other two above-mentioned.
 
 Here again I turn the object on all sides, in order to discover
 the nature of this necessary connexion, and find the impression, or
 impressions, from which its idea may be derived. When I cast my eye on
 the known Qualities of objects, I immediately discover that the relation
 of cause and effect depends not in the least on them. When I consider
 their relations, I can find none but those of contiguity and succession;
 which I have already regarded as imperfect and unsatisfactory. Shall the
 despair of success make me assert, that I am here possest of an idea,
 which is not preceded by any similar impression? This would be too
 strong a proof of levity and inconstancy; since the contrary principle
 has been already so firmly established, as to admit of no farther doubt;
 at least, till we have more fully examined the present difficulty.
 
 We must, therefore, proceed like those, who being in search of any
 thing, that lies concealed from them, and not finding it in the place
 they expected, beat about all the neighbouring fields, without any
 certain view or design, in hopes their good fortune will at last guide
 them to what they search for. It is necessary for us to leave the
 direct survey of this question concerning the nature of that necessary
 connexion, which enters into our idea of cause and effect; and endeavour
 to find some other questions, the examination of which will perhaps
 afford a hint, that may serve to clear up the present difficulty. Of
 these questions there occur two, which I shall proceed to examine, viz.
 
 First, For what reason we pronounce it necessary, that every thing whose
 existence has a beginning, should also have a cause.
 
 Secondly, Why we conclude, that such particular causes must necessarily
 have such particular effects; and what is the nature of that inference
 we draw from the one to the other, and of the belief we repose in it?
 
 I shall only observe before I proceed any farther, that though the ideas
 of cause and effect be derived from the impressions of reflection as
 well as from those of sensation, yet for brevity's sake, I commonly
 mention only the latter as the origin of these ideas; though I desire
 that whatever I say of them may also extend to the former. Passions are
 connected with their objects and with one another; no less than external
 bodies are connected together. The same relation, then, of cause and
 effect, which belongs to one, must be common to all of them.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. III. WHY A CAUSE IS ALWAYS NECESSARY.
 
 
 To begin with the first question concerning the necessity of a cause:
 It is a general maxim in philosophy, that whatever begins to exist, must
 have a cause of existence. This is commonly taken for granted in all
 reasonings, without any proof given or demanded. It is supposed to be
 founded on intuition, and to be one of those maxims, which though they
 may be denyed with the lips, it is impossible for men in their hearts
 really to doubt of. But if we examine this maxim by the idea of
 knowledge above-explained, we shall discover in it no mark of any such
 intuitive certainty; but on the contrary shall find, that it is of a
 nature quite foreign to that species of conviction.
 
 All certainty arises from the comparison of ideas, and from the
 discovery of such relations as are unalterable, so long as the ideas
 continue the same. These relations are RESEMBLANCE, PROPORTIONS IN
 QUANTITY AND NUMBER, DEGREES OF ANY QUALITY, and CONTRARIETY; none of
 which are implyed in this proposition, Whatever has a beginning has
 also a cause of existence. That proposition therefore is not intuitively
 certain. At least any one, who would assert it to be intuitively
 certain, must deny these to be the only infallible relations, and must
 find some other relation of that kind to be implyed in it; which it will
 then be time enough to examine.
 
 But here is an argument, which proves at once, that the foregoing
 proposition is neither intuitively nor demonstrably certain. We can
 never demonstrate the necessity of a cause to every new existence, or
 new modification of existence, without shewing at the same time the
 impossibility there is, that any thing can ever begin to exist without
 some productive principle; and where the latter proposition cannot be
 proved, we must despair of ever being able to prove the former. Now that
 the latter proposition is utterly incapable of a demonstrative proof,
 we may satisfy ourselves by considering that as all distinct ideas are
 separable from each other, and as the ideas of cause and effect are
 evidently distinct, it will be easy for us to conceive any object to be
 non-existent this moment, and existent the next, without conjoining to
 it the distinct idea of a cause or productive principle. The separation,
 therefore, of the idea of a cause from that of a beginning of existence,
 is plainly possible for the imagination; and consequently the actual
 separation of these objects is so far possible, that it implies no
 contradiction nor absurdity; and is therefore incapable of being refuted
 by any reasoning from mere ideas; without which it is impossible to
 demonstrate the necessity of a cause.
 
 Accordingly we shall find upon examination, that every demonstration,
 which has been produced for the necessity of a cause, is fallacious and
 sophistical. All the points of time and place, say some philosophers
 [Mr. Hobbes.], in which we can suppose any object to begin to exist, are
 in themselves equal; and unless there be some cause, which is peculiar
 to one time and to one place, and which by that means determines and
 fixes the existence, it must remain in eternal suspence; and the object
 can never begin to be, for want of something to fix its beginning. But I
 ask; Is there any more difficulty in supposing the time and place to be
 fixed without a cause, than to suppose the existence to be determined in
 that manner? The first question that occurs on this subject is always,
 whether the object shall exist or not: The next, when and where it shall
 begin to exist. If the removal of a cause be intuitively absurd in the
 one case, it must be so in the other: And if that absurdity be not clear
 without a proof in the one case, it will equally require one in the
 other. The absurdity, then, of the one supposition can never be a proof
 of that of the other; since they are both upon the same footing, and
 must stand or fall by the same reasoning.
 
 The second argument [Dr. Clarke and others.], which I find used on this
 head, labours under an equal difficulty. Every thing, it is said, must
 have a cause; for if any thing wanted a cause, it would produce
 ITSELF; that is, exist before it existed; which is impossible. But this
 reasoning is plainly unconclusive; because it supposes, that in our
 denial of a cause we still grant what we expressly deny, viz. that there
 must be a cause; which therefore is taken to be the object itself; and
 that, no doubt, is an evident contradiction. But to say that any thing
 is produced, or to express myself more properly, comes into existence,
 without a cause, is not to affirm, that it is itself its own cause; but
 on the contrary in excluding all external causes, excludes a fortiori
 the thing itself, which is created. An object, that exists absolutely
 without any cause, certainly is not its own cause; and when you assert,
 that the one follows from the other, you suppose the very point in
 questions and take it for granted, that it is utterly impossible any
 thing can ever begin to exist without a cause, but that, upon the
 exclusion of one productive principle, we must still have recourse to
 another.
 
 It is exactly the same case with the third argument [Mr. Locke.], which
 has been employed to demonstrate the necessity of a cause. Whatever is
 produced without any cause, is produced by nothing; or in other words,
 has nothing for its cause. But nothing can never be a cause, no more
 than it can be something, or equal to two right angles. By the same
 intuition, that we perceive nothing not to be equal to two right angles,
 or not to be something, we perceive, that it can never be a cause; and
 consequently must perceive, that every object has a real cause of its
 existence.
 
 I believe it will not be necessary to employ many words in shewing the
 weakness of this argument, after what I have said of the foregoing. They
 are all of them founded on the same fallacy, and are derived from the
 same turn of thought. It is sufficient only to observe, that when
 we exclude all causes we really do exclude them, and neither suppose
 nothing nor the object itself to be the causes of the existence;
 and consequently can draw no argument from the absurdity of these
 suppositions to prove the absurdity of that exclusion. If every thing
 must have a cause, it follows, that upon the exclusion of other causes
 we must accept of the object itself or of nothing as causes. But it is
 the very point in question, whether every thing must have a cause or
 not; and therefore, according to all just reasoning, it ought never to
 be taken for granted.
 
 They are still more frivolous, who say, that every effect must have a
 cause, because it is implyed in the very idea of effect. Every effect
 necessarily pre-supposes a cause; effect being a relative term, of which
 cause is the correlative. But this does not prove, that every being must
 be preceded by a cause; no more than it follows, because every husband
 must have a wife, that therefore every man must be marryed. The true
 state of the question is, whether every object, which begins to exist,
 must owe its existence to a cause: and this I assert neither to be
 intuitively nor demonstratively certain, and hope to have proved it
 sufficiently by the foregoing arguments.
 
 Since it is not from knowledge or any scientific reasoning, that we
 derive the opinion of the necessity of a cause to every new production,
 that opinion must necessarily arise from observation and experience. The
 next question, then, should naturally be, how experience gives rise to
 such a principle? But as I find it will be more convenient to sink this
 question in the following, Why we conclude, that such particular
 causes must necessarily have such particular erects, and why we form
 an inference from one to another? we shall make that the subject of our
 future enquiry. It will, perhaps, be found in the end, that the same
 answer will serve for both questions.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. IV. OF THE COMPONENT PARTS OF OUR REASONINGS CONCERNING CAUSE AND EFFECT.
 
 
 Though the mind in its reasonings from causes or effects carries its
 view beyond those objects, which it sees or remembers, it must never
 lose sight of them entirely, nor reason merely upon its own ideas,
 without some mixture of impressions, or at least of ideas of the memory,
 which are equivalent to impressions. When we infer effects from causes,
 we must establish the existence of these causes; which we have only
 two ways of doing, either by an immediate perception of our memory or
 senses, or by an inference from other causes; which causes again we must
 ascertain in the same manner, either by a present impression, or by an
 inference from their causes, and so on, till we arrive at some object,
 which we see or remember. It is impossible for us to carry on our
 inferences IN INFINITUM; and the only thing, that can stop them, is an
 impression of the memory or senses, beyond which there is no room for
 doubt or enquiry.
 
 To give an instance of this, we may chuse any point of history, and
 consider for what reason we either believe or reject it. Thus we believe
 that Caesar was killed in the senate-house on the ides of March; and
 that because this fact is established on the unanimous testimony of
 historians, who agree to assign this precise time and place to that
 event. Here are certain characters and letters present either to our
 memory or senses; which characters we likewise remember to have been
 used as the signs of certain ideas; and these ideas were either in the
 minds of such as were immediately present at that action, and received
 the ideas directly from its existence; or they were derived from the
 testimony of others, and that again from another testimony, by a
 visible gradation, it will we arrive at those who were eyewitnesses and
 spectators of the event. It is obvious all this chain of argument or
 connexion of causes and effects, is at first founded on those characters
 or letters, which are seen or remembered, and that without the authority
 either of the memory or senses our whole reasoning would be chimerical
 and without foundation. Every link of the chain would in that case hang
 upon another; but there would not be any thing fixed to one end of it,
 capable of sustaining the whole; and consequently there would be no
 belief nor evidence. And this actually is the case with all hypothetical
 arguments, or reasonings upon a supposition; there being in them,
 neither any present impression, nor belief of a real existence.
 
 I need not observe, that it is no just objection to the present
 doctrine, that we can reason upon our past conclusions or principles,
 without having recourse to those impressions, from which they first
 arose. For even supposing these impressions should be entirely effaced
 from the memory, the conviction they produced may still remain; and it
 is equally true, that all reasonings concerning causes and effects are
 originally derived from some impression; in the same manner, as the
 assurance of a demonstration proceeds always from a comparison of ideas,
 though it may continue after the comparison is forgot.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. V. OF THE IMPRESSIONS OF THE SENSES AND MEMORY.
 
 
 In this kind of reasoning, then, from causation, we employ materials,
 which are of a mixed and heterogeneous nature, and which, however
 connected, are yet essentially different from each other. All our
 arguments concerning causes and effects consist both of an impression of
 the memory or, senses, and of the idea of that existence, which produces
 the object of the impression, or is produced by it. Here therefore
 we have three things to explain, viz. First, The original impression.
 Secondly, The transition to the idea of the connected cause or effect.
 Thirdly, The nature and qualities of that idea.
 
 As to those impressions, which arise from the senses, their ultimate
 cause is, in my opinion, perfectly inexplicable by human reason, and it
 will always be impossible to decide with certainty, whether they arise
 immediately from the object, or are produced by the creative power of
 the mind, or are derived from the author of our being. Nor is such a
 question any way material to our present purpose. We may draw inferences
 from the coherence of our perceptions, whether they be true or false;
 whether they represent nature justly, or be mere illusions of the
 senses.
 
 When we search for the characteristic, which distinguishes the memory
 from the imagination, we must immediately perceive, that it cannot lie
 in the simple ideas it presents to us; since both these faculties borrow
 their simple ideas from the impressions, and can never go beyond these
 original perceptions. These faculties are as little distinguished from
 each other by the arrangement of their complex ideas. For though it be
 a peculiar property of the memory to preserve the original order and
 position of its ideas, while the imagination transposes and changes
 them, as it pleases; yet this difference is not sufficient to
 distinguish them in their operation, or make us know the one from the
 other; it being impossible to recal the past impressions, in order to
 compare them with our present ideas, and see whether their arrangement
 be exactly similar. Since therefore the memory, is known, neither by
 the order of its complex ideas, nor the nature of its simple ones; it
 follows, that the difference betwixt it and the imagination lies in its
 superior force and vivacity. A man may indulge his fancy in feigning
 any past scene of adventures; nor would there be any possibility of
 distinguishing this from a remembrance of a like kind, were not the
 ideas of the imagination fainter and more obscure.
 
 It frequently happens, that when two men have been engaged in any scene
 of action, the one shall remember it much better than the other,
 and shall have all the difficulty in the world to make his companion
 recollect it. He runs over several circumstances in vain; mentions the
 time, the place, the company, what was said, what was done on all sides;
 till at last he hits on some lucky circumstance, that revives the whole,
 and gives his friend a perfect memory of every thing. Here the person
 that forgets receives at first all the ideas from the discourse of
 the other, with the same circumstances of time and place; though he
 considers them as mere fictions of the imagination. But as soon as the
 circumstance is mentioned, that touches the memory, the very same ideas
 now appear in a new light, and have, in a manner, a different feeling
 from what they had before. Without any other alteration, beside that
 of the feeling, they become immediately ideas of the memory, and are
 assented to.
 
 Since, therefore, the imagination can represent all the same objects
 that the memory can offer to us, and since those faculties are only
 distinguished by the different feeling of the ideas they present, it
 may be proper to consider what is the nature of that feeling. And here
 I believe every one will readily agree with me, that the ideas of the
 memory are more strong and lively than those of the fancy.
 
 A painter, who intended to represent a passion or emotion of any kind,
 would endeavour to get a sight of a person actuated by a like emotion,
 in order to enliven his ideas, and give them a force and vivacity
 superior to what is found in those, which are mere fictions of the
 imagination. The more recent this memory is, the clearer is the idea;
 and when after a long interval he would return to the contemplation of
 his object, he always finds its idea to be much decayed, if not wholly
 obliterated. We are frequently in doubt concerning the ideas of the
 memory, as they become very weak and feeble; and are at a loss to
 determine whether any image proceeds from the fancy or the memory,
 when it is not drawn in such lively colours as distinguish that latter
 faculty. I think, I remember such an event, says one; but am not sure.
 A long tract of time has almost worn it out of my memory, and leaves me
 uncertain whether or not it be the pure offspring of my fancy.
 
 And as an idea of the memory, by losing its force and vivacity,
 may degenerate to such a degree, as to be taken for an idea of the
 imagination; so on the other hand an idea of the imagination may acquire
 such a force and vivacity, as to pass for an idea of the memory, and
 counterfeit its effects on the belief and judgment. This is noted in
 the case of liars; who by the frequent repetition of their lies, come at
 last to believe and remember them, as realities; custom and habit having
 in this case, as in many others, the same influence on the mind as
 nature, and infixing the idea with equal force and vigour.
 
 Thus it appears, that the belief or assent, which always attends the
 memory and senses, is nothing but the vivacity of those perceptions they
 present; and that this alone distinguishes them from the imagination. To
 believe is in this case to feel an immediate impression of the senses,
 or a repetition of that impression in the memory. It is merely the force
 and liveliness of the perception, which constitutes the first act of the
 judgment, and lays the foundation of that reasoning, which we build upon
 it, when we trace the relation of cause and effect.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VI. OF THE INFERENCE FROM THE IMPRESSION TO THE IDEA.
 
 
 It is easy to observe, that in tracing this relation, the inference we
 draw from cause to effect, is not derived merely from a survey of these
 particular objects, and from such a penetration into their essences
 as may discover the dependance of the one upon the other. There is no
 object, which implies the existence of any other if we consider these
 objects in themselves, and never look beyond the ideas which we form of
 them. Such an inference would amount to knowledge, and would imply
 the absolute contradiction and impossibility of conceiving any thing
 different. But as all distinct ideas are separable, it is evident
 there can be no impossibility of that kind. When we pass from a present
 impression to the idea of any object, we might possibly have separated
 the idea from the impression, and have substituted any other idea in its
 room.
 
 It is therefore by EXPERIENCE only, that we can infer the existence of
 one object from that of another. The nature of experience is this. We
 remember to have had frequent instances of the existence of one species
 of objects; and also remember, that the individuals of another species
 of objects have always attended them, and have existed in a regular
 order of contiguity and succession with regard to them. Thus we
 remember, to have seen that species of object we call flame, and to have
 felt that species of sensation we call heat. We likewise call to mind
 their constant conjunction in all past instances. Without any farther
 ceremony, we call the one cause and the other effect, and infer the
 existence of the one from that of the other. In all those instances,
 from which we learn the conjunction of particular causes and effects,
 both the causes and effects have been perceived by the senses, and are
 remembered But in all cases, wherein we reason concerning them, there
 is only one perceived or remembered, and the other is supplyed in
 conformity to our past experience.
 
 Thus in advancing we have insensibly discovered a new relation betwixt
 cause and effect, when we least expected it, and were entirely employed
 upon another subject. This relation is their CONSTANT CONJUNCTION.
 Contiguity and succession are not sufficient to make us pronounce any
 two objects to be cause and effect, unless we perceive, that these
 two relations are preserved in several instances. We may now see the
 advantage of quitting the direct survey of this relation, in order
 to discover the nature of that necessary connexion, which makes so
 essential a part of it. There are hopes, that by this means we may
 at last arrive at our proposed end; though to tell the truth, this
 new-discovered relation of a constant conjunction seems to advance us
 but very little in our way. For it implies no more than this, that like
 objects have always been placed in like relations of contiguity and
 succession; and it seems evident, at least at first sight, that by this
 means we can never discover any new idea, and can only multiply, but not
 enlarge the objects of our mind. It may be thought, that what we learn
 not from one object, we can never learn from a hundred, which are all
 of the same kind, and are perfectly resembling in every circumstance. As
 our senses shew us in one instance two bodies, or motions, or qualities
 in certain relations of success and contiguity; so our memory presents
 us only with a multitude of instances, wherein we always find like
 bodies, motions, or qualities in like relations. From the mere
 repetition of any past impression, even to infinity, there never will
 arise any new original idea, such as that of a necessary connexion; and
 the number of impressions has in this case no more effect than if we
 confined ourselves to one only. But though this reasoning seems just and
 obvious; yet as it would be folly to despair too soon, we shall continue
 the thread of our discourse; and having found, that after the discovery
 of the constant conjunction of any objects, we always draw an inference
 from one object to another, we shall now examine the nature of that
 inference, and of the transition from the impression to the idea.
 Perhaps it will appear in the end, that the necessary connexion depends
 on the inference, instead of the inference's depending on the necessary
 connexion.
 
 Since it appears, that the transition from an impression present to
 the memory or senses to the idea of an object, which we call cause or
 effect, is founded on past experience, and on our remembrance of their
 constant conjunction, the next question is, Whether experience produces
 the idea by means of the understanding or imagination; whether we are
 determined by reason to make the transition, or by a certain association
 and relation of perceptions. If reason determined us, it would proceed
 upon that principle, that instances, of which we have had no experience,
 must resemble those, of which we have had experience, and that the
 course of nature continues always uniformly the same. In order therefore
 to clear up this matter, let us consider all the arguments, upon which
 such a proposition may be supposed to be founded; and as these must be
 derived either from knowledge or probability, let us cast our eye on
 each of these degrees of evidence, and see whether they afford any just
 conclusion of this nature.
 
 Our foregoing method of reasoning will easily convince us, that there
 can be no demonstrative arguments to prove, that those instances, of
 which we have, had no experience, resemble those, of which we have had
 experience. We can at least conceive a change in the course of nature;
 which sufficiently proves, that such a change is not absolutely
 impossible. To form a clear idea of any thing, is an undeniable
 argument for its possibility, and is alone a refutation of any pretended
 demonstration against it.
 
 Probability, as it discovers not the relations of ideas, considered as
 such, but only those of objects, must in some respects be founded on the
 impressions of our memory and senses, and in some respects on our ideas.
 Were there no mixture of any impression in our probable reasonings, the
 conclusion would be entirely chimerical: And were there no mixture
 of ideas, the action of the mind, in observing the relation, would,
 properly speaking, be sensation, not reasoning. It is therefore
 necessary, that in all probable reasonings there be something present
 to the mind, either seen or remembered; and that from this we infer
 something connected with it, which is not seen nor remembered.
 
 The only connexion or relation of objects, which can lead us beyond the
 immediate impressions of our memory and senses, is that of cause and
 effect; and that because it is the only one, on which we can found a
 just inference from one object to another. The idea of cause and effect
 is derived from experience, which informs us, that such particular
 objects, in all past instances, have been constantly conjoined with
 each other: And as an object similar to one of these is supposed to
 be immediately present in its impression, we thence presume on the
 existence of one similar to its usual attendant. According to this
 account of things, which is, I think, in every point unquestionable,
 probability is founded on the presumption of a resemblance betwixt those
 objects, of which we have had experience, and those, of which we have
 had none; and therefore it is impossible this presumption can arise from
 probability. The same principle cannot be both the cause and effect
 of another; and this is, perhaps, the only proposition concerning that
 relation, which is either intuitively or demonstratively certain.
 
 Should any one think to elude this argument; and without determining
 whether our reasoning on this subject be derived from demonstration or
 probability, pretend that all conclusions from causes and effects are
 built on solid reasoning: I can only desire, that this reasoning may be
 produced, in order to be exposed to our examination. It may, perhaps,
 be said, that after experience of the constant conjunction of certain
 objects, we reason in the following manner. Such an object is always
 found to produce another. It is impossible it coued have this effect,
 if it was not endowed with a power of production. The power necessarily
 implies the effect; and therefore there is a just foundation for drawing
 a conclusion from the existence of one object to that of its usual
 attendant. The past production implies a power: The power implies a new
 production: And the new production is what we infer from the power and
 the past production.
 
 It were easy for me to shew the weakness of this reasoning, were I
 willing to make use of those observations, I have already made, that
 the idea of production is the same with that of causation, and that no
 existence certainly and demonstratively implies a power in any other
 object; or were it proper to anticipate what I shall have occasion to
 remark afterwards concerning the idea we form of power and efficacy. But
 as such a method of proceeding may seem either to weaken my system,
 by resting one part of it on another, or to breed a confusion in my
 reasoning, I shall endeavour to maintain my present assertion without
 any such assistance.
 
 It shall therefore be allowed for a moment, that the production of one
 object by another in any one instance implies a power; and that this
 power is connected with its effect. But it having been already proved,
 that the power lies not in the sensible qualities of the cause; and
 there being nothing but the sensible qualities present to us; I ask, why
 in other instances you presume that the same power still exists, merely
 upon the appearance of these qualities? Your appeal to past experience
 decides nothing in the present case; and at the utmost can only prove,
 that that very object, which produced any other, was at that very
 instant endowed with such a power; but can never prove, that the
 same power must continue in the same object or collection of sensible
 qualities; much less, that a like power is always conjoined with like
 sensible qualities, should it be said, that we have experience, that the
 same power continues united with the same object, and that like objects
 are endowed with like powers, I would renew my question, why from this
 experience we form any conclusion beyond those past instances, of which
 we have had experience. If you answer this question in, the same manner
 as the preceding, your answer gives still occasion to a new question
 of the same kind, even in infinitum; which clearly proves, that the
 foregoing reasoning had no just foundation.
 
 Thus not only our reason fails us in the discovery of the ultimate
 connexion of causes and effects, but even after experience has informed
 us of their constant conjunction, it is impossible for us to satisfy
 ourselves by our reason, why we should extend that experience beyond
 those particular instances, which have fallen under our observation. We
 suppose, but are never able to prove, that there must be a resemblance
 betwixt those objects, of which we have had experience, and those which
 lie beyond the reach of our discovery.
 
 We have already taken notice of certain relations, which make us pass
 from one object to another, even though there be no reason to determine
 us to that transition; and this we may establish for a general rule,
 that wherever the mind constantly and uniformly makes a transition
 without any reason, it is influenced by these relations. Now this is
 exactly the present case. Reason can never shew us the connexion of one
 object with another, though aided by experience, and the observation
 of their constant conjunction in all past instances. When the mind,
 therefore, passes from the idea or impression of one object to the idea
 or belief of another, it is not determined by reason, but by certain
 principles, which associate together the ideas of these objects, and
 unite them in the imagination. Had ideas no more union in the fancy
 than objects seem to have to the understanding, we coued never draw any
 inference from causes to effects, nor repose belief in any matter of
 fact. The inference, therefore, depends solely on the union of ideas.
 
 The principles of union among ideas, I have reduced to three general
 ones, and have asserted, that the idea or impression of any object
 naturally introduces the idea of any other object, that is resembling,
 contiguous to, or connected with it. These principles I allow to be
 neither the infallible nor the sole causes of an union among ideas.
 They are not the infallible causes. For one may fix his attention during
 Sometime on any one object without looking farther. They are not the
 sole causes. For the thought has evidently a very irregular motion in
 running along its objects, and may leap from the heavens to the earth,
 from one end of the creation to the other, without any certain method
 or order. But though I allow this weakness in these three relations, and
 this irregularity in the imagination; yet I assert that the only general
 principles, which associate ideas, are resemblance, contiguity and
 causation.
 
 There is indeed a principle of union among ideas, which at first sight
 may be esteemed different from any of these, but will be found at
 the bottom to depend on the same origin. When every individual of any
 species of objects is found by experience to be constantly united with
 an individual of another species, the appearance of any new individual
 of either species naturally conveys the thought to its usual attendant.
 Thus because such a particular idea is commonly annexed to such a
 particular word, nothing is required but the hearing of that word to
 produce the correspondent idea; and it will scarce be possible for the
 mind, by its utmost efforts, to prevent that transition. In this case it
 is not absolutely necessary, that upon hearing such a particular sound
 we should reflect on any past experience, and consider what idea
 has been usually connected with the sound. The imagination of itself
 supplies the place of this reflection, and is so accustomed to pass from
 the word to the idea, that it interposes not a moment's delay betwixt
 the hearing of the one, and the conception of the other.
 
 But though I acknowledge this to be a true principle of association
 among ideas, I assert it to be the very same with that betwixt the ideas
 of cause and effects and to be an essential part in all our reasonings
 from that relation. We have no other notion of cause and effect, but
 that of certain objects, which have been always conjoined together,
 and which in all past instances have been found inseparable. We cannot
 penetrate into the reason of the conjunction. We only observe the thing
 itself, and always find that from the constant conjunction the objects
 acquire an union in the imagination. When the impression of one becomes
 present to us, we immediately form an idea of its usual attendant; and
 consequently we may establish this as one part of the definition of an
 opinion or belief, that it is an idea related to or associated with a
 present impression.
 
 Thus though causation be a philosophical relation, as implying
 contiguity, succession, and constant conjunction, yet it is only so far
 as it is a natural relation, and produces an union among our ideas, that
 we are able to reason upon it, or draw any inference from it.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VII. OF THE NATURE OF THE IDEA OR BELIEF.
 
 
 The idea of an object is an essential part of the belief of it, but not
 the whole. We conceive many things, which we do not believe. In order
 then to discover more fully the nature of belief, or the qualities of
 those ideas we assent to, let us weigh the following considerations.
 
 It is evident, that all reasonings from causes or effects terminate
 in conclusions, concerning matter of fact; that is, concerning the
 existence of objects or of their qualities. It is also evident, that the
 idea, of existence is nothing different from the idea of any object, and
 that when after the simple conception of any thing we would conceive
 it as existent, we in reality make no addition to or alteration on our
 first idea. Thus when we affirm, that God is existent, we simply
 form the idea of such a being, as he is represented to us; nor is the
 existence, which we attribute to him, conceived by a particular idea,
 which we join to the idea of his other qualities, and can again separate
 and distinguish from them. But I go farther; and not content with
 asserting, that the conception of the existence of any object is no
 addition to the simple conception of it, I likewise maintain, that the
 belief of the existence joins no new ideas to those which compose
 the idea of the object. When I think of God, when I think of him as
 existent, and when I believe him to be existent, my idea of him
 neither encreases nor diminishes. But as it is certain there is a great
 difference betwixt the simple conception of the existence of an object,
 and the belief of it, and as this difference lies not in the parts or
 composition of the idea, which we conceive; it follows, that it must lie
 in the manner, in which we conceive it.
 
 Suppose a person present with me, who advances propositions, to which I
 do not assent, that Caesar dyed in his bed, that silver is more
 fusible, than lead, or mercury heavier than gold; it is evident, that
 notwithstanding my incredulity, I clearly understand his meaning, and
 form all the same ideas, which he forms. My imagination is endowed with
 the same powers as his; nor is it possible for him to conceive any idea,
 which I cannot conceive; nor conjoin any, which I cannot conjoin. I
 therefore ask, Wherein consists the difference betwixt believing
 and disbelieving any proposition? The answer is easy with regard to
 propositions, that are proved by intuition or demonstration. In that
 case, the person, who assents, not only conceives the ideas according to
 the proposition, but is necessarily determined to conceive them in that
 particular manner, either immediately or by the interposition of other
 ideas. Whatever is absurd is unintelligible; nor is it possible for the
 imagination to conceive any thing contrary to a demonstration. But as in
 reasonings from causation, and concerning matters of fact, this absolute
 necessity cannot take place, and the imagination is free to conceive
 both sides of the question, I still ask, Wherein consists the deference
 betwixt incredulity and belief? since in both cases the conception of
 the idea is equally possible and requisite.
 
 It will not be a satisfactory answer to say, that a person, who does not
 assent to a proposition you advance; after having conceived the object
 in the same manner with you; immediately conceives it in a different
 manner, and has different ideas of it. This answer is unsatisfactory;
 not because it contains any falshood, but because it discovers not all
 the truth. It is contest, that in all cases, wherein we dissent from any
 person, we conceive both sides of the question; but as we can believe
 only one, it evidently follows, that the belief must make some
 difference betwixt that conception to which we assent, and that from
 which we dissent. We may mingle, and unite, and separate, and confound,
 and vary our ideas in a hundred different ways; but until there appears
 some principle, which fixes one of these different situations, we
 have in reality no opinion: And this principle, as it plainly makes
 no addition to our precedent ideas, can only change the manner of our
 conceiving them.
 
 All the perceptions of the mind are of two kinds, viz. impressions and
 ideas, which differ from each other only in their different degrees
 of force and vivacity. Our ideas are copyed from our impressions, and
 represent them in all their parts. When you would any way vary the idea
 of a particular object, you can only encrease or diminish its force and
 vivacity. If you make any other change on it, it represents a different
 object or impression. The case is the same as in colours. A particular
 shade of any colour may acquire a new degree of liveliness or brightness
 without any other variation. But when you produce any other variation,
 it is no longer the same shade or colour. So that as belief does nothing
 but vary the manner, in which we conceive any object, it can only bestow
 on our ideas an additional force and vivacity. An opinion, therefore,
 or belief may be most accurately defined, a lively idea related to or
 associated with a present impression.
 
 We may here take occasion to observe a very remarkable error, which
 being frequently inculcated in the schools, has become a kind of
 establishd maxim, and is universally received by all logicians. This
 error consists in the vulgar division of the acts of the understanding,
 into CONCEPTION, JUDGMENT and REASONING, and in the definitions we give
 of them. Conception is defind to be the simple survey of one or more
 ideas: Judgment to be the separating or uniting of different ideas:
 Reasoning to be the separating or uniting of different ideas by the
 interposition of others, which show the relation they bear to each
 other. But these distinctions and definitions are faulty in very
 considerable articles. For FIRST, it is far from being true, that in
 every judgment, which we form, we unite two different ideas; since in
 that proposition, GOD IS, or indeed any other, which regards existence,
 the idea of existence is no distinct idea, which we unite with that
 of the object, and which is capable of forming a compound idea by the
 union. SECONDLY, As we can thus form a proposition, which contains only
 one idea, so we may exert our reason without employing more than two
 ideas, and without having recourse to a third to serve as a medium
 betwixt them. We infer a cause immediately from its effect; and this
 inference is not only a true species of reasoning, but the strongest of
 all others, and more convincing than when we interpose another idea to
 connect the two extremes. What we may in general affirm concerning these
 three acts of the understanding is, that taking them in a proper
 light, they all resolve themselves into the first, and are nothing but
 particular ways of conceiving our objects. Whether we consider a single
 object, or several; whether we dwell on these objects, or run from them
 to others; and in whatever form or order we survey them, the act of
 the mind exceeds not a simple conception; and the only remarkable
 difference, which occurs on this occasion, is, when we join belief to
 the conception, and are persuaded of the truth of what we conceive.
 This act of the mind has never yet been explaind by any philosopher; and
 therefore I am at liberty to propose my hypothesis concerning it; which
 is, that it is only a strong and steady conception of any idea, and such
 as approaches in some measure to an immediate impression. [Footnote 5.]
 
 
      [Footnote 5. Here are the heads of those arguments, which
      lead us to this conclusion. When we infer the existence of
      an object from that of others, some object must always be
      present either to the memory or senses, in order to be the
      foundation of our reasoning; since the mind cannot run up
      with its inferences IN INFINITUM. Reason can never satisfy
      us that the existence of any one object does ever imply that
      of another; so that when we pass from the impression of one
      to the idea or belief of another, we are not determined by
      reason, but by custom or a principle of association. But
      belief is somewhat more than a simple idea. It is a
      particular manner of forming an idea: And as the same idea
      can only be varyed by a variation of its degrees of force
      and vivacity; it follows upon the whole, that belief is a
      lively idea produced by a relation to a present impression,
      according to the foregoing definition.]
 
 This operation of the mind, which forms the belief of any matter of
 fact, seems hitherto to have been one of the greatest mysteries of
 philosophy; though no one has so much as suspected, that there was
 any difficulty in explaining it. For my part I must own, that I find
 a considerable difficulty in the case; and that even when I think I
 understand the subject perfectly, I am at a loss for terms to express
 my meaning. I conclude, by an induction which seems to me very evident,
 that an opinion or belief is nothing but an idea, that is different
 from a fiction, not in the nature or the order of its parts, but in the
 manner of its being conceived. But when I would explain this manner, I
 scarce find any word that fully answers the case, but am obliged to have
 recourse to every one's feeling, in order to give him a perfect notion
 of this operation of the mind. An idea assented to FEELS different
 from a fictitious idea, that the fancy alone presents to us: And this
 different feeling I endeavour to explain by calling it a superior force,
 or vivacity, or solidity, or FIRMNESS, or steadiness. This variety of
 terms, which may seem so unphilosophical, is intended only to express
 that act of the mind, which renders realities more present to us than
 fictions, causes them to weigh more in the thought, and gives them a
 superior influence on the passions and imagination. Provided we
 agree about the thing, it is needless to dispute about the terms. The
 imagination has the command over all its ideas, and can join, and mix,
 and vary them in all the ways possible. It may conceive objects with
 all the circumstances of place and time. It may set them, in a manner,
 before our eyes in their true colours, just as they might have existed.
 But as it is impossible, that that faculty can ever, of itself, reach
 belief, it is evident, that belief consists not in the nature and
 order of our ideas, but in the manner of their conception, and in
 their feeling to the mind. T confess, that it is impossible to explain
 perfectly this feeling or manner of conception. We may make use of
 words, that express something near it. But its true and proper name
 is belief, which is a term that every one sufficiently understands in
 common life. And in philosophy we can go no farther, than assert, that
 it is something felt by the mind, which distinguishes the ideas of the
 judgment from the fictions of the imagination. It gives them more force
 and influence; makes them appear of greater importance; infixes them in
 the mind; and renders them the governing principles of all our actions.
 
 This definition will also be found to be entirely conformable to every
 one's feeling and experience. Nothing is more evident, than that those
 ideas, to which we assent, are more strong, firm and vivid, than the
 loose reveries of a castle-builder. If one person sits down to read a
 book as a romance, and another as a true history, they plainly receive
 the same ideas, and in the same order; nor does the incredulity of the
 one, and the belief of the other hinder them from putting the very
 same sense upon their author. His words produce the same ideas in both;
 though his testimony has not the same influence on them. The latter has
 a more lively conception of all the incidents. He enters deeper into
 the concerns of the persons: represents to himself their actions, and
 characters, and friendships, and enmities: He even goes so far as to
 form a notion of their features, and air, and person. While the former,
 who gives no credit to the testimony of the author, has a more faint and
 languid conception of all these particulars; and except on account
 of the style and ingenuity of the composition, can receive little
 entertainment from it.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VIII. OF THE CAUSES OF BELIEF.
 
 
 Having thus explained the nature of belief, and shewn that it consists
 in a lively idea related to a present impression; let us now proceed
 to examine from what principles it is derived, and what bestows the
 vivacity on the idea.
 
 I would willingly establish it as a general maxim in the science of
 human nature, that when any impression becomes present to us, it
 not only transports the mind to such ideas as are related to it, but
 likewise communicates to them a share of its force and vivacity. All
 the operations of the mind depend in a great measure on its disposition,
 when it performs them; and according as the spirits are more or less
 elevated, and the attention more or less fixed, the action will always
 have more or less vigour and vivacity. When therefore any object is
 presented, which elevates and enlivens the thought, every action, to
 which the mind applies itself, will be more strong and vivid, as Tong
 as that disposition continues, Now it is evident the continuance of the
 disposition depends entirely on the objects, about which the mind is
 employed; and that any new object naturally gives a new direction to the
 spirits, and changes the disposition; as on the contrary, when the mind
 fixes constantly on the same object, or passes easily and insensibly
 along related objects, the disposition has a much longer duration.
 Hence it happens, that when the mind is once inlivened by a present
 impression, it proceeds to form a more lively idea of the related
 objects, by a natural transition of the disposition from the one to the
 other. The change of the objects is so easy, that the mind is scarce
 sensible of it, but applies itself to the conception of the related idea
 with all the force and vivacity it acquired from the present impression.
 
 If in considering the nature of relation, and that facility of
 transition, which is essential to it, we can satisfy ourselves
 concerning the reality of this phaenomenon, it is well: But I must
 confess I place my chief confidence in experience to prove so material
 a principle. We may, therefore, observe, as the first experiment to our
 present purpose, that upon the appearance of the picture of an absent
 friend, our idea of him is evidently inlivened by the resemblance, and
 that every passion, which that idea occasions, whether of joy or sorrow,
 acquires new force and vigour. In producing this effect there concur
 both a relation and a present impression. Where the picture bears him no
 resemblance, or at least was not intended for him, it never so much
 as conveys our thought to him: And where it is absent, as well as the
 person; though the mind may pass from the thought of the one to that of
 the other; it feels its idea to be rather weekend than inlivened by that
 transition. We take a pleasure in viewing the picture of a friend, when
 it is set before us; but when it is removed, rather choose to consider
 him directly, than by reflexion in an image, which is equally distinct
 and obscure.
 
 The ceremonies of the Roman Catholic religion may be considered
 as experiments of the same nature. The devotees of that strange
 superstition usually plead in excuse of the mummeries, with which they
 are upbraided, that they feel the good effect of those external motions,
 and postures, and actions, in enlivening their devotion, and quickening
 their fervour, which otherwise would decay away, if directed entirely to
 distant and immaterial objects. We shadow out the objects of our faith,
 say they, in sensible types and images, and render them more present to
 us by the immediate presence of these types, than it is possible for
 us to do, merely by an intellectual view and contemplation. Sensible
 objects have always a greater influence on the fancy than any other;
 and this influence they readily convey to those ideas, to which they
 are related, and which they Resemble. I shall only infer from these
 practices, and this reasoning, that the effect of resemblance in
 inlivening the idea is very common; and as in every case a resemblance
 and a present impression must concur, we are abundantly supplyed with
 experiments to prove the reality of the foregoing principle.
 
 We may add force to these experiments by others of a different kind, in
 considering the effects of contiguity, as well as of resemblance. It is
 certain, that distance diminishes the force of every idea, and that upon
 our approach to any object; though it does not discover itself to our
 senses; it operates upon the mind with an influence that imitates an
 immediate impression. The thinking on any object readily transports the
 mind to what is contiguous; but it is only the actual presence of an
 object, that transports it with a superior vivacity. When I am a few
 miles from home, whatever relates to it touches me more nearly than
 when I am two hundred leagues distant; though even at that distance the
 reflecting on any thing in the neighbourhood of my friends and family
 naturally produces an idea of them. But as in this latter case, both
 the objects of the mind are ideas; notwithstanding there is an easy
 transition betwixt them; that transition alone is not able to give
 a superior vivacity to any of the ideas, for want of some immediate
 impression. [Footnote 6.]

 No one can doubt but causation has the same influence as the other two
 relations; of resemblance and contiguity. Superstitious people are fond
 of the relicks of saints and holy men, for the same reason that they
 seek after types and images, in order to enliven their devotion, and
 give them a more intimate and strong conception of those exemplary
 lives, which they desire to imitate. Now it is evident, one of the best
 relicks a devotee coued procure, would be the handywork of a saint; and
 if his cloaths and furniture are ever to be considered in this light, it
 is because they were once at his disposal, and were moved and affected
 by him; in which respect they are to be considered as imperfect effects,
 and as connected with him by a shorter chain of consequences than any
 of those, from which we learn the reality of his existence. This
 phaenomenon clearly proves, that a present impression with a relation
 of causation may, inliven any idea, and consequently produce belief or
 assent, according to the precedent definition of it.
 
 But why need we seek for other arguments to prove, that a present
 impression with a relation or transition of the fancy may inliven any
 idea, when this very instance of our reasonings from cause and effect
 will alone suffice to that purpose? It is certain we must have an idea
 of every matter of fact, which we believe. It is certain, that this idea
 arises only from a relation to a present impression. It is certain, that
 the belief super-adds nothing to the idea, but only changes our manner
 of conceiving it, and renders it more strong and lively. The present
 conclusion concerning the influence of relation is the immediate
 consequence of all these steps; and every step appears to me sure end
 infallible. There enters nothing into this operation of the mind but a
 present impression, a lively idea, and a relation or association in the
 fancy betwixt the impression and idea; so that there can be no suspicion
 of mistake.
 
 In order to put this whole affair in a fuller light, let us consider
 it as a question in natural philosophy, which we must determine by
 experience and observation. I suppose there is an object presented, from
 which I draw a certain conclusion, and form to myself ideas, which I
 am said to believe or assent to. Here it is evident, that however that
 object, which is present to my senses, and that other, whose existence
 I infer by reasoning, may be thought to influence each other by their
 particular powers or qualities; yet as the phenomenon of belief, which
 we at present examine, is merely internal, these powers and qualities,
 being entirely unknown, can have no hand in producing it. It is the
 present impression, which is to be considered as the true and real
 cause of the idea, and of the belief which attends it. We must therefore
 endeavour to discover by experiments the particular qualities, by which
 it is enabled to produce so extraordinary an effect.
 
 First then I observe, that the present impression has not this effect
 by its own proper power and efficacy, and when considered alone, as
 a single perception, limited to the present moment. I find, that
 an impression, from which, on its first appearance, I can draw no
 conclusion, may afterwards become the foundation of belief, when I have
 had experience of its usual consequences. We must in every case have
 observed the same impression in past instances, and have found it to be
 constantly conjoined with some other impression. This is confirmed by
 such a multitude of experiments, that it admits not of the smallest
 doubt.
 
 From a second observation I conclude, that the belief, which attends the
 present impression, and is produced by a number of past impressions and
 conjunctions; that this belief, I say, arises immediately, without any
 new operation of the reason or imagination. Of this I can be certain,
 because I never am conscious of any such operation, and find nothing
 in the subject, on which it can be founded. Now as we call every thing
 CUSTOM, which proceeds from a past repetition, without any new reasoning
 or conclusion, we-may establish it as a certain truth, that all the
 belief, which follows upon any present impression, is derived solely
 from that origin. When we are accustomed to see two impressions
 conjoined together, the appearance or idea of the one immediately
 carries us to the idea of the other.
 
 Being fully satisfyed on this head, I make a third set of experiments,
 in order to know, whether any thing be requisite, beside the customary
 transition, towards the production of this phaenomenon of belief. I
 therefore change the first impression into an idea; and observe, that
 though the customary transition to the correlative idea still remains,
 yet there is in reality no belief nor perswasion. A present impression,
 then, is absolutely requisite to this whole operation; and when after
 this I compare an impression with an idea, and find that their only
 difference consists in their different degrees of force and vivacity,
 I conclude upon the whole, that belief is a more vivid and intense
 conception of an idea, proceeding from its relation to a present
 impression.
 
 Thus all probable reasoning is nothing but a species of sensation. It is
 not solely in poetry and music, we must follow our taste and sentiment,
 but likewise in philosophy. When I am convinced of any principle, it
 is only an idea, which strikes more strongly upon me. When I give the
 preference to one set of arguments above another, I do nothing but
 decide from my feeling concerning the superiority of their influence.
 Objects have no discoverable connexion together; nor is it from any
 other principle but custom operating upon the imagination, that we
 can draw any inference from the appearance of one to the existence of
 another.
 
 It will here be worth our observation, that the past experience, on
 which all our judgments concerning cause and effect depend, may operate
 on our mind in such an insensible manner as never to be taken notice of,
 and may even in some measure be unknown to us. A person, who stops
 short in his journey upon meeting a river in his way, foresees the
 consequences of his proceeding forward; and his knowledge of these
 consequences is conveyed to him by past experience, which informs him of
 such certain conjunctions of causes and effects. But can we think,
 that on this occasion he reflects on any past experience, and calls
 to remembrance instances, that he has seen or heard of, in order to
 discover the effects of water on animal bodies? No surely; this is not
 the method, in which he proceeds in his reasoning. The idea of sinking
 is so closely connected with that of water, and the idea of suffocating
 with that of sinking, that the mind makes the transition without the
 assistance of the memory. The custom operates before we have time for
 reflection. The objects seem so inseparable, that we interpose not
 a moment's delay in passing from the one to the other. But as this
 transition proceeds from experience, and not from any primary connexion
 betwixt the ideas, we must necessarily acknowledge, that experience
 may produce a belief and a judgment of causes and effects by a secret
 operation, and without being once thought of. This removes all pretext,
 if there yet remains any, for asserting that the mind is convinced
 by reasoning of that principle, that instances of which we have no
 experience, must necessarily resemble those, of which we have. For we
 here find, that the understanding or imagination can draw inferences
 from past experience, without reflecting on it; much more without
 forming any principle concerning it, or reasoning upon that principle.
 
 In general we may observe, that in all the most established and uniform
 conjunctions of causes and effects, such as those of gravity, impulse,
 solidity, &c. the mind never carries its view expressly to consider any
 past experience: Though in other associations of objects, which are more
 rare and unusual, it may assist the custom and transition of ideas by
 this reflection. Nay we find in some cases, that the reflection produces
 the belief without the custom; or more properly speaking, that the
 reflection produces the custom in an oblique and artificial manner. I
 explain myself. It is certain, that not only in philosophy, but even in
 common life, we may attain the knowledge of a particular cause merely by
 one experiment, provided it be made with judgment, and after a careful
 removal of all foreign and superfluous circumstances. Now as after one
 experiment of this kind, the mind, upon the appearance either of the
 cause or the effect, can draw an inference concerning the existence
 of its correlative; and as a habit can never be acquired merely by one
 instance; it may be thought, that belief cannot in this case be esteemed
 the effect of custom. But this difficulty will vanish, if we consider,
 that though we are here supposed to have had only one experiment of
 a particular effect, yet we have many millions to convince us of this
 principle; that like objects placed in like circumstances, will always
 produce like effects; and as this principle has established itself by a
 sufficient custom, it bestows an evidence and firmness on any opinion,
 to which it can be applied. The connexion of the ideas is not habitual
 after one experiment: but this connexion is comprehended under another
 principle, that is habitual; which brings us back to our hypothesis. In
 all cases we transfer our experience to instances, of which we have no
 experience, either expressly or tacitly, either directly or indirectly.
 
 I must not conclude this subject without observing, that it is very
 difficult to talk of the operations of the mind with perfect propriety
 and exactness; because common language has seldom made any very nice
 distinctions among them, but has generally called by the same term
 all such as nearly resemble each other. And as this is a source
 almost inevitable of obscurity and confusion in the author; so it may
 frequently give rise to doubts and objections in the reader, which
 otherwise he would never have dreamed of. Thus my general position, that
 an opinion or belief is nothing but a strong and lively idea derived
 from a present impression related to it, maybe liable to the following
 objection, by reason of a little ambiguity in those words strong and
 lively. It may be said, that not only an impression may give rise to
 reasoning, but that an idea may also have the same influence; especially
 upon my principle, that all our ideas are derived from correspondent
 impressions. For suppose I form at present an idea, of which I have
 forgot the correspondent impression, I am able to conclude from this
 idea, that such an impression did once exist; and as this conclusion is
 attended with belief, it may be asked, from whence are the qualities of
 force and vivacity derived, which constitute this belief? And to this I
 answer very readily, from the present idea. For as this idea is not here
 considered, as the representation of any absent object, but as a real
 perception in the mind, of which we are intimately conscious, it must
 be able to bestow on whatever is related to it the same quality, call
 it firmness, or solidity, or force, or vivacity, with which the mind
 reflects upon it, and is assured of its present existence. The idea here
 supplies the place of an impression, and is entirely the same, so far as
 regards our present purpose.
 
 Upon the same principles we need not be surprized to hear of the
 remembrance of an idea: that is, of the idea of an idea, and of its
 force and vivacity superior to the loose conceptions of the imagination.
 In thinking of our past thoughts we not only delineate out the objects,
 of which we were thinking, but also conceive the action of the mind in
 the meditation, that certain JE-NE-SCAI-QUOI, of which it is impossible
 to give any definition or description, but which every one sufficiently
 understands. When the memory offers an idea of this, and represents it
 as past, it is easily conceived how that idea may have more vigour and
 firmness, than when we think of a past thought, of which we have no
 remembrance.
 
 After this any one will understand how we may form the idea of an
 impression and of an idea, and how we way believe the existence of an
 impression and of an idea.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. IX. OF THE EFFECTS OF OTHER RELATIONS AND OTHER HABITS.
 
 
 However convincing the foregoing arguments may appear, we must not rest
 contented with them, but must turn the subject on every side, in order
 to find some new points of view, from which we may illustrate and
 confirm such extraordinary, and such fundamental principles. A
 scrupulous hesitation to receive any new hypothesis is so laudable a
 disposition in philosophers, and so necessary to the examination of
 truth, that it deserves to be complyed with, and requires that every
 argument be produced, which may tend to their satisfaction, and every
 objection removed, which may stop them in their reasoning.
 
 I have often observed, that, beside cause and effect, the two relations
 of resemblance and contiguity, are to be considered as associating
 principles of thought, and as capable of conveying the imagination from
 one idea to another. I have also observed, that when of two objects
 connected to-ether by any of these relations, one is immediately
 present to the memory or senses, not only the mind is conveyed to
 its co-relative by means of the associating principle; but likewise
 conceives it with an additional force and vigour, by the united
 operation of that principle, and of the present impression. All this
 I have observed, in order to confirm by analogy, my explication of
 our judgments concerning cause and effect. But this very argument may,
 perhaps, be turned against me, and instead of a confirmation of my
 hypothesis, may become an objection to it. For it may be said, that if
 all the parts of that hypothesis be true, viz. that these three species
 of relation are derived from the same principles; that their effects
 in informing and enlivening our ideas are the same; and that belief is
 nothing but a more forcible and vivid conception of an idea; it should
 follow, that that action of the mind may not only be derived from the
 relation of cause and effect, but also from those of contiguity and
 resemblance. But as we find by experience, that belief arises only from
 causation, and that we can draw no inference from one object to another,
 except they be connected by this relation, we may conclude, that there
 is some error in that reasoning, which leads us into such difficulties.
 
 This is the objection; let us now consider its solution. It is evident,
 that whatever is present to the memory, striking upon the mind with
 a vivacity, which resembles an immediate impression, must become of
 considerable moment in all the operations of the mind, and must easily
 distinguish itself above the mere fictions of the imagination. Of
 these impressions or ideas of the memory we form a kind of system,
 comprehending whatever we remember to have been present, either to our
 internal perception or senses; and every particular of that system,
 joined to the present impressions, we are pleased to call a reality.
 But the mind stops not here. For finding, that with this system of
 perceptions, there is another connected by custom, or if you will, by
 the relation of cause or effect, it proceeds to the consideration
 of their ideas; and as it feels that it is in a manner necessarily
 determined to view these particular ideas, and that the custom or
 relation, by which it is determined, admits not of the least change, it
 forms them into a new system, which it likewise dignifies with the title
 of realities. The first of these systems is the object of the memory and
 senses; the second of the judgment.
 
 It is this latter principle, which peoples the world, and brings us
 acquainted with such existences, as by their removal in time and place,
 lie beyond the reach of the senses and memory. By means of it I paint
 the universe in my imagination, and fix my attention on any part of it
 I please. I form an idea of ROME, which I neither see nor remember; but
 which is connected with such impressions as I remember to have received
 from the conversation and books of travellers and historians. This idea
 of Rome I place in a certain situation on the idea of an object, which I
 call the globe. I join to it the conception of a particular government,
 and religion, and manners. I look backward and consider its first
 foundation; its several revolutions, successes, and misfortunes. All
 this, and everything else, which I believe, are nothing but ideas;
 though by their force and settled order, arising from custom and the
 relation of cause and effect, they distinguish themselves from the other
 ideas, which are merely the offspring of the imagination.
 
 As to the influence of contiguity and resemblance, we may observe, that
 if the contiguous and resembling object be comprehended in this system
 of realities, there is no doubt but these two relations will assist that
 of cause and effect, and infix the related idea with more force in the
 imagination. This I shall enlarge upon presently. Mean while I shall
 carry my observation a step farther, and assert, that even where the
 related object is but feigned, the relation will serve to enliven the
 idea, and encrease its influence. A poet, no doubt, will be the better
 able to form a strong description of the Elysian fields, that he prompts
 his imagination by the view of a beautiful meadow or garden; as at
 another time he may by his fancy place himself in the midst of these
 fabulous regions, that by the feigned contiguity he may enliven his
 imagination.
 
 But though I cannot altogether exclude the relations of resemblance and
 contiguity from operating on the fancy in this manner, it is observable
 that, when single, their influence is very feeble and uncertain. As the
 relation of cause and effect is requisite to persuade us of any real
 existence, so is this persuasion requisite to give force to these other
 relations. For where upon the appearance of an impression we not
 only feign another object, but likewise arbitrarily, and of our mere
 good-will and pleasure give it a particular relation to the impression,
 this can have but a small effect upon the mind; nor is there any reason,
 why, upon the return of the same impression, we should be determined to
 place the same object in the same relation to it. There is no manner of
 necessity for the mind to feign any resembling and contiguous objects;
 and if it feigns such, there is as little necessity for it always to
 confine itself to the same, without any difference or variation. And
 indeed such a fiction is founded on so little reason, that nothing but
 pure caprice can determine the mind to form it; and that principle being
 fluctuating and uncertain, it is impossible it can ever operate with
 any considerable degree of force and constancy. The mind forsees and
 anticipates the change; and even from the very first instant feels the
 looseness of its actions, and the weak hold it has of its objects. And
 as this imperfection is very sensible in every single instance, it still
 encreases by experience and observation, when we compare the several
 instances we may remember, and form a general rule against the reposing
 any assurance in those momentary glimpses of light, which arise in the
 imagination from a feigned resemblance and contiguity.
 
 The relation of cause and effect has all the opposite advantages. The
 objects it presents are fixt and unalterable. The impressions of the
 memory never change in any considerable degree; and each impression
 draws along with it a precise idea, which takes its place in the
 imagination as something solid and real, certain and invariable. The
 thought is always determined to pass from the impression to the idea,
 and from that particular impression to that particular idea, without any
 choice or hesitation.
 
 But not content with removing this objection, I shall endeavour
 to extract from it a proof of the present doctrine. Contiguity and
 resemblance have an effect much inferior to causation; but still have
 some effect, and augment the conviction of any opinion, and the vivacity
 of any conception. If this can be proved in several new instances,
 beside what we have already observed, it will be allowed no
 inconsiderable argument, that belief is nothing but a lively idea
 related to a present impression.
 
 To begin with contiguity; it has been remarked among the Mahometans as
 well as Christians, that those pilgrims, who have seen MECCA or the HOLY
 LAND, are ever after more faithful and zealous believers, than those
 who have not had that advantage. A man, whose memory presents him with a
 lively image of the Red-Sea, and the Desert, and Jerusalem, and Galilee,
 can never doubt of any miraculous events, which are related either by
 Moses or the Evangelists. The lively idea of the places passes by an
 easy transition to the facts, which are supposed to have been related to
 them by contiguity, and encreases the belief by encreasing the vivacity
 of the conception. The remembrance of these fields and rivers has
 the same influence on the vulgar as a new argument; and from the same
 causes.
 
 We may form a like observation concerning resemblance. We have remarked,
 that the conclusion, which we draw from a present object to its absent
 cause or effect, is never founded on any qualities, which we observe
 in that object, considered in itself, or, in other words, that it is
 impossible to determine, otherwise than by experience, what will result
 from any phenomenon, or what has preceded it. But though this be so
 evident in itself, that it seemed not to require any, proof; yet some
 philosophers have imagined that there is an apparent cause for the
 communication of motion, and that a reasonable man might immediately
 infer the motion of one body from the impulse of another, without having
 recourse to any past observation. That this opinion is false will admit
 of an easy proof. For if such an inference may be drawn merely from
 the ideas of body, of motion, and of impulse, it must amount to a
 demonstration, and must imply the absolute impossibility of any contrary
 supposition. Every effect, then, beside the communication of motion,
 implies a formal contradiction; and it is impossible not only that it
 can exist, but also that it can be conceived. But we may soon satisfy
 ourselves of the contrary, by forming a clear and consistent idea of
 one body's moving upon another, and of its rest immediately upon the
 contact, or of its returning back in the same line in which it came; or
 of its annihilation; or circular or elliptical motion: and in short, of
 an infinite number of other changes, which we may suppose it to undergo.
 These suppositions are all consistent and natural; and the reason, Why
 we imagine the communication of motion to be more consistent and natural
 not only than those suppositions, but also than any other natural
 effect, is founded on the relation of resemblance betwixt the cause and
 effect, which is here united to experience, and binds the objects in the
 closest and most intimate manner to each other, so as to make us imagine
 them to be absolutely inseparable. Resemblance, then, has the same or a
 parallel influence with experience; and as the only immediate effect
 of experience is to associate our ideas together, it follows, that all
 belief arises from the association of ideas, according to my hypothesis.
 
 It is universally allowed by the writers on optics, that the eye at all
 times sees an equal number of physical points, and that a man on the top
 of a mountain has no larger an image presented to his senses, than
 when he is cooped up in the narrowest court or chamber. It is only by
 experience that he infers the greatness of the object from some peculiar
 qualities of the image; and this inference of the judgment he confounds
 with sensation, as is common on other occasions. Now it is evident,
 that the inference of the judgment is here much more lively than what
 is usual in our common reasonings, and that a man has a more vivid
 conception of the vast extent of the ocean from the image he receives by
 the eye, when he stands on the top of the high promontory, than merely
 from hearing the roaring of the waters. He feels a more sensible
 pleasure from its magnificence; which is a proof of a more lively idea:
 And he confounds his judgment with sensation, which is another proof of
 it. But as the inference is equally certain and immediate in both cases,
 this superior vivacity of our conception in one case can proceed from
 nothing but this, that in drawing an inference from the sight, beside
 the customary conjunction, there is also a resemblance betwixt the image
 and the object we infer; which strengthens the relation, and conveys the
 vivacity of the impression to the related idea with an easier and more
 natural movement.
 
 No weakness of human nature is more universal and conspicuous than what
 we commonly call CREDULITY, or a too easy faith in the testimony of
 others; and this weakness is also very naturally accounted for from the
 influence of resemblance. When we receive any matter of fact upon human
 testimony, our faith arises from the very same origin as our inferences
 from causes to effects, and from effects to causes; nor is there
 anything but our experience of the governing principles of human nature,
 which can give us any assurance of the veracity of men. But though
 experience be the true standard of this, as well as of all other
 judgments, we seldom regulate ourselves entirely by it; but have a
 remarkable propensity to believe whatever is reported, even concerning
 apparitions, enchantments, and prodigies, however contrary to daily
 experience and observation. The words or discourses of others have an
 intimate connexion with certain ideas in their mind; and these ideas
 have also a connexion with the facts or objects, which they represent.
 This latter connexion is generally much over-rated, and commands our
 assent beyond what experience will justify; which can proceed from
 nothing beside the resemblance betwixt the ideas and the facts. Other
 effects only point out their causes in an oblique manner; but the
 testimony of men does it directly, and is to be considered as an image
 as well as an effect. No wonder, therefore, we are so rash in drawing
 our inferences from it, and are less guided by experience in our
 judgments concerning it, than in those upon any other subject.
 
 As resemblance, when conjoined with causation, fortifies our reasonings;
 so the want of it in any very great degree is able almost entirely to
 destroy them. Of this there is a remarkable instance in the universal
 carelessness and stupidity of men with regard to a future state, where
 they show as obstinate an incredulity, as they do a blind credulity on
 other occasions. There is not indeed a more ample matter of wonder
 to the studious, and of regret to the pious man, than to observe
 the negligence of the bulk of mankind concerning their approaching
 condition; and it is with reason, that many eminent theologians have not
 scrupled to affirm, that though the vulgar have no formal principles
 of infidelity, yet they are really infidels in their hearts, and have
 nothing like what we can call a belief of the eternal duration of their
 souls. For let us consider on the one hand what divines have displayed
 with such eloquence concerning the importance of eternity; and at the
 same time reflect, that though in matters of rhetoric we ought to lay
 our account with some exaggeration, we must in this case allow, that the
 strongest figures are infinitely inferior to the subject: And after this
 let us view on the other hand, the prodigious security of men in this
 particular: I ask, if these people really believe what is inculcated on
 them, and what they pretend to affirm; and the answer is obviously in
 the negative. As belief is an act of the mind arising from custom, it
 is not strange the want of resemblance should overthrow what custom has
 established, and diminish the force of the idea, as much as that latter
 principle encreases it. A future state is so far removed from our
 comprehension, and we have so obscure an idea of the manner, in which we
 shall exist after the dissolution of the body, that all the reasons we
 can invent, however strong in themselves, and however much assisted
 by education, are never able with slow imaginations to surmount this
 difficulty, or bestow a sufficient authority and force on the idea. I
 rather choose to ascribe this incredulity to the faint idea we form
 of our future condition, derived from its want of resemblance to the
 present life, than to that derived from its remoteness. For I observe,
 that men are everywhere concerned about what may happen after their
 death, provided it regard this world; and that there are few to whom
 their name, their family, their friends, and their country are in any
 period of time entirely indifferent.
 
 And indeed the want of resemblance in this case so entirely destroys
 belief, that except those few, who upon cool reflection on the
 importance of the subject, have taken care by repeated meditation to
 imprint in their minds the arguments for a future state, there scarce
 are any, who believe the immortality of the soul with a true and
 established judgment; such as is derived from the testimony of
 travellers and historians. This appears very conspicuously wherever
 men have occasion to compare the pleasures and pains, the rewards and
 punishments of this life with those of a future; even though the case
 does not concern themselves, and there is no violent passion to disturb
 their judgment. The Roman Clatholicks are certainly the most zealous of
 any sect in the Christian world; and yet you'll find few among the
 more sensible people of that communion who do not blame the
 Gunpowder-treason, and the massacre of St. Bartholomew, as cruel and
 barbarous, though projected or executed against those very people, whom
 without any scruple they condemn to eternal and infinite punishments.
 All we can say in excuse for this inconsistency is, that they really do
 not believe what they affirm concerning a future state; nor is there any
 better proof of it than the very inconsistency.
 
 We may add to this a remark; that in matters of religion men take a
 pleasure in being terrifyed, and that no preachers are so popular, as
 those who excite the most dismal and gloomy passions. In the common
 affairs of life, where we feel and are penetrated with the solidity of
 the subject, nothing can be more disagreeable than fear and terror; and
 it is only in dramatic performances and in religious discourses, that
 they ever give pleasure. In these latter cases the imagination reposes
 itself indolently on the idea; and the passion, being softened by the
 want of belief in the subject, has no more than the agreeable effect of
 enlivening the mind, and fixing the attention.
 
 The present hypothesis will receive additional confirmation, if we
 examine the effects of other kinds of custom, as well as of other
 relations. To understand this we must consider, that custom, to which
 I attribute all belief and reasoning, may operate upon the mind in
 invigorating an idea after two several ways. For supposing that in all
 past experience we have found two objects to have been always conjoined
 together, it is evident, that upon the appearance of one of these
 objects in an impression, we must from custom make an easy transition to
 the idea of that object, which usually attends it; and by means of the
 present impression and easy transition must conceive that idea in a
 stronger and more lively manner, than we do any loose floating image of
 the fancy. But let us next suppose, that a mere idea alone, without any
 of this curious and almost artificial preparation, should frequently
 make its appearance in the mind, this idea must by degrees acquire a
 facility and force; and both by its firm hold and easy introduction
 distinguish itself from any new and unusual idea. This is the only
 particular, in which these two kinds of custom agree; and if it appear,
 that their effects on the judgment, are similar and proportionable, we
 may certainly conclude, that the foregoing explication of that faculty
 is satisfactory. But can we doubt of this agreement in their influence
 on the judgment, when we consider the nature and effects Of EDUCATION?
 
 All those opinions and notions of things, to which we have been
 accustomed from our infancy, take such deep root, that it is impossible
 for us, by all the powers of reason and experience, to eradicate them;
 and this habit not only approaches in its influence, but even on
 many occasions prevails over that which a-rises from the constant and
 inseparable union of causes and effects. Here we most not be contented
 with saying, that the vividness of the idea produces the belief: We must
 maintain that they are individually the same. The frequent repetition
 of any idea infixes it in the imagination; but coued never possibly
 of itself produce belief, if that act of the mind was, by the original
 constitution of our natures, annexed only to a reasoning and comparison
 of ideas. Custom may lead us into some false comparison of ideas. This
 is the utmost effect we can conceive of it. But it is certain it coued
 never supply the place of that comparison, nor produce any act of the
 mind, which naturally belonged to that principle.
 
 A person, that has lost a leg or an arm by amputation, endeavours for a
 long time afterwards to serve himself with them. After the death of any
 one, it is a common remark of the whole family, but especially of the
 servants, that they can scarce believe him to be dead, but still
 imagine him to be in his chamber or in any other place, where they
 were accustomed to find him. I have often heard in conversation, after
 talking of a person, that is any way celebrated, that one, who has
 no acquaintance with him, will say, I have never seen such-a-one, but
 almost fancy I have; so often have I heard talk of him. All these are
 parallel instances.
 
 If we consider this argument from EDUCATION in a proper light, it will
 appear very convincing; and the more so, that it is founded on one
 of the most common phaenomena, that is any where to be met with. I am
 persuaded, that upon examination we shall find more than one half of
 those opinions, that prevail among mankind, to be owing to education,
 and that the principles, which are thus implicitely embraced,
 overballance those, which are owing either to abstract reasoning or
 experience. As liars, by the frequent repetition of their lies, come at
 last to remember them; so the judgment, or rather the imagination, by
 the like means, may have ideas so strongly imprinted on it, and conceive
 them in so full a light, that they may operate upon the mind in the same
 manner with those, which the senses, memory or reason present to us. But
 as education is an artificial and not a natural cause, and as its maxims
 are frequently contrary to reason, and even to themselves in different
 times and places, it is never upon that account recognized by
 philosophers; though in reality it be built almost on the same
 foundation of custom and repetition as our reasonings from causes and
 effects.
 
 
      [Footnote 7. In general we may observe, that as our assent
      to all probable reasonings is founded on the vivacity of
      ideas, It resembles many of those whimsies and prejudices,
      which are rejected under the opprobrious character of being
      the offspring of the imagination. By this expression it
      appears that the word, imagination, is commonly usd in two
      different senses; and tho nothing be more contrary to true
      philosophy, than this inaccuracy, yet in the following
      reasonings I have often been obligd to fall into it. When I
      oppose the Imagination to the memory, I mean the faculty, by
      which we form our fainter ideas. When I oppose it to reason,
      I mean the same faculty, excluding only our demonstrative
      and probable reasonings. When I oppose it to neither, it is
      indifferent whether it be taken in the larger or more
      limited sense, or at least the context will sufficiently
      explain the meaning.]
 
 
 
 
 
 SECT. X. OF THE INFLUENCE OF BELIEF.
 
 
 But though education be disclaimed by philosophy, as a fallacious ground
 of assent to any opinion, it prevails nevertheless in the world, and
 is the cause why all systems are apt to be rejected at first as new
 and unusual. This perhaps will be the fate of what I have here advanced
 concerning belief, and though the proofs I have produced appear to
 me perfectly conclusive, I expect not to make many proselytes to
 my opinion. Men will scarce ever be persuaded, that effects of
 such consequence can flow from principles, which are seemingly so
 inconsiderable, and that the far greatest part of our reasonings with
 all our actions and passions, can be derived from nothing but custom and
 habit. To obviate this objection, I shall here anticipate a little what
 would more properly fall under our consideration afterwards, when we
 come to treat of the passions and the sense of beauty.
 
 There is implanted in the human mind a perception of pain and pleasure,
 as the chief spring and moving principle of all its actions. But pain
 and pleasure have two ways of making their appearance in the mind; of
 which the one has effects very different from the other. They may either
 appear in impression to the actual feeling, or only in idea, as at
 present when I mention them. It is evident the influence of these upon
 our actions is far from being equal. Impressions always actuate the
 soul, and that in the highest degree; but it is not every idea which
 has the same effect. Nature has proceeded with caution in this came, and
 seems to have carefully avoided the inconveniences of two extremes.
 Did impressions alone influence the will, we should every moment of our
 lives be subject to the greatest calamities; because, though we foresaw
 their approach, we should not be provided by nature with any principle
 of action, which might impel us to avoid them. On the other hand,
 did every idea influence our actions, our condition would not be much
 mended. For such is the unsteadiness and activity of thought, that
 the images of every thing, especially of goods and evils, are always
 wandering in the mind; and were it moved by every idle conception of
 this kind, it would never enjoy a moment's peace and tranquillity.
 
 Nature has, therefore, chosen a medium, and has neither bestowed on
 every idea of good and evil the power of actuating the will, nor yet has
 entirely excluded them from this influence. Though an idle fiction has
 no efficacy, yet we find by experience, that the ideas of those objects,
 which we believe either are or will be existent, produce in a lesser
 degree the same effect with those impressions, which are immediately
 present to the senses and perception. The effect, then, of belief is to
 raise up a simple idea to an equality with our impressions, and bestow
 on it a like influence on the passions. This effect it can only have by
 making an idea approach an impression in force and vivacity. For as the
 different degrees of force make all the original difference betwixt an
 impression and an idea, they must of consequence be the source of all
 the differences in the effects of these perceptions, and their removal,
 in whole or in part, the cause of every new resemblance they acquire.
 Wherever we can make an idea approach the impressions in force and
 vivacity, it will likewise imitate them in its influence on the mind;
 and vice versa, where it imitates them in that influence, as in the
 present case, this must proceed from its approaching them in force and
 vivacity. Belief, therefore, since it causes an idea to imitate
 the effects of the impressions, must make it resemble them in these
 qualities, and is nothing but A MORE VIVID AND INTENSE CONCEPTION OF
 ANY IDEA. This, then, may both serve as an additional argument for
 the present system, and may give us a notion after what manner our
 reasonings from causation are able to operate on the will and passions.
 
 As belief is almost absolutely requisite to the exciting our passions,
 so the passions in their turn are very favourable to belief; and not
 only such facts as convey agreeable emotions, but very often such as
 give pain, do upon that account become more readily the objects of faith
 and opinion. A coward, whose fears are easily awakened, readily assents
 to every account of danger he meets with; as a person of a sorrowful and
 melancholy disposition is very credulous of every thing, that nourishes
 his prevailing passion. When any affecting object is presented, it
 gives the alarm, and excites immediately a degree of its proper passion;
 especially in persons who are naturally inclined to that passion. This
 emotion passes by an easy transition to the imagination; and diffusing
 itself over our idea of the affecting object, makes us form that
 idea with greater force and vivacity, and consequently assent to it,
 according to the precedent system. Admiration and surprize have the same
 effect as the other passions; and accordingly we may observe, that
 among the vulgar, quacks and projectors meet with a more easy faith upon
 account of their magnificent pretensions, than if they kept themselves
 within the bounds of moderation. The first astonishment, which naturally
 attends their miraculous relations, spreads itself over the whole soul,
 and so vivifies and enlivens the idea, that it resembles the inferences
 we draw from experience. This is a mystery, with which we may be already
 a little acquainted, and which we shall have farther occasion to be let
 into in the progress of this treatise.
 
 After this account of the influence of belief on the passions, we shall
 find less difficulty in explaining its effects on the imagination,
 however extraordinary they may appear. It is certain we cannot take
 pleasure in any discourse, where our judgment gives no assent to those
 images which are presented to our fancy. The conversation of those who
 have acquired a habit of lying, though in affairs of no moment, never
 gives any satisfaction; and that because those ideas they present to us,
 not being attended with belief, make no impression upon the mind. Poets
 themselves, though liars by profession, always endeavour to give an air
 of truth to their fictions; and where that is totally neglected, their
 performances, however ingenious, will never be able to afford much
 pleasure. In short, we may observe, that even when ideas have no manner
 of influence on the will and passions, truth and reality are still
 requisite, in order to make them entertaining to the imagination.
 
 But if we compare together all the phenomena that occur on this head,
 we shall find, that truth, however necessary it may seem in all works
 of genius, has no other effect than to procure an easy reception for the
 ideas, and to make the mind acquiesce in them with satisfaction, or at
 least without reluctance. But as this is an effect, which may easily be
 supposed to flow from that solidity and force, which, according to
 my system, attend those ideas that are established by reasonings from
 causation; it follows, that all the influence of belief upon the fancy
 may be explained from that system. Accordingly we may observe, that
 wherever that influence arises from any other principles beside truth or
 reality, they supply its place, and give an equal entertainment to
 the imagination. Poets have formed what they call a poetical system of
 things, which though it be believed neither by themselves nor readers,
 is commonly esteemed a sufficient foundation for any fiction. We have
 been so much accustomed to the names of MARS, JUPITER, VENUS, that
 in the same manner as education infixes any opinion, the constant
 repetition of these ideas makes them enter into the mind with facility,
 and prevail upon the fancy, without influencing the judgment. In like
 manner tragedians always borrow their fable, or at least the names of
 their principal actors, from some known passage in history; and that not
 in order to deceive the spectators; for they will frankly confess, that
 truth is not in any circumstance inviolably observed: but in order
 to procure a more easy reception into the imagination for those
 extraordinary events, which they represent. But this is a precaution,
 which is not required of comic poets, whose personages and incidents,
 being of a more familiar kind, enter easily into the conception, and are
 received without any such formality, even though at first night they be
 known to be fictitious, and the pure offspring of the fancy.
 
 This mixture of truth and falshood in the fables of tragic poets not
 only serves our present purpose, by shewing, that the imagination can be
 satisfyed without any absolute belief or assurance; but may in another
 view be regarded as a very strong confirmation of this system. It is
 evident, that poets make use of this artifice of borrowing the names
 of their persons, and the chief events of their poems, from history, in
 order to procure a more easy reception for the whole, and cause it
 to make a deeper impression on the fancy and affections. The several
 incidents of the piece acquire a kind of relation by being united into
 one poem or representation; and if any of these incidents be an object
 of belief, it bestows a force and vivacity on the others, which are
 related to it. The vividness of the first conception diffuses itself
 along the relations, and is conveyed, as by so many pipes or canals,
 to every idea that has any communication with the primary one. This,
 indeed, can never amount to a perfect assurance; and that because
 the union among the ideas is, in a manner, accidental: But still it
 approaches so near, in its influence, as may convince us, that they
 are derived from the same origin. Belief must please the imagination
 by means of the force and vivacity which attends it; since every idea,
 which has force and vivacity, is found to be agreeable to that faculty.
 
 To confirm this we may observe, that the assistance is mutual betwixt
 the judgment and fancy, as well as betwixt the judgment and passion;
 and that belief not only gives vigour to the imagination, but that a
 vigorous and strong imagination is of all talents the most proper to
 procure belief and authority. It is difficult for us to withhold our
 assent from what is painted out to us in all the colours of eloquence;
 and the vivacity produced by the fancy is in many cases greater than
 that which arises from custom and experience. We are hurried away by the
 lively imagination of our author or companion; and even he himself is
 often a victim to his own fire and genius.
 
 Nor will it be amiss to remark, that as a lively imagination very often
 degenerates into madness or folly, and bears it a great resemblance in
 its operations; so they influence the judgment after the same manner,
 and produce belief from the very same principles. When the imagination,
 from any extraordinary ferment of the blood and spirits, acquires such a
 vivacity as disorders all its powers and faculties, there is no means
 of distinguishing betwixt truth and falshood; but every loose fiction or
 idea, having the same influence as the impressions of the memory, or
 the conclusions of the judgment, is received on the same footing, and
 operates with equal force on the passions. A present impression and a
 customary transition are now no longer necessary to enliven our ideas.
 Every chimera of the brain is as vivid and intense as any of those
 inferences, which we formerly dignifyed with the name of conclusions
 concerning matters of fact, and sometimes as the present impressions of
 the senses.
 
 We may observe the same effect of poetry in a lesser degree; and this is
 common both to poetry and madness, that the vivacity they bestow on the
 ideas is not derived from the particular situations or connexions of the
 objects of these ideas, but from the present temper and disposition
 of the person. But how great soever the pitch may be, to which this
 vivacity rises, it is evident, that in poetry it never has the same
 feeling with that which arises in the mind, when we reason, though even
 upon the lowest species of probability. The mind can easily distinguish
 betwixt the one and the other; and whatever emotion the poetical
 enthusiasm may give to the spirits, it is still the mere phantom of
 belief or persuasion. The case is the same with the idea, as with the
 passion it occasions. There is no passion of the human mind but what may
 arise from poetry; though at the same time the feelings of the passions
 are very different when excited by poetical fictions, from what they are
 when they are from belief and reality. A passion, which is disagreeable
 in real life, may afford the highest entertainment in a tragedy, or epic
 poem. In the latter case, it lies not with that weight upon us: It
 feels less firm and solid: And has no other than the agreeable effect of
 exciting the spirits, and rouzing the attention. The difference in the
 passions is a clear proof of a like difference in those ideas, from
 which the passions are derived. Where the vivacity arises from a
 customary conjunction with a present impression; though the imagination
 may not, in appearance, be so much moved; yet there is always something
 more forcible and real in its actions, than in the fervors of poetry and
 eloquence. The force of our mental actions in this case, no more than in
 any other, is not to be measured by the apparent agitation of the mind.
 A poetical description may have a more sensible effect on the
 fancy, than an historical narration. It may collect more of those
 circumstances, that form a compleat image or picture. It may seem to
 set the object before us in more lively colours. But still the ideas it
 presents are different to the feeling from those, which arise from the
 memory and the judgment. There is something weak and imperfect amidst
 all that seeming vehemence of thought and sentiment, which attends the
 fictions of poetry.
 
 We shall afterwards have occasion to remark both the resemblance and
 differences betwixt a poetical enthusiasm, and a serious conviction. In
 the mean time I cannot forbear observing, that the great difference
 in their feeling proceeds in some measure from reflection and GENERAL
 RULES. We observe, that the vigour of conception, which fictions receive
 from poetry and eloquence, is a circumstance merely accidental, of which
 every idea is equally susceptible; and that such fictions are connected
 with nothing that is real. This observation makes us only lend
 ourselves, so to speak, to the fiction: But causes the idea to feel very
 different from the eternal established persuasions founded on memory and
 custom. They are somewhat of the same kind: But the one is much inferior
 to the other, both in its causes and effects.
 
 A like reflection on general rules keeps us from augmenting our belief
 upon every encrease of the force and vivacity of our ideas. Where an
 opinion admits of no doubt, or opposite probability, we attribute to it
 a full conviction: though the want of resemblance, or contiguity, may
 render its force inferior to that of other opinions. It is thus the
 understanding corrects the appearances of the senses, and makes us
 imagine, that an object at twenty foot distance seems even to the eye as
 large as one of the same dimensions at ten.
 
 We may observe the same effect of poetry in a lesser degree; only with
 this difference, that the least reflection dissipates the illusions
 of poetry, and Places the objects in their proper light. It is however
 certain, that in the warmth of a poetical enthusiasm, a poet has a
 counterfeit belief, and even a kind of vision of his objects: And
 if there be any shadow of argument to support this belief, nothing
 contributes more to his full conviction than a blaze of poetical figures
 and images, which have their effect upon the poet himself, as well as
 upon his readers.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. XI. OF THE PROBABILITY OF CHANCES.
 
 
 But in order to bestow on this system its full force and evidence, we
 must carry our eye from it a moment to consider its consequences, and
 explain from the same principles some other species of reasoning, which
 are derived from the same origin.
 
 Those philosophers, who have divided human reason into knowledge and
 probability, and have defined the first to be that evidence, which
 arises from the comparison of ideas, are obliged to comprehend all our
 arguments from causes or effects under the general term of probability.
 But though every one be free to use his terms in what sense he pleases;
 and accordingly in the precedent part of this discourse, I have followed
 this method of expression; it is however certain, that in common
 discourse we readily affirm, that many arguments from causation exceed
 probability, and may be received as a superior kind of evidence. One
 would appear ridiculous, who would say, that it is only probable the
 sun will rise to-morrow, or that all men must dye; though it is plain we
 have no further assurance of these facts, than what experience affords
 us. For this reason, it would perhaps be more convenient, in order at
 once to preserve the common signification of words, and mark the several
 degrees of evidence, to distinguish human reason into three kinds, viz.
 THAT FROM KNOWLEDGE, FROM PROOFS, AND FROM PROBABILITIES. By knowledge,
 I mean the assurance arising from the comparison of ideas. By proofs,
 those arguments, which are derived from the relation of cause and
 effect, and which are entirely free from doubt and uncertainty. By
 probability, that evidence, which is still attended with uncertainty. It
 is this last species of reasoning, I proceed to examine.
 
 Probability or reasoning from conjecture may be divided into two kinds,
 viz. that which is founded on chance, and that which arises from causes.
 We shall consider each of these in order.
 
 The idea of cause and effect is derived from experience, which
 presenting us with certain objects constantly conjoined with each other,
 produces such a habit of surveying them in that relation, that we cannot
 without a sensible violence survey them iii any other. On the other
 hand, as chance is nothing real in itself, and, properly speaking, is
 merely the negation of a cause, its influence on the mind is contrary to
 that of causation; and it is essential to it, to leave the imagination
 perfectly indifferent, either to consider the existence or non-existence
 of that object, which is regarded as contingent. A cause traces the
 way to our thought, and in a manner forces us to survey such certain
 objects, in such certain relations. Chance can only destroy this
 determination of the thought, and leave the mind in its native situation
 of indifference; in which, upon the absence of a cause, it is instantly
 re-instated.
 
 Since therefore an entire indifference is essential to chance, no one
 chance can possibly be superior to another, otherwise than as it is
 composed of a superior number of equal chances. For if we affirm that
 one chance can, after any other manner, be superior to another, we must
 at the same time affirm, that there is something, which gives it the
 superiority, and determines the event rather to that side than the
 other: That is, in other words, we must allow of a cause, and destroy
 the supposition of chance; which we had before established. A
 perfect and total indifference is essential to chance, and one total
 indifference can never in itself be either superior or inferior to
 another. This truth is not peculiar to my system, but is acknowledged by
 every one, that forms calculations concerning chances.
 
 And here it is remarkable, that though chance and causation be directly
 contrary, yet it is impossible for us to conceive this combination of
 chances, which is requisite to render one hazard superior to another,
 without supposing a mixture of causes among the chances, and a
 conjunction of necessity in some particulars, with a total indifference
 in others. Where nothing limits the chances, every notion, that the most
 extravagant fancy can form, is upon a footing of equality; nor can there
 be any circumstance to give one the advantage above another. Thus unless
 we allow, that there are some causes to make the dice fall, and preserve
 their form in their fall, and lie upon some one of their sides, we can
 form no calculation concerning the laws of hazard. But supposing these
 causes to operate, and supposing likewise all the rest to be indifferent
 and to be determined by chance, it is easy to arrive at a notion of a
 superior combination of chances. A dye that has four sides marked with
 a certain number of spots, and only two with another, affords us an
 obvious and easy instance of this superiority. The mind is here limited
 by the causes to such a precise number and quality of the events; and at
 the same time is undetermined in its choice of any particular event.
 
 Proceeding then in that reasoning, wherein we have advanced three steps;
 that chance is merely the negation of a cause, and produces a total
 indifference in the mind; that one negation of a cause and one total
 indifference can never be superior or inferior to another; and that
 there must always be a mixture of causes among the chances, in order to
 be the foundation of any reasoning: We are next to consider what effect
 a superior combination of chances can have upon the mind, and after what
 manner it influences our judgment and opinion. Here we may repeat all
 the same arguments we employed in examining that belief, which arises
 from causes; and may prove, after the same manner, that a superior
 number of chances produces our assent neither by demonstration nor
 probability. It is indeed evident that we can never by the comparison
 of mere ideas make any discovery, which can be of consequence in this
 affairs and that it is impossible to prove with certainty, that any
 event must fall on that side where there is a superior number of
 chances. To, suppose in this case any certainty, were to overthrow what
 we have established concerning the opposition of chances, and their
 perfect equality and indifference.
 
 Should it be said, that though in an opposition of chances it is
 impossible to determine with certainty, on which side the event will
 fall, yet we can pronounce with certainty, that it is more likely and
 probable, it will be on that side where there is a superior number of
 chances, than where there is an inferior: should this be said, I would
 ask, what is here meant by likelihood and probability? The likelihood
 and probability of chances is a superior number of equal chances; and
 consequently when we say it is likely the event win fall on the side,
 which is superior, rather than on the inferior, we do no more than
 affirm, that where there is a superior number of chances there is
 actually a superior, and where there is an inferior there is an
 inferior; which are identical propositions, and of no consequence. The
 question is, by what means a superior number of equal chances operates
 upon the mind, and produces belief or assent; since it appears, that
 it is neither by arguments derived from demonstration, nor from
 probability.
 
 In order to clear up this difficulty, we shall suppose a person to take
 a dye, formed after such a manner as that four of its sides are marked
 with one figure, or one number of spots, and two with another; and to
 put this dye into the box with an intention of throwing it: It is plain,
 he must conclude the one figure to be more probable than the other, and
 give the preference to that which is inscribed on the greatest number
 of sides. He in a manner believes, that this will lie uppermost; though
 still with hesitation and doubt, in proportion to the number of chances,
 which are contrary: And according as these contrary chances diminish,
 and the superiority encreases on the other side, his belief acquires new
 degrees of stability and assurance. This belief arises from an operation
 of the mind upon the simple and limited object before us; and therefore
 its nature will be the more easily discovered and explained. We have
 nothing but one single dye to contemplate, in order to comprehend one of
 the most curious operations of the understanding.
 
 This dye, formed as above, contains three circumstances worthy of our
 attention. First, Certain causes, such as gravity, solidity, a cubical
 figure, &c. which determine it to fall, to preserve its form in its
 fall, and to turn up one of its sides. Secondly, A certain number
 of sides, which are supposed indifferent. Thirdly, A certain figure
 inscribed on each side. These three particulars form the whole nature of
 the dye, so far as relates to our present purpose; and consequently are
 the only circumstances regarded by the mind in its forming a judgment
 concerning the result of such a throw. Let us, therefore, consider
 gradually and carefully what must be the influence of these
 circumstances on the thought and imagination.
 
 First, We have already observed, that the mind is determined by custom
 to pass from any cause to its effect, and that upon the appearance
 of the one, it is almost impossible for it not to form an idea of the
 other. Their constant conjunction in past instances has produced such
 a habit in the mind, that it always conjoins them in its thought, and
 infers the existence of the one from that of its usual attendant. When
 it considers the dye as no longer supported by the box, it can not
 without violence regard it as suspended in the air; but naturally places
 it on the table, and views it as turning up one of its sides. This
 is the effect of the intermingled causes, which are requisite to our
 forming any calculation concerning chances.
 
 Secondly, It is supposed, that though the dye be necessarily determined
 to fall, and turn up one of its sides, yet there is nothing to fix the
 particular side, but that this is determined entirely by chance. The
 very nature and essence of chance is a negation of causes, and the
 leaving the mind in a perfect indifference among those events, which
 are supposed contingent. When therefore the thought is determined by the
 causes to consider the dye as falling and turning up one of its sides,
 the chances present all these sides as equal, and make us consider every
 one of them, one after another, as alike probable and possible. The
 imagination passes from the cause, viz. the throwing of the dye, to the
 effect, viz. the turning up one of the six sides; and feels a kind of
 impossibility both of stopping short in the way, and of forming any
 other idea. But as all these six sides are incompatible, and the dye
 cannot turn up above one at once, this principle directs us not to
 consider all of them at once as lying uppermost; which we look upon
 as impossible: Neither does it direct us with its entire force to any
 particular side; for in that case this side would be considered as
 certain and inevitable; but it directs us to the whole six sides after
 such a manner as to divide its force equally among them. We conclude in
 general, that some one of them must result from the throw: We run all
 of them over in our minds: The determination of the thought is common to
 all; but no more of its force falls to the share of any one, than what
 is suitable to its proportion with the rest. It is after this manner the
 original impulse, and consequently the vivacity of thought, arising from
 the causes, is divided and split in pieces by the intermingled chances.
 
 We have already seen the influence of the two first qualities of the
 dye, viz. the causes, and the number and indifference of the sides, and
 have learned how they give an impulse to the thought, and divide that
 impulse into as many parts as there are unites in the number of sides.
 We must now consider the effects of the third particular, viz. the
 figures inscribed on each side. It is evident that where several
 sides have the same figure inscribe on them, they must concur in their
 influence on the mind, and must unite upon one image or idea of a figure
 all those divided impulses, that were dispersed over the several sides,
 upon which that figure is inscribed. Were the question only what side
 will be turned up, these are all perfectly equal, and no one coued ever
 have any advantage above another. But as the question is concerning the
 figure, and as the same figure is presented by more than one side: it is
 evident, that the impulses belonging to all these sides must re-unite
 in that one figure, and become stronger and more forcible by the union.
 Four sides are supposed in the present case to have the same figure
 inscribed on them, and two to have another figure. The impulses of
 the former are, therefore, superior to those of the latter. But as the
 events are contrary, and it is impossible both these figures can be
 turned up; the impulses likewise become contrary, and the inferior
 destroys the superior, as far as its strength goes. The vivacity of the
 idea is always proportionable to the degrees of the impulse or tendency
 to the transition; and belief is the same with the vivacity of the idea,
 according to the precedent doctrine.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. XII. OF THE PROBABILITY OF CAUSES.
 
 
 What I have said concerning the probability of chances can serve to
 no other purpose, than to assist us in explaining the probability of
 causes; since it is commonly allowed by philosophers, that what the
 vulgar call chance is nothing but a secret and concealed cause. That
 species of probability, therefore, is what we must chiefly examine.
 
 The probabilities of causes are of several kinds; but are all derived
 from the same origin, viz. THE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS TO A PRESENT
 IMPRESSION. As the habit, which produces the association, arises from
 the frequent conjunction of objects, it must arrive at its perfection by
 degrees, and must acquire new force from each instance, that falls under
 our observation. The first instance has little or no force: The second
 makes some addition to it: The third becomes still more sensible; and it
 is by these slow steps, that our judgment arrives at a full assurance.
 But before it attains this pitch of perfection, it passes through
 several inferior degrees, and in all of them is only to be esteemed a
 presumption or probability. The gradation, therefore, from probabilities
 to proofs is in many cases insensible; and the difference betwixt these
 kinds of evidence is more easily perceived in the remote degrees, than
 in the near and contiguous.
 
 It is worthy of remark on this occasion, that though the species of
 probability here explained be the first in order, and naturally takes
 place before any entire proof can exist, yet no one, who is arrived at
 the age of maturity, can any longer be acquainted with it. It is true,
 nothing is more common than for people of the most advanced knowledge
 to have attained only an imperfect experience of many particular events;
 which naturally produces only an imperfect habit and transition: But
 then we must consider, that the mind, having formed another observation
 concerning the connexion of causes and effects, gives new force to
 its reasoning from that observation; and by means of it can build an
 argument on one single experiment, when duly prepared and examined. What
 we have found once to follow from any object, we conclude will for ever
 follow from it; and if this maxim be not always built upon as certain,
 it is not for want of a sufficient number of experiments, but because
 we frequently meet with instances to the contrary; which leads us to
 the second species of probability, where there is a contrariety in our
 experience and observation.
 
 It would be very happy for men in the conduct of their lives and
 actions, were the same objects always conjoined together, and, we had
 nothing to fear but the mistakes of our own judgment, without having any
 reason to apprehend the uncertainty of nature. But as it is frequently
 found, that one observation is contrary to another, and that causes and
 effects follow not in the same order, of which we have I had experience,
 we are obliged to vary our reasoning on, account of this uncertainty,
 and take into consideration the contrariety of events. The first
 question, that occurs on this head, is concerning the nature and causes
 of the contrariety.
 
 The vulgar, who take things according to their first appearance,
 attribute the uncertainty of events to such an uncertainty in the
 causes, as makes them often fail of their usual influence, though
 they meet with no obstacle nor impediment in their operation. But
 philosophers observing, that almost in every part of nature there is
 contained a vast variety of springs and principles, which are hid,
 by reason of their minuteness or remoteness, find that it is at least
 possible the contrariety of events may not proceed from any contingency
 in the cause, but from the secret operation of contrary causes. This
 possibility is converted into certainty by farther observation, when
 they remark, that upon an exact scrutiny, a contrariety of effects
 always betrays a contrariety of causes, and proceeds from their mutual
 hindrance and opposition. A peasant can give no better reason for the
 stopping of any clock or watch than to say, that commonly it does not
 go right: But an artizan easily perceives, that the same force in the
 spring or pendulum has always the same influence on the wheels; but
 fails of its usual effect, perhaps by reason of a grain of dust, which
 puts a stop to the whole movement. From the observation of several
 parallel instances, philosophers form a maxim, that the connexion
 betwixt all causes and effects is equally necessary, and that its
 seeming uncertainty in some instances proceeds from the secret
 opposition of contrary causes.
 
 But however philosophers and the vulgar may differ in their explication
 of the contrariety of events, their inferences from it are always of the
 same kind, and founded on the same principles. A contrariety of events
 in the past may give us a kind of hesitating belief for the future after
 two several ways. First, By producing an imperfect habit and transition
 from the present impression to the related idea. When the conjunction of
 any two objects is frequent, without being entirely constant, the mind
 is determined to pass from one object to the other; but not with
 so entire a habit, as when the union is uninterrupted, and all the
 instances we have ever met with are uniform and of a piece-.. We find
 from common experience, in our actions as well as reasonings, that
 a constant perseverance in any course of life produces a strong
 inclination and tendency to continue for the future; though there
 are habits of inferior degrees of force, proportioned to the inferior
 degrees of steadiness and uniformity in our conduct.
 
 There is no doubt but this principle sometimes takes place, and
 produces those inferences we draw from contrary phaenomena: though I
 am perswaded, that upon examination we shall not find it to be the
 principle, that most commonly influences the mind in this species of
 reasoning. When we follow only the habitual determination of the mind,
 we make the transition without any reflection, and interpose not a
 moment's delay betwixt the view of one object and the belief of that,
 which is often found to attend it. As the custom depends not upon any
 deliberation, it operates immediately, without allowing any time for
 reflection. But this method of proceeding we have but few instances
 of in our probable reasonings; and even fewer than in those, which are
 derived from the uninterrupted conjunction of objects. In the former
 species of reasoning we commonly take knowingly into consideration
 the contrariety of past events; we compare the different sides of the
 contrariety, and carefully weigh the experiments, which we have on each
 side: Whence we may conclude, that our reasonings of this kind arise
 not directly from the habit, but in an oblique manner; which we must now
 endeavour to explain.
 
 It is evident, that when an object is attended with contrary effects, we
 judge of them only by our past experience, and always consider those
 as possible, which we have observed to follow from it. And as past
 experience regulates our judgment concerning the possibility of these
 effects, so it does that concerning their probability; and that effect,
 which has been the most common, we always esteem the most likely. Here
 then are two things to be considered, viz. the reasons which determine
 us to make the past a standard for the future, and the manner how we
 extract a single judgment from a contrariety of past events.
 
 First we may observe, that the supposition, that the future resembles
 the past, is not founded on arguments of any kind, but is derived
 entirely from habit, by which we are determined to expect for the future
 the same train of objects, to which we have been accustomed. This habit
 or determination to transfer the past to the future is full and perfect;
 and consequently the first impulse of the imagination in this species of
 reasoning is endowed with the same qualities.
 
 But, secondly, when in considering past experiments we find them of a
 contrary nature, this determination, though full and perfect in itself,
 presents us with no steady object, but offers us a number of disagreeing
 images in a certain order and proportion. The first impulse, therefore,
 is here broke into pieces, and diffuses itself over all those images, of
 which each partakes an equal share of that force and vivacity, that is
 derived from the impulse. Any of these past events may again happen;
 and we judge, that when they do happen, they will be mixed in the same
 proportion as in the past.
 
 If our intention, therefore, be to consider the proportions of contrary
 events in a great number of instances, the images presented by our past
 experience must remain in their FIRST FORM, and preserve their first
 proportions. Suppose, for instance, I have found by long observation,
 that of twenty ships, which go to sea, only nineteen return. Suppose
 I see at present twenty ships that leave the port: I transfer my past
 experience to the future, and represent to myself nineteen of these
 ships as returning in safety, and one as perishing. Concerning this
 there can be no difficulty. But as we frequently run over those several
 ideas of past events, in order to form a judgment concerning one single
 event, which appears uncertain; this consideration must change the FIRST
 FORM of our ideas, and draw together the divided images presented
 by experience; since it is to it we refer the determination of that
 particular event, upon which we reason. Many of these images are
 supposed to concur, and a superior number to concur on one side. These
 agreeing images unite together, and render the idea more strong and
 lively, not only than a mere fiction of the imagination, but also than
 any idea, which is supported by a lesser number of experiments. Each new
 experiment is as a new stroke of the pencil, which bestows an additional
 vivacity on the colours without either multiplying or enlarging the
 figure. This operation of the mind has been so fully explained in
 treating of the probability of chance, that I need not here endeavour to
 render it more intelligible. Every past experiment may be considered as
 a kind of chance; I it being uncertain to us, whether the object will
 exist conformable to one experiment or another. And for this reason
 every thing that has been said on the one subject is applicable to both.
 
 Thus upon the whole, contrary experiments produce an imperfect belief,
 either by weakening the habit, or by dividing and afterwards joining in
 different parts, that perfect habit, which makes us conclude in general,
 that instances, of which we have no experience, must necessarily
 resemble those of which we have.
 
 To justify still farther this account of the second species of
 probability, where we reason with knowledge and reflection from
 a contrariety of past experiments, I shall propose the following
 considerations, without fearing to give offence by that air of subtilty,
 which attends them. Just reasoning ought still, perhaps, to retain
 its force, however subtile; in the same manner as matter preserves its
 solidity in the air, and fire, and animal spirits, as well as in the
 grosser and more sensible forms.
 
 First, We may observe, that there is no probability so great as not to
 allow of a contrary possibility; because otherwise it would cease to be
 a probability, and would become a certainty. That probability of causes,
 which is most extensive, and which we at present examine, depends on a
 contrariety of experiments: and it is evident An experiment in the past
 proves at least a possibility for the future.
 
 Secondly, The component parts of this possibility and probability are of
 the same nature, and differ in number only, but not in kind. It has been
 observed, that all single chances are entirely equal, and that the
 only circumstance, which can give any event, that is contingent, a
 superiority over another is a superior number of chances. In like
 manner, as the uncertainty of causes is discovery by experience, which
 presents us with a view of contrary events, it is plain, that when we
 transfer the past to the future, the known to the unknown, every past
 experiment has the same weight, and that it is only a superior number
 of them, which can throw the ballance on any side. The possibility,
 therefore, which enters into every reasoning of this kind, is composed
 of parts, which are of the same nature both among themselves, and with
 those, that compose the opposite probability.
 
 Thirdly, We may establish it as a certain maxim, that in all moral as
 well as natural phaenomena, wherever any cause consists of a number
 of parts, and the effect encreases or diminishes, according to the
 variation of that number, the effects properly speaking, is a compounded
 one, and arises from the union of the several effects, that proceed from
 each part of the cause. Thus, because the gravity of a body encreases or
 diminishes by the encrease or diminution of its parts, we conclude that
 each part contains this quality and contributes to the gravity of the
 whole. The absence or presence of a part of the cause is attended with
 that of a proportionable part of the effect. This connexion or constant
 conjunction sufficiently proves the one part to be the cause of the
 other. As the belief which we have of any event, encreases or diminishes
 according to the number of chances or past experiments, it is to be
 considered as a compounded effect, of which each part arises from a
 proportionable number of chances or experiments.
 
 Let us now join these three observations, and see what conclusion we can
 draw from them. To every probability there is an opposite possibility.
 This possibility is composed of parts, that are entirely of the same
 nature with those of the probability; and consequently have the same
 influence on the mind and understanding. The belief, which attends the
 probability, is a compounded effect, and is formed by the concurrence
 of the several effects, which proceed from each part of the probability.
 Since therefore each part of the probability contributes to the
 production of the belief, each part of the possibility must have the
 same influence on the opposite side; the nature of these parts being
 entirely the same. The contrary belief, attending the possibility,
 implies a view of a certain object, as well as the probability does
 an opposite view. In this particular both these degrees of belief are
 alike. The only manner then, in which the superior number of similar
 component parts in the one can exert its influence, and prevail above
 the inferior in the other, is by producing a stronger and more lively
 view of its object. Each part presents a particular view; and all these
 views uniting together produce one general view, which is fuller and
 more distinct by the greater number of causes or principles, from which
 it is derived.
 
 The component parts of the probability and possibility, being alike
 in their nature, must produce like effects; and the likeness of their
 effects consists in this, that each of them presents a view of a
 particular object. But though these parts be alike in their nature, they
 are very different in their quantity and number; and this difference
 must appear in the effect as well as the similarity. Now as the view
 they present is in both cases full and entire, and comprehends the
 object in all its parts, it is impossible that in this particular there
 can be any difference; nor is there any thing but a superior vivacity
 in the probability, arising from the concurrence of a superior number of
 views, which can distinguish these effects.
 
 Here is almost the same argument in a different light. All our
 reasonings concerning the probability of causes are founded on the
 transferring of past to future. The transferring of any past experiment
 to the future is sufficient to give us a view of the object; whether
 that experiment be single or combined with others of the same kind;
 whether it be entire, or opposed by others of a contrary kind. Suppose,
 then, it acquires both these qualities of combination and opposition, it
 loses not upon that account its former power of presenting a view of the
 object, but only concurs with and opposes other experiments, that have
 a like influence. A question, therefore, may arise concerning the manner
 both of the concurrence and opposition. As to the concurrence, there is
 only the choice left betwixt these two hypotheses. First, That the view
 of the object, occasioned by the transference of each past experiment,
 preserves itself entire, and only multiplies the number of views. Or,
 SECONDLY, That it runs into the other similar and correspondent views,
 and gives them a superior degree of force and vivacity. But that the
 first hypothesis is erroneous, is evident from experience, which
 informs us, that the belief, attending any reasoning, consists in
 one conclusion, not in a multitude of similar ones, which would only
 distract the mind, and in many cases would be too numerous to be
 comprehended distinctly by any finite capacity. It remains, therefore,
 as the only reasonable opinion, that these similar views run into each
 other, and unite their forces; so as to produce a stronger and clearer
 view, than what arises from any one alone. This is the manner, in which
 past experiments concur, when they are transfered to any future event.
 As to the manner of their opposition, it is evident, that as the
 contrary views are incompatible with each other, and it is impossible
 the object can at once exist conformable to both of them, their
 influence becomes mutually destructive, and the mind is determined to
 the superior only with that force, which remains, after subtracting the
 inferior.
 
 I am sensible how abstruse all this reasoning must appear to the
 generality of readers, who not being accustomed to such profound
 reflections on the intellectual faculties of the mind, will be apt to
 reject as chimerical whatever strikes not in with the common received
 notions, and with the easiest and most obvious principles of philosophy.
 And no doubt there are some pains required to enter into these
 arguments; though perhaps very little are necessary to perceive the
 imperfection of every vulgar hypothesis on this subject, and the little
 light, which philosophy can yet afford us in such sublime and such
 curious speculations. Let men be once fully perswaded of these two
 principles, THAT THERE, IS NOTHING IN ANY OBJECT, CONSIDERed IN ITSELF,
 WHICH CAN AFFORD US A REASON FOR DRAWING A CONCLUSION BEYOND it; and,
 THAT EVEN AFTER THE OBSERVATION OF THE FREQUENT OR CONSTANT CONJUNCTION
 OF OBJECTS, WE HAVE NO REASON TO DRAW ANY INFERENCE CONCERNING ANY
 OBJECT BEYOND THOSE OF WHICH WE HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE; I say, let men be
 once fully convinced of these two principles, and this will throw them
 so loose from all common systems, that they will make no difficulty of
 receiving any, which may appear the most extraordinary. These principles
 we have found to be sufficiently convincing, even with regard to our
 most certain reasonings from causation: But I shall venture to affirm,
 that with regard to these conjectural or probable reasonings they still
 acquire a new degree of evidence.
 
 First, It is obvious, that in reasonings of this kind, it is not the
 object presented to us, which, considered in itself, affords us any
 reason to draw a conclusion concerning any other object or event. For
 as this latter object is supposed uncertain, and as the uncertainty is
 derived from a concealed contrariety of causes in the former, were any
 of the causes placed in the known qualities of that object, they would
 no longer be concealed, nor would our conclusion be uncertain.
 
 But, secondly, it is equally obvious in this species of reasoning, that
 if the transference of the past to the future were founded merely on a
 conclusion of the understanding, it coued never occasion any belief or
 assurance. When we transfer contrary experiments to the future, we
 can only repeat these contrary experiments with their particular
 proportions; which coued not produce assurance in any single event, upon
 which we reason, unless the fancy melted together all those images
 that concur, and extracted from them one single idea or image, which is
 intense and lively in proportion to the number of experiments from which
 it is derived, and their superiority above their antagonists. Our past
 experience presents no determinate object; and as our belief, however
 faint, fixes itself on a determinate object, it is evident that the
 belief arises not merely from the transference of past to future, but
 from some operation of the fancy conjoined with it. This may lead us
 to conceive the manner, in which that faculty enters into all our
 reasonings.
 
 I shall conclude this subject with two reflections, which may deserve
 our attention. The FIRST may be explained after this manner. When the
 mind forms a reasoning concerning any matter of fact, which is
 only probable, it casts its eye backward upon past experience, and
 transferring it to the future, is presented with so many contrary
 views of its object, of which those that are of the same kind uniting
 together, and running into one act of the mind, serve to fortify and
 inliven it. But suppose that this multitude of views or glimpses of an
 object proceeds not from experience, but from a voluntary act of the
 imagination; this effect does not follow, or at least, follows not in
 the same degree. For though custom and education produce belief by such
 a repetition, as is not derived from experience, yet this requires
 a long tract of time, along with a very frequent and undesigned
 repetition. In general we may pronounce, that a person who would
 voluntarily repeat any idea in his mind, though supported by one past
 experience, would be no more inclined to believe the existence of its
 object, than if he had contented himself with one survey of it.
 Beside the effect of design; each act of the mind, being separate and
 independent, has a separate influence, and joins not its force with that
 of its fellows. Not being united by any common object, producing them,
 they have no relation to each other; and consequently make no transition
 or union of forces. This phaenomenon we shall understand better
 afterwards.
 
 My second reflection is founded on those large probabilities, which the
 mind can judge of, and the minute differences it can observe betwixt
 them. When the chances or experiments on one side amount to ten
 thousand, and on the other to ten thousand and one, the judgment gives
 the preference to the latter, upon account of that superiority; though
 it is plainly impossible for the mind to run over every particular view,
 and distinguish the superior vivacity of the image arising from the
 superior number, where the difference is so inconsiderable. We have a
 parallel instance in the affections. It is evident, according to the
 principles above-mentioned, that when an object produces any passion in
 us, which varies according to the different quantity of the object; I
 say, it is evident, that the passion, properly speaking, is not a simple
 emotion, but a compounded one, of a great number of weaker passions,
 derived from a view of each part of the object. For otherwise it were
 impossible the passion should encrease by the encrease of these parts.
 Thus a man, who desires a thousand pound, has in reality a thousand
 or more desires which uniting together, seem to make only one passion;
 though the composition evidently betrays itself upon every alteration of
 the object, by the preference he gives to the larger number, if superior
 only by an unite. Yet nothing can be more certain, than that so small
 a difference would not be discernible in the passions, nor coued render
 them distinguishable from each other. The difference, therefore, of our
 conduct in preferring the greater number depends not upon our passions,
 but upon custom, and general rules. We have found in a multitude of
 instances, that the augmenting the numbers of any sum augments the
 passion, where the numbers are precise and the difference sensible. The
 mind can perceive from its immediate feeling, that three guineas produce
 a greater passion than two; and this it transfers to larger numbers,
 because of the resemblance; and by a general rule assigns to a thousand
 guineas, a stronger passion than to nine hundred and ninety nine. These
 general rules we shall explain presently.
 
 But beside these two species of probability, which a-re derived from an
 imperfect experience and from contrary causes, there is a third arising
 from ANALOGY, which differs from them in some material circumstances.
 According to the hypothesis above explained all kinds of reasoning from
 causes or effects are founded on two particulars, viz., the constant
 conjunction of any two objects in all past experience, and the
 resemblance of a present object to any one of them. The effect of these
 two particulars is, that the present object invigorates and inlivens the
 imagination; and the resemblance, along with the constant union, conveys
 this force and vivacity to the related idea; which we are therefore said
 to believe, or assent to. If you weaken either the union or resemblance,
 you weaken the principle of transition, and of consequence that belief,
 which arises from it. The vivacity of the first impression cannot be
 fully conveyed to the related idea, either where the conjunction of
 their objects is not constant, or where the present impression does
 not perfectly resemble any of those, whose union we are accustomed to
 observe. In those probabilities of chance and causes above-explained,
 it is the constancy of the union, which is diminished; and in the
 probability derived from analogy, it is the resemblance only, which is
 affected. Without some degree of resemblance, as well as union, it is
 impossible there can be any reasoning: but as this resemblance admits
 of many different degrees, the reasoning becomes proportionably more
 or less firm and certain. An experiment loses of its force, when
 transferred to instances, which are not exactly resembling; though it
 is evident it may still retain as much as may be the foundation of
 probability, as long as there is any resemblance remaining.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. XIII. OF UNPHILOSOPHICAL PROBABILITY.
 
 
 All these kinds of probability are received by philosophers, and allowed
 to be reasonable foundations of belief and opinion. But there are
 others, that are derived from the same principles, though they have not
 had the good fortune to obtain the same sanction. The first probability
 of this kind may be accounted for thus. The diminution of the union, and
 of the resemblance, as above explained, diminishes the facility of the
 transition, and by that means weakens the evidence; and we may farther
 observe, that the same diminution of the evidence will follow from a
 diminution of the impression, and from the shading of those colours,
 under which it appears to the memory or senses. The argument, which
 we found on any matter of fact we remember, is more or less convincing
 according as the fact is recent or remote; and though the difference
 in these degrees of evidence be not received by philosophy as solid and
 legitimate; because in that case an argument must have a different force
 to day, from what it shall have a month hence; yet notwithstanding
 the opposition of philosophy, it is certain, this circumstance has a
 considerable influence on the understanding, and secretly changes the
 authority of the same argument, according to the different times,
 in which it is proposed to us. A greater force and vivacity in the
 impression naturally conveys a greater to the related idea; and it is on
 the degrees of force and vivacity, that the belief depends, according to
 the foregoing system.
 
 There is a second difference, which we may frequently observe in our
 degrees of belief and assurance, and which never fails to take place,
 though disclaimed by philosophers. An experiment, that is recent and
 fresh in the memory, affects us more than one that is in some measure
 obliterated; and has a superior influence on the judgment, as well as on
 the passions. A lively impression produces more assurance than a faint
 one; because it has more original force to communicate to the related
 idea, which thereby acquires a greater force and vivacity. A recent
 observation has a like effect; because the custom and transition is
 there more entire, and preserves better the original force in the
 communication. Thus a drunkard, who has seen his companion die of a
 debauch, is struck with that instance for some time, and dreads a like
 accident for himself: But as the memory of it decays away by degrees,
 his former security returns, and the danger seems less certain and real.
 
 I add, as a third instance of this kind, that though our reasonings from
 proofs and from probabilities be considerably different from each other,
 yet the former species of reasoning often degenerates insensibly into
 the latter, by nothing but the multitude of connected arguments. It is
 certain, that when an inference is drawn immediately from an object,
 without any intermediate cause or effect, the conviction is much
 stronger, and the persuasion more lively, than when the imagination is
 carryed through a long chain of connected arguments, however infallible
 the connexion of each link may be esteemed. It is from the original
 impression, that the vivacity of all the ideas is derived, by means
 of the customary transition of the imagination; and it is evident this
 vivacity must gradually decay in proportion to the distance, and must
 lose somewhat in each transition. Sometimes this distance has a greater
 influence than even contrary experiments would have; and a man may
 receive a more lively conviction from a probable reasoning, which is
 close and immediate, than from a long chain of consequences, though just
 and conclusive in each part. Nay it is seldom such reasonings produce
 any conviction; and one must have a very strong and firm imagination
 to preserve the evidence to the end, where it passes through so many,
 stages.
 
 But here it may not be amiss to remark a very curious phaenomenon, which
 the present subject suggests to us. It is evident there is no point
 of ancient history, of which we can have any assurance, but by passing
 through many millions of causes and effects, and through a chain of
 arguments of almost an immeasurable length. Before the knowledge of the
 fact coued come to the first historian, it must be conveyed through many
 mouths; and after it is committed to writing, each new copy is a new
 object, of which the connexion with the foregoing is known only by
 experience and observation. Perhaps, therefore, it may be concluded from
 the precedent reasoning, that the evidence of all ancient history must
 now be lost; or at least, will be lost in time, as the chain of causes
 encreases, and runs on to a greater length. But as it seems contrary to
 common sense to think, that if the republic of letters, and the art of
 printing continue on the same footing as at present, our posterity, even
 after a thousand ages, can ever doubt if there has been such a man as
 JULIUS CAESAR; this may be considered as an objection to the present
 system. If belief consisted only in a certain vivacity, conveyed from an
 original impression, it would decay by the length of the transition, and
 must at last be utterly extinguished: And vice versa, if belief on some
 occasions be not capable of such an extinction; it must be something
 different from that vivacity.
 
 Before I answer this objection I shall observe, that from this topic
 there has been borrowed a very celebrated argument against the Christian
 Religion; but with this difference, that the connexion betwixt each link
 of the chain in human testimony has been there supposed not to go beyond
 probability, and to be liable to a degree of doubt and uncertainty.
 And indeed it must be confest, that in this manner of considering
 the subject, (which however is not a true one) there is no history or
 tradition, but what must in the end lose all its force and evidence.
 Every new probability diminishes the original conviction; and however
 great that conviction may be supposed, it is impossible it can subsist
 under such re-iterated diminutions. This is true in general; though
 we shall find [Part IV. Sect. 1.] afterwards, that there is one very
 memorable exception, which is of vast consequence in the present subject
 of the understanding.
 
 Mean while to give a solution of the preceding objection upon the
 supposition, that historical evidence amounts at first to an entire
 proof; let us consider, that though the links are innumerable, that
 connect any original fact with the present impression, which is the
 foundation of belief; yet they are all of the same kind, and depend on
 the fidelity of Printers and Copyists. One edition passes into another,
 and that into a third, and so on, till we come to that volume we peruse
 at present. There is no variation in the steps. After we know one we
 know all of them; and after we have made one, we can have no scruple as
 to the rest. This circumstance alone preserves the evidence of history,
 and will perpetuate the memory of the present age to the latest
 posterity. If all the long chain of causes and effects, which connect
 any past event with any volume of history, were composed of parts
 different from each other, and which it were necessary for the mind
 distinctly to conceive, it is impossible we should preserve to the
 end any belief or evidence. But as most of these proofs are perfectly
 resembling, the mind runs easily along them, jumps from one part to
 another with facility, and forms but a confused and general notion of
 each link. By this means a long chain of argument, has as little effect
 in diminishing the original vivacity, as a much shorter would have, if
 composed of parts, which were different from each other, and of which
 each required a distinct consideration.
 
 A fourth unphilosophical species of probability is that derived from
 general rules, which we rashly form to ourselves, and which are the
 source of what we properly call PREJUDICE. An IRISHMAN cannot have
 wit, and a Frenchman cannot have solidity; for which reason, though the
 conversation of the former in any instance be visibly very agreeable,
 and of the latter very judicious, we have entertained such a prejudice
 against them, that they must be dunces or fops in spite of sense and
 reason. Human nature is very subject to errors of this kind; and perhaps
 this nation as much as any other.
 
 Should it be demanded why men form general rules, and allow them to
 influence their judgment, even contrary to present observation and
 experience, I should reply, that in my opinion it proceeds from those
 very principles, on which all judgments concerning causes and effects
 depend. Our judgments concerning cause and effect are derived from
 habit and experience; and when we have been accustomed to see one object
 united to another, our imagination passes from the first to the second,
 by a natural transition, which precedes reflection, and which cannot be
 prevented by it. Now it is the nature of custom not only to operate with
 its full force, when objects are presented, that are exactly the same
 with those to which we have been accustomed; but also to operate in an
 inferior degree, when we discover such as are similar; and though the
 habit loses somewhat of its force by every difference, yet it is seldom
 entirely destroyed, where any considerable circumstances remain the
 same. A man, who has contracted a custom of eating fruit by the use of
 pears or peaches, will satisfy himself with melons, where he cannot find
 his favourite fruit; as one, who has become a drunkard by the use of
 red wines, will be carried almost with the same violence to white, if
 presented to him. From this principle I have accounted for that species
 of probability, derived from analogy, where we transfer our experience
 in past instances to objects which are resembling, but are not exactly
 the same with those concerning which we have had experience. In
 proportion as the resemblance decays, the probability diminishes;
 but still has some force as long as there remain any traces of the
 resemblance.
 
 This observation we may carry farther; and may remark, that though
 custom be the foundation of all our judgments, yet sometimes it has an
 effect on the imagination in opposition to the judgment, and produces
 a contrariety in our sentiments concerning the same object. I explain
 myself. In almost all kinds of causes there is a complication of
 circumstances, of which some are essential, and others superfluous; some
 are absolutely requisite to the production of the effect, and others
 are only conjoined by accident. Now we may observe, that when these
 superfluous circumstances are numerous, and remarkable, and frequently
 conjoined with the essential, they have such an influence on the
 imagination, that even in the absence of the latter they carry us on to
 t-he conception of the usual effect, and give to that conception a force
 and vivacity, which make it superior to the mere fictions of the fancy.
 We may correct this propensity by a reflection on the nature of those
 circumstances: but it is still certain, that custom takes the start, and
 gives a biass to the imagination.
 
 To illustrate this by a familiar instance, let us consider the case of
 a man, who, being hung out from a high tower in a cage of iron cannot
 forbear trembling, when he surveys the precipice below him, though he
 knows himself to be perfectly secure from falling, by his experience of
 the solidity of the iron, which supports him; and though the ideas of
 fall and descent, and harm and death, be derived solely from custom and
 experience. The same custom goes beyond the instances, from which it is
 derived, and to which it perfectly corresponds; and influences his
 ideas of such objects as are in some respect resembling, but fall not
 precisely under the same rule. The circumstances of depth and descent
 strike so strongly upon him, that their influence can-not be destroyed
 by the contrary circumstances of support and solidity, which ought to
 give him a perfect security. His imagination runs away with its object,
 and excites a passion proportioned to it. That passion returns back
 upon the imagination and inlivens the idea; which lively idea has a
 new influence on the passion, and in its turn augments its force and
 violence; and both his fancy and affections, thus mutually supporting
 each other, cause the whole to have a very great influence upon him.
 
 But why need we seek for other instances, while the present subject
 of philosophical probabilities offers us so obvious an one, in the
 opposition betwixt the judgment and imagination arising from these
 effects of custom? According to my system, all reasonings are nothing
 but the effects of custom; and custom has no influence, but by
 inlivening the imagination, and giving us a strong conception of
 any object. It may, therefore, be concluded, that our judgment and
 imagination can never be contrary, and that custom cannot operate on
 the latter faculty after such a manner, as to render it opposite to the
 former. This difficulty we can remove after no other manner, than by
 supposing the influence of general rules. We shall afterwards take
 [Sect. 15.] notice of some general rules, by which we ought to regulate
 our judgment concerning causes and effects; and these rules are formed
 on the nature of our understanding, and on our experience of its
 operations in the judgments we form concerning objects. By them we learn
 to distinguish the accidental circumstances from the efficacious causes;
 and when we find that an effect can be produced without the concurrence
 of any particular circumstance, we conclude that that circumstance makes
 not a part of the efficacious cause, however frequently conjoined with
 it. But as this frequent conjunction necessity makes it have some effect
 on the imagination, in spite of the opposite conclusion from general
 rules, the opposition of these two principles produces a contrariety
 in our thoughts, and causes us to ascribe the one inference to our
 judgment, and the other to our imagination. The general rule is
 attributed to our judgment; as being more extensive and constant. The
 exception to the imagination, as being more capricious and uncertain.
 
 Thus our general rules are in a manner set in opposition to each other.
 When an object appears, that resembles any cause in very considerable
 circumstances, the imagination naturally carries us to a lively
 conception of the usual effect, Though the object be different in the
 most material and most efficacious circumstances from that cause. Here
 is the first influence of general rules. But when we take a review of
 this act of the mind, and compare it with the more general and authentic
 operations of the understanding, we find it to be of an irregular
 nature, and destructive of all the most established principles of
 reasonings; which is the cause of our rejecting it. This is a second
 influence of general rules, and implies the condemnation of the former.
 Sometimes the one, sometimes the other prevails, according to the
 disposition and character of the person. The vulgar are commonly guided
 by the first, and wise men by the second. Mean while the sceptics may
 here have the pleasure of observing a new and signal contradiction in
 our reason, and of seeing all philosophy ready to be subverted by a
 principle of human nature, and again saved by a new direction of
 the very same principle. The following of general rules is a very
 unphilosophical species of probability; and yet it is only by
 following them that we can correct this, and all other unphilosophical
 probabilities.
 
 Since we have instances, where general rules operate on the imagination
 even contrary to the judgment, we need not be surprized to see their
 effects encrease, when conjoined with that latter faculty, and to
 observe that they bestow on the ideas they present to us a force
 superior to what attends any other. Every one knows, there is an
 indirect manner of insinuating praise or blame, which is much less
 shocking than the open flattery or censure of any person. However he may
 communicate his sentiments by such secret insinuations, and make them
 known with equal certainty as by the open discovery of them, it is
 certain that their influence is not equally strong and powerful. One who
 lashes me with concealed strokes of satire, moves not my indignation to
 such a degree, as if he flatly told me I was a fool and coxcomb; though
 I equally understand his meaning, as if he did. This difference is to be
 attributed to the influence of general rules.
 
 Whether a person openly, abuses me, or slyly intimates his contempt, in
 neither case do I immediately perceive his sentiment or opinion; and it
 is only by signs, that is, by its effects, I become sensible of it. The
 only difference, then, betwixt these two cases consists in this, that
 in the open discovery of his sentiments he makes use of signs, which are
 general and universal; and in the secret intimation employs such as are
 more singular and uncommon. The effect of this circumstance is, that the
 imagination, in running from the present impression to the absent idea,
 makes the transition with greater facility, and consequently conceives
 the object with greater force, where the connexion is common and
 universal, than where it is more rare and particular. Accordingly we
 may observe, that the open declaration of our sentiments is called the
 taking off the mask, as the secret intimation of our opinions is said
 to be the veiling of them. The difference betwixt an idea produced by
 a general connexion, and that arising from a particular one is here
 compared to the difference betwixt an impression and an idea. This
 difference in the imagination has a suitable effect on the passions; and
 this effect is augmented by another circumstance. A secret intimation
 of anger or contempt shews that we still have some consideration for
 the person, and avoid the directly abusing him. This makes a concealed
 satire less disagreeable; but still this depends on the same principle.
 For if an idea were not more feeble, when only intimated, it would never
 be esteemed a mark of greater respect to proceed in this method than in
 the other.
 
 Sometimes scurrility is less displeasing than delicate satire, because
 it revenges us in a manner for the injury at the very time it is
 committed, by affording us a just reason to blame and contemn the
 person, who injures us. But this phaenomenon likewise depends upon the
 same principle. For why do we blame all gross and injurious language,
 unless it be, because we esteem it contrary to good breeding and
 humanity? And why is it contrary, unless it be more shocking than any
 delicate satire? The rules of good breeding condemn whatever is openly
 disobliging, and gives a sensible pain and confusion to those, with
 whom we converse. After this is once established, abusive language is
 universally blamed, and gives less pain upon account of its coarseness
 and incivility, which render the person despicable, that employs it. It
 becomes less disagreeable, merely because originally it is more so; and
 it is more disagreeable, because it affords an inference by general and
 common rules, that are palpable and undeniable.
 
 To this explication of the different influence of open and concealed
 flattery or satire, I shall add the consideration of another phenomenon,
 which is analogous to it. There are many particulars in the point of
 honour both of men and women, whose violations, when open and avowed,
 the world never excuses, but which it is more apt to overlook, when the
 appearances are saved, and the transgression is secret and concealed.
 Even those, who know with equal certainty, that the fault is committed,
 pardon it more easily, when the proofs seem in some measure oblique and
 equivocal, than when they are direct and undeniable. The same idea is
 presented in both cases, and, properly speaking, is equally assented
 to by the judgment; and yet its influence is different, because of the
 different manner, in which it is presented.
 
 Now if we compare these two cases, of the open and concealed violations
 of the laws of honour, we shall find, that the difference betwixt them
 consists in this, that in the first ease the sign, from which we infer
 the blameable action, is single, and suffices alone to be the foundation
 of our reasoning and judgment; whereas in the latter the signs are
 numerous, and decide little or nothing when alone and unaccompanyed with
 many minute circumstances, which are almost imperceptible. But it is
 certainly true, that any reasoning is always the more convincing, the
 more single and united it is to the eye, and the less exercise it gives
 to the imagination to collect all its parts, and run from them to the
 correlative idea, which forms the conclusion. The labour of the thought
 disturbs the regular progress of the sentiments, as we shall observe
 presently.[Part IV. Sect. 1.] The idea strikes not on us with ouch
 vivacity; and consequently has no such influence on the passion and
 imagination.
 
 From the same principles we may account for those observations of the
 CARDINAL DE RETZ, that there are many things, in which the world wishes
 to be deceived; and that it more easily excuses a person in acting than
 in talking contrary to the decorum of his profession and character. A
 fault in words is commonly more open and distinct than one in actions,
 which admit of many palliating excuses, and decide not so clearly
 concerning the intention and views of the actor.
 
 Thus it appears upon the whole, that every kind of opinion or judgment,
 which amounts not to knowledge, is derived entirely from the force and
 vivacity of the perception, and that these qualities constitute in the
 mind, what we call the BELIEF Of the existence of any object. This force
 and this vivacity are most conspicuous in the memory; and therefore our
 confidence in the veracity of that faculty is the greatest imaginable,
 and equals in many respects the assurance of a demonstration. The next
 degree of these qualities is that derived from the relation of cause and
 effect; and this too is very great, especially when the conjunction is
 found by experience to be perfectly constant, and when the object,
 which is present to us, exactly resembles those, of which we have had
 experience. But below this degree of evidence there are many others,
 which have an influence on the passions and imagination, proportioned to
 that degree of force and vivacity, which they communicate to the ideas.
 It is by habit we make the transition from cause to effect; and it is
 from some present impression we borrow that vivacity, which we diffuse
 over the correlative idea. But when we have not observed a sufficient
 number of instances, to produce a strong habit; or when these instances
 are contrary to each other; or when the resemblance is not exact; or
 the present impression is faint and obscure; or the experience in some
 measure obliterated from the memory; or the connexion dependent on a
 long chain of objects; or the inference derived from general rules, and
 yet not conformable to them: In all these cases the evidence diminishes
 by the diminution of the force and intenseness of the idea. This
 therefore is the nature of the judgment and probability.
 
 What principally gives authority to this system is, beside the undoubted
 arguments, upon which each part is founded, the agreement of these
 parts, and the necessity of one to explain another. The belief, which
 attends our memory, is of the same nature with that, which is derived
 from our judgments: Nor is there any difference betwixt that judgment,
 which is derived from a constant and uniform connexion of causes and
 effects, and that which depends upon an interrupted and uncertain. It is
 indeed evident, that in all determinations, where the mind decides from
 contrary experiments, it is first divided within itself, and has an
 inclination to either side in proportion to the number of experiments
 we have seen and remember. This contest is at last determined to the
 advantage of that side, where we observe a superior number of these
 experiments; but still with a diminution of force in the evidence
 correspondent to the number of the opposite experiments. Each
 possibility, of which the probability is composed, operates separately
 upon the imagination; and it is the larger collection of possibilities,
 which at last prevails, and that with a force proportionable to its
 superiority. All these phenomena lead directly to the precedent system;
 nor will it ever be possible upon any other principles to give a
 satisfactory and consistent explication of them. Without considering
 these judgments as the effects of custom on the imagination, we shall
 lose ourselves in perpetual contradiction and absurdity.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. XIV. OF THE IDEA OF NECESSARY CONNEXION.
 
 
 Having thus explained the manner, in which we reason beyond our
 immediate impressions, and conclude that such particular causes must
 have such particular effects; we must now return upon our footsteps to
 examine that question, which [Sect. 2.] first occured to us, and which
 we dropt in our way, viz. What is our idea of necessity, when we say
 that two objects are necessarily connected together. Upon this head I
 repeat what I have often had occasion to observe, that as we have
 no idea, that is not derived from an impression, we must find some
 impression, that gives rise to this idea of necessity, if we assert we
 have really such an idea. In order to this I consider, in what objects
 necessity is commonly supposed to lie; and finding that it is always
 ascribed to causes and effects, I turn my eye to two objects supposed to
 be placed in that relation; and examine them in all the situations,
 of which they are susceptible. I immediately perceive, that they are
 contiguous in time and place, and that the object we call cause precedes
 the other we call effect. In no one instance can I go any farther,
 nor is it possible for me to discover any third relation betwixt these
 objects. I therefore enlarge my view to comprehend several instances;
 where I find like objects always existing in like relations of
 contiguity and succession. At first sight this seems to serve but little
 to my purpose. The reflection on several instances only repeats the
 same objects; and therefore can never give rise to a new idea. But upon
 farther enquiry I find, that the repetition is not in every particular
 the same, but produces a new impression, and by that means the idea,
 which I at present examine. For after a frequent repetition, I find,
 that upon the appearance of one of the objects, the mind is determined
 by custom to consider its usual attendant, and to consider it in a
 stronger light upon account of its relation to the first object. It is
 this impression, then, or determination, which affords me the idea of
 necessity.
 
 I doubt not but these consequences will at first sight be received
 without difficulty, as being evident deductions from principles, which
 we have already established, and which we have often employed in our
 reasonings. This evidence both in the first principles, and in the
 deductions, may seduce us unwarily into the conclusion, and make us
 imagine it contains nothing extraordinary, nor worthy of our curiosity.
 But though such an inadvertence may facilitate the reception of this
 reasoning, it will make it be the more easily forgot; for which reason
 I think it proper to give warning, that I have just now examined one of
 the most sublime questions in philosophy, viz. that concerning the power
 and efficacy of causes; where all the sciences seem so much interested.
 Such a warning will naturally rouze up the attention of the reader, and
 make him desire a more full account of my doctrine, as well as of the
 arguments, on which it is founded. This request is so reasonable, that
 I cannot refuse complying with it; especially as I am hopeful that these
 principles, the more they are examined, will acquire the more force and
 evidence.
 
 There is no question, which on account of its importance, as well as
 difficulty, has caused more disputes both among antient and modern
 philosophers, than this concerning the efficacy of causes, or that
 quality which makes them be followed by their effects. But before they
 entered upon these disputes, methinks it would not have been improper to
 have examined what idea we have of that efficacy, which is the subject
 of the controversy. This is what I find principally wanting in their
 reasonings, and what I shall here endeavour to supply.
 
 I begin with observing that the terms of EFFICACY, AGENCY, POWER, FORCE,
 ENERGY, NECESSITY, CONNEXION, and PRODUCTIVE QUALITY, are all nearly
 synonymous; and therefore it is an absurdity to employ any of them in
 defining the rest. By this observation we reject at once all the vulgar
 definitions, which philosophers have given of power and efficacy; and
 instead of searching for the idea in these definitions, must look for
 it in the impressions, from which it is originally derived. If it be a
 compound idea, it must arise from compound impressions. If simple, from
 simple impressions.
 
 I believe the most general and most popular explication of this
 matter, is to say [See Mr. Locke, chapter of power.], that finding from
 experience, that there are several new productions in matter, such
 as the motions and variations of body, and concluding that there must
 somewhere be a power capable of producing them, we arrive at last by
 this reasoning at the idea of power and efficacy. But to be convinced
 that this explication is more popular than philosophical, we need but
 reflect on two very obvious principles. First, That reason alone can
 never give rise to any original idea, and secondly, that reason, as
 distinguished from experience, can never make us conclude, that a cause
 or productive quality is absolutely requisite to every beginning of
 existence. Both these considerations have been sufficiently explained:
 and therefore shall not at present be any farther insisted on.
 
 I shall only infer from them, that since reason can never give rise to
 the idea of efficacy, that idea must be derived from experience, and
 from some particular instances of this efficacy, which make their
 passage into the mind by the common channels of sensation or reflection.
 Ideas always represent their objects or impressions; and vice versa,
 there are some objects necessary to give rise to every idea. If we
 pretend, therefore, to have any just idea of this efficacy, we must
 produce some instance, wherein the efficacy is plainly discoverable to
 the mind, and its operations obvious to our consciousness or sensation.
 By the refusal of this, we acknowledge, that the idea is impossible and
 imaginary, since the principle of innate ideas, which alone can save
 us from this dilemma, has been already refuted, and is now almost
 universally rejected in the learned world. Our present business,
 then, must be to find some natural production, where the operation and
 efficacy of a cause can be clearly conceived and comprehended by the
 mind, without any danger of obscurity or mistake.
 
 In this research we meet with very little encouragement from that
 prodigious diversity, which is found in the opinions of those
 philosophers, who have pretended to explain the secret force and energy
 of causes. [See Father Malbranche, Book vi. Part 2, chap. 3. And the
 illustrations upon it.] There are some, who maintain, that bodies
 operate by their substantial form; others, by their accidents or
 qualities; several, by their matter and form; some, by their form and
 accidents; others, by certain virtues and faculties distinct from all
 this. All these sentiments again are mixed and varyed in a thousand
 different ways; and form a strong presumption, that none of them have
 any solidity or evidence, and that the supposition of an efficacy in any
 of the known qualities of matter is entirely without foundation.
 This presumption must encrease upon us, when we consider, that these
 principles of substantial forms, and accidents, and faculties, are not
 in reality any of the known properties of bodies, but are perfectly
 unintelligible and inexplicable. For it is evident philosophers would
 never have had recourse to such obscure and uncertain principles, had
 they met with any satisfaction in such as are clear and intelligible;
 especially in such an affair as this, which must be an object of the
 simplest understanding, if not of the senses. Upon the whole, we
 may conclude, that it is impossible in any one instance to shew the
 principle, in which the force and agency of a cause is placed; and that
 the most refined and most vulgar understandings are equally at a loss
 in this particular. If any one think proper to refute this assertion,
 he need not put himself to the trouble of inventing any long reasonings:
 but may at once shew us an instance of a cause, where we discover the
 power or operating principle. This defiance we are obliged frequently
 to make use of, as being almost the only means of proving a negative in
 philosophy.
 
 The small success, which has been met with in all the attempts to fix
 this power, has at last obliged philosophers to conclude, that the
 ultimate force and efficacy of nature is perfectly unknown to us,
 and that it is in vain we search for it in all the known qualities of
 matter. In this opinion they are almost unanimous; and it is only in the
 inference they draw from it, that they discover any difference in their
 sentiments. For some of them, as the CARTESIANS in particular, having
 established it as a principle, that we are perfectly acquainted with the
 essence of matter, have very naturally inferred, that it is endowed with
 no efficacy, and that it is impossible for it of itself to communicate
 motion, or produce any of those effects, which we ascribe to it. As the
 essence of matter consists in extension, and as extension implies not
 actual motion, but only mobility; they conclude, that the energy, which
 produces the motion, cannot lie in the extension.
 
 This conclusion leads them into another, which they regard as perfectly
 unavoidable. Matter, say they, is in itself entirely unactive, and
 deprived of any power, by which it may produce, or continue, or
 communicate motion: But since these effects are evident to our senses,
 and since the power, that produces them, must be placed somewhere, it
 must lie in the DEITY, or that divine being, who contains in his nature
 all excellency and perfection. It is the deity, therefore, who is the
 prime mover of the universe, and who not only first created matter, and
 gave it it's original impulse, but likewise by a continued exertion of
 omnipotence, supports its existence, and successively bestows on it
 all those motions, and configurations, and qualities, with which it is
 endowed.
 
 This opinion is certainly very curious, and well worth our attention;
 but it will appear superfluous to examine it in this place, if we
 reflect a moment on our present purpose in taking notice of it. We
 have established it as a principle, that as all ideas are derived from
 impressions, or some precedent perceptions, it is impossible we can have
 any idea of power and efficacy, unless some instances can be produced,
 wherein this power is perceived to exert itself. Now, as these instances
 can never be discovered in body, the Cartesians, proceeding upon their
 principle of innate ideas, have had recourse to a supreme spirit or
 deity, whom they consider as the only active being in the universe, and
 as the immediate cause of every alteration in matter. But the principle
 of innate ideas being allowed to be false, it follows, that the
 supposition of a deity can serve us in no stead, in accounting for that
 idea of agency, which we search for in vain in all the objects, which
 are presented to our senses, or which we are internally conscious of in
 our own minds. For if every idea be derived from an impression, the idea
 of a deity proceeds from the same origin; and if no impression, either
 of sensation or reflection, implies any force or efficacy, it is equally
 impossible to discover or even imagine any such active principle in the
 deity. Since these philosophers, therefore, have concluded, that
 matter cannot be endowed with any efficacious principle, because it
 is impossible to discover in it such a principle; the same course of
 reasoning should determine them to exclude it from the supreme being. Or
 if they esteem that opinion absurd and impious, as it really is, I shall
 tell them how they may avoid it; and that is, by concluding from the
 very first, that they have no adequate idea of power or efficacy in
 any object; since neither in body nor spirit, neither in superior nor
 inferior natures, are they able to discover one single instance of it.
 
 The same conclusion is unavoidable upon the hypothesis of those, who
 maintain the efficacy of second causes, and attribute a derivative, but
 a real power and energy to matter. For as they confess, that this energy
 lies not in any of the known qualities of matter, the difficulty still
 remains concerning the origin of its idea. If we have really an idea
 of power, we may attribute power to an unknown quality: But as it is
 impossible, that that idea can be derived from such a quality, and as
 there is nothing in known qualities, which can produce it; it follows
 that we deceive ourselves, when we imagine we are possest of any idea
 of this kind, after the manner we commonly understand it. All ideas are
 derived from, and represent impressions. We never have any impression,
 that contains any power or efficacy. We never therefore have any idea of
 power.
 
 Some have asserted, that we feel an energy, or power, in our own mind;
 and that having in this manner acquired the idea of power, we transfer
 that quality to matter, where we are not able immediately to discover
 it. The motions of our body, and the thoughts and sentiments of our
 mind, (say they) obey the will; nor do we seek any farther to acquire
 a just notion of force or power. But to convince us how fallacious this
 reasoning is, we need only consider, that the will being here considered
 as a cause, has no more a discoverable connexion with its effects, than
 any material cause has with its proper effect. So far from perceiving
 the connexion betwixt an act of volition, and a motion of the body;
 it is allowed that no effect is more inexplicable from the powers and
 essence of thought and matter. Nor is the empire of the will over
 our mind more intelligible. The effect is there distinguishable
 and separable from the cause, and coued not be foreseen without the
 experience of their constant conjunction. We have command over our mind
 to a certain degree, but beyond that, lose all empire over it: And it is
 evidently impossible to fix any precise bounds to our authority, where
 we consult not experience. In short, the actions of the mind are, in
 this respect, the same with those of matter. We perceive only their
 constant conjunction; nor can we ever reason beyond it. No internal
 impression has an apparent energy, more than external objects have.
 Since, therefore, matter is confessed by philosophers to operate by
 an unknown force, we should in vain hope to attain an idea of force by
 consulting our own minds. [Footnote 8.]
 
 
      [Footnote 8. The same imperfection attends our ideas of the
      Deity; but this can have no effect either on religion or
      morals. The order of the universe proves an omnipotent mind;
      that is, a mind whose wili is CONSTANTLY ATTENDED with the
      obedience of every creature and being. Nothing more is
      requisite to give a foundation to all the articles of
      religion, nor is It necessary we shoud form a distinct idea
      of the force and energy of the supreme Being.]
 
 It has been established as a certain principle, that general or abstract
 ideas are nothing but individual ones taken in a certain light, and
 that, in reflecting on any object, it is as impossible to exclude from
 our thought all particular degrees of quantity and quality as from the
 real nature of things. If we be possest, therefore, of any idea of power
 in general, we must also be able to conceive some particular species
 of it; and as power cannot subsist alone, but is always regarded as an
 attribute of some being or existence, we must be able to place this
 power in some particular being, and conceive that being as endowed with
 a real force and energy, by which such a particular effect necessarily
 results from its operation. We must distinctly and particularly conceive
 the connexion betwixt the cause and effect, and be able to pronounce,
 from a simple view of the one, that it must be followed or preceded by
 the other. This is the true manner of conceiving a particular power in
 a particular body: and a general idea being impossible without an
 individual; where the latter is impossible, it is certain the former
 can never exist. Now nothing is more evident, than that the human mind
 cannot form such an idea of two objects, as to conceive any connexion
 betwixt them, or comprehend distinctly that power or efficacy, by which
 they are united. Such a connexion would amount to a demonstration, and
 would imply the absolute impossibility for the one object not to follow,
 or to be conceived not to follow upon the other: Which kind of connexion
 has already been rejected in all cases. If any one is of a contrary
 opinion, and thinks he has attained a notion of power in any particular
 object, I desire he may point out to me that object. But till I meet
 with such-a-one, which I despair of, I cannot forbear concluding, that
 since we can never distinctly conceive how any particular power can
 possibly reside in any particular object, we deceive ourselves in
 imagining we can form any such general idea.
 
 Thus upon the whole we may infer, that when we talk of any being,
 whether of a superior or inferior nature, as endowed with a power
 or force, proportioned to any effect; when we speak of a necessary
 connexion betwixt objects, and suppose, that this connexion depends upon
 an efficacy or energy, with which any of these objects are endowed; in
 all these expressions, so applied, we have really no distinct meaning,
 and make use only of common words, without any clear and determinate
 ideas. But as it is more probable, that these expressions do here lose
 their true meaning by being wrong applied, than that they never have
 any meaning; it will be proper to bestow another consideration on this
 subject, to see if possibly we can discover the nature and origin of
 those ideas, we annex to them.
 
 Suppose two objects to be presented to us, of which the one is the
 cause and the other the effect; it is plain, that from the simple
 consideration of one, or both these objects we never shall perceive the
 tie by which they are united, or be able certainly to pronounce, that
 there is a connexion betwixt them. It is not, therefore, from any one
 instance, that we arrive at the idea of cause and effect, of a necessary
 connexion of power, of force, of energy, and of efficacy. Did we never
 see any but particular conjunctions of objects, entirely different from
 each other, we should never be able to form any such ideas.
 
 But again; suppose we observe several instances, in which the same
 objects are always conjoined together, we immediately conceive a
 connexion betwixt them, and begin to draw an inference from one
 to another. This multiplicity of resembling instances, therefore,
 constitutes the very essence of power or connexion, and is the source
 from which the idea of it arises. In order, then, to understand the idea
 of power, we must consider that multiplicity; nor do I ask more to give
 a solution of that difficulty, which has so long perplexed us. For thus
 I reason. The repetition of perfectly similar instances can never alone
 give rise to an original idea, different from what is to be found in any
 particular instance, as has been observed, and as evidently follows from
 our fundamental principle, that all ideas are copyed from impressions.
 Since therefore the idea of power is a new original idea, not to be
 found in any one instance, and which yet arises from the repetition of
 several instances, it follows, that the repetition alone has not that
 effect, but must either discover or produce something new, which is the
 source of that idea. Did the repetition neither discover nor produce
 anything new, our ideas might be multiplyed by it, but would not
 be enlarged above what they are upon the observation of one single
 instance. Every enlargement, therefore, (such as the idea of power or
 connexion) which arises from the multiplicity of similar instances,
 is copyed from some effects of the multiplicity, and will be perfectly
 understood by understanding these effects. Wherever we find anything new
 to be discovered or produced by the repetition, there we must place the
 power, and must never look for it in any other object.
 
 But it is evident, in the first place, that the repetition of like
 objects in like relations of succession and contiguity discovers nothing
 new in any one of them: since we can draw no inference from it, nor make
 it a subject either of our demonstrative or probable reasonings;[Sect.
 6.] as has been already proved. Nay suppose we coued draw an inference,
 it would be of no consequence in the present case; since no kind of
 reasoning can give rise to a new idea, such as this of power is; but
 wherever we reason, we must antecedently be possest of clear ideas,
 which may be the objects of our reasoning. The conception always
 precedes the understanding; and where the one is obscure, the other is
 uncertain; where the one fails, the other must fail also.
 
 Secondly, It is certain that this repetition of similar objects in
 similar situations produces nothing new either in these objects, or
 in any external body. For it will readily be allowed, that the several
 instances we have of the conjunction of resembling causes and effects
 are in themselves entirely independent, and that the communication
 of motion, which I see result at present from the shock of two
 billiard-balls, is totally distinct from that which I saw result from
 such an impulse a twelve-month ago. These impulses have no influence
 on each other. They are entirely divided by time and place; and the one
 might have existed and communicated motion, though the other never had
 been in being.
 
 There is, then, nothing new either discovered or produced in any objects
 by their constant conjunction, and by the uninterrupted resemblance
 of their relations of succession and contiguity. But it is from this
 resemblance, that the ideas of necessity, of power, and of efficacy, are
 derived. These ideas, therefore, represent not anything, that does or
 can belong to the objects, which are constantly conjoined. This is
 an argument, which, in every view we can examine it, will be found
 perfectly unanswerable. Similar instances are still the first source
 of our idea of power or necessity; at the same time that they have no
 influence by their similarity either on each other, or on any external
 object. We must, therefore, turn ourselves to some other quarter to seek
 the origin of that idea.
 
 Though the several resembling instances, which give rise to the idea of
 power, have no influence on each other, and can never produce any new
 quality in the object, which can be the model of that idea, yet the
 observation of this resemblance produces a new impression in the mind,
 which is its real model. For after we have observed the resemblance in
 a sufficient number of instances, we immediately feel a determination of
 the mind to pass from one object to its usual attendant, and to conceive
 it in a stronger light upon account of that relation. This determination
 is the only effect of the resemblance; and therefore must be the same
 with power or efficacy, whose idea is derived from the resemblance. The
 several instances of resembling conjunctions lead us into the notion of
 power and necessity. These instances are in themselves totally distinct
 from each other, and have no union but in the mind, which observes
 them, and collects their ideas. Necessity, then, is the effect of this
 observation, and is nothing but an internal impression of the mind,
 or a determination to carry our thoughts from one object to another.
 Without considering it in this view, we can never arrive at the most
 distant notion of it, or be able to attribute it either to external or
 internal objects, to spirit or body, to causes or effects.
 
 The necessary connexion betwixt causes and effects is the foundation of
 our inference from one to the other. The foundation of our inference is
 the transition arising from the accustomed union. These are, therefore,
 the same.
 
 The idea of necessity arises from some impression. There is no
 impression conveyed by our senses, which can give rise to that idea. It
 must, therefore, be derived from some internal impression, or impression
 of reflection. There is no internal impression, which has any relation
 to the present business, but that propensity, which custom produces, to
 pass from an object to the idea of its usual attendant. This therefore
 is the essence of necessity. Upon the whole, necessity is something,
 that exists in the mind, not in objects; nor is it possible for us ever
 to form the most distant idea of it, considered as a quality in bodies.
 Either we have no idea of necessity, or necessity is nothing but that
 determination of the thought to pass from causes to effects, and from
 effects to causes, according to their experienced union.
 
 Thus as the necessity, which makes two times two equal to four, or three
 angles of a triangle equal to two right ones, lies only in the act of
 the understanding, by which we consider and compare these ideas; in like
 manner the necessity or power, which unites causes and effects, lies
 in the determination of the mind to pass from the one to the other. The
 efficacy or energy of causes is neither placed in the causes themselves,
 nor in the deity, nor in the concurrence of these two principles; but
 belongs entirely to the soul, which considers the union of two or more
 objects in all past instances. It is here that the real power of causes
 is placed along with their connexion and necessity.
 
 I am sensible, that of all the paradoxes, which I, have had, or shall
 hereafter have occasion to advance in the course of this treatise, the
 present one is the most violent, and that it is merely by dint of solid
 proof and reasoning I can ever hope it will have admission, and overcome
 the inveterate prejudices of mankind. Before we are reconciled to this
 doctrine, how often must we repeat to ourselves, that the simple view of
 any two objects or actions, however related, can never give us any idea,
 of power, or of a connexion betwixt them: that this idea arises from
 the repetition of their union: that the repetition neither discovers nor
 causes any thing in the objects, but has an influence only on the mind,
 by that customary transition it produces: that this customary transition
 is, therefore, the same with the power and necessity; which are
 consequently qualities of perceptions, not of objects, and are
 internally felt by the soul, and not perceivd externally in bodies?
 There is commonly an astonishment attending every thing extraordinary;
 and this astonishment changes immediately into the highest degree
 of esteem or contempt, according as we approve or disapprove of the
 subject. I am much afraid, that though the foregoing reasoning appears
 to me the shortest and most decisive imaginable; yet with the generality
 of readers the biass of the mind will prevail, and give them a prejudice
 against the present doctrine.
 
 This contrary biass is easily accounted for. It is a common observation,
 that the mind has a great propensity to spread itself on external
 objects, and to conjoin with them any internal impressions, which they
 occasion, and which always make their appearance at the same time that
 these objects discover themselves to the senses. Thus as certain sounds
 and smells are always found to attend certain visible objects, we
 naturally imagine a conjunction, even in place, betwixt the objects and
 qualities, though the qualities be of such a nature as to admit of no
 such conjunction, and really exist no where. But of this more fully
 hereafter [Part IV, Sect. 5.]. Mean while it is sufficient to observe,
 that the same propensity is the reason, why we suppose necessity and
 power to lie in the objects we consider, not in our mind that considers
 them; notwithstanding it is not possible for us to form the most distant
 idea of that quality, when it is not taken for the determination of the
 mind, to pass from the idea of an object to that of its usual attendant.
 
 But though this be the only reasonable account we can give of necessity,
 the contrary notion if; so riveted in the mind from the principles
 above-mentioned, that I doubt not but my sentiments will be treated by
 many as extravagant and ridiculous. What! the efficacy of causes lie
 in the determination of the mind! As if causes did not operate entirely
 independent of the mind, and would not continue their operation,
 even though there was no mind existent to contemplate them, or reason
 concerning them. Thought may well depend on causes for its operation,
 but not causes on thought. This is to reverse the order of nature, and
 make that secondary, which is really primary, To every operation there
 is a power proportioned; and this power must be placed on the body, that
 operates. If we remove the power from one cause, we must ascribe it to
 another: But to remove it from all causes, and bestow it on a being,
 that is no ways related to the cause or effect, but by perceiving them,
 is a gross absurdity, and contrary to the most certain principles of
 human reason.
 
 I can only reply to all these arguments, that the case is here much the
 same, as if a blind man should pretend to find a great many absurdities
 in the supposition, that the colour of scarlet is not the same with the
 sound of a trumpet, nor light the same with solidity. If we have really
 no idea of a power or efficacy in any object, or of any real connexion
 betwixt causes and effects, it will be to little purpose to prove, that
 an efficacy is necessary in all operations. We do not understand our own
 meaning in talking so, but ignorantly confound ideas, which are entirely
 distinct from each other. I am, indeed, ready to allow, that there may
 be several qualities both in material and immaterial objects, with which
 we are utterly unacquainted; and if we please to call these POWER or
 EFFICACY, it will be of little consequence to the world. But when,
 instead of meaning these unknown qualities, we make the terms of power
 and efficacy signify something, of which we have a clear idea, and which
 is incompatible with those objects, to which we apply it, obscurity
 and error begin then to take place, and we are led astray by a false
 philosophy. This is the case, when we transfer the determination of the
 thought to external objects, and suppose any real intelligible connexion
 betwixt them; that being a quality, which can only belong to the mind
 that considers them.
 
 As to what may be said, that the operations of nature are independent
 of our thought and reasoning, I allow it; and accordingly have observed,
 that objects bear to each other the relations of contiguity and
 succession: that like objects may be observed in several instances to
 have like relations; and that all this is independent of, and antecedent
 to the operations of the understanding. But if we go any farther, and
 ascribe a power or necessary connexion to these objects; this is what
 we can never observe in them, but must draw the idea of it from what we
 feel internally in contemplating them. And this I carry so far, that I
 am ready to convert my present reasoning into an instance of it, by a
 subtility, which it will not be difficult to comprehend.
 
 When any object is presented to us, it immediately conveys to the mind
 a lively idea of that object, which is usually found to attend it; and
 this determination of the mind forms the necessary connexion of these
 objects. But when we change the point of view, from the objects to the
 perceptions; in that case the impression is to be considered as the
 cause, and the lively idea as the effect; and their necessary connexion
 is that new determination, which we feel to pass from the idea of the
 one to that of the other. The uniting principle among our internal
 perceptions is as unintelligible as that among external objects, and
 is not known to us any other way than by experience. Now the nature
 and effects of experience have been already sufficiently examined and
 explained. It never gives us any insight into the internal structure or
 operating principle of objects, but only accustoms the mind to pass from
 one to another.
 
 It is now time to collect all the different parts of this reasoning,
 and by joining them together form an exact definition of the relation of
 cause and effect, which makes the subject of the present enquiry. This
 order would not have been excusable, of first examining our inference
 from the relation before we had explained the relation itself, had it
 been possible to proceed in a different method. But as the nature of the
 relation depends so much on that of the inference, we have been obliged
 to advance in this seemingly preposterous manner, and make use of terms
 before we were able exactly to define them, or fix their meaning. We
 shall now correct this fault by giving a precise definition of cause and
 effect.
 
 There may two definitions be given of this relation, which are only
 different, by their presenting a different view of the same object,
 and making us consider it either as a philosophical or as a natural
 relation; either as a comparison of two ideas, or as an association
 betwixt them. We may define a CAUSE to be An object precedent and
 contiguous to another, and where all the objects resembling the former
 are placed in like relations of precedency and contiguity to those
 objects that resemble the latter. I If this definition be esteemed
 defective, because drawn from objects foreign to the cause, we may
 substitute this other definition in its place, viz. A CAUSE is an object
 precedent and contiguous to another, and so united with it, that the
 idea, of the one determines the mind to form the idea of the other, and
 the impression of the one to form a more lively idea of the other. 2
 should this definition also be rejected for the same reason, I know no
 other remedy, than that the persons, who express this delicacy, should
 substitute a juster definition in its place. But for my part I must own
 my incapacity for such an undertaking. When I examine with the utmost
 accuracy those objects, which are commonly denominated causes and
 effects, I find, in considering a single instance, that the one object
 is precedent and contiguous to the other; and in inlarging my view
 to consider several instances, I find only, that like objects are
 constantly placed in like relations of succession and contiguity. Again,
 when I consider the influence of this constant conjunction, I perceive,
 that such a relation can never be an object of reasoning, and can never
 operate upon the mind, but by means of custom, which determines the
 imagination to make a transition from the idea of one object to that
 of its usual attendant, and from the impression of one to a more lively
 idea of the other. However extraordinary these sentiments may appear,
 I think it fruitless to trouble myself with any farther enquiry or
 reasoning upon the subject, but shall repose myself on them as on
 established maxims.
 
 It will only be proper, before we leave this subject, to draw some
 corrollaries from it, by which we may remove several prejudices and
 popular errors, that have very much prevailed in philosophy. First, We
 may learn from the foregoing, doctrine, that all causes are of the
 same kind, and that in particular there is no foundation for that
 distinction, which we sometimes make betwixt efficient causes and causes
 sine qua non; or betwixt efficient causes, and formal, and material, and
 exemplary, and final causes. For as our idea of efficiency is derived
 from the constant conjunction of two objects, wherever this is observed,
 the cause is efficient; and where it is not, there can never be a cause
 of any kind. For the same reason we must reject the distinction betwixt
 cause and occasion, when supposed to signify any thing essentially
 different from each other. If constant conjunction be implyed in what we
 call occasion, it is a real cause. If not, it is no relation at all, and
 cannot give rise to any argument or reasoning.
 
 Secondly, The same course of reasoning will make us conclude, that there
 is but one kind of necessity, as there is but one kind of cause, and
 that the common distinction betwixt moral and physical necessity
 is without any foundation in nature. This clearly appears from the
 precedent explication of necessity. It is the constant conjunction of
 objects, along with the determination of the mind, which constitutes
 a physical necessity: And the removal of these is the same thing with
 chance. As objects must either be conjoined or not, and as the mind must
 either be determined or not to pass from one object to another, it
 is impossible to admit of any medium betwixt chance and an absolute
 necessity. In weakening this conjunction and determination you do not
 change the nature of the necessity; since even in the operation of
 bodies, these have different degrees of constancy and force, without
 producing a different species of that relation.
 
 The distinction, which we often make betwixt POWER and the EXERCISE of
 it, is equally without foundation.
 
 Thirdly, We may now be able fully to overcome all that repugnance, which
 it is so natural for us to entertain against the foregoing reasoning,
 by which we endeavoured to prove, that the necessity of a cause to
 every beginning of existence is not founded on any arguments either
 demonstrative or intuitive. Such an opinion will not appear strange
 after the foregoing definitions. If we define a cause to be an
 object precedent and contiguous to another, and where all the objects
 resembling the farmer are placed in a like relation of priority and
 contiguity to those objects, that resemble the latter; we may easily
 conceive, that there is no absolute nor metaphysical necessity, that
 every beginning of existence should be attended with such an object. If
 we define a cause to be, AN OBJECT PRECEDENT AND CONTIGUOUS TO ANOTHER,
 AND SO UNITED WITH IT IN THE IMAGINATION, THAT THE IDEA OF THE ONE
 DETERMINES THE MIND TO FORM THE IDEA OF THE OTHER, AND THE IMPRESSION
 OF THE ONE TO FORM A MORE LIVELY IDEA OF THE OTHER; we shall make still
 less difficulty of assenting to this opinion. Such an influence on the
 mind is in itself perfectly extraordinary and incomprehensible; nor can
 we be certain of its reality, but from experience and observation.
 
 I shall add as a fourth corrollary that we can never have reason to
 believe that any object exists, of which we cannot form an idea. For as
 all our reasonings concerning existence are derived from causation,
 and as all our reasonings concerning causation are derived from
 the experienced conjunction of objects, not from any reasoning or
 reflection, the same experience must give us a notion of these objects,
 and must remove all mystery from our conclusions. This is so evident,
 that it would scarce have merited our attention, were it not to obviate
 certain objections of this kind, which might arise against the following
 reasonings concerning matter and substance. I need not observe, that
 a full knowledge of the object is not requisite, but only of those
 qualities of it, which we believe to exist.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. XV. RULES BY WHICH TO JUDGE OF CAUSES AND EFFECTS.
 
 
 According to the precedent doctrine, there are no objects which by the
 mere survey, without consulting experience, we can determine to be the
 causes of any other; and no objects, which we can certainly determine in
 the same manner not to be the causes. Any thing may produce any thing.
 Creation, annihilation, motion, reason, volition; all these may arise
 from one another, or from any other object we can imagine. Nor will this
 appear strange, if we compare two principles explained above, THAT THE
 CONSTANT CONJUNCTION OF OBJECTS DETERMINES THEIR CAUSATION, AND [Part I.
 Sect. 5.] THAT, PROPERTY SPEAKING, NO OBJECTS ARE CONTRARY TO EACH OTHER
 BUT EXISTENCE AND NON-EXISTENCE. Where objects are not contrary,
 nothing hinders them from having that constant conjunction, on which the
 relation of cause and effect totally depends.
 
 Since therefore it is possible for all objects to become causes or
 effects to each other, it may be proper to fix some general rules, by
 which we may know when they really are so.
 
 (1) The cause and effect must be contiguous in space and time.
 
 (2) The cause must be prior to the effect.
 
 (3) There must be a constant union betwixt the cause and effect. It is
 chiefly this quality, that constitutes the relation.
 
 (4) The same cause always produces the same effect, and the same effect
 never arises but from the same cause. This principle we derive from
 experience, and is the source of most of our philosophical reasonings.
 For when by any clear experiment we have discovered the causes or
 effects of any phaenomenon, we immediately extend our observation to
 every phenomenon of the same kind, without waiting for that constant
 repetition, from which the first idea of this relation is derived.
 
 (5) There is another principle, which hangs upon this, viz. that where
 several different objects produce the same effect, it must be by means
 of some quality, which we discover to be common amongst them. For as
 like effects imply like causes, we must always ascribe the causation to
 the circumstance, wherein we discover the resemblance.
 
 (6) The following principle is founded on the same reason. The
 difference in the effects of two resembling objects must proceed from
 that particular, in which they differ. For as like causes always
 produce like effects, when in any instance we find our expectation to be
 disappointed, we must conclude that this irregularity proceeds from some
 difference in the causes.
 
 (7) When any object encreases or diminishes with the encrease or
 diminution of its cause, it is to be regarded as a compounded effect,
 derived from the union of the several different effects, which arise
 from the several different parts of the cause. The absence or presence
 of one part of the cause is here supposed to be always attended with
 the absence or presence of a proportionable part of the effect. This
 constant conjunction sufficiently proves, that the one part is the cause
 of the other. We must, however, beware not to draw such a conclusion
 from a few experiments. A certain degree of heat gives pleasure; if you
 diminish that heat, the pleasure diminishes; but it does not follow,
 that if you augment it beyond a certain degree, the pleasure will
 likewise augment; for we find that it degenerates into pain.
 
 (8) The eighth and last rule I shall take notice of is, that an object,
 which exists for any time in its full perfection without any effect, is
 not the sole cause of that effect, but requires to be assisted by some
 other principle, which may forward its influence and operation. For as
 like effects necessarily follow from like causes, and in a contiguous
 time and place, their separation for a moment shews, that these causes
 are not compleat ones.
 
 Here is all the LOGIC I think proper to employ in my reasoning; and
 perhaps even this was not very necessary, but might have been supplyd by
 the natural principles of our understanding. Our scholastic head-pieces
 and logicians shew no such superiority above the mere vulgar in their
 reason and ability, as to give us any inclination to imitate them in
 delivering a long system of rules and precepts to direct our judgment,
 in philosophy. All the rules of this nature are very easy in their
 invention, but extremely difficult in their application; and even
 experimental philosophy, which seems the most natural and simple of any,
 requires the utmost stretch of human judgment. There is no phaenomenon
 in nature, but what is compounded and modifyd by so many different
 circumstances, that in order to arrive at the decisive point, we
 must carefully separate whatever is superfluous, and enquire by new
 experiments, if every particular circumstance of the first experiment
 was essential to it. These new experiments are liable to a discussion
 of the same kind; so that the utmost constancy is requird to make us
 persevere in our enquiry, and the utmost sagacity to choose the right
 way among so many that present themselves. If this be the case even
 in natural philosophy, how much more in moral, where there is a much
 greater complication of circumstances, and where those views and
 sentiments, which are essential to any action of the mind, are so
 implicit and obscure, that they often escape our strictest attention,
 and are not only unaccountable in their causes, but even unknown in
 their existence? I am much afraid lest the small success I meet with
 in my enquiries will make this observation bear the air of an apology
 rather than of boasting.
 
 If any thing can give me security in this particular, it will be the
 enlarging of the sphere of my experiments as much as possible; for which
 reason it may be proper in this place to examine the reasoning faculty
 of brutes, as well as that of human creatures.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. XVI OF THE REASON OF ANIMALS
 
 
 Next to the ridicule of denying an evident truth, is that of taking much
 pains to defend it; and no truth appears to me more evident, than that
 beasts are endowd with thought and reason as well as men. The arguments
 are in this case so obvious, that they never escape the most stupid and
 ignorant.
 
 We are conscious, that we ourselves, in adapting means to ends, are
 guided by reason and design, and that it is not ignorantly nor casually
 we perform those actions, which tend to self-preservation, to the
 obtaining pleasure, and avoiding pain. When therefore we see other
 creatures, in millions of instances, perform like actions, and direct
 them to the ends, all our principles of reason and probability carry us
 with an invincible force to believe the existence of a like cause. It is
 needless in my opinion to illustrate this argument by the enumeration
 of particulars. The smallest attention will supply us with more than are
 requisite. The resemblance betwixt the actions of animals and those
 of men is so entire in this respect, that the very first action of
 the first animal we shall please to pitch on, will afford us an
 incontestable argument for the present doctrine.
 
 This doctrine is as useful as it is obvious, and furnishes us with a
 kind of touchstone, by which we may try every system in this species
 of philosophy. It is from the resemblance of the external actions of
 animals to those we ourselves perform, that we judge their internal
 likewise to resemble ours; and the same principle of reasoning, carryd
 one step farther, will make us conclude that since our internal actions
 resemble each other, the causes, from which they are derivd, must also
 be resembling. When any hypothesis, therefore, is advancd to explain a
 mental operation, which is common to men and beasts, we must apply the
 same hypothesis to both; and as every true hypothesis will abide this
 trial, so I may venture to affirm, that no false one will ever be able
 to endure it. The common defect of those systems, which philosophers
 have employd to account for the actions of the mind, is, that they
 suppose such a subtility and refinement of thought, as not only exceeds
 the capacity of mere animals, but even of children and the common people
 in our own species; who are notwithstanding susceptible of the same
 emotions and affections as persons of the most accomplishd genius and
 understanding. Such a subtility is a dear proof of the falshood, as the
 contrary simplicity of the truth, of any system.
 
 Let us therefore put our present system concerning the nature of the
 understanding to this decisive trial, and see whether it will equally
 account for the reasonings of beasts as for these of the human species.
 
 Here we must make a distinction betwixt those actions of animals, which
 are of a vulgar nature, and seem to be on a level with their common
 capacities, and those more extraordinary instances of sagacity, which
 they sometimes discover for their own preservation, and the propagation
 of their species. A dog, that avoids fire and precipices, that shuns
 strangers, and caresses his master, affords us an instance of the first
 kind. A bird, that chooses with such care and nicety the place and
 materials of her nest, and sits upon her eggs for a due time, and in
 suitable season, with all the precaution that a chymist is capable of in
 the most delicate projection, furnishes us with a lively instance of the
 second.
 
 As to the former actions, I assert they proceed from a reasoning, that
 is not in itself different, nor founded on different principles, from
 that which appears in human nature. It is necessary in the first place,
 that there be some impression immediately present to their memory or
 senses, in order to be the foundation of their judgment. From the
 tone of voice the dog infers his masters anger, and foresees his own
 punishment. From a certain sensation affecting his smell, he judges his
 game not to be far distant from him.
 
 Secondly, The inference he draws from the present impression is built on
 experience, and on his observation of the conjunction of objects in past
 instances. As you vary this experience, he varies his reasoning. Make
 a beating follow upon one sign or motion for some time, and afterwards
 upon another; and he will successively draw different conclusions,
 according to his most recent experience.
 
 Now let any philosopher make a trial, and endeavour to explain that
 act of the mind, which we call BELIEF, and give an account of the
 principles, from which it is derivd, independent of the influence of
 custom on the imagination, and let his hypothesis be equally applicable
 to beasts as to the human species; and after he has done this, I promise
 to embrace his opinion. But at the same time I demand as an equitable
 condition, that if my system be the only one, which can answer to all
 these terms, it may be receivd as entirely satisfactory and convincing.
 And that it is the only one, is evident almost without any reasoning.
 Beasts certainly never perceive any real connexion among objects. It is
 therefore by experience they infer one from another. They can never by
 any arguments form a general conclusion, that those objects, of which
 they have had no experience, resemble those of which they have. It is
 therefore by means of custom alone, that experience operates upon them.
 All this was sufficiently evident with respect to man. But with respect
 to beasts there cannot be the least suspicion of mistake; which must be
 ownd to be a strong confirmation, or rather an invincible proof of my
 system.
 
 Nothing shews more the force of habit in reconciling us to any
 phaenomenoun, than this, that men are not astonished at the operations
 of their own reason, at the same time, that they admire the instinct
 of animals, and find a difficulty in explaining it, merely because it
 cannot be reducd tothe very same principles. To consider the matter
 aright, reason is nothing but a wonderful and unintelligible instinct in
 our souls, which carries us along a certain train of ideas, and endows
 them with particular qualities, according to their particular situations
 and relations. This instinct, it is true, arises from past observation
 and experience; but can any one give the ultimate reason, why past
 experience and observation produces such an effect, any more than why
 nature alone shoud produce it? Nature may certainly produce whatever
 can arise from habit: Nay, habit is nothing but one of the principles of
 nature, and derives all its force from that origin.
 
 
 
 
 
 PART IV. OF THE SCEPTICAL AND OTHER SYSTEMS OF PHILOSOPHY.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. I. OF SCEPTICISM WITH REGARD TO REASON.
 
 
 In all demonstrative sciences the rules are certain and infallible; but
 when we apply them, our fallible said uncertain faculties are very apt
 to depart from them, and fall into error. We must, therefore, in every
 reasoning form a new judgment, as a check or controul on our first
 judgment or belief; and must enlarge our view to comprehend a kind of
 history of all the instances, wherein our understanding has deceived us,
 compared with those, wherein its testimony was just and true. Our reason
 must be considered as a kind of cause, of which truth is the natural
 effect; but such-a-one as by the irruption of other causes, and by the
 inconstancy of our mental powers, may frequently be prevented. By this
 means all knowledge degenerates into probability; and this probability
 is greater or less, according to our experience of the veracity or
 deceitfulness of our understanding, and according to the simplicity or
 intricacy of the question.
 
 There is no Algebraist nor Mathematician so expert in his science, as to
 place entire confidence in any truth immediately upon his discovery of
 it, or regard it as any thing, but a were probability. Every time he
 runs over his proofs, his confidence encreases; but still more by the
 approbation of his friends; and is raised to its utmost perfection by
 the universal assent and applauses of the learned world. Now it is
 evident, that this gradual encrease of assurance is nothing but the
 addition of new probabilities, and is derived from the constant union of
 causes and effects, according to past experience and observation.
 
 In accompts of any length or importance, Merchants seldom trust to
 the infallible certainty of numbers for their security; but by the
 artificial structure of the accompts, produce a probability beyond what
 is derived from the skill and experience of the accomptant. For that
 is plainly of itself some degree of probability; though uncertain and
 variable, according to the degrees of his experience and length of
 the accompt. Now as none will maintain, that our assurance in a long
 numeration exceeds probability, I may safely affirm, that there scarce
 is any proposition concerning numbers, of which we can have a fuller
 security. For it is easily possible, by gradually diminishing the
 numbers, to reduce the longest series of addition to the most simple
 question, which can be formed, to an addition of two single numbers; and
 upon this supposition we shall find it impracticable to shew the precise
 limits of knowledge and of probability, or discover that particular
 number, at which the one ends and the other begins. But knowledge and
 probability are of such contrary and disagreeing natures, that they
 cannot well run insensibly into each other, and that because they will
 not divide, but must be either entirely present, or entirely absent.
 Besides, if any single addition were certain, every one would be so, and
 consequently the whole or total sum; unless the whole can be different
 from all its parts. I had almost said, that this was certain; but I
 reflect that it must reduce itself, as well as every other reasoning,
 and from knowledge degenerate into probability.
 
 Since therefore all knowledge resolves itself into probability, and
 becomes at last of the same nature with that evidence, which we employ
 in common life, we must now examine this latter species of reasoning,
 and see on what foundation it stands.
 
 In every judgment, which we can form concerning probability, as well
 as concerning knowledge, we ought always to correct the first judgment,
 derived from the nature of the object, by another judgment, derived from
 the nature of the understanding. It is certain a man of solid sense and
 long experience ought to have, and usually has, a greater assurance
 in his opinions, than one that is foolish and ignorant, and that our
 sentiments have different degrees of authority, even with ourselves, in
 proportion to the degrees of our reason and experience. In the man of
 the best sense and longest experience, this authority is never entire;
 since even such-a-one must be conscious of many errors in the past, and
 must still dread the like for the future. Here then arises a new species
 of probability to correct and regulate the first, and fix its just
 standard and proportion. As demonstration is subject to the controul of
 probability, so is probability liable to a new correction by a reflex
 act of the mind, wherein the nature of our understanding, and our
 reasoning from the first probability become our objects.
 
 Having thus found in every probability, beside the original uncertainty
 inherent in the subject, a new uncertainty derived from the weakness of
 that faculty, which judges, and having adjusted these two together,
 we are obliged by our reason to add a new doubt derived from the
 possibility of error in the estimation we make of the truth and fidelity
 of our faculties. This is a doubt, which immediately occurs to us, and
 of which, if we would closely pursue our reason, we cannot avoid giving
 a decision. But this decision, though it should be favourable to our
 preceding judgment, being founded only on probability, must weaken still
 further our first evidence, and must itself be weakened by a fourth
 doubt of the same kind, and so on in infinitum: till at last there
 remain nothing of the original probability, however great we may
 suppose it to have been, and however small the diminution by every new
 uncertainty. No finite object can subsist under a decrease repeated IN
 INFINITUM; and even the vastest quantity, which can enter into human
 imagination, must in this manner be reduced to nothing. Let our first
 belief be never so strong, it must infallibly perish by passing through
 so many new examinations, of which each diminishes somewhat of its force
 and vigour. When I reflect on the natural fallibility of my judgment,
 I have less confidence in my opinions, than when I only consider the
 objects concerning which I reason; and when I proceed still farther,
 to turn the scrutiny against every successive estimation I make of my
 faculties, all the rules of logic require a continual diminution, and at
 last a total extinction of belief and evidence.
 
 Should it here be asked me, whether I sincerely assent to this argument,
 which I seem to take such pains to inculcate, and whether I be really
 one of those sceptics, who hold that all is uncertain, and that our
 judgment is not in any thing possest of any measures of truth and
 falshood; I should reply, that this question is entirely superfluous,
 and that neither I, nor any other person was ever sincerely and
 constantly of that opinion. Nature, by an absolute and uncontroulable
 necessity has determined us to judge as well as to breathe and feel; nor
 can we any more forbear viewing certain objects in a stronger and
 fuller light, upon account of their customary connexion with a present
 impression, than we can hinder ourselves from thinking as long, as
 we are awake, or seeing the surrounding bodies, when we turn our eyes
 towards them in broad sunshine. Whoever has taken the pains to refute
 the cavils of this total scepticism, has really disputed without an
 antagonist, and endeavoured by arguments to establish a faculty, which
 nature has antecedently implanted in the mind, and rendered unavoidable.
 
 My intention then in displaying so carefully the arguments of that
 fantastic sect, is only to make the reader sensible of the truth of my
 hypothesis, that all our reasonings concerning causes and effects are
 derived from nothing but custom; and that belief is more properly an act
 of the sensitive, than of the cogitative part of our natures. I
 have here proved, that the very same principles, which make us form
 a decision upon any subject, and correct that decision by the
 consideration of our genius and capacity, and of the situation of our
 mind, when we examined that subject; I say, I have proved, that these
 same principles, when carryed farther, and applied to every new reflex
 judgment, must, by continually diminishing the original evidence, at
 last reduce it to nothing, and utterly subvert all belief and opinion.
 If belief, therefore, were a simple act of the thought, without any
 peculiar manner of conception, or the addition of a force and vivacity,
 it must infallibly destroy itself, and in every case terminate in a
 total suspense of judgment. But as experience will sufficiently convince
 any one, who thinks it worth while to try, that though he can find no
 error in the foregoing arguments, yet he still continues to believe, and
 think, and reason as usual, he may safely conclude, that his reasoning
 and belief is some sensation or peculiar manner of conception, which it
 is impossible for mere ideas and reflections to destroy.
 
 But here, perhaps, it may be demanded, how it happens, even upon my
 hypothesis, that these arguments above-explained produce not a total
 suspense of judgment, and after what manner the mind ever retains a
 degree of assurance in any subject? For as these new probabilities,
 which by their repetition perpetually diminish the original evidence,
 are founded on the very same principles, whether of thought or
 sensation, as the primary judgment, it may seem unavoidable, that in
 either case they must equally subvert it, and by the opposition,
 either of contrary thoughts or sensations, reduce the mind to a total
 uncertainty. I suppose, there is some question proposed to me, and
 that after revolving over the impressions of my memory and senses,
 and carrying my thoughts from them to such objects, as are commonly
 conjoined with them, I feel a stronger and more forcible conception on
 the one side, than on the other. This strong conception forms my first
 decision. I suppose, that afterwards I examine my judgment itself,
 and observing from experience, that it is sometimes just and sometimes
 erroneous, I consider it as regulated by contrary principles or causes,
 of which some lead to truth, and some to error; and in ballancing these
 contrary causes, I diminish by a new probability the assurance of my
 first decision. This new probability is liable to the same diminution as
 the foregoing, and so on, IN INFINITUM. It is therefore demanded, how
 it happens, that even after all we retain a degree of belief, which is
 sufficient for our purpose, either in philosophy or common life.
 
 I answer, that after the first and second decision; as the action of
 the mind becomes forced and unnatural, and the ideas faint and obscure;
 though the principles of judgment, and the ballancing of opposite
 causes be the same as at the very beginning; yet their influence on the
 imagination, and the vigour they add to, or diminish from the thought,
 is by no means equal. Where the mind reaches not its objects with
 easiness and facility, the same principles have not the same effect as
 in a more natural conception of the ideas; nor does the imagination feel
 a sensation, which holds any proportion with that which arises from
 its common judgments and opinions. The attention is on the stretch: The
 posture of the mind is uneasy; and the spirits being diverted from their
 natural course, are not governed in their movements by the same laws, at
 least not to the same degree, as when they flow in their usual channel.
 
 If we desire similar instances, it will not be very difficult to find
 them. The present subject of metaphysics will supply us abundantly. The
 same argument, which would have been esteemed convincing in a reasoning
 concerning history or politics, has little or no influence in these
 abstruser subjects, even though it be perfectly comprehended; and that
 because there is required a study and an effort of thought, in order
 to its being comprehended: And this effort of thought disturbs the
 operation of our sentiments, on which the belief depends. The case is
 the same in other subjects. The straining of the imagination always
 hinders the regular flowing of the passions and sentiments. A tragic
 poet, that would represent his heroes as very ingenious and witty in
 their misfortunes, would never touch the passions. As the emotions of
 the soul prevent any subtile reasoning and reflection, so these latter
 actions of the mind are equally prejudicial to the former. The mind, as
 well as the body, seems to be endowed with a certain precise degree of
 force and activity, which it never employs in one action, but at the
 expense of all the rest. This is more evidently true, where the actions
 are of quite different natures; since in that case the force of the mind
 is not only diverted, but even the disposition changed, so as to render
 us incapable of a sudden transition from one action to the other, and
 still more of performing both at once. No wonder, then, the conviction,
 which arises from a subtile reasoning, diminishes in proportion to the
 efforts, which the imagination makes to enter into the reasoning, and
 to conceive it in all its parts. Belief, being a lively conception, can
 never be entire, where it is not founded on something natural and easy.
 
 This I take to be the true state of the question, and cannot approve of
 that expeditious way, which some take with the sceptics, to reject
 at once all their arguments without enquiry or examination. If the
 sceptical reasonings be strong, say they, it is a proof, that reason may
 have some force and authority: if weak, they can never be sufficient to
 invalidate all the conclusions of our understanding. This argument is
 not just; because the sceptical reasonings, were it possible for them
 to exist, and were they not destroyed by their subtility, would
 be successively both strong and weak, according to the successive
 dispositions of the mind. Reason first appears in possession of the
 throne, prescribing laws, and imposing maxims, with an absolute sway and
 authority. Her enemy, therefore, is obliged to take shelter under
 her protection, and by making use of rational arguments to prove the
 fallaciousness and imbecility of reason, produces, in a manner, a
 patent under her band and seal. This patent has at first an authority,
 proportioned to the present and immediate authority of reason, from
 which it is derived. But as it is supposed to be contradictory to
 reason, it gradually diminishes the force of that governing power
 and its own at the same time; till at last they both vanish away into
 nothing, by a regulax and just diminution. The sceptical and dogmatical
 reasons are of the same kind, though contrary in their operation and
 tendency; so that where the latter is strong, it has an enemy of equal
 force in the former to encounter; and as their forces were at first
 equal, they still continue so, as long as either of them subsists; nor
 does one of them lose any force in the contest, without taking as much
 from its antagonist. It is happy, therefore, that nature breaks the
 force of all sceptical arguments in time, and keeps them from having any
 considerable influence on the understanding. Were we to trust entirely
 to their self-destruction, that can never take place, until they have
 first subverted all conviction, and have totally destroyed human reason.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. II. OF SCEPTICISM WITH REGARD TO THE SENSES.
 
 
 Thus the sceptic still continues to reason and believe, even though be
 asserts, that he cannot defend his reason by reason; and by the same
 rule he must assent to the principle concerning the existence of body,
 though he cannot pretend by any arguments of philosophy to maintain its
 veracity. Nature has not left this to his choice, and has doubtless,
 esteemed it an affair of too great importance to be trusted to our
 uncertain reasonings and speculations. We may well ask, What causes
 induce us to believe in the existence of body? but it is in vain to ask,
 Whether there be body or not? That is a point, which we must take for
 granted in all our reasonings.
 
 The subject, then, of our present enquiry is concerning the causes which
 induce us to believe in the existence of body: And my reasonings on this
 head I shall begin with a distinction, which at first sight may
 seem superfluous, but which will contribute very much to the perfect
 understanding of what follows. We ought to examine apart those two
 questions, which are commonly confounded together, viz. Why we attribute
 a continued existence to objects, even when they are not present to the
 senses; and why we suppose them to have an existence DISTINCT from the
 mind and perception. Under this last head I comprehend their
 situation as well as relations, their external position as well as
 the independence of their existence and operation. These two questions
 concerning the continued and distinct existence of body are intimately
 connected together. For if the objects of our senses continue to
 exist, even when they are not perceived, their existence is of course
 independent of and distinct from the perception: and vice versa, if
 their existence be independent of the perception and distinct from it,
 they must continue to exist, even though they be not perceived. But
 though the decision of the one question decides the other; yet that we
 may the more easily discover the principles of human nature, from whence
 the decision arises, we shall carry along with us this distinction, and
 shall consider, whether it be the senses, reason, or the imagination,
 that produces the opinion of a continued or of a distinct existence.
 These are the only questions, that are intelligible on the present
 subject. For as to the notion of external existence, when taken for
 something specially different from our perceptions [Part. II. Sect. 6.],
 we have already shewn its absurdity.
 
 To begin with the SENSES, it is evident these faculties are incapable of
 giving rise to the notion of the continued existence of their objects,
 after they no longer appear to the senses. For that is a contradiction
 in terms, and suppose that the senses continue to operate, even after
 they have ceased all manner of operation. These faculties, therefore, if
 they have any influence in the present case, must produce the opinion
 of a distinct, not of a continued existence; and in order to that, must
 present their impressions either as images and representations, or as
 these very distinct and external existences.
 
 That our senses offer not their impressions as the images of something
 distinct, or independent, and external, is evident; because they convey
 to us nothing but a single perception, and never give us the least
 intimation of any thing beyond. A single perception can never produce
 the idea of a double existence, but by some inference either of the
 reason or imagination. When the mind looks farther than what immediately
 appears to it, its conclusions can never be put to the account of the
 senses; and it certainly looks farther, when from a single perception it
 infers a double existence, and supposes the relations of resemblance and
 causation betwixt them.
 
 If our senses, therefore, suggest any idea of distinct existences,
 they must convey the impressions as those very existences, by a kind of
 fallacy and illusion. Upon this bead we may observe, that all sensations
 are felt by the mind, such as they really are, and that when we
 doubt, whether they present themselves as distinct objects, or as
 mere impressions, the difficulty is not concerning their nature, but
 concerning their relations and situation. Now if the senses presented
 our impressions as external to, and independent of ourselves, both the
 objects and ourselves must be obvious to our senses, otherwise they
 coued not be compared by these faculties. The difficulty, then, is how
 fax we are ourselves the objects of our senses.
 
 It is certain there is no question in philosophy more abstruse than
 that concerning identity, and the nature of the uniting principle, which
 constitutes a person. So far from being able by our senses merely to
 determine this question, we must have recourse to the most profound
 metaphysics to give a satisfactory answer to it; and in common life
 it is evident these ideas of self and person are never very fixed nor
 determinate. It is absurd, therefore, to imagine the senses can ever
 distinguish betwixt ourselves and external objects.
 
 Add to this, that every impression, external and internal, passions,
 affections, sensations, pains and pleasures, are originally on the same
 footing; and that whatever other differences we may observe among them,
 they appear, all of them, in their true colours, as impressions or
 perceptions. And indeed, if we consider the matter aright, it is scarce
 possible it should be otherwise, nor is it conceivable that our senses
 should be more capable of deceiving us in the situation and relations,
 than in the nature of our impressions. For since all actions and
 sensations of the mind are known to us by consciousness, they must
 necessarily appear in every particular what they are, and be what they
 appear. Every thing that enters the mind, being in reality a perception,
 it is impossible any thing should to feeling appear different. This were
 to suppose, that even where we are most intimately conscious, we might
 be mistaken.
 
 But not to lose time in examining, whether it is possible for our senses
 to deceive us, and represent our perceptions as distinct from ourselves,
 that is as external to and independent of us; let us consider whether
 they really do so, and whether this error proceeds from an immediate
 sensation, or from some other causes.
 
 To begin with the question concerning EXTERNAL existence, it may perhaps
 be said, that setting aside the metaphysical question of the identity
 of a thinking substance, our own body evidently belongs to us; and as
 several impressions appear exterior to the body, we suppose them also
 exterior to ourselves. The paper, on which I write at present, is beyond
 my hand. The table is beyond the paper. The walls of the chamber beyond
 the table. And in casting my eye towards the window, I perceive a great
 extent of fields and buildings beyond my chamber. From all this it may
 be infered, that no other faculty is required, beside the senses, to
 convince us of the external existence of body. But to prevent this
 inference, we need only weigh the three following considerations. First,
 That, properly speaking, it is not our body we perceive, when we regard
 our limbs and members, but certain impressions, which enter by the
 senses; so that the ascribing a real and corporeal existence to these
 impressions, or to their objects, is an act of the mind as difficult
 to explain, as that which we examine at present. Secondly, Sounds, and
 tastes, and smelts, though commonly regarded by the mind as continued
 independent qualities, appear not to have any existence in extension,
 and consequently cannot appear to the senses as situated externally
 to the body. The reason, why we ascribe a place to them, shall be:
 considered afterwards. Thirdly, Even our sight informs us not of
 distance or outness (so to speak) immediately and without a certain
 reasoning and experience, as is acknowledged by the most rational
 philosophers.
 
 As to the independency of our perceptions on ourselves, this can never
 be an object of the senses; but any opinion we form concerning it, must
 be derived from experience and observation: And we shall see afterwards,
 that our conclusions from experience are far from being favourable to
 the doctrine of the independency of our perceptions. Mean while we may
 observe that when we talk of real distinct existences, we have commonly
 more in our eye their independency than external situation in place,
 and think an object has a sufficient reality, when its Being is
 uninterrupted, and independent of the incessant revolutions, which we
 are conscious of in ourselves.
 
 Thus to resume what I have said concerning the senses; they give us no
 notion of continued existence, because they cannot operate beyond the
 extent, in which they really operate. They as little produce the opinion
 of a distinct existence, because they neither can offer it to the mind
 as represented, nor as original. To offer it as represented, they must
 present both an object and an image. To make it appear as original, they
 must convey a falshood; and this falshood must lie in the relations and
 situation: In order to which they must be able to compare the object
 with ourselves; and even in that case they do not, nor is it possible
 they should, deceive us. We may, therefore, conclude with certainty,
 that the opinion of a continued and of a distinct existence never arises
 from the senses.
 
 To confirm this we may observe, that there are three different kinds of
 impressions conveyed by the senses. The first are those of the figure,
 bulk, motion and solidity of bodies. The second those of colours,
 tastes, smells, sounds, heat and cold. The third are the pains and
 pleasures, that arise from the application of objects to our bodies, as
 by the cutting of our flesh with steel, and such like. Both philosophers
 and the vulgar suppose the first of these to have a distinct continued
 existence. The vulgar only regard the second as on the same footing.
 Both philosophers and the vulgar, again, esteem the third to be merely
 perceptions and consequently interrupted and dependent beings.
 
 Now it is evident, that, whatever may be our philosophical opinion,
 colours, Sounds, heat and cold, as far as appears to the senses, exist
 after the same manner with motion and solidity, and that the difference
 we make betwixt them in this respect, arises not from the mere
 perception. So strong the prejudice for the distinct continued existence
 Of the former qualities, that when the contrary opinion is advanced by
 modern philosophers, people imagine they can almost refute it from
 their feeling and experience, and that their very senses contradict this
 philosophy. It is also evident, that colours, sounds, &c. are originally
 on the same footing with the pain that arises from steel, and pleasure
 that proceeds from a fire; and that the difference betwixt them is
 founded neither on perception nor reason, but on the imagination. For
 as they are confest to be, both of them, nothing but perceptions arising
 from the particular configurations and motions of the parts of body,
 wherein possibly can their difference consist? Upon the whole, then, we
 may conclude, that as far as the senses are judges, all perceptions are
 the same in the manner of their existence.
 
 We may also observe in this instance of sounds and colours, that we
 can attribute a distinct continued existence to objects without ever
 consulting REASON, or weighing our opinions by any philosophical
 principles. And indeed, whatever convincing arguments philosophers may
 fancy they can produce to establish the belief of objects independent of
 the mind, it is obvious these arguments are known but to very few, and
 that it is not by them, that children, peasants, and the greatest part
 of mankind are induced to attribute objects to some impressions, and
 deny them to others. Accordingly we find, that all the conclusions,
 which the vulgar form on this head, are directly contrary to those,
 which are confirmed by philosophy. For philosophy informs us, that every
 thing, which appears to the mind, is nothing but a perception, and is
 interrupted, and dependent on the mind: whereas the vulgar confound
 perceptions and objects, and attribute a distinct continued existence
 to the very things they feel or see. This sentiment, then, as it is
 entirely unreasonable, must proceed from some other faculty than
 the understanding. To which we may add, that as long as we take our
 perceptions and objects to be the same, we can never infer the existence
 of the one from that of the other, nor form any argument from the
 relation of cause and effect; which is the only one that earl assure us
 of matter of fact. Even after we distinguish our perceptions from
 our objects, it will appear presently, that we are still incapable of
 reasoning from the existence of one to that of the other: So that upon
 the whole our reason neither does, nor is it possible it ever should,
 upon any supposition, give us an assurance of the continued and
 distinct existence of body. That opinion must be entirely owing to the
 IMAGINATION: which must now be the subject of our enquiry.
 
 Since all impressions are internal and perishing existences, and appear
 as such, the notion of their distinct and continued existence must arise
 from a concurrence of some of their qualities with the qualities of the
 imagination, and since this notion does not extend to all of them, it
 must arise from certain qualities peculiar to some impressions. It will
 therefore be easy for us to discover these qualities by a comparison
 of the impressions, to which we attribute a distinct and continued
 existence, with those, which we regard as internal and perishing.
 
 We may observe, then, that it is neither upon account of the
 involuntariness of certain impressions, as is commonly supposed, nor of
 their superior force and violence, that we attribute to them a reality,
 and continued existence, which we refuse to others, that are voluntary
 or feeble. For it is evident our pains and pleasures, our passions and
 affections, which we never suppose to have any existence beyond our
 perception, operate with greater violence, and are equally involuntary,
 as the impressions of figure and extension, colour and sound, which we
 suppose to be permanent beings. The heat of a fire, when moderate, is
 supposed to exist in the fire; but the pain, which it causes upon a near
 approach, is not taken to have any being, except in the perception.
 
 These vulgar opinions, then, being rejected, we must search for some
 other hypothesis, by which we may discover those peculiar qualities
 in our impressions, which makes us attribute to them a distinct and
 continued existence.
 
 After a little examination, we shall find, that all those objects, to
 which we attribute a continued existence, have a peculiar constancy,
 which distinguishes them from the impressions, whose existence depends
 upon our perception. Those mountains, and houses, and trees, which lie
 at present under my eye, have always appeared to me in the same order;
 and when I lose sight of them by shutting my eyes or turning my head, I
 soon after find them return upon me without the least alteration. My bed
 and table, my books and papers, present themselves in the same uniform
 manner, and change not upon account of any interruption in my seeing
 or perceivilng them. This is the case with all the impressions, whose
 objects are supposed to have an external existence; and is the case
 with no other impressions, whether gentle or violent, voluntary or
 involuntary.
 
 This constancy, however, is not so perfect as not to admit of very
 considerable exceptions. Bodies often change their position and
 qualities, and after a little absence or interruption may become hardly
 knowable. But here it is observable, that even in these changes they
 preserve a coherence, and have a regular dependence on each other; which
 is the foundation of a kind of reasoning from causation, and produces
 the opinion of their continued existence. When I return to my chamber
 after an hour's absence, I find not my fire in the same situation, in
 which I left it: But then I am accustomed in other instances to see a
 like alteration produced in a like time, whether I am present or absent,
 near or remote. This coherence, therefore, in their changes is one of
 the characteristics of external objects, as well as their constancy.
 
 Having found that the opinion of the continued existence of body depends
 on the COHERENCE, and CONSTANCY of certain impressions, I now proceed to
 examine after what manner these qualities give rise to so extraordinary
 an opinion. To begin with the coherence; we may observe, that though
 those internal impressions, which we regard as fleeting and perishing,
 have also a certain coherence or regularity in their appearances, yet
 it is of somewhat a different nature, from that which we discover in
 bodies. Our passions are found by experience to have a mutual connexion
 with and dependence on each other; but on no occasion is it necessary
 to suppose, that they have existed and operated, when they were not
 perceived, in order to preserve the same dependence and connexion, of
 which we have had experience. The case is not the same with relation
 to external objects. Those require a continued existence, or otherwise
 lose, in a great measure, the regularity of their operation. I am here
 seated in my chamber with my face to the fire; and all the objects, that
 strike my senses, are contained in a few yards around me. My memory,
 indeed, informs me of the existence of many objects; but then this
 information extends not beyond their past existence, nor do either my
 senses or memory give any testimony to the continuance of their being.
 When therefore I am thus seated, and revolve over these thoughts, I hear
 on a sudden a noise as of a door turning upon its hinges; and a little
 after see a porter, who advances towards me. This gives occasion to many
 new reflections and reasonings. First, I never have observed, that
 this noise coued proceed from any thing but the motion of a door; and
 therefore conclude, that the present phaenomenon is a contradiction to
 all past experience, unless the door, which I remember on the other side
 the chamber, be still in being. Again, I have always found, that a human
 body was possest of a quality, which I call gravity, and which hinders
 it from mounting in the air, as this porter must have done to arrive
 at my chamber, unless the stairs I remember be not annihilated by my
 absence. But this is not all. I receive a letter, which upon, opening
 it I perceive by the hand-writing and subscription to have come from a
 friend, who says he is two hundred leagues distant. It is evident I can
 never account for this phenomenon, conformable to my experience in other
 instances, without spreading out in my mind the whole sea and continent
 between us, and supposing the effects and continued existence of posts
 and ferries, according to my Memory and observation. To consider
 these phaenomena of the porter and letter in a certain light, they are
 contradictions to common experience, and may be regarded as objections
 to those maxims, which we form concerning the connexions of causes and
 effects. I am accustomed to hear such a sound, and see such an object in
 motion at the same time. I have not received in this particular instance
 both these perceptions. These observations are contrary, unless I
 suppose that the door still remains, and that it was opened without
 my perceiving it: And this supposition, which was at first entirely
 arbitrary and hypothetical, acquires a force and evidence by its being
 the only one, upon which I can reconcile these contradictions. There
 is scarce a moment of my life, wherein there is not a similar instance
 presented to me, and I have not occasion to suppose the continued
 existence of objects, in order to connect their past and present
 appearances, and give them such an union with each other, as I have
 found by experience to be suitable to their particular natures and
 circumstances. Here then I am naturally led to regard the world, as
 something real and durable, and as preserving its existence, even when
 it is no longer present to my perception.
 
 But though this conclusion from the coherence of appearances may seem to
 be of the same nature with our reasonings concerning causes and effects;
 as being derived from custom, and regulated by past experience; we
 shall find upon examination, that they are at the bottom considerably
 different from each other, and that this inference arises from the
 understanding, and from custom in an indirect and oblique manner. For
 it will readily be allowed, that since nothing is ever really present to
 the mind, besides its own perceptions, it is not only impossible,
 that any habit should ever be acquired otherwise than by the regular
 succession of these perceptions, but also that any habit should ever
 exceed that degree of regularity. Any degree, therefore, of regularity
 in our perceptions, can never be a foundation for us to infer a greater
 degree of regularity in some objects, which are not perceived; since
 this supposes a contradiction, viz. a habit acquired by what was never
 present to the mind. But it is evident, that whenever we infer the
 continued existence of the objects of sense from their coherence, and
 the frequency of their union, it is in order to bestow on the objects
 a greater regularity than what is observed in our mere perceptions. We
 remark a connexion betwixt two kinds of objects in their past appearance
 to the senses, but are not able to observe this connexion to be
 perfectly constant, since the turning about of our head or the shutting
 of our eyes is able to break it. What then do we suppose in this
 case, but that these objects still continue their usual connexion,
 notwithstanding their apparent interruption, and that the irregular
 appearances are joined by something, of which we are insensible? But as
 all reasoning concerning matters of fact arises only from custom, and
 custom can only be the effect of repeated perceptions, the extending of
 custom and reasoning beyond the perceptions can never be the direct and
 natural effect of the constant repetition and connexion, but must arise
 from the co-operation of some other principles.
 
 I have already observed [Part II, Sect. 4.], in examining the foundation
 of mathematics, that the imagination, when set into any train of
 thinking, is apt to continue, even when its object fails it, and like a
 galley put in motion by the oars, carries on its course without any new
 impulse. This I have assigned for the reason, why, after considering
 several loose standards of equality, and correcting them by each other,
 we proceed to imagine so correct and exact a standard of that relation,
 as is not liable to the least error or variation. The same principle
 makes us easily entertain this opinion of the continued existence
 of body. Objects have a certain coherence even as they appear to our
 senses; but this coherence is much greater and more uniform, if we
 suppose the object.% to have a continued existence; and as the mind is
 once in the train of observing an uniformity among objects, it naturally
 continues, till it renders the uniformity as compleat as possible.
 The simple supposition of their continued existence suffices for this
 purpose, and gives us a notion of a much greater regularity among
 objects, than what they have when we look no farther than our senses.
 
 But whatever force we may ascribe to this principle, I am afraid it
 is too weak to support alone so vast an edifice, as is that of the
 continued existence of all external bodies; and that we must join the
 constancy of their appearance to the coherence, in order to give a
 satisfactory account of that opinion. As the explication of this will
 lead me into a considerable compass of very profound reasoning; I
 think it proper, in order to avoid confusion, to give a short sketch or
 abridgment of my system, and afterwards draw out all its parts in their
 full compass. This inference from the constancy of our perceptions, like
 the precedent from their coherence, gives rise to the opinion of the
 continued existence of body, which is prior to that of its distinct
 existence, and produces that latter principle.
 
 When we have been accustomed to observe a constancy in certain
 impressions, and have found, that the perception of the sun or ocean,
 for instance, returns upon us after an absence or annihilation with like
 parts and in a like order, as at its first appearance, we are not apt
 to regard these interrupted perceptions as different, (which they really
 are) but on the contrary consider them as individually the same,
 upon account of their resemblance. But as this interruption of their
 existence is contrary to their perfect identity, and makes us regard
 the first impression as annihilated, and the second as newly created,
 we find ourselves somewhat at a loss, and are involved in a kind of
 contradiction. In order to free ourselves from this difficulty, we
 disguise, as much as possible, the interruption, or rather remove it
 entirely, by supposing that these interrupted perceptions are connected
 by a real existence, of which we are insensible. This supposition, or
 idea of continued existence, acquires a force and vivacity from the
 memory of these broken impressions, and from that propensity, which
 they give us, to suppose them the same; and according to the precedent
 reasoning, the very essence of belief consists in the force and vivacity
 of the conception.
 
 In order to justify this system, there are four things requisite. First,
 To explain the PRINCIPIUM INDIVIDUATIONIS, or principle of identity.
 Secondly, Give a reason, why the resemblance of our broken and
 interrupted perceptions induces us to attribute an identity to them.
 Thirdly, Account for that propensity, which this illusion gives, to
 unite these broken appearances by a continued existence. Fourthly and
 lastly, Explain that force and vivacity of conception, which arises from
 the propensity.
 
 First, As to the principle of individuation; we may observe, that the
 view of any one object is not sufficient to convey the idea of identity.
 For in that proposition, an object is the same with itself, if the idea
 expressed by the word, object, were no ways distinguished from
 that meant by itself; we really should mean nothing, nor would the
 proposition contain a predicate and a subject, which however are implyed
 in this affirmation. One single object conveys the idea of unity, not
 that of identity.
 
 On the other hand, a multiplicity of objects can never convey this idea,
 however resembling they may be supposed. The mind always pronounces the
 one not to be the other, and considers them as forming two, three,
 or any determinate number of objects, whose existences are entirely
 distinct and independent.
 
 Since then both number and unity are incompatible with the relation of
 identity, it must lie in something that is neither of them. But to tell
 the truth, at first sight this seems utterly impossible. Betwixt unity
 and number there can be no medium; no more than betwixt existence and
 nonexistence. After one object is supposed to exist, we must either
 suppose another also to exist; in which case we have the idea of number:
 Or we must suppose it not to exist; in which case the first object
 remains at unity.
 
 To remove this difficulty, let us have recourse to the idea of time or
 duration. I have already observd [Part II, Sect. 5.], that time, in a
 strict sense, implies succession, and that when we apply its idea to
 any unchangeable object, it is only by a fiction of the imagination, by
 which the unchangeable object is supposd to participate of the
 changes of the co-existent objects, and in particular of that of our
 perceptions. This fiction of the imagination almost universally takes
 place; and it is by means of it, that a single object, placd before us,
 and surveyd for any time without our discovering in it any interruption
 or variation, is able to give us a notion of identity. For when we
 consider any two points of this time, we may place them in different
 lights: We may either survey them at the very same instant; in which
 case they give us the idea of number, both by themselves and by the
 object; which must be multiplyd, in order to be conceivd at once, as
 existent in these two different points of time: Or on the other hand,
 we may trace the succession of time by a like succession of ideas,
 and conceiving first one moment, along with the object then existent,
 imagine afterwards a change in the time without any VARIATION or
 INTERRUPTION in the object; in which case it gives us the idea of unity.
 Here then is an idea, which is a medium betwixt unity and number; or
 more properly speaking, is either of them, according to the view, in
 which we take it: And this idea we call that of identity. We cannot, in
 any propriety of speech, say, that an object is the same with itself,
 unless we mean, that the object existent at one time is the same with
 itself existent at another. By this means we make a difference, betwixt
 the idea meant by the word, OBJECT, and that meant by ITSELF, without
 going the length of number, and at the same time without restraining
 ourselves to a strict and absolute unity.
 
 Thus the principle of individuation is nothing but the INVARIABLENESS
 and UNINTERRUPTEDNESS of any object, thro a supposd variation of
 time, by which the mind can trace it in the different periods of its
 existence, without any break of the view, and without being obligd to
 form the idea of multiplicity or number.
 
 I now proceed to explain the SECOND part of my system, and shew why
 the constancy of our perceptions makes us ascribe to them a perfect
 numerical identity, tho there be very long intervals betwixt their
 appearance, and they have only one of the essential qualities of
 identity, VIZ, INVARIABLENESS. That I may avoid all ambiguity and
 confusion on this head, I shall observe, that I here account for the
 opinions and belief of the vulgar with regard to the existence of body;
 and therefore must entirely conform myself to their manner of thinking
 and of expressing themselves. Now we have already observd, that however
 philosophers may distinguish betwixt the objects and perceptions of the
 senses; which they suppose co-existent and resembling; yet this is a
 distinction, which is not comprehended by the generality of mankind, who
 as they perceive only one being, can never assent to the opinion of a
 double existence and representation. Those very sensations, which enter
 by the eye or ear, are with them the true objects, nor can they
 readily conceive that this pen or paper, which is immediately perceivd,
 represents another, which is different from, but resembling it. In
 order, therefore, to accommodate myself to their notions, I shall at
 first suppose; that there is only a single existence, which I shall call
 indifferently OBJECT or PERCEPTION, according as it shall seem best to
 suit my purpose, understanding by both of them what any common man means
 by a hat, or shoe, or stone, or any other impression, conveyd to him
 by his senses. I shall be sure to give warning, when I return to a more
 philosophical way of speaking and thinking.
 
 To enter, therefore, upon the question concerning the source of the
 error and deception with regard to identity, when we attribute it to our
 resembling perceptions, notwithstanding their interruption; I must here
 recal an observation, which I have already provd and explaind [Part II.
 Sect. 5.]. Nothing is more apt to make us mistake one idea for another,
 than any relation betwixt them, which associates them together in the
 imagination, and makes it pass with facility from one to the other.
 Of all relations, that of resemblance is in this respect the most
 efficacious; and that because it not only causes an association of
 ideas, but also of dispositions, and makes us conceive the one idea by
 an act or operation of the mind, similar to that by which we conceive
 the other. This circumstance I have observd to be of great moment; and
 we may establish it for a general rule, that whatever ideas place the
 mind in the same disposition or in similar ones, are very apt to be
 confounded. The mind readily passes from one to the other, and perceives
 not the change without a strict attention, of which, generally speaking,
 it is wholly incapable.
 
 In order to apply this general maxim, we must first examine the
 disposition of the mind in viewing any object which preserves a perfect
 identity, and then find some other object, that is confounded with it,
 by causing a similar disposition. When we fix our thought on any object,
 and suppose it to continue the same for some time; it is evident we
 suppose the change to lie only in the time, and never exert ourselves to
 produce any new image or idea of the object. The faculties of the mind
 repose themselves in a manner, and take no more exercise, than what is
 necessary to continue that idea, of which we were formerly possest, and
 which subsists without variation or interruption. The passage from one
 moment to another is scarce felt, and distinguishes not itself by a
 different perception or idea, which may require a different direction of
 the spirits, in order to its conception.
 
 Now what other objects, beside identical ones, are capable of placing
 the mind in the same disposition, when it considers them, and of causing
 the same uninterrupted passage of the imagination from one idea to
 another? This question is of the last importance. For if we can find any
 such objects, we may certainly conclude, from the foregoing principle,
 that they are very naturally confounded with identical ones, and are
 taken for them in most of our reasonings. But though this question be
 very important, it is not very difficult nor doubtful. For I immediately
 reply, that a succession of related objects places the mind in this
 disposition, and is considered with the same smooth and uninterrupted
 progress of the imagination, as attends the view of the same invariable
 object. The very nature and essence of relation is to connect our ideas
 with each other, and upon the appearance of one, to facilitate the
 transition to its correlative. The passage betwixt related ideas is,
 therefore, so smooth and easy, that it produces little alteration on
 the mind, and seems like the continuation of the same action; and as the
 continuation of the same action is an effect of the continued view of
 the same object, it is for this reason we attribute sameness to every
 succession of related objects. The thought slides along the succession
 with equal facility, as if it considered only one object; and therefore
 confounds the succession with the identity.
 
 We shall afterwards see many instances of this tendency of relation to
 make us ascribe an identity to different objects; but shall here confine
 ourselves to the present subject. We find by experience, that there is
 such a constancy in almost all the impressions of the senses, that their
 interruption produces no alteration on them, and hinders them not from
 returning the same in appearance and in situation as at their first
 existence. I survey the furniture of my chamber; I shut my eyes, and
 afterwards open them; and find the new perceptions to resemble perfectly
 those, which formerly struck my senses. This resemblance is observed in
 a thousand instances, and naturally connects together our ideas of these
 interrupted perceptions by the strongest relation, and conveys the
 mind with an easy transition from one to another. An easy transition
 or passage of the imagination, along the ideas of these different and
 interrupted perceptions, is almost the same disposition of mind with
 that in which we consider one constant and uninterrupted perception. It
 is therefore very natural for us to mistake the one for the other.
 
 
      [Footnote 9  This reasoning, it must be confest, is somewhat
      abstruse, and difficult to be comprehended; but it is
      remarkable, that this very difficulty may be converted into
      a proof of the reasoning. We may observe, that there are two
      relations, and both of them resemblances, which contribute
      to our mistaking the succession of our interrupted
      perceptions for an identical object. The first is, the
      resemblance of the perceptions: The second is the
      resemblance, which the act of the mind in surveying a
      succession of resembling objects bears to that in surveying
      an identical object. Now these resemblances we are apt to
      confound with each other; and it is natural we shoud,
      according to this very reasoning. But let us keep them
      distinct, and we shall find no difficulty in conceiving the
      precedent argument.]
 
 The persons, who entertain this opinion concerning the identity of
 our resembling perceptions, are in general an the unthinking and
 unphilosophical part of mankind, (that is, all of us, at one time or
 other) and consequently such as suppose their perceptions to be their
 only objects, and never think of a double existence internal and
 external, representing and represented. The very image, which is present
 to the senses, is with us the real body; and it is to these interrupted
 images we ascribe a perfect identity. But as the interruption of the
 appearance seems contrary to the identity, and naturally leads us to
 regard these resembling perceptions as different from each other, we
 here find ourselves at a loss how to reconcile such opposite opinions.
 The smooth passage of the imagination along the ideas of the resembling
 perceptions makes us ascribe to them a perfect identity. The interrupted
 manner of their appearance makes us consider them as so many resembling,
 but still distinct beings, which appear after certain intervals. The
 perplexity arising from this contradiction produces a propension to
 unite these broken appearances by the fiction of a continued existence,
 which is the third part of that hypothesis I proposed to explain.
 
 Nothing is more certain from experience, than that any contradiction
 either to the sentiments or passions gives a sensible uneasiness,
 whether it proceeds from without or from within; from the opposition
 of external objects, or from the combat of internal principles. On the
 contrary, whatever strikes in with the natural propensities, and either
 externally forwards their satisfaction, or internally concurs with their
 movements, is sure to give a sensible pleasure. Now there being here an
 opposition betwixt the notion of the identity of resembling perceptions,
 and the interruption of their appearance, the mind must be uneasy in
 that situation, and will naturally seek relief from the uneasiness.
 Since the uneasiness arises from the opposition of two contrary
 principles, it must look for relief by sacrificing the one to the
 other. But as the smooth passage of our thought along our resembling
 perceptions makes us ascribe to them an identity, we can never without
 reluctance yield up that opinion. We must, therefore, turn to the other
 side, and suppose that our perceptions are no longer interrupted, but
 preserve a continued as well as an invariable existence, and are by that
 means entirely the same. But here the interruptions in the appearance
 of these perceptions are so long and frequent, that it is impossible to
 overlook them; and as the appearance of a perception in the mind and
 its existence seem at first sight entirely the same, it may be doubted,
 whether we can ever assent to so palpable a contradiction, and suppose a
 perception to exist without being present to the mind. In order to clear
 up this matter, and learn how the interruption in the appearance of a
 perception implies not necessarily an interruption in its existence,
 it will be proper to touch upon some principles, which we shall have
 occasion to explain more fully afterwards. [Sect. 6.]
 
 We may begin with observing, that the difficulty in the present case
 is not concerning the matter of fact, or whether the mind forms such a
 conclusion concerning the continued existence of its perceptions,
 but only concerning the manner in which the conclusion is formed, and
 principles from which it is derived. It is certain, that almost all
 mankind, and even philosophers themselves, for the greatest part of
 their lives, take their perceptions to be their only objects, and
 suppose, that the very being, which is intimately present to the mind,
 is the real body or material existence. It is also certain, that this
 very perception or object is supposed to have a continued uninterrupted
 being, and neither to be annihilated by our absence, nor to be brought
 into existence by our presence. When we are absent from it, we say it
 still exists, but that we do not feel, we do not see it. When we are
 present, we say we feel, or see it. Here then may arise two questions;
 First, How we can satisfy ourselves in supposing a perception to be
 absent from the mind without being annihilated. Secondly, After what
 manner we conceive an object to become present to the mind, without some
 new creation of a perception or image; and what we mean by this seeing,
 and feeling, and perceiving.
 
 As to the first question; we may observe, that what we call a mind,
 is nothing but a heap or collection of different perceptions, united
 together by certain relations, and supposed, though falsely, to be
 endowed with a perfect simplicity and identity. Now as every perception
 is distinguishable from another, and may be considered as separately
 existent; it evidently follows, that there is no absurdity in separating
 any particular perception from the mind; that is, in breaking off all
 its relations, with that connected mass of perceptions, which constitute
 a thinking being.
 
 The same reasoning affords us an answer to the second question. If the
 name of perception renders not this separation from a mind absurd and
 contradictory, the name of object, standing for the very same thing, can
 never render their conjunction impossible. External objects are seen,
 and felt, and become present to the mind; that is, they acquire such a
 relation to a connected heap of perceptions, as to influence them very
 considerably in augmenting their number by present reflections and
 passions, and in storing the memory with ideas. The same continued and
 uninterrupted Being may, therefore, be sometimes present to the mind,
 and sometimes absent from it, without any real or essential change in
 the Being itself. An interrupted appearance to the senses implies not
 necessarily an interruption in the existence. The supposition of the
 continued existence of sensible objects or perceptions involves
 no contradiction. We may easily indulge our inclination to that
 supposition. When the exact resemblance of our perceptions makes us
 ascribe to them an identity, we may remove the seeming interruption by
 feigning a continued being, which may fill those intervals, and preserve
 a perfect and entire identity to our perceptions.
 
 But as we here not only feign but believe this continued existence, the
 question is, from whence arises such a belief; and this question leads
 us to the fourth member of this system. It has been proved already, that
 belief in general consists in nothing, but the vivacity of an idea; and
 that an idea may acquire this vivacity by its relation to some present
 impression. Impressions are naturally the most vivid perceptions of
 the mind; and this quality is in part conveyed by the relation to every
 connected idea. The relation causes a smooth passage from the impression
 to the idea, and even gives a propensity to that passage. The mind falls
 so easily from the one perception to the other, that it scarce perceives
 the change, but retains in the second a considerable share of the
 vivacity of the first. It is excited by the lively impression; and this
 vivacity is conveyed to the related idea, without any great diminution
 in the passage, by reason of the smooth transition and the propensity of
 the imagination.
 
 But suppose, that this propensity arises from some other principle,
 besides that of relation; it is evident it must still have the same
 effect, and convey the vivacity from the impression to the idea. Now
 this is exactly the present case. Our memory presents us with a vast
 number of instances of perceptions perfectly resembling each other,
 that return at different distances of time, and after considerable
 interruptions. This resemblance gives us a propension to consider these
 interrupted perceptions as the same; and also a propension to connect
 them by a continued existence, in order to justify this identity, and
 avoid the contradiction, in which the interrupted appearance of these
 perceptions seems necessarily to involve us. Here then we have a
 propensity to feign the continued existence of all sensible objects; and
 as this propensity arises from some lively impressions of the memory, it
 bestows a vivacity on that fiction: or in other words, makes us believe
 the continued existence of body. If sometimes we ascribe a continued
 existence to objects, which are perfectly new to us, and of whose
 constancy and coherence we have no experience, it is because the manner,
 in which they present themselves to our senses, resembles that of
 constant and coherent objects; and this resemblance is a source of
 reasoning and analogy, and leads us to attribute the same qualities to
 similar objects.
 
 I believe an intelligent reader will find less difficulty to assent to
 this system, than to comprehend it fully and distinctly, and will allow,
 after a little reflection, that every part carries its own proof
 along with it. It is indeed evident, that as the vulgar suppose their
 perceptions to be their only objects, and at the same time believe the
 continued existence of matter, we must account for the origin of the
 belief upon that supposition. Now upon that supposition, it is a false
 opinion that any of our objects, or perceptions, are identically the
 same after an interruption; and consequently the opinion of their
 identity can never arise from reason, but must arise from the
 imagination. The imagination is seduced into such an opinion only by
 means of the resemblance of certain perceptions; since we find they are
 only our resembling perceptions, which we have a propension to suppose
 the same. This propension to bestow an identity on our resembling
 perceptions, produces the fiction of a continued existence; since that
 fiction, as well as the identity, is really false, as is acknowledged
 by all philosophers, and has no other effect than to remedy the
 interruption of our perceptions, which is the only circumstance that
 is contrary to their identity. In the last place this propension causes
 belief by means of the present impressions of the memory; since without
 the remembrance of former sensations, it is plain we never should have
 any belief of the continued existence of body. Thus in examining all
 these parts, we find that each of them is supported by the strongest
 proofs: and that all of them together form a consistent system, which is
 perfectly convincing. A strong propensity or inclination alone, without
 any present impression, will sometimes cause a belief or opinion. How
 much more when aided by that circumstance?
 
 But though we are led after this manner, by the natural propensity of
 the imagination, to ascribe a continued existence to those sensible
 objects or perceptions, which we find to resemble each other in their
 interrupted appearance; yet a very little reflection and philosophy
 is sufficient to make us perceive the fallacy of that opinion. I have
 already observed, that there is an intimate connexion betwixt those two
 principles, of a continued and of a distinct or independent existence,
 and that we no sooner establish the one than the other follows, as a
 necessary consequence. It is the opinion of a continued existence, which
 first takes place, and without much study or reflection draws the other
 along with it, wherever the mind follows its first and most natural
 tendency. But when we compare experiments, and reason a little upon
 them, we quickly perceive, that the doctrine of the independent
 existence of our sensible perceptions is contrary to the plainest
 experience. This leads us backward upon our footsteps to perceive our
 error in attributing a continued existence to our perceptions, and is
 the origin of many very curious opinions, which we shall here endeavour
 to account for.
 
 It will first be proper to observe a few of those experiments, which
 convince us, that our perceptions are not possest of any independent
 existence. When we press one eye with a finger, we immediately perceive
 all the objects to become double, and one half of them to be removed
 from their common and natural position. But as we do not attribute to
 continued existence to both these perceptions, and as they are both
 of the same nature, we clearly perceive, that all our perceptions are
 dependent on our organs, and the disposition of our nerves and
 animal spirits. This opinion is confirmed by the seeming encrease and
 diminution of objects, according to their distance; by the apparent
 alterations in their figure; by the changes in their colour and other
 qualities from our sickness and distempers: and by an infinite number
 of other experiments of the same kind; from all which we learn, that
 our sensible perceptions are not possest of any distinct or independent
 existence.
 
 The natural consequence of this reasoning should be, that our
 perceptions have no more a continued than an independent existence; and
 indeed philosophers have so far run into this opinion, that they change
 their system, and distinguish, (as we shall do for the future) betwixt
 perceptions and objects, of which the former are supposed to be
 interrupted, and perishing, and different at every different return; the
 latter to be uninterrupted, and to preserve a continued existence and
 identity. But however philosophical this new system may be esteemed, I
 assert that it is only a palliative remedy, and that it contains all the
 difficulties of the vulgar system, with some others, that are peculiar
 to itself. There are no principles either of the understanding or fancy,
 which lead us directly to embrace this opinion of the double existence
 of perceptions and objects, nor can we arrive at it but by passing
 through the common hypothesis of the identity and continuance of
 our interrupted perceptions. Were we not first perswaded, that our
 perceptions are our only objects, and continue to exist even when they
 no longer make their appearance to the senses, we should never be led
 to think, that our perceptions and objects are different, and that our
 objects alone preserve a continued existence. The latter hypothesis
 has no primary recommendation either to reason or the imagination, but
 acquires all its influence on the imagination from the former. This
 proposition contains two parts, which we shall endeavour to prove as
 distinctly and clearly, as such abstruse subjects will permit.
 
 As to the first part of the proposition, that this philosophical
 hypothesis has no primary recommendation, either to reason, or the
 imagination, we may soon satisfy ourselves with regard to reason by the
 following reflections. The only existences, of which we are certain,
 are perceptions, which being immediately present to us by consciousness,
 command our strongest assent, and are the first foundation of all our
 conclusions. The only conclusion we can draw from the existence of
 one thing to that of another, is by means of the relation of cause and
 effect, which shews, that there is a connexion betwixt them, and that
 the existence of one is dependent on that of the other. The idea of this
 relation is derived from past experience, by which we find, that two
 beings are constantly conjoined together, and are always present at
 once to the mind. But as no beings are ever present to the mind but
 perceptions; it follows that we may observe a conjunction or a relation
 of cause and effect between different perceptions, but can never observe
 it between perceptions and objects. It is impossible, therefore, that
 from the existence or any of the qualities of the former, we can ever
 form any conclusion concerning the existence of the latter, or ever
 satisfy our reason in this particular.
 
 It is no less certain, that this philosophical system has no primary
 recommendation to the imagination, and that that faculty would never, of
 itself, and by its original tendency, have fallen upon such a principle.
 I confess it will be somewhat difficult to prove this to the fall
 satisfaction of the reader; because it implies a negative, which in many
 cases will not admit of any positive proof. If any one would take the
 pains to examine this question, and would invent a system, to account
 for the direct origin of this opinion from the imagination, we should be
 able, by the examination of that system, to pronounce a certain
 judgment in the present subject. Let it be taken for granted, that our
 perceptions are broken, and interrupted, and however like, are still
 different from each other; and let any one upon this supposition shew
 why the fancy, directly and immediately, proceeds to the belief of
 another existence, resembling these perceptions in their nature, but yet
 continued, and uninterrupted, and identical; and after he has done this
 to my satisfaction, I promise to renounce my present opinion. Mean while
 I cannot forbear concluding, from the very abstractedness and difficulty
 of the first supposition, that it is an improper subject for the fancy
 to work upon. Whoever would explain the origin of the common opinion
 concerning the continued and distinct existence of body, must take the
 mind in its common situation, and must proceed upon the supposition,
 that our perceptions are our only objects, and continue to exist even
 when they are not perceived. Though this opinion be false, it is the
 most natural of any, and has alone any primary recommendation to the
 fancy.
 
 As to the second part of the proposition, that the philosophical system
 acquires all its influence on the imagination from the vulgar one; we
 may observe, that this is a natural and unavoidable consequence of the
 foregoing conclusion, that it has no primary recommendation to reason or
 the imagination. For as the philosophical system is found by experience
 to take hold of many minds, and in particular of all those, who reflect
 ever so little on this subject, it must derive all its authority from
 the vulgar system; since it has no original authority of its own.
 The manner, in which these two systems, though directly contrary, are
 connected together, may be explains, as follows.
 
 The imagination naturally runs on in this train of thinking. Our
 perceptions are our only objects: Resembling perceptions are the same,
 however broken or uninterrupted in their appearance: This appealing
 interruption is contrary to the identity: The interruption consequently
 extends not beyond the appearance, and the perception or object really
 continues to exist, even when absent from us: Our sensible perception
 s have, therefore, a continued and uninterrupted existence. But as a
 little reflection destroys this conclusion, that our perceptions have a
 continued existence, by shewing that they have a dependent one, it would
 naturally be expected, that we must altogether reject the opinion,
 that there is such a thing in nature as a continued existence, which
 is preserved even when it no longer appears to the senses. The case,
 however, is otherwise. Philosophers are so far from rejecting the
 opinion of a continued existence upon rejecting that of the independence
 and continuance of our sensible perceptions, that though all sects
 agree in the latter sentiment, the former, which is, in a manner, its
 necessary consequence, has been peculiar to a few extravagant sceptics;
 who after all maintained that opinion in words only, and were never able
 to bring themselves sincerely to believe it.
 
 There is a great difference betwixt such opinions as we form after
 a calm and profound reflection, and such as we embrace by a kind of
 instinct or natural impulse, on account of their suitableness and
 conformity to the mind. If these opinions become contrary, it is not
 difficult to foresee which of them will have the advantage. As long as
 our attention is bent upon the subject, the philosophical and studyed
 principle may prevail; but the moment we relax our thoughts, nature will
 display herself, and draw us back to our former opinion. Nay she has
 sometimes such an influence, that she can stop our progress, even in the
 midst of our most profound reflections, and keep us from running on
 with all the consequences of any philosophical opinion. Thus though we
 clearly perceive the dependence and interruption of our perceptions, we
 stop short in our career, and never upon that account reject the notion
 of an independent and continued existence. That opinion has taken such
 deep root in the imagination, that it is impossible ever to eradicate
 it, nor will any strained metaphysical conviction of the dependence of
 our perceptions be sufficient for that purpose.
 
 But though our natural and obvious principles here prevail above our
 studied reflections, it is certain there must be sonic struggle and
 opposition in the case: at least so long as these rejections retain any
 force or vivacity. In order to set ourselves at ease in this particular,
 we contrive a new hypothesis, which seems to comprehend both
 these principles of reason and imagination. This hypothesis is the
 philosophical, one of the double existence of perceptions and objects;
 which pleases our reason, in allowing, that our dependent perceptions
 are interrupted and different; and at the same time is agreeable to the
 imagination, in attributing a continued existence to something else,
 which we call objects. This philosophical system, therefore, is the
 monstrous offspring of two principles, which are contrary to each
 other, which are both at once embraced by the mind, and which are unable
 mutually to destroy each other. The imagination tells us, that our
 resembling perceptions have a continued and uninterrupted existence, and
 are not annihilated by their absence. Reflection tells us, that even our
 resembling perceptions are interrupted in their existence, and different
 from each other. The contradiction betwixt these opinions we elude by a
 new fiction, which is conformable to the hypotheses both of reflection
 and fancy, by ascribing these contrary qualities to different
 existences; the interruption to perceptions, and the continuance to
 objects. Nature is obstinate, and will not quit the field, however
 strongly attacked by reason; and at the same time reason is so clear
 in the point, that there is no possibility of disguising her. Not being
 able to reconcile these two enemies, we endeavour to set ourselves at
 ease as much as possible, by successively granting to each whatever
 it demands, and by feigning a double existence, where each may find
 something, that has all the conditions it desires. Were we fully
 convinced, that our resembling perceptions are continued, and identical,
 and independent, we should never run into this opinion of a double
 existence, since we should find satisfaction in our first supposition,
 and would not look beyond. Again, were we fully convinced, that our
 perceptions are dependent, and interrupted, and different, we should be
 as little inclined to embrace the opinion of a double existence;
 since in that case we should clearly perceive the error of our first
 supposition of a continued existence, and would never regard it any
 farther. It is therefore from the intermediate situation of the mind,
 that this opinion arises, and from such an adherence to these two
 contrary principles, as makes us seek some pretext to justify our
 receiving both; which happily at last is found in the system of a double
 existence.
 
 Another advantage of this philosophical system is its similarity to the
 vulgar one; by which means we can humour our reason for a moment,
 when it becomes troublesome and sollicitous; and yet upon its least
 negligence or inattention, can easily return to our vulgar and natural
 notions. Accordingly we find, that philosophers neglect not this
 advantage; but immediately upon leaving their closets, mingle with the
 rest of mankind in those exploded opinions, that our perceptions are our
 only objects, and continue identically and uninterruptedly the same in
 all their interrupted appearances.
 
 There are other particulars of this system, wherein we may remark its
 dependence on the fancy, in a very conspicuous manner. Of these, I
 shall observe the two following. First, We suppose external objects to
 resemble internal perceptions. I have already shewn, that the relation
 of cause and effect can never afford us any just conclusion from the
 existence or qualities of our perceptions to the existence of external
 continued objects: And I shall farther add, that even though they coued
 afford such a conclusion, we should never have any reason to infer,
 that our objects resemble our perceptions. That opinion, therefore, is
 derived from nothing but the quality of the fancy above-explained, <that
 it borrows all its ideas from some precedent perception>. We never can
 conceive any thing but perceptions, and therefore must make every thing
 resemble them.
 
 Secondly, As we suppose our objects in general to resemble our
 perceptions, so we take it for granted, that every particular object
 resembles that perception, which it causes. The relation of cause and
 effect determines us to join the other of resemblance; and the ideas
 of these existences being already united together in the fancy by the
 former relation, we naturally add the latter to compleat the union.
 We have a strong propensity to compleat every union by joining new
 relations to those which we have before observed betwixt any ideas, as
 we shall have occasion to observe presently. [Sect. 5.]
 
 Having thus given an account of all the systems both popular and
 philosophical, with regard to external existences, I cannot forbear
 giving vent to a certain sentiment, which arises upon reviewing those
 systems. I begun this subject with premising, that we ought to have an
 implicit faith in our senses, and that this would be the conclusion, I
 should draw from the whole of my reasoning. But to be ingenuous, I feel
 myself at present of a quite contrary sentiment, and am more inclined
 to repose no faith at all in my senses, or rather imagination, than
 to place in it such an implicit confidence. I cannot conceive how such
 trivial qualities of the fancy, conducted by such false suppositions,
 can ever lead to any solid and rational system. They are the coherence
 and constancy of our perceptions, which produce the opinion of their
 continued existence; though these qualities of perceptions have no
 perceivable connexion with such an existence. The constancy of our
 perceptions has the most considerable effect, and yet is attended with
 the greatest difficulties. It is a gross illusion to suppose, that
 our resembling perceptions are numerically the same; and it is this
 illusion, which leads us into the opinion, that these perceptions are
 uninterrupted, and are still existent, even when they are not present
 to the senses. This is the case with our popular system. And as to
 our philosophical one, it is liable to the same difficulties; and is
 over-and-above loaded with this absurdity, that it at once denies and
 establishes the vulgar supposition. Philosophers deny our resembling
 perceptions to be identically the same, and uninterrupted; and yet have
 so great a propensity to believe them such, that they arbitrarily invent
 a new set of perceptions, to which they attribute these qualities. I
 say, a new set of perceptions: For we may well suppose in general, but
 it is impossible for us distinctly to conceive, objects to be in their
 nature any thing but exactly the same with perceptions. What then can
 we look for from this confusion of groundless and extraordinary opinions
 but error and falshood? And how can we justify to ourselves any belief
 we repose in them?
 
 This sceptical doubt, both with respect to reason and the senses, is
 a malady, which can never be radically cured, but must return upon
 us every moment, however we may chace it away, and sometimes may seem
 entirely free from it. It is impossible upon any system to defend either
 our understanding or senses; and we but expose them farther when we
 endeavour to justify them in that manner. As the sceptical doubt arises
 naturally from a profound and intense reflection on those subjects,
 it always encreases, the farther we carry our reflections, whether in
 opposition or conformity to it. Carelessness and in-attention alone can
 afford us any remedy. For this reason I rely entirely upon them; and
 take it for granted, whatever may be the reader's opinion at this
 present moment, that an hour hence he will be persuaded there is both an
 external and internal world; and going upon that supposition, I intend
 to examine some general systems both ancient and modern, which have
 been proposed of both, before I proceed to a more particular enquiry
 concerning our impressions. This will not, perhaps, in the end be found
 foreign to our present purpose.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. III. OF THE ANTIENT PHILOSOPHY.
 
 
 Several moralists have recommended it as an excellent method of becoming
 acquainted with our own hearts, and knowing our progress in virtue,
 to recollect our dreams in a morning, and examine them with the same
 rigour, that we would our most serious and most deliberate actions.
 Our character is the same throughout, say they, and appears best
 where artifice, fear, and policy have no place, and men can neither be
 hypocrites with themselves nor others. The generosity, or baseness
 of our temper, our meekness or cruelty, our courage or pusilanimity,
 influence the fictions of the imagination with the most unbounded
 liberty, and discover themselves in the most glaring colours. In like
 manner, I am persuaded, there might be several useful discoveries made
 from a criticism of the fictions of the antient philosophy, concerning
 substances, and substantial form, and accidents, and occult qualities;
 which, however unreasonable and capricious, have a very intimate
 connexion with the principles of human nature.
 
 It is confest by the most judicious philosophers, that our ideas of
 bodies are nothing but collections formed by the mind of the ideas of
 the several distinct sensible qualities, of which objects are composed,
 and which we find to have a constant union with each other. But however
 these qualities may in themselves be entirely distinct, it is certain
 we commonly regard the compound, which they form, as ONE thing, and
 as continuing the SAME under very considerable alterations. The
 acknowledged composition is evidently contrary to this supposed
 simplicity, and the variation to the identity. It may, therefore, be
 worth while to consider the causes, which make us almost universally
 fall into such evident contradictions, as well as the means by which we
 endeavour to conceal them.
 
 It is evident, that as the ideas of the several distinct, successive
 qualities of objects are united together by a very close relation, the
 mind, in looking along the succession, must be carryed from one part
 of it to another by an easy transition, and will no more perceive the
 change, than if it contemplated the same unchangeable object. This easy
 transition is the effect, or rather essence of relation; I and as the
 imagination readily takes one idea for another, where their influence
 on the mind is similar; hence it proceeds, that any such succession
 of related qualities is readily considered as one continued object,
 existing without any variation. The smooth and uninterrupted progress of
 the thought, being alike in both cases, readily deceives the mind, and
 makes us ascribe an identity to the changeable succession of connected
 qualities.
 
 But when we alter our method of considering the succession, and instead
 of traceing it gradually through the successive points of time, survey
 at once Any two distinct periods of its duration, and compare the
 different conditions of the successive qualities; in that case the
 variations, which were insensible when they arose gradually, do now
 appear of consequence, and seem entirely to destroy the identity. By
 this means there arises a kind of contrariety in our method of thinking,
 from the different points of view, in which we survey the object, and
 from the nearness or remoteness of those instants of time, which we
 compare together. When we gradually follow an object in its successive
 changes, the smooth progress of the thought makes us ascribe an identity
 to the succession; because it is by a similar act of the mind we
 consider an unchangeable object. When we compare its situation after
 a considerable change the progress of the thought is broke; and
 consequently we are presented with the idea of diversity: In order to
 reconcile which contradictions the imagination is apt to feign something
 unknown and invisible, which it supposes to continue the same under
 all these variations; and this unintelligible something it calls a
 substance, or original and first matter.
 
 We entertain a like notion with regard to the simplicity of substances,
 and from like causes. Suppose an object perfectly simple and indivisible
 to be presented, along with another object, whose co-existent parts are
 connected together by a strong relation, it is evident the actions of
 the mind, in considering these two objects, are not very different. The
 imagination conceives the simple object at once, with facility, by a
 single effort of thought, without change or variation. The connexion of
 parts in the compound object has almost the same effect, and so unites
 the object within itself, that the fancy feels not the transition in
 passing from one part to another. Hence the colour, taste, figure,
 solidity, and other qualities, combined in a peach or melon, are
 conceived to form one thing; and that on account of their close
 relation, which makes them affect the thought in the same manner, as if
 perfectly uncompounded. But the mind rests not here. Whenever it views
 the object in another light, it finds that all these qualities are
 different, and distinguishable, and separable from each other; which
 view of things being destructive of its primary and more natural
 notions, obliges the imagination to feign an unknown something, or
 original substance and matter, as a principle of union or cohesion among
 these qualities, and as what may give the compound object a title to be
 called one thing, notwithstanding its diversity and composition.
 
 The peripatetic philosophy asserts the original matter to be perfectly
 homogeneous in all bodies, and considers fire, water, earth, and air, as
 of the very same substance; on account of their gradual revolutions and
 changes into each other. At the same time it assigns to each of these
 species of objects a distinct substantial form, which it supposes to be
 the source of all those different qualities they possess, and to be a
 new foundation of simplicity and identity to each particular species.
 All depends on our manner of viewing the objects. When we look along the
 insensible changes of bodies, we suppose all of them to be of the same
 substance or essence. When we consider their sensible differences, we
 attribute to each of them a substantial and essential difference. And
 in order to indulge ourselves in both these ways of considering our
 objects, we suppose all bodies to have at once a substance and a
 substantial form.
 
 The notion of accidents is an unavoidable consequence of this method
 of thinking with regard to substances and substantial forms; nor can
 we forbear looking upon colours, sounds, tastes, figures, and other
 properties of bodies, as existences, which cannot subsist apart, but
 require a subject of inhesion to sustain and support them. For having
 never discovered any of these sensible qualities, where, for the reasons
 above-mentioned, we did not likewise fancy a substance to exist; the
 same habit, which makes us infer a connexion betwixt cause and effect,
 makes us here infer a dependence of every quality on the unknown
 substance. The custom of imagining a dependence has the same effect as
 the custom of observing it would have. This conceit, however, is no more
 reasonable than any of the foregoing. Every quality being a distinct
 thing from another, may be conceived to exist apart, and may exist
 apart, not only from every other quality, but from that unintelligible
 chimera of a substance.
 
 But these philosophers carry their fictions still farther in their
 sentiments concerning occult qualities, and both suppose a substance
 supporting, which they do not understand, and an accident supported, of
 which they have as imperfect an idea. The whole system, therefore, is
 entirely incomprehensible, and yet is derived from principles as natural
 as any of these above-explained.
 
 In considering this subject we may observe a gradation of three
 opinions, that rise above each other, according as the persons, who form
 them, acquire new degrees of reason and knowledge. These opinions are
 that of the vulgar, that of a false philosophy, and that of the true;
 where we shall find upon enquiry, that the true philosophy approaches
 nearer to the sentiments of the vulgar, than to those of a mistaken
 knowledge. It is natural for men, in their common and care, less way of
 thinking, to imagine they perceive a connexion betwixt such objects
 as they have constantly found united together; and because custom has
 rendered it difficult to separate the ideas, they are apt to fancy such
 a separation to be in itself impossible and absurd. But philosophers,
 who abstract from the effects of custom, and compare the ideas of
 objects, immediately perceive the falshood of these vulgar sentiments,
 and discover that there is no known connexion among objects. Every
 different object appears to them entirely distinct and separate; and
 they perceive, that it is not from a view of the nature and qualities of
 objects we infer one from another, but only when in several instances we
 observe them to have been constantly conjoined. But these philosophers,
 instead of drawing a just inference from this observation, and
 concluding, that we have no idea of power or agency, separate from
 the mind, and belonging to causes; I say, instead of drawing this
 conclusion, they frequently search for the qualities, in which this
 agency consists, and are displeased with every system, which their
 reason suggests to them, in order to explain it. They have sufficient
 force of genius to free them from the vulgar error, that there is a
 natural and perceivable connexion betwixt the several sensible qualities
 and actions of matter; but not sufficient to keep them from ever
 seeking for this connexion in matter, or causes. Had they fallen upon
 the just conclusion, they would have returned back to the situation
 of the vulgar, and would have regarded all these disquisitions with
 indolence and indifference. At present they seem to be in a very
 lamentable condition, and such as the poets have given us but a faint
 notion of in their descriptions of the punishment of Sisyphus and
 Tantalus. For what can be imagined more tormenting, than to seek with
 eagerness, what for ever flies us; and seek for it in a place, where it
 is impossible it can ever exist?
 
 But as nature seems to have observed a kind of justice and compensation
 in every thing, she has not neglected philosophers more than the rest
 of the creation; but has reserved them a consolation amid all their
 disappointments and afflictions. This consolation principally consists
 in their invention of the words: faculty and occult quality. For
 it being usual, after the frequent use of terms, which are really
 significant and intelligible, to omit the idea, which we would express
 by them, and to preserve only the custom, by which we recal the idea at
 pleasure; so it naturally happens, that after the frequent use of terms,
 which are wholly insignificant and unintelligible, we fancy them to be
 on the same footing with the precedent, and to have a secret meaning,
 which we might discover by reflection. The resemblance of their
 appearance deceives the mind, as is usual, and makes us imagine a
 thorough resemblance and conformity. By this means these philosophers
 set themselves at ease, and arrive at last, by an illusion, at the
 same indifference, which the people attain by their stupidity, and true
 philosophers by their moderate scepticism. They need only say, that
 any phenomenon, which puzzles them, arises from a faculty or an occult
 quality, and there is an end of all dispute and enquiry upon the matter.
 
 But among all the instances, wherein the Peripatetics have shewn they
 were guided by every trivial propensity of the imagination, no one is
 more-remarkable than their sympathies, antipathies, and horrors of
 a vacuum. There is a very remarkable inclination in human nature, to
 bestow on external objects the same emotions, which it observes in
 itself; and to find every where those ideas, which are most present to
 it. This inclination, it is true, is suppressed by a little reflection,
 and only takes place in children, poets, and the antient philosophers.
 It appears in children, by their desire of beating the stones, which
 hurt them: In poets, by their readiness to personify every thing: And in
 the antient philosophers, by these fictions of sympathy and antipathy.
 We must pardon children, because of their age; poets, because they
 profess to follow implicitly the suggestions of their fancy: But
 what excuse shall we find to justify our philosophers in so signal a
 weakness?
 
 
 
 
 SECT. IV. OF THE MODERN PHILOSOPHY.
 
 
 But here it may be objected, that the imagination, according to my own
 confession, being the ultimate judge of all systems of philosophy, I
 am unjust in blaming the antient philosophers for making use of that
 faculty, and allowing themselves to be entirely guided by it in their
 reasonings. In order to justify myself, I must distinguish in the
 imagination betwixt the principles which are permanent, irresistible,
 and universal; such as the customary transition from causes to effects,
 and from effects to causes: And the principles, which are changeable,
 weak, and irregular; such as those I have just now taken notice of. The
 former are the foundation of all our thoughts and actions, so that upon
 their removal human nature must immediately perish and go to ruin. The
 latter are neither unavoidable to mankind, nor necessary, or so much as
 useful in the conduct of life; but on the contrary are observed only to
 take place in weak minds, and being opposite to the other principles
 of custom and reasoning, may easily be subverted by a due contrast and
 opposition. For this reason the former are received by philosophy, and
 the latter rejected. One who concludes somebody to be near him, when
 he hears an articulate voice in the dark, reasons justly and naturally;
 though that conclusion be derived from nothing but custom, which infixes
 and inlivens the idea of a human creature, on account of his usual
 conjunction with the present impression. But one, who is tormented
 he knows not why, with the apprehension of spectres in the dark, may,
 perhaps, be said to reason, and to reason naturally too: But then it
 must be in the same sense, that a malady is said to be natural; as
 arising from natural causes, though it be contrary to health, the most
 agreeable and most natural situation of man.
 
 The opinions of the antient philosophers, their fictions of substance
 and accident, and their reasonings concerning substantial forms and
 occult qualities, are like the spectres in the dark, and are derived
 from principles, which, however common, are neither universal nor
 unavoidable in human nature. The modern philosophy pretends to be
 entirely free from this defect, and to arise only from the solid,
 permanent, and consistent principles of the imagination. Upon what
 grounds this pretension is founded must now be the subject of our
 enquiry.
 
 The fundamental principle of that philosophy is the opinion concerning
 colours, sounds, tastes, smells, heat and cold; which it asserts to
 be nothing but impressions in the mind, derived from the operation of
 external objects, and without any resemblance to the qualities of the
 objects. Upon examination, I find only one of the reasons commonly
 produced for this opinion to be satisfactory, viz. that derived from the
 variations of those impressions, even while the external object, to all
 appearance, continues the same. These variations depend upon several
 circumstances. Upon the different situations of our health: A man in a
 malady feels a disagreeable taste in meats, which before pleased him the
 most. Upon the different complexions and constitutions of men That seems
 bitter to one, which is sweet to another. Upon the difference of their
 external situation and position: Colours reflected from the clouds
 change according to the distance of the clouds, and according to the
 angle they make with the eye and luminous body. Fire also communicates
 the sensation of pleasure at one distance, and that of pain at another.
 Instances of this kind are very numerous and frequent.
 
 The conclusion drawn from them, is likewise as satisfactory as can
 possibly be imagined. It is certain, that when different impressions of
 the same sense arise from any object, every one of these impressions has
 not a resembling quality existent in the object. For as the same object
 cannot, at the same time, be endowed with different qualities of the
 same sense, and as the same quality cannot resemble impressions entirely
 different; it evidently follows, that many of our impressions have
 no external model or archetype. Now from like effects we presume like
 causes. Many of the impressions of colour, sound, &c. are confest to be
 nothing but internal existences, and to arise from causes, which no ways
 resemble them. These impressions are in appearance nothing different
 from the other impressions of colour, sound, &c. We conclude, therefore,
 that they are, all of them, derived from a like origin.
 
 This principle being once admitted, all the other doctrines of that
 philosophy seem to follow by an easy consequence. For upon the removal
 of sounds, colours, beat, cold, and other sensible qualities, from the
 rank of continued independent existences, we are reduced merely to what
 are called primary qualities, as the only real ones, of which we have
 any adequate notion. These primary qualities are extension and solidity,
 with their different mixtures and modifications; figure, motion,
 gravity, and cohesion. The generation, encrease, decay, and corruption
 of animals and vegetables, are nothing but changes of figure and motion;
 as also the operations of all bodies on each other; of fire, of light,
 water, air, earth, and of all the elements and powers of nature. One
 figure and motion produces another figure and motion; nor does there
 remain in the material universe any other principle, either active or
 passive, of which we can form the most distant idea.
 
 I believe many objections might be made to this system But at present
 I shall confine myself to one, which is in my opinion very decisive. I
 assert, that instead of explaining the operations of external objects by
 its means, we utterly annihilate all these objects, and reduce ourselves
 to the opinions of the most extravagant scepticism concerning them. If
 colours, sounds, tastes, and smells be merely perceptions, nothing we
 can conceive is possest of a real, continued, and independent existence;
 not even motion, extension and solidity, which are the primary qualities
 chiefly insisted on.
 
 To begin with the examination of motion; it is evident this is a quality
 altogether inconceivable alone, and without a reference to some other
 object. The idea of motion necessarily supposes that of a body moving.
 Now what is our idea of the moving body, without which motion is
 incomprehensible? It must resolve itself into the idea of extension or
 of solidity; and consequently the reality of motion depends upon that of
 these other qualities.
 
 This opinion, which is universally acknowledged concerning motion, I
 have proved to be true with regard to extension; and have shewn that it
 is impossible to conceive extension, but as composed of parts, endowed
 with colour or solidity. The idea of extension is a compound idea;
 but as it is not compounded of an infinite number of parts or inferior
 ideas, it must at last resolve itself into such as are perfectly simple
 and indivisible. These simple and indivisible parts, not being ideas of
 extension, must be non entities, unless conceived as coloured or solid.
 Colour is excluded from any real existence. The reality, therefore, of
 our idea of extension depends upon the reality of that of solidity, nor
 can the former be just while the latter is chimerical. Let us, then,
 lend our attention to the examination of the idea of solidity.
 
 The idea of solidity is that of two objects, which being impelled by the
 utmost force, cannot penetrate each other; but still maintain a
 separate and distinct existence. Solidity, therefore, is perfectly
 incomprehensible alone, and without the conception of some bodies, which
 are solid, and maintain this separate and distinct existence. Now what
 idea have we of these bodies? The ideas of colours, sounds, and other
 secondary qualities are excluded. The idea of motion depends on that
 of extension, and the idea of extension on that of solidity. It is
 impossible, therefore, that the idea of solidity can depend on either of
 them. For that would be to run in a circle, and make one idea depend on
 another, while at the same time the latter depends on the former. Our
 modern philosophy, therefore, leaves us no just nor satisfactory idea of
 solidity; nor consequently of matter.
 
 This argument will appear entirely conclusive to every one that
 comprehends it; but because it may seem abstruse and intricate to the
 generality of readers, I hope to be excused, if I endeavour to render
 it more obvious by some variation of the expression. In order to form
 an idea of solidity, we must conceive two bodies pressing on each other
 without any penetration; and it is impossible to arrive at this idea,
 when we confine ourselves to one object, much more without conceiving
 any. Two non-entities cannot exclude each other from their places;
 because they never possess any place, nor can be endowed with any
 quality. Now I ask, what idea do we form of these bodies or objects,
 to which we suppose solidity to belong? To say, that we conceive them
 merely as solid, is to run on in infinitum. To affirm, that we paint
 them out to ourselves as extended, either resolves all into a false
 idea, or returns in a circle. Extension must necessarily be considered
 either as coloured, which is a false idea; I or as solid, which
 brings us back to the first question. We may make the same observation
 concerning mobility and figure; and upon the whole must conclude, that
 after the exclusion of colours, sounds, heat and cold from the rank of
 external existences, there remains nothing, which can afford us a just
 and constituent idea of body.
 
 Add to this, that, properly speaking, solidity or impenetrability is
 nothing, but an impossibility of annihilation, as [Part II. Sect. 4.]
 has been already observed: For which reason it is the more necessary
 for us to form some distinct idea of that object, whose annihilation we
 suppose impossible. An impossibility of being annihilated cannot exist,
 and can never be conceived to exist, by itself: but necessarily
 requires some object or real existence, to which it may belong. Now
 the difficulty still remains, how to form an idea of this object
 or existence, without having recourse to the secondary and sensible
 qualities.
 
 Nor must we omit on this occasion our accustomed method of examining
 ideas by considering those impressions, from which they are derived. The
 impressions, which enter by the sight and hearing, the smell and taste,
 are affirmed by modern philosophy to be without any resembling objects;
 and consequently the idea of solidity, which is supposed to be real, can
 never be derived from any of these senses. There remains, therefore,
 the feeling as the only sense, that can convey the impression, which is
 original to the idea of solidity; and indeed we naturally imagine, that
 we feel the solidity of bodies, and need but touch any object in order
 to perceive this quality. But this method of thinking is more popular
 than philosophical; as will appear from the following reflections.
 
 First, It is easy to observe, that though bodies are felt by means of
 their solidity, yet the feeling is a quite different thing from the
 solidity; and that they have not the least resemblance to each other.
 A man, who has the palsey in one hand, has as perfect an idea of
 impenetrability, when he observes that hand to be supported by the
 table, as when he feels the same table with the other hand. An object,
 that presses upon any of our members, meets with resistance; and that
 resistance, by the motion it gives to the nerves and animal spirits,
 conveys a certain sensation to the mind; but it does not follow, that
 the sensation, motion, and resistance are any ways resembling.
 
 Secondly, The impressions of touch are simple impressions, except when
 considered with regard to their extension; which makes nothing to the
 present purpose: And from this simplicity I infer, that they neither
 represent solidity, nor any real object. For let us put two cases, viz.
 that of a man, who presses a stone, or any solid body, with his hand,
 and that of two stones, which press each other; it will readily be
 allowed, that these two cases are not in every respect alike, but
 that in the former there is conjoined with the solidity, a feeling or
 sensation, of which there is no appearance in the latter. In order,
 therefore, to make these two cases alike, it is necessary to remove some
 part of the impression, which the man feels by his hand, or organ of
 sensation; and that being impossible in a simple impression, obliges
 us to remove the whole, and proves that this whole impression has
 no archetype or model in external objects. To which we may add, that
 solidity necessarily supposes two bodies, along with contiguity and
 impulse; which being a compound object, can never be represented by a
 simple impression. Not to mention, that though solidity continues always
 invariably the same, the impressions of touch change every moment upon
 us; which is a clear proof that the latter are not representations of
 the former.
 
 Thus there is a direct and total opposition betwixt our reason and our
 senses; or more properly speaking, betwixt those conclusions we form
 from cause and effect, and those that persuade us of the continued and
 independent existence of body. When we reason from cause and effect, we
 conclude, that neither colour, sound, taste, nor smell have a continued
 and independent existence. When we exclude these sensible qualities
 there remains nothing in the universe, which has such an existence.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. V. OF THE IMMATERIALITY OF THE SOUL.
 
 
 Having found such contradictions and difficulties in every system
 concerning external objects, and in the idea of matter, which we fancy
 so clear and determinate, We shall naturally expect still greater
 difficulties and contradictions in every hypothesis concerning our
 internal perceptions, and the nature of the mind, which we are apt
 to imagine so much more obscure, and uncertain. But in this we should
 deceive ourselves. The intellectual world, though involved in infinite
 obscurities, is not perplexed with any such contradictions, as those we
 have discovered in the natural. What is known concerning it, agrees with
 itself; and what is unknown, we must be contented to leave so.
 
 It is true, would we hearken to certain philosophers, they promise to
 diminish our ignorance; but I am afraid it is at the hazard of running
 us into contradictions, from which the subject is of itself exempted.
 These philosophers are the curious reasoners concerning the material or
 immaterial substances, in which they suppose our perceptions to inhere.
 In order to put a stop to these endless cavils on both sides, I know no
 better method, than to ask these philosophers in a few words, What
 they mean by substance and inhesion? And after they have answered
 this question, it will then be reasonable, and not till then, to enter
 seriously into the dispute.
 
 This question we have found impossible to be answered with regard to
 matter and body: But besides that in the case of the mind, it labours
 under all the same difficulties, it is burthened with some additional
 ones, which are peculiar to that subject. As every idea is derived from
 a precedent impression, had we any idea of the substance of our minds,
 we must also have an impression of it; which is very difficult, if
 not impossible, to be conceived. For how can an impression represent a
 substance, otherwise than by resembling it? And how can an impression
 resemble a substance, since, according to this philosophy, it is not a
 substance, and has none of the peculiar qualities or characteristics of
 a substance?
 
 But leaving the question of what may or may not be, for that other what
 actually is, I desire those philosophers, who pretend that we have an
 idea of the substance of our minds, to point out the impression that
 produces it, and tell distinctly after what manner that impression
 operates, and from what object it is derived. Is it an impression of
 sensation or of reflection? Is it pleasant, or painful, or indifferent?
 I Does it attend us at all times, or does it only return at intervals?
 If at intervals, at what times principally does it return, and by what
 causes is it produced?
 
 If instead of answering these questions, any one should evade the
 difficulty, by saying, that the definition of a substance is something
 which may exist by itself; and that this definition ought to satisfy us:
 should this be said, I should observe, that this definition agrees to
 every thing, that can possibly be conceived; and never will serve to
 distinguish substance from accident, or the soul from its perceptions.
 For thus I reason. Whatever is clearly conceived may exist; and whatever
 is clearly conceived, after any manner, may exist after the same manner.
 This is one principle, which has been already acknowledged. Again, every
 thing, which is different, is distinguishable, and every thing which
 is distinguishable, is separable by the imagination. This is another
 principle. My conclusion from both is, that since all our perceptions
 are different from each other, and from every thing else in the
 universe, they are also distinct and separable, and may be considered as
 separately existent, and may exist separately, and have no need of any
 thing else to support their existence. They are, therefore, substances,
 as far as this definition explains a substance.
 
 Thus neither by considering the first origin of ideas, nor by means of
 a definition are we able to arrive at any satisfactory notion of
 substance; which seems to me a sufficient reason for abandoning utterly
 that dispute concerning the materiality and immateriality of the soul,
 and makes me absolutely condemn even the question itself. We have no
 perfect idea of any thing but of a perception. A substance is entirely
 different from a perception. We have, therefore, no idea of a substance.
 Inhesion in something is supposed to be requisite to support the
 existence of our perceptions. Nothing appears requisite to support the
 existence of a perception. We have, therefore, no idea of inhesion. What
 possibility then of answering that question, Whether perceptions
 inhere in a material or immaterial substance, when we do not so much as
 understand the meaning of the question?
 
 There is one argument commonly employed for the immateriality of the
 soul, which seems to me remarkable. Whatever is extended consists of
 parts; and whatever consists of parts is divisible, if not in reality,
 at least in the imagination. But it is impossible anything divisible
 can be conjoined to a thought or perception, which is a being altogether
 inseparable and indivisible. For supposing such a conjunction, would
 the indivisible thought exist on the left or on the right hand of this
 extended divisible body? On the surface or in the middle? On the back
 or fore side of it? If it be conjoined with the extension, it must exist
 somewhere within its dimensions. If it exist within its dimensions, it
 must either exist in one particular part; and then that particular part
 is indivisible, and the perception is conjoined only with it, not with
 the extension: Or if the thought exists in every part, it must also be
 extended, and separable, and divisible, as well as the body; which is
 utterly absurd and contradictory. For can any one conceive a passion of
 a yard in length, a foot in breadth, and an inch in thickness? Thought,
 therefore, and extension are qualities wholly incompatible, and never
 can incorporate together into one subject.
 
 This argument affects not the question concerning the substance of the
 soul, but only that concerning its local conjunction with matter; and
 therefore it may not be improper to consider in general what objects
 are, or are not susceptible of a local conjunction. This is a curious
 question, and may lead us to some discoveries of considerable moment.
 
 The first notion of space and extension is derived solely from the
 senses of sight and feeling; nor is there any thing, but what is
 coloured or tangible, that has parts disposed after such a manner, as to
 convey that idea. When we diminish or encrease a relish, it is not after
 the same manner that we diminish or encrease any visible object; and
 when several sounds strike our hearing at once, custom and reflection
 alone make us form an idea of the degrees of the distance and contiguity
 of those bodies, from which they are derived. Whatever marks the place
 of its existence either must be extended, or must be a mathematical
 point, without parts or composition. What is extended must have a
 particular figure, as square, round, triangular; none of which will
 agree to a desire, or indeed to any impression or idea, except to these
 two senses above-mentioned. Neither ought a desire, though indivisible,
 to be considered as a mathematical point. For in that case it would be
 possible, by the addition of others, to make two, three, four desires,
 and these disposed and situated in such a manner, as to have a
 determinate length, breadth and thickness; which is evidently absurd.
 
 It will not be surprising after this, if I deliver a maxim, which is
 condemned by several metaphysicians, and is esteemed contrary to the
 most certain principles of hum reason. This maxim is that an object
 may exist, and yet be no where: and I assert, that this is not only
 possible, but that the greatest part of beings do and must exist after
 this manner. An object may be said to be no where, when its parts are
 not so situated with respect to each other, as to form any figure or
 quantity; nor the whole with respect to other bodies so as to answer to
 our notions of contiguity or distance. Now this is evidently the case
 with all our perceptions and objects, except those of the sight and
 feeling. A moral reflection cannot be placed on the right or on the left
 hand of a passion, nor can a smell or sound be either of a circular or a
 square figure. These objects and perceptions, so far from requiring
 any particular place, are absolutely incompatible with it, and even
 the imagination cannot attribute it to them. And as to the absurdity of
 supposing them to be no where, we may consider, that if the passions and
 sentiments appear to the perception to have any particular place, the
 idea of extension might be derived from them, as well as from the sight
 and touch; contrary to what we have already established. If they APPEAR
 not to have any particular place, they may possibly exist in the same
 manner; since whatever we conceive is possible.
 
 It will not now be necessary to prove, that those perceptions, which are
 simple, and exist no where, are incapable of any conjunction in place
 with matter or body, which is extended and divisible; since it is
 impossible to found a relation but on some common quality. It may
 be better worth our while to remark, that this question of the local
 conjunction of objects does not only occur in metaphysical disputes
 concerning the nature of the soul, but that even in common life we have
 every moment occasion to examine it. Thus supposing we consider a fig at
 one end of the table, and an olive at the other, it is evident, that in
 forming the complex ideas of these substances, one of the most obvious
 is that of their different relishes; and it is as evident, that we
 incorporate and conjoin these qualities with such as are coloured
 and tangible. The bitter taste of the one, and sweet of the other are
 supposed to lie in the very visible body, and to be separated from
 each other by the whole length of the table. This is so notable and so
 natural an illusion, that it may be proper to consider the principles,
 from which it is derived.
 
 Though an extended object be incapable of a conjunction in place with
 another, that exists without any place or extension, yet are they
 susceptible of many other relations. Thus the taste and smell of
 any fruit are inseparable from its other qualities of colour and
 tangibility; and whichever of them be the cause or effect, it is certain
 they are always co-existent. Nor are they only co-existent in general,
 but also co-temporary in their appearance in the mind; and it is upon
 the application of the extended body to our senses we perceive its
 particular taste and smell. These relations, then, of causation, and
 contiguity in the time of their appearance, betwixt the extended object
 and the quality, which exists without any particular place, must have
 such an effect on the mind, that upon the appearance of one it will
 immediately turn its thought to the conception of the other. Nor is this
 all. We not only turn our thought from one to the other upon account of
 their relation, but likewise endeavour to give them a new relation, viz.
 that of a CONJUNCTION IN PLACE, that we may render the transition more
 easy and natural. For it is a quality, which I shall often have occasion
 to remark in human nature, and shall explain more fully in its proper
 place, that when objects are united by any relation, we have a strong
 propensity to add some new relation to them, in order to compleat the
 union. In our arrangement of bodies we never fail to place such as are
 resembling, in contiguity to each other, or at least in correspondent
 points of view: Why? but because we feel a satisfaction in joining the
 relation of contiguity to that of resemblance, or the resemblance of
 situation to that of qualities. The effects this propensity have been
 [Sect. 2, towards the end.] already observed in that resemblance, which
 we so readily suppose betwixt particular impressions and their external
 causes. But we shall not find a more evident effect of it, than in the
 present instance, where from the relations of causation and contiguity
 in time betwixt two objects, we feign likewise that of a conjunction in
 place, in order to strengthen the connexion.
 
 But whatever confused notions we may form of an union in place betwixt
 an extended body, as a fig, and its particular taste, it is certain
 that upon reflection we must observe this union something altogether
 unintelligible and contradictory. For should we ask ourselves one
 obvious question, viz. if the taste, which we conceive to be contained
 in the circumference of the body, is in every part of it or in one only,
 we must quickly find ourselves at a loss, and perceive the impossibility
 of ever giving a satisfactory answer. We cannot rely, that it is only
 in one part: For experience convinces us, that every part has the same
 relish. We can as little reply, that it exists in every part: For
 then we must suppose it figured and extended; which is absurd and
 incomprehensible. Here then we are influenced by two principles directly
 contrary to each other, viz. that inclination of our fancy by which we
 are determined to incorporate the taste with the extended object, and
 our reason, which shows us the impossibility of such an union. Being
 divided betwixt these opposite principles, we renounce neither one nor
 the other, but involve the subject in such confusion and obscurity, that
 we no longer perceive the opposition. We suppose, that the taste exists
 within the circumference of the body, but in such a manner, that it
 fills the whole without extension, and exists entire in every part
 without separation. In short, we use in our most familiar way of
 thinking, that scholastic principle, which, when crudely proposed,
 appears so shocking, of TOTUM IN TOTO & TOLUM IN QUALIBET PARTE: Which
 is much the same, as if we should say, that a thing is in a certain
 place, and yet is not there.
 
 All this absurdity proceeds from our endeavouring to bestow a place on
 what is utterly incapable of it; and that endeavour again arises from
 our inclination to compleat an union, which is founded on causation,
 and a contiguity of time, by attributing to the objects a conjunction in
 place. But if ever reason be of sufficient force to overcome prejudice,
 it is certain, that in the present case it must prevail. For we have
 only this choice left, either to suppose that some beings exist without
 any place; or that they are figured and extended; or that when they are
 incorporated with extended objects, the whole is in the whole, and the
 whole in every part. The absurdity of the two last suppositions proves
 sufficiently the veracity of the first. Nor is there any fourth
 opinion. For as to the supposition of their existence in the manner of
 mathematical points, it resolves itself into the second opinion, and
 supposes, that several passions may be placed in a circular figure,
 and that a certain number of smells, conjoined with a certain number of
 sounds, may make a body of twelve cubic inches; which appears ridiculous
 upon the bare mentioning of it.
 
 But though in this view of things we cannot refuse to condemn the
 materialists, who conjoin all thought with extension; yet a little
 reflection will show us equal reason for blaming their antagonists, who
 conjoin all thought with a simple and indivisible substance. The most
 vulgar philosophy informs us, that no external object can make itself
 known to the mind immediately, and without the interposition of an
 image or perception. That table, which just now appears to me, is only a
 perception, and all its qualities are qualities of a perception. Now the
 most obvious of all its qualities is extension. The perception consists
 of parts. These parts are so situated, as to afford us the notion
 of distance and contiguity; of length, breadth, and thickness. The
 termination of these three dimensions is what we call figure. This
 figure is moveable, separable, and divisible. Mobility, and separability
 are the distinguishing properties of extended objects. And to cut short
 all disputes, the very idea of extension is copyed from nothing but an
 impression, and consequently must perfectly agree to it. To say the idea
 of extension agrees to any thing, is to say it is extended.
 
 The free-thinker may now triumph in his turn; and having found there are
 impressions and ideas really extended, may ask his antagonists, how
 they can incorporate a simple and indivisible subject with an extended
 perception? All the arguments of Theologians may here be retorted upon
 them. Is the indivisible subject, or immaterial substance, if you
 will, on the left or on the right hand of the perception? Is it in this
 particular part, or in that other? Is it in every part without being
 extended? Or is it entire in any one part without deserting the rest? It
 is impossible to give any answer to these questions, but what will both
 be absurd in itself, and will account for the union of our indivisible
 perceptions with an extended substance.
 
 This gives me an occasion to take a-new into consideration the question
 concerning the substance of the soul; and though I have condemned that
 question as utterly unintelligible, yet I cannot forbear proposing some
 farther reflections concerning it. I assert, that the doctrine of the
 immateriality, simplicity, and indivisibility of a thinking substance
 is a true atheism, and will serve to justify all those sentiments, for
 which Spinoza is so universally infamous. From this topic, I hope at
 least to reap one advantage, that my adversaries will not have any
 pretext to render the present doctrine odious by their declamations,
 when they see that they can be so easily retorted on them.
 
 The fundamental principle of the atheism of Spinoza is the doctrine
 of the simplicity of the universe, and the unity of that substance, in
 which he supposes both thought and matter to inhere. There is only one
 substance, says he, in the world; and that substance is perfectly simple
 and indivisible, and exists every where, without any local presence.
 Whatever we discover externally by sensation; whatever we feel
 internally by reflection; all these are nothing but modifications of
 that one, simple, and necessarily existent being, and are not possest
 of any separate or distinct existence. Every passion of the soul; every
 configuration of matter, however different and various, inhere in
 the same substance, and preserve in themselves their characters of
 distinction, without communicating them to that subject, in which
 they inhere. The same substratum, if I may so speak, supports the most
 different modifications, without any difference in itself; and varies
 them, without any variation. Neither time, nor place, nor all the
 diversity of nature are able to produce any composition or change in its
 perfect simplicity and identity.
 
 I believe this brief exposition of the principles of that famous atheist
 will be sufficient for the present purpose, and that without entering
 farther into these gloomy and obscure regions, I shall be able to
 shew, that this hideous hypothesis is almost the same with that of the
 immateriality of the soul, which has become so popular. To make this
 evident, let us [Part II, Sect. 6.] remember, that as every idea is
 derived from a preceding perception, it is impossible our idea of
 a perception, and that of an object or external existence can ever
 represent what are specifically different from each other. Whatever
 difference we may suppose betwixt them, it is still incomprehensible to
 us; and we are obliged either to conceive an external object merely as
 a relation without a relative, or to make it the very same with a
 perception or impression.
 
 The consequence I shall draw from this may, at first sight, appear a
 mere sophism; but upon the least examination will be found solid and
 satisfactory. I say then, that since we may suppose, but never can
 conceive a specific deference betwixt an object and impression;
 any conclusion we form concerning the connexion and repugnance of
 impressions, will not be known certainly to be applicable to objects;
 but that on the other hand, whatever conclusions of this kind we form
 concerning objects, will most certainly be applicable to impressions.
 The reason is not difficult. As an object is supposed to be different
 from an impression, we cannot be sure, that the circumstance, upon
 which we found our reasoning, is common to both, supposing we form the
 reasoning upon the impression. It is still possible, that the object may
 differ from it in that particular. But when we first form our reasoning
 concerning the object, it is beyond doubt, that the same reasoning must
 extend to the impression: And that because the quality of the object,
 upon which the argument is founded, must at least be conceived by
 the mind; and coued not be conceived, unless it were common to an
 impression; since we have no idea but what is derived from that origin.
 Thus we may establish it as a certain maxim, that we can never, by any
 principle, but by an irregular kind [Such as that of Sect. 2, form the
 coherence of our perceptions.] of reasoning from experience, discover
 a connexion or repugnance betwixt objects, which extends not to
 impressions; though the inverse proposition may not be equally true,
 that all the discoverable relations of impressions are common to
 objects.
 
 To apply this to the present case; there are two different systems
 of being presented, to which I suppose myself under necessity of
 assigning some substance, or ground of inhesion. I observe first the
 universe of objects or of body: The sun, moon and stars; the earth,
 seas, plants, animals, men, ships, houses, and other productions either
 of art or nature. Here Spinoza appears, and tells me, that these are
 only modifications; and that the subject, in which they inhere, is
 simple, incompounded, and indivisible. After this I consider the other
 system of beings, viz. the universe of thought, or my impressions and
 ideas. There I observe another sun, moon and stars; an earth, and seas,
 covered and inhabited by plants and animals; towns, houses, mountains,
 rivers; and in short every thing I can discover or conceive in the
 first system. Upon my enquiring concerning these, Theologians present
 themselves, and tell me, that these also are modifications, and
 modifications of one simple, uncompounded, and indivisible substance.
 Immediately upon which I am deafened with the noise of a hundred voices,
 that treat the first hypothesis with detestation and scorn, and the
 second with applause and veneration. I turn my attention to these
 hypotheses to see what may be the reason of so great a partiality; and
 find that they have the same fault of being unintelligible, and that
 as far as we can understand them, they are so much alike, that it is
 impossible to discover any absurdity in one, which is not common to both
 of them. We have no idea of any quality in an object, which does not
 agree to, and may not represent a quality in an impression; and that
 because all our ideas are derived from our impressions. We can
 never, therefore, find any repugnance betwixt an extended object as
 a modification, and a simple uncompounded essence, as its substance,
 unless that repugnance takes place equally betwixt the perception or
 impression of that extended object, and the same uncompounded essence.
 Every idea of a quality in an object passes through an impression;
 and therefore every perceivable relation, whether of connexion or
 repugnance, must be common both to objects and impressions.
 
 But though this argument, considered in general, seems evident beyond
 all doubt and contradiction, yet to make it more clear and sensible, let
 us survey it in detail; and see whether all the absurdities, which have
 been found in the system of Spinoza, may not likewise be discovered in
 that of Theologians. [See Bayle's dictionary, article of Spinoza.]
 
 First, It has been said against Spinoza, according to the scholastic way
 of talking, rather than thinking, that a mode, not being any distinct
 or separate existence, must be the very same with its substance,
 and consequently the extension of the universe, must be in a manner
 identifyed with that, simple, uncompounded essence, in which the
 universe is supposed to inhere. But this, it may be pretended, is
 utterly impossible and inconceivable unless the indivisible substance
 expand itself, so as to correspond to the extension, or the extension
 contract itself, so as to answer to the indivisible substance. This
 argument seems just, as far as we can understand it; and it is plain
 nothing is required, but a change in the terms, to apply the same
 argument to our extended perceptions, and the simple essence of the
 soul; the ideas of objects and perceptions being in every respect
 the same, only attended with the supposition of a difference, that is
 unknown and incomprehensible.
 
 Secondly, It has been said, that we have no idea of substance, which is
 not applicable to matter; nor any idea of a distinct substance, which is
 not applicable to every distinct portion of matter. Matter, therefore,
 is not a mode but a substance, and each part of matter is not a distinct
 mode, but a distinct substance. I have already proved, that we have no
 perfect idea of substance; but that taking it for something, that can
 exist by itself, it is evident every perception is a substance,
 and every distinct part of a perception a distinct substance: And
 consequently the one hypothesis labours under the same difficulties in
 this respect with the other.
 
 Thirdly, It has been objected to the system of one simple substance in
 the universe, that this substance being the support or substratum of
 every thing, must at the very same instant be modifyed into forms,
 which are contrary and incompatible. The round and square figures are
 incompatible in the same substance at the same time. How then is it
 possible, that the same substance can at once be modifyed into
 that square table, and into this round one? I ask the same question
 concerning the impressions of these tables; and find that the answer is
 no more satisfactory in one case than in the other.
 
 It appears, then, that to whatever side we turn, the same difficulties
 follow us, and that we cannot advance one step towards the establishing
 the simplicity and immateriality o the soul, without preparing the
 way for a dangerous and irrecoverable atheism. It is the same case, if
 instead o calling thought a modification of the soul, we should give it
 the more antient, and yet more modish name of an action. By an action we
 mean much the same thing, as what is commonly called an abstract
 mode; that is, something, which, properly speaking, is neither
 distinguishable, nor separable from its substance, and is only conceived
 by a distinction of reason, or an abstraction. But nothing is gained by
 this change of the term of modification, for that of action; nor do we
 free ourselves from one single difficulty by its means; as will appear
 from the two following reflexions.
 
 First, I observe, that the word, action, according to this explication
 of it, can never justly be applied to any perception, as derived from
 a mind or thinking substance. Our perceptions are all really different,
 and separable, and distinguishable from each other, and from everything
 else, which we can imagine: and therefore it is impossible to conceive,
 how they can be the action or abstract mode of any substance. The
 instance of motion, which is commonly made use of to shew after what
 manner perception depends, as an action, upon its substance, rather
 confounds than instructs us. Motion to all appearance induces no real
 nor essential change on the body, but only varies its relation to other
 objects. But betwixt a person in the morning walking a garden with
 company, agreeable to him; and a person in the afternoon inclosed in a
 dungeon, and full of terror, despair, and resentment, there seems to be
 a radical difference, and of quite another kind, than what is produced
 on a body by the change of its situation. As we conclude from the
 distinction and separability of their ideas, that external objects
 have a separate existence from each other; so when we make these ideas
 themselves our objects, we must draw the same conclusion concerning
 them, according to the precedent reasoning. At least it must be confest,
 that having idea of the substance of the soul, it is impossible for us
 to tell how it can admit of such differences, and even contrarieties of
 perception without any fundamental change; and consequently can never
 tell in what sense perceptions are actions of that substance. The use,
 therefore, of the word, action, unaccompanyed with any meaning, instead
 of that of modification, makes no addition to our knowledge, nor is of
 any advantage to the doctrine of the immateriality of the soul.
 
 I add in the second place, that if it brings any advantage to that
 cause, it must bring an equal to the cause of atheism. For do our
 Theologians pretend to make a monopoly of the word, action, and may not
 the atheists likewise take possession of it, and affirm that plants,
 animals, men, &c. are nothing but particular actions of one simple
 universal substance, which exerts itself from a blind and
 absolute necessity? This you'll say is utterly absurd. I own it is
 unintelligible; but at the same time assert, according to the principles
 above-explained, that it is impossible to discover any absurdity in the
 supposition, that all the various objects in nature are actions of
 one simple substance, which absurdity will not be applicable to a like
 supposition concerning impressions and ideas.
 
 From these hypotheses concerning the substance and local conjunction of
 our perceptions, we may pass to another, which is more intelligible
 than the former, and more important than the latter, viz. concerning the
 cause of our perceptions. Matter and motion, it is commonly said in the
 schools, however varyed, are still matter and motion, and produce only
 a difference in the position and situation of objects. Divide a body as
 often as you please, it is still body. Place it in any figure, nothing
 ever results but figure, or the relation of parts. Move it in any
 manner, you still find motion or a change of relation. It is absurd to
 imagine, that motion in a circle, for instance, should be nothing but
 merely motion in a circle; while motion in another direction, as in an
 ellipse, should also be a passion or moral reflection: That the shocking
 of two globular particles should become a sensation of pain, and that
 the meeting of two triangular ones should afford a pleasure. Now as
 these different shocks, and variations, and mixtures are the only
 changes, of which matter is susceptible, and as these never afford us
 any idea of thought or perception, it is concluded to be impossible,
 that thought can ever be caused by matter.
 
 Few have been able to withstand the seeming evidence of this argument;
 and yet nothing in the world is more easy than to refute it. We need
 only reflect on what has been proved at large, that we are never
 sensible of any connexion betwixt causes and effects, and that it is
 only by our experience of their constant conjunction, we can arrive
 at any knowledge of this relation. Now as all objects, which are not
 contrary, are susceptible of a constant conjunction, and as no real
 objects are contrary [Part III. Sect. 15.]; I have inferred from these
 principles, that to consider the matter A PRIORI, any thing may produce
 any thing, and that we shall never discover a reason, why any object may
 or may not be the cause of any other, however great, or however little
 the resemblance may be betwixt them. This evidently destroys the
 precedent reasoning concerning the cause of thought or perception. For
 though there appear no manner of connexion betwixt motion or thought,
 the case is the same with all other causes and effects. Place one body
 of a pound weight on one end of a lever, and another body of the same
 weight on another end; you will never find in these bodies any principle
 of motion dependent on their distances from the center, more than of
 thought and perception. If you pretend, therefore, to prove a priori,
 that such a position of bodies can never cause thought; because turn it
 which way you will, it is nothing but a position of bodies; you must by
 the same course of reasoning conclude, that it can never produce motion;
 since there is no more apparent connexion in the one case than in the
 other. But as this latter conclusion is contrary to evident experience,
 and as it is possible we may have a like experience in the operations of
 the mind, and may perceive a constant conjunction of thought and motion;
 you reason too hastily, when from the mere consideration of the ideas,
 you conclude that it is impossible motion can ever produce thought, or
 a different position of parts give rise to a different passion or
 reflection. Nay it is not only possible we may have such an experience,
 but it is certain we have it; since every one may perceive, that the
 different dispositions of his body change his thoughts and sentiments.
 And should it be said, that this depends on the union of soul and
 body; I would answer, that we must separate the question concerning the
 substance of the mind from that concerning the cause of its thought; and
 that confining ourselves to the latter question we find by the comparing
 their ideas, that thought and motion are different from each other,
 and by experience, that they are constantly united; which being all
 the circumstances, that enter into the idea of cause and effect, when
 applied to the operations of matter, we may certainly conclude, that
 motion may be, and actually is, the cause of thought and perception.
 
 There seems only this dilemma left us in the present case; either to
 assert, that nothing can be the cause of another, but where the mind can
 perceive the connexion in its idea of the objects: Or to maintain, that
 all objects, which we find constantly conjoined, are upon that account
 to be regarded as causes and effects. If we choose the first part of the
 dilemma, these are the consequences. First, We in reality affirm,
 that there is no such thing in the universe as a cause or productive
 principle, not even the deity himself; since our idea of that supreme
 Being is derived from particular impressions, none of which contain any
 efficacy, nor seem to have any connexion with any other existence. As to
 what may be said, that the connexion betwixt the idea of an infinitely
 powerful being, and that of any effect, which he wills, is necessary and
 unavoidable; I answer, that we have no idea of a being endowed with
 any power, much less of one endowed with infinite power. But if we will
 change expressions, we can only define power by connexion; and then in
 saying, that the idea, of an infinitely powerful being is connected with
 that of every effect, which he wills, we really do no more than
 assert, that a being, whose volition is connected with every effect,
 is connected with every effect: which is an identical proposition, and
 gives us no insight into the nature of this power or connexion. But,
 secondly, supposing, that the deity were the great and efficacious
 principle, which supplies the deficiency of all causes, this leads us
 into the grossest impieties and absurdities. For upon the same account,
 that we have recourse to him in natural operations, and assert that
 matter cannot of itself communicate motion, or produce thought, viz.
 because there is no apparent connexion betwixt these objects; I say,
 upon the very same account, we must acknowledge that the deity is the
 author of all our volitions and perceptions; since they have no more
 apparent connexion either with one another, or with the supposed but
 unknown substance of the soul. This agency of the supreme Being we know
 to have been asserted by [As father Malebranche and other Cartesians.]
 several philosophers with relation to all the actions of the mind,
 except volition, or rather an inconsiderable part of volition; though it
 is easy to perceive, that this exception is a mere pretext, to avoid the
 dangerous consequences of that doctrine. If nothing be active but
 what has an apparent power, thought is in no case any more active than
 matter; and if this inactivity must make us have recourse to a deity,
 the supreme being is the real cause of all our actions, bad as well as
 good, vicious as well as virtuous.
 
 Thus we are necessarily reduced to the other side of the dilemma, viz..
 that all objects, which are found to be constantly conjoined, are upon
 that account only to be regarded as causes and effects. Now as
 all objects, which are not contrary, are susceptible of a constant
 conjunction, and as no real objects are contrary: it follows, that for
 ought we can determine by the mere ideas, any thing may be the cause
 or effect of any thing; which evidently gives the advantage to the
 materialists above their antagonists.
 
 To pronounce, then, the final decision upon the whole; the question
 concerning the substance of the soul is absolutely unintelligible: All
 our perceptions are not susceptible of a local union, either with what
 is extended or unextended: there being some of them of the one kind,
 and some of the other: And as the constant conjunction of objects
 constitutes the very essence of cause and effect, matter and motion may
 often be regarded as the causes of thought, as far as we have any notion
 of that relation.
 
 It is certainly a kind of indignity to philosophy, whose sovereign
 authority ought every where to be acknowledged, to oblige her on every
 occasion to make apologies for her conclusions, and justify herself to
 every particular art and science, which may be offended at her. This
 puts one in mind of a king arrainged for high-treason against his
 subjects. There is only one occasion, when philosophy will think it
 necessary and even honourable to justify herself, and that is, when
 religion may seem to be in the least offended; whose rights are as
 dear to her as her own, and are indeed the same. If any one, therefore,
 should imagine that the foregoing arguments are any ways dangerous to
 religion, I hope the following apology will remove his apprehensions.
 
 There is no foundation for any conclusion a priori, either concerning
 the operations or duration of any object, of which it is possible for
 the human mind to form a conception. Any object may be imagined to
 become entirely inactive, or to be annihilated in a moment; and it is an
 evident principle, that whatever we can imagine, is possible. Now this
 is no more true of matter, than of spirit; of an extended compounded
 substance, than of a simple and unextended. In both cases the
 metaphysical arguments for the immortality of the soul are equally
 inconclusive: and in both cases the moral arguments and those derived
 from the analogy of nature are equally strong and convincing. If my
 philosophy, therefore, makes no addition to the arguments for religion,
 I have at least the satisfaction to think it takes nothing from them,
 but that every thing remains precisely as before.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VI. OF PERSONAL IDENTITY
 
 
 There are some philosophers who imagine we are every moment intimately
 conscious of what we call our SELF; that we feel its existence and its
 continuance in existence; and are certain, beyond the evidence of a
 demonstration, both o its perfect identity and simplicity. The strongest
 sensation, the most violent passion, say they, instead of distracting
 us from this view, only fix it the more intensely, and make us consider
 their influence on self either by their pain or pleasure. To attempt a
 farther proof of this were to weaken its evidence; since no proof can be
 derived from any fact, of which we are so intimately conscious; nor is
 there any thing, of which we can be certain, if we doubt of this.
 
 Unluckily all these positive assertions are contrary to that very
 experience, which is pleaded for them, nor have we any idea of self,
 after the manner it is here explained. For from what impression coued
 this idea be derived? This question it is impossible to answer without
 a manifest contradiction and absurdity; and yet it is a question, which
 must necessarily be answered, if we would have the idea of self pass for
 clear and intelligible, It must be some one impression, that gives rise
 to every real idea. But self or person is not any one impression, but
 that to which our several impressions and ideas are supposed to have
 a reference. If any impression gives rise to the idea of self, that
 impression must continue invariably the same, through the whole course
 of our lives; since self is supposed to exist after that manner. But
 there is no impression constant and invariable. Pain and pleasure, grief
 and joy, passions and sensations succeed each other, and never all
 exist at the same time. It cannot, therefore, be from any of these
 impressions, or from any other, that the idea of self is derived; and
 consequently there is no such idea.
 
 But farther, what must become of all our particular perceptions upon
 this hypothesis? All these are different, and distinguishable, and
 separable from each other, and may be separately considered, and may
 exist separately, and have no Deed of tiny thing to support their
 existence. After what manner, therefore, do they belong to self; and how
 are they connected with it? For my part, when I enter most intimately
 into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception
 or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or
 pleasure. I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and
 never can observe any thing but the perception. When my perceptions
 are removed for any time, as by sound sleep; so long am I insensible of
 myself, and may truly be said not to exist. And were all my perceptions
 removed by death, and coued I neither think, nor feel, nor see, nor
 love, nor hate after the dissolution of my body, I should be entirely
 annihilated, nor do I conceive what is farther requisite to make me a
 perfect non-entity. If any one, upon serious and unprejudiced reflection
 thinks he has a different notion of himself, I must confess I call
 reason no longer with him. All I can allow him is, that he may be in
 the right as well as I, and that we are essentially different in this
 particular. He may, perhaps, perceive something simple and continued,
 which he calls himself; though I am certain there is no such principle
 in me.
 
 But setting aside some metaphysicians of this kind, I may venture to
 affirm of the rest of mankind, that they are nothing but a bundle or
 collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an
 inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement. Our
 eyes cannot turn in their sockets without varying our perceptions. Our
 thought is still more variable than our sight; and all our other senses
 and faculties contribute to this change; nor is there any single power
 of the soul, which remains unalterably the same, perhaps for one moment.
 The mind is a kind of theatre, where several perceptions successively
 make their appearance; pass, re-pass, glide away, and mingle in an
 infinite variety of postures and situations. There is properly no
 simplicity in it at one time, nor identity in different; whatever
 natural propension we may have to imagine that simplicity and identity.
 The comparison of the theatre must not mislead us. They are the
 successive perceptions only, that constitute the mind; nor have we the
 most distant notion of the place, where these scenes are represented, or
 of the materials, of which it is composed.
 
 What then gives us so great a propension to ascribe an identity to
 these successive perceptions, and to suppose ourselves possest of an
 invariable and uninterrupted existence through the whole course of our
 lives? In order to answer this question, we must distinguish betwixt
 personal identity, as it regards our thought or imagination, and as it
 regards our passions or the concern we take in ourselves. The first is
 our present subject; and to explain it perfectly we must take the matter
 pretty deep, and account for that identity, which we attribute to plants
 and animals; there being a great analogy betwixt it, and the identity of
 a self or person.
 
 We have a distinct idea of an object, that remains invariable and
 uninterrupted through a supposed variation of time; and this idea we
 call that of identity or sameness. We have also a distinct idea of
 several different objects existing in succession, and connected together
 by a close relation; and this to an accurate view affords as perfect
 a notion of diversity, as if there was no manner of relation among the
 objects. But though these two ideas of identity, and a succession of
 related objects be in themselves perfectly distinct, and even contrary,
 yet it is certain, that in our common way of thinking they are generally
 confounded with each other. That action of the imagination, by which we
 consider the uninterrupted and invariable object, and that by which we
 reflect on the succession of related objects, are almost the same to the
 feeling, nor is there much more effort of thought required in the latter
 case than in the former. The relation facilitates the transition of the
 mind from one object to another, and renders its passage as smooth as if
 it contemplated one continued object. This resemblance is the cause
 of the confusion and mistake, and makes us substitute the notion of
 identity, instead of that of related objects. However at one instant we
 may consider the related succession as variable or interrupted, we are
 sure the next to ascribe to it a perfect identity, and regard it as
 enviable and uninterrupted. Our propensity to this mistake is so great
 from the resemblance above-mentioned, that we fall into it before we are
 aware; and though we incessantly correct ourselves by reflection, and
 return to a more accurate method of thinking, yet we cannot long sustain
 our philosophy, or take off this biass from the imagination. Our last
 resource is to yield to it, and boldly assert that these different
 related objects are in effect the same, however interrupted and
 variable. In order to justify to ourselves this absurdity, we often
 feign some new and unintelligible principle, that connects the objects
 together, and prevents their interruption or variation. Thus we feign
 the continued existence of the perceptions of our senses, to remove
 the interruption: and run into the notion of a soul, and self, and
 substance, to disguise the variation. But we may farther observe, that
 where we do not give rise to such a fiction, our propension to confound
 identity with relation is so great, that we are apt to imagine [Footnote
 10] something unknown and mysterious, connecting the parts, beside their
 relation; and this I take to be the case with regard to the identity
 we ascribe to plants and vegetables. And even when this does not take
 place, we still feel a propensity to confound these ideas, though we
 a-re not able fully to satisfy ourselves in that particular, nor
 find any thing invariable and uninterrupted to justify our notion of
 identity.
 
 
      [Footnote 10  If the reader is desirous to see how a great
      genius may be influencd by these seemingly trivial
      principles of the imagination, as well as the mere vulgar,
      let him read my Lord SHAFTSBURYS reasonings concerning the
      uniting principle of the universe, and the identity of
      plants and animals. See his MORALISTS: or, PHILOSOPHICAL
      RHAPSODY.]
 
 Thus the controversy concerning identity is not merely a dispute of
 words. For when we attribute identity, in an improper sense, to variable
 or interrupted objects, our mistake is not confined to the expression,
 but is commonly attended with a fiction, either of something invariable
 and uninterrupted, or of something mysterious and inexplicable, or at
 least with a propensity to such fictions. What will suffice to prove
 this hypothesis to the satisfaction of every fair enquirer, is to shew
 from daily experience and observation, that the objects, which are
 variable or interrupted, and yet are supposed to continue the same, are
 such only as consist of a succession of parts, connected together by
 resemblance, contiguity, or causation. For as such a succession answers
 evidently to our notion of diversity, it can only be by mistake we
 ascribe to it an identity; and as the relation of parts, which leads us
 into this mistake, is really nothing but a quality, which produces an
 association of ideas, and an easy transition of the imagination from one
 to another, it can only be from the resemblance, which this act of the
 mind bears to that, by which we contemplate one continued object, that
 the error arises. Our chief business, then, must be to prove, that
 all objects, to which we ascribe identity, without observing their
 invariableness and uninterruptedness, are such as consist of a
 succession of related objects.
 
 In order to this, suppose any mass of matter, of which the parts are
 contiguous and connected, to be placed before us; it is plain we must
 attribute a perfect identity to this mass, provided all the parts
 continue uninterruptedly and invariably the same, whatever motion or
 change of place we may observe either in the whole or in any of the
 parts. But supposing some very small or inconsiderable part to be added
 to the mass, or subtracted from it; though this absolutely destroys
 the identity of the whole, strictly speaking; yet as we seldom think so
 accurately, we scruple not to pronounce a mass of matter the same, where
 we find so trivial an alteration. The passage of the thought from the
 object before the change to the object after it, is so smooth and easy,
 that we scarce perceive the transition, and are apt to imagine, that it
 is nothing but a continued survey of the same object.
 
 There is a very remarkable circumstance, that attends this experiment;
 which is, that though the change of any considerable part in a mass
 of matter destroys the identity of the whole, let we must measure the
 greatness of the part, not absolutely, but by its proportion to the
 whole. The addition or diminution of a mountain would not be sufficient
 to produce a diversity in a planet: though the change of a very few
 inches would be able to destroy the identity of some bodies. It will be
 impossible to account for this, but by reflecting that objects operate
 upon the mind, and break or interrupt the continuity of its actions not
 according to their real greatness, but according to their proportion to
 each other: And therefore, since this interruption makes an object cease
 to appear the same, it must be the uninterrupted progress o the thought,
 which constitutes the imperfect identity.
 
 This may be confirmed by another phenomenon. A change in any
 considerable part of a body destroys its identity; but it is remarkable,
 that where the change is produced gradually and insensibly we are less
 apt to ascribe to it the same effect. The reason can plainly be no
 other, than that the mind, in following the successive changes of the
 body, feels an easy passage from the surveying its condition in one
 moment to the viewing of it in another, and at no particular time
 perceives any interruption in its actions. From which continued
 perception, it ascribes a continued existence and identity to the
 object.
 
 But whatever precaution we may use in introducing the changes gradually,
 and making them proportionable to the whole, it is certain, that where
 the changes are at last observed to become considerable, we make a
 scruple of ascribing identity to such different objects. There is,
 however, another artifice, by which we may induce the imagination to
 advance a step farther; and that is, by producing a reference of the
 parts to each other, and a combination to some common end or purpose.
 A ship, of which a considerable part has been changed by frequent
 reparations, is still considered as the same; nor does the difference
 of the materials hinder us from ascribing an identity to it. The
 common end, in which the parts conspire, is the same under all their
 variations, and affords an easy transition of the imagination from one
 situation of the body to another.
 
 But this is still more remarkable, when we add a sympathy of parts
 to their common end, and suppose that they bear to each other, the
 reciprocal relation of cause and effect in all their actions and
 operations. This is the case with all animals and vegetables; where not
 only the several parts have a reference to some general purpose, but
 also a mutual dependence on, and connexion with each other. The effect
 of so strong a relation is, that though every one must allow, that in a
 very few years both vegetables and animals endure a total change, yet we
 still attribute identity to them, while their form, size, and substance
 are entirely altered. An oak, that grows from a small plant to a large
 tree, is still the same oak; though there be not one particle of matter,
 or figure of its parts the same. An infant becomes a man-, and is
 sometimes fat, sometimes lean, without any change in his identity.
 
 We may also consider the two following phaenomena, which are remarkable
 in their kind. The first is, that though we commonly be able to
 distinguish pretty exactly betwixt numerical and specific identity, yet
 it sometimes happens, that we confound them, and in our thinking and
 reasoning employ the one for the other. Thus a man, who bears a noise,
 that is frequently interrupted and renewed, says, it is still the same
 noise; though it is evident the sounds have only a specific identity or
 resemblance, and there is nothing numerically the same, but the cause,
 which produced them. In like manner it may be said without breach of the
 propriety of language, that such a church, which was formerly of brick,
 fell to ruin, and that the parish rebuilt the same church of free-stone,
 and according to modern architecture. Here neither the form nor
 materials are the same, nor is there any thing common to the two
 objects, but their relation to the inhabitants of the parish; and yet
 this alone is sufficient to make us denominate them the same. But
 we must observe, that in these cases the first object is in a manner
 annihilated before the second comes into existence; by which means, we
 are never presented in any one point of time with the idea of difference
 and multiplicity: and for that reason are less scrupulous in calling
 them the same.
 
 Secondly, We may remark, that though in a succession of related objects,
 it be in a manner requisite, that the change of parts be not sudden nor
 entire, in order to preserve the identity, yet where the objects are
 in their nature changeable and inconstant, we admit of a more sudden
 transition, than would otherwise be consistent with that relation. Thus
 as the nature of a river consists in the motion and change of parts;
 though in less than four and twenty hours these be totally altered; this
 hinders not the river from continuing the same during several ages. What
 is natural and essential to any thing is, in a manner, expected; and
 what is expected makes less impression, and appears of less moment, than
 what is unusual and extraordinary. A considerable change of the former
 kind seems really less to the imagination, than the most trivial
 alteration of the latter; and by breaking less the continuity of the
 thought, has less influence in destroying the identity.
 
 We now proceed to explain the nature of personal identity, which has
 become so great a question ill philosophy, especially of late years in
 England, where all the abstruser sciences are studyed with a peculiar
 ardour and application. And here it is evident, the same method of
 reasoning must be continued which has so successfully explained the
 identity of plants, and animals, and ships, and houses, and of all
 the compounded and changeable productions either of art or nature. The
 identity, which we ascribe to the mind of man, is only a fictitious one,
 and of a like kind with that which we ascribe to vegetables and animal
 bodies. It cannot, therefore, have a different origin, but must proceed
 from a like operation of the imagination upon like objects.
 
 But lest this argument should not convince the reader; though in my
 opinion perfectly decisive; let him weigh the following reasoning, which
 is still closer and more immediate. It is evident, that the identity,
 which we attribute to the human mind, however perfect we may imagine it
 to be, is not able to run the several different perceptions into one,
 and make them lose their characters of distinction and difference, which
 are essential to them. It is still true, that every distinct perception,
 which enters into the composition of the mind, is a distinct existence,
 and is different, and distinguishable, and separable from every other
 perception, either contemporary or successive. But, as, notwithstanding
 this distinction and separability, we suppose the whole train of
 perceptions to be united by identity, a question naturally arises
 concerning this relation of identity; whether it be something that
 really binds our several perceptions together, or only associates
 their ideas in the imagination. That is, in other words, whether in
 pronouncing concerning the identity of a person, we observe some real
 bond among his perceptions, or only feel one among the ideas we form of
 them. This question we might easily decide, if we would recollect what
 has been already proud at large, that the understanding never observes
 any real connexion among objects, and that even the union of cause
 and effect, when strictly examined, resolves itself into a customary
 association of ideas. For from thence it evidently follows, that
 identity is nothing really belonging to these different perceptions, and
 uniting them together; but is merely a quality, which we attribute to
 them, because of the union of their ideas in the imagination, when we
 reflect upon them. Now the only qualities, which can give ideas an union
 in the imagination, are these three relations above-mentioned. There
 are the uniting principles in the ideal world, and without them
 every distinct object is separable by the mind, and may be separately
 considered, and appears not to have any more connexion with any other
 object, than if disjoined by the greatest difference and remoteness.
 It is, therefore, on some of these three relations of resemblance,
 contiguity and causation, that identity depends; and as the very essence
 of these relations consists in their producing an easy transition
 of ideas; it follows, that our notions of personal identity, proceed
 entirely from the smooth and uninterrupted progress of the thought along
 a train of connected ideas, according to the principles above-explained.
 
 The only question, therefore, which remains, is, by what relations this
 uninterrupted progress of our thought is produced, when we consider
 the successive existence of a mind or thinking person. And here it is
 evident we must confine ourselves to resemblance and causation, and must
 drop contiguity, which has little or no influence in the present case.
 
 To begin with resemblance; suppose we coued see clearly into the
 breast of another, and observe that succession of perceptions, which
 constitutes his mind or thinking principle, and suppose that he always
 preserves the memory of a considerable part of past perceptions; it is
 evident that nothing coued more contribute to the bestowing a relation
 on this succession amidst all its variations. For what is the memory but
 a faculty, by which we raise up the images of past perceptions? And
 as an image necessarily resembles its object, must not. The frequent
 placing of these resembling perceptions in the chain of thought, convey
 the imagination more easily from one link to another, and make the whole
 seem like the continuance of one object? In this particular, then, the
 memory not only discovers the identity, but also contributes to
 its production, by producing the relation of resemblance among the
 perceptions. The case is the same whether we consider ourselves or
 others.
 
 As to causation; we may observe, that the true idea of the human mind,
 is to consider it as a system of different perceptions or different
 existences, which are linked together by the relation of cause and
 effect, and mutually produce, destroy, influence, and modify each other.
 Our impressions give rise to their correspondent ideas; said these ideas
 in their turn produce other impressions. One thought chaces another,
 and draws after it a third, by which it is expelled in its turn. In this
 respect, I cannot compare the soul more properly to any thing than to a
 republic or commonwealth, in which the several members are united by the
 reciprocal ties of government and subordination, and give rise to other
 persons, who propagate the same republic in the incessant changes of
 its parts. And as the same individual republic may not only change its
 members, but also its laws and constitutions; in like manner the
 same person may vary his character and disposition, as well as his
 impressions and ideas, without losing his identity. Whatever changes
 he endures, his several parts are still connected by the relation of
 causation. And in this view our identity with regard to the passions
 serves to corroborate that with regard to the imagination, by the making
 our distant perceptions influence each other, and by giving us a present
 concern for our past or future pains or pleasures.
 
 As a memory alone acquaints us with the continuance and extent of this
 succession of perceptions, it is to be considered, upon that account
 chiefly, as the source of personal identity. Had we no memory, we never
 should have any notion of causation, nor consequently of that chain of
 causes and effects, which constitute our self or person. But having once
 acquired this notion of causation from the memory, we can extend the
 same chain of causes, and consequently the identity of car persons
 beyond our memory, and can comprehend times, and circumstances, and
 actions, which we have entirely forgot, but suppose in general to have
 existed. For how few of our past actions are there, of which we have
 any memory? Who can tell me, for instance, what were his thoughts and
 actions on the 1st of January 1715, the 11th of March 1719, and the 3rd
 of August 1733? Or will he affirm, because he has entirely forgot the
 incidents of these days, that the present self is not the same person
 with the self of that time; and by that means overturn all the most
 established notions of personal identity? In this view, therefore,
 memory does not so much produce as discover personal identity, by
 shewing us the relation of cause and effect among our different
 perceptions. It will be incumbent on those, who affirm that memory
 produces entirely our personal identity, to give a reason why we cm thus
 extend our identity beyond our memory.
 
 The whole of this doctrine leads us to a conclusion, which is of great
 importance in the present affair, viz. that all the nice and subtile
 questions concerning personal identity can never possibly be decided,
 and are to be regarded rather as gramatical than as philosophical
 difficulties. Identity depends on the relations of ideas; and these
 relations produce identity, by means of that easy transition they
 occasion. But as the relations, and the easiness of the transition may
 diminish by insensible degrees, we have no just standard, by which we
 can decide any dispute concerning the time, when they acquire or lose a
 title to the name of identity. All the disputes concerning the identity
 of connected objects are merely verbal, except so fax as the relation of
 parts gives rise to some fiction or imaginary principle of union, as we
 have already observed.
 
 What I have said concerning the first origin and uncertainty of our
 notion of identity, as applied to the human mind, may be extended with
 little or no variation to that of simplicity. An object, whose different
 co-existent parts are bound together by a close relation, operates upon
 the imagination after much the same manner as one perfectly simple and
 indivisible and requires not a much greater stretch of thought in order
 to its conception. From this similarity of operation we attribute a
 simplicity to it, and feign a principle of union as the support of this
 simplicity, and the center of all the different parts and qualities of
 the object.
 
 Thus we have finished our examination of the several systems of
 philosophy, both of the intellectual and natural world; and in our
 miscellaneous way of reasoning have been led into several topics;
 which will either illustrate and confirm some preceding part of this
 discourse, or prepare the way for our following opinions. It is now time
 to return to a more close examination of our subject, and to proceed in
 the accurate anatomy of human nature, having fully explained the nature
 of our judgment and understandings.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VII. CONCLUSION OF THIS BOOK.
 
 
 But before I launch out into those immense depths of philosophy, which
 lie before me, I find myself inclined to stop a moment in my present
 station, and to ponder that voyage, which I have undertaken, and which
 undoubtedly requires the utmost art and industry to be brought to a
 happy conclusion. Methinks I am like a man, who having struck on many
 shoals, and having narrowly escaped shipwreck in passing a small frith,
 has yet the temerity to put out to sea in the same leaky weather-beaten
 vessel, and even carries his ambition so far as to think of compassing
 the globe under these disadvantageous circumstances. My memory of past
 errors and perplexities, makes me diffident for the future. The wretched
 condition, weakness, and disorder of the faculties, I must employ in my
 enquiries, encrease my apprehensions. And the impossibility of amending
 or correcting these faculties, reduces me almost to despair, and makes
 me resolve to perish on the barren rock, on which I am at present,
 rather than venture myself upon that boundless ocean, which runs
 out into immensity. This sudden view of my danger strikes me with
 melancholy; and as it is usual for that passion, above all others, to
 indulge itself; I cannot forbear feeding my despair, with all those
 desponding reflections, which the present subject furnishes me with in
 such abundance.
 
 I am first affrighted and confounded with that forelorn solitude,
 in which I am placed in my philosophy, and fancy myself some strange
 uncouth monster, who not being able to mingle and unite in society,
 has been expelled all human commerce, and left utterly abandoned and
 disconsolate. Fain would I run into the crowd for shelter and warmth;
 but cannot prevail with myself to mix with such deformity. I call upon
 others to join me, in order to make a company apart; but no one will
 hearken to me. Every one keeps at a distance, and dreads that storm,
 which beats upon me from every side. I have exposed myself to the enmity
 of all metaphysicians, logicians, mathematicians, and even theologians;
 and can I wonder at the insults I must suffer? I have declared my
 disapprobation of their systems; and can I be surprized, if they should
 express a hatred of mine and of my person? When I look abroad, I foresee
 on every side, dispute, contradiction, anger, calumny and detraction.
 When I turn my eye inward, I find nothing but doubt and ignorance.
 All the world conspires to oppose and contradict me; though such is my
 weakness, that I feel all my opinions loosen and fall of themselves,
 when unsupported by the approbation of others. Every step I take is
 with hesitation, and every new reflection makes me dread an error and
 absurdity in my reasoning.
 
 For with what confidence can I venture upon such bold enterprises, when
 beside those numberless infirmities peculiar to myself, I find so many
 which are common to human nature? Can I be sure, that in leaving all
 established opinions I am following truth; and by what criterion shall
 I distinguish her, even if fortune should at last guide me on her
 foot-steps? After the most accurate and exact of my reasonings, I can
 give no reason why I should assent to it; and feel nothing but a strong
 propensity to consider objects strongly in that view, under which they
 appear to me. Experience is a principle, which instructs me in
 the several conjunctions of objects for the past. Habit is another
 principle, which determines me to expect the same for the future; and
 both of them conspiring to operate upon the imagination, make me form
 certain ideas in a more intense and lively manner, than others, which
 are not attended with the same advantages. Without this quality, by
 which the mind enlivens some ideas beyond others (which seemingly is so
 trivial, and so little founded on reason) we coued never assent to any
 argument, nor carry our view beyond those few objects, which are present
 to our senses. Nay, even to these objects we coued never attribute any
 existence, but what was dependent on the senses; and must comprehend
 them entirely in that succession of perceptions, which constitutes our
 self or person. Nay farther, even with relation to that succession, we
 coued only admit of those perceptions, which are immediately present to
 our consciousness, nor coued those lively images, with which the memory
 presents us, be ever received as true pictures of past perceptions. The
 memory, senses, and understanding are, therefore, all of them founded on
 the imagination, or the vivacity of our ideas.
 
 No wonder a principle so inconstant and fallacious should lead us into
 errors, when implicitly followed (as it must be) in all its variations.
 It is this principle, which makes us reason from causes and effects; and
 it is the same principle, which convinces us of the continued existence
 of external objects, when absent from the senses. But though these two
 operations be equally natural and necessary in the human mind, yet in
 some circumstances they are [Sect. 4.] directly contrary, nor is it
 possible for us to reason justly and regularly from causes and effects,
 and at the same time believe the continued existence of matter. How
 then shall we adjust those principles together? Which of them shall we
 prefer? Or in case we prefer neither of them, but successively assent
 to both, as is usual among philosophers, with what confidence can we
 afterwards usurp that glorious title, when we thus knowingly embrace a
 manifest contradiction?
 
 This contradiction [Part III. Sect. 14.] would be more excusable, were
 it compensated by any degree of solidity and satisfaction in the other
 parts of our reasoning. But the case is quite contrary. When we trace up
 the human understanding to its first principles, we find it to lead us
 into such sentiments, as seem to turn into ridicule all our past pains
 and industry, and to discourage us from future enquiries. Nothing is
 more curiously enquired after by the mind of man, than the causes of
 every phenomenon; nor are we content with knowing the immediate causes,
 but push on our enquiries, till we arrive at the original and ultimate
 principle. We would not willingly stop before we are acquainted with
 that energy in the cause, by which it operates on its effect; that tie,
 which connects them together; and that efficacious quality, on which the
 tie depends. This is our aim in all our studies and reflections: And
 how must we be disappointed, when we learn, that this connexion, tie, or
 energy lies merely in ourselves, and is nothing but that determination
 of the mind, which is acquired by custom, and causes us to make
 a transition from an object to its usual attendant, and from the
 impression of one to the lively idea of the other? Such a discovery not
 only cuts off all hope of ever attaining satisfaction, but even prevents
 our very wishes; since it appears, that when we say we desire to know
 the ultimate and operating principle, as something, which resides in
 the external object, we either contradict ourselves, or talk without a
 meaning.
 
 This deficiency in our ideas is not, indeed, perceived in common life,
 nor are we sensible, that in the most usual conjunctions of cause and
 effect we are as ignorant of the ultimate principle, which binds them
 together, as in the most unusual and extraordinary. But this proceeds
 merely from an illusion of the imagination; and the question is, how far
 we ought to yield to these illusions. This question is very difficult,
 and reduces us to a very dangerous dilemma, whichever way we answer it.
 For if we assent to every trivial suggestion of the fancy; beside that
 these suggestions are often contrary to each other; they lead us into
 such errors, absurdities, and obscurities, that we must at last become
 ashamed of our credulity. Nothing is more dangerous to reason than the
 flights of the imagination, and nothing has been the occasion of more
 mistakes among philosophers. Men of bright fancies may in this respect
 be compared to those angels, whom the scripture represents as covering
 their eyes with their wings. This has already appeared in so many
 instances, that we may spare ourselves the trouble of enlarging upon it
 any farther.
 
 But on the other hand, if the consideration of these instances makes us
 take a resolution to reject all the trivial suggestions of the fancy,
 and adhere to the understanding, that is, to the general and more
 established properties of the imagination; even this resolution, if
 steadily executed, would be dangerous, and attended with the most
 fatal consequences. For I have already shewn [Sect. 1.], that the
 understanding, when it acts alone, and according to its most general
 principles, entirely subverts itself, and leaves not the lowest degree
 of evidence in any proposition, either in philosophy or common life. We
 save ourselves from this total scepticism only by means of that singular
 and seemingly trivial property of the fancy, by which we enter with
 difficulty into remote views of things, and are not able to accompany
 them with so sensible an impression, as we do those, which are more easy
 and natural. Shall we, then, establish it for a general maxim, that no
 refined or elaborate reasoning is ever to be received? Consider well the
 consequences of such a principle. By this means you cut off entirely
 all science and philosophy: You proceed upon one singular quality of the
 imagination, and by a parity of reason must embrace all of them: And
 you expressly contradict yourself; since this maxim must be built on the
 preceding reasoning, which will be allowed to be sufficiently refined
 and metaphysical. What party, then, shall we choose among these
 difficulties? If we embrace this principle, and condemn all refined
 reasoning, we run into the most manifest absurdities. If we reject it
 in favour of these reasonings, we subvert entirely the human
 understanding. We have, therefore, no choice left but betwixt a false
 reason and none at all. For my part, know not what ought to be done in
 the present case. I can only observe what is commonly done; which is,
 that this difficulty is seldom or never thought of; and even where it
 has once been present to the mind, is quickly forgot, and leaves but a
 small impression behind it. Very refined reflections have little or
 no influence upon us; and yet we do not, and cannot establish it for
 a rule, that they ought not to have any influence; which implies a
 manifest contradiction.
 
 But what have I here said, that reflections very refined and
 metaphysical have little or no influence upon us? This opinion I can
 scarce forbear retracting, and condemning from my present feeling
 and experience. The intense view of these manifold contradictions and
 imperfections in human reason has so wrought upon me, and heated my
 brain, that I am ready to reject all belief and reasoning, and can look
 upon no opinion even as more probable or likely than another. Where
 am I, or what? From what causes do I derive my existence, and to what
 condition shall I return? Whose favour shall I court, and whose
 anger must I dread? What beings surround me? and on whom have, I any
 influence, or who have any influence on me? I am confounded with all
 these questions, and begin to fancy myself in the most deplorable
 condition imaginable, invironed with the deepest darkness, and utterly
 deprived of the use of every member and faculty.
 
 Most fortunately it happens, that since reason is incapable of
 dispelling these clouds, nature herself suffices to that purpose,
 and cures me of this philosophical melancholy and delirium, either by
 relaxing this bent of mind, or by some avocation, and lively impression
 of my senses, which obliterate all these chimeras. I dine, I play a game
 of backgammon, I converse, and am merry with my friends; and when after
 three or four hours' amusement, I would return to these speculations,
 they appear so cold, and strained, and ridiculous, that I cannot find in
 my heart to enter into them any farther.
 
 Here then I find myself absolutely and necessarily determined to live,
 and talk, and act like other people in the common affairs of life. But
 notwithstanding that my natural propensity, and the course of my animal
 spirits and passions reduce me to this indolent belief in the general
 maxims of the world, I still feel such remains of my former disposition,
 that I am ready to throw all my books and papers into the fire, and
 resolve never more to renounce the pleasures of life for the sake of
 reasoning and philosophy. For those are my sentiments in that splenetic
 humour, which governs me at present. I may, nay I must yield to the
 current of nature, in submitting to my senses and understanding; and in
 this blind submission I shew most perfectly my sceptical disposition and
 principles. But does it follow, that I must strive against the current
 of nature, which leads me to indolence and pleasure; that I must seclude
 myself, in some measure, from the commerce and society of men, which
 is so agreeable; and that I must torture my brains with subtilities and
 sophistries, at the very time that I cannot satisfy myself concerning
 the reasonableness of so painful an application, nor have any tolerable
 prospect of arriving by its means at truth and certainty. Under what
 obligation do I lie of making such an abuse of time? And to what end
 can it serve either for the service of mankind, or for my own private
 interest? No: If I must be a fool, as all those who reason or believe
 any thing certainly are, my follies shall at least be natural and
 agreeable. Where I strive against my inclination, I shall have a good
 reason for my resistance; and will no more be led a wandering into such
 dreary solitudes, and rough passages, as I have hitherto met with.
 
 These are the sentiments of my spleen and indolence; and indeed I must
 confess, that philosophy has nothing to oppose to them, and expects a
 victory more from the returns of a serious good-humoured disposition,
 than from the force of reason and conviction. In all the incidents of
 life we ought still to preserve our scepticism. If we believe, that fire
 warms, or water refreshes, it is only because it costs us too much pains
 to think otherwise. Nay if we are philosophers, it ought only to be
 upon sceptical principles, and from an inclination, which we feel to the
 employing ourselves after that manner. Where reason is lively, and mixes
 itself with some propensity, it ought to be assented to. Where it does
 not, it never can have any title to operate upon us.
 
 At the time, therefore, that I am tired with amusement and company,
 and have indulged a reverie in my chamber, or in a solitary walk by a
 river-side, I feel my mind all collected within itself, and am naturally
 inclined to carry my view into all those subjects, about which I have
 met with so many disputes in the course of my reading and conversation.
 I cannot forbear having a curiosity to be acquainted with the principles
 of moral good and evil, the nature and foundation of government, and
 the cause of those several passions and inclinations, which actuate and
 govern me. I am uneasy to think I approve of one object, and disapprove
 of another; call one thing beautiful, and another deformed; decide
 concerning truth and falshood, reason and folly, without knowing upon
 what principles I proceed. I am concerned for the condition of the
 learned world, which lies under such t deplorable ignorance in all these
 particulars. I feel an ambition to arise in me of contributing to the
 instruction of mankind, and of acquiring a name by my inventions
 and discoveries. These sentiments spring up naturally in my present
 disposition; and should I endeavour to banish them, by attaching myself
 to any other business or diversion, I feel I should be a loser in point
 of pleasure; and this is the origin of my philosophy.
 
 But even suppose this curiosity and ambition should not transport
 me into speculations without the sphere of common life, it would
 necessarily happen, that from my very weakness I must be led into such
 enquiries. It is certain, that superstition is much more bold in its
 systems and hypotheses than philosophy; and while the latter contents
 itself with assigning new causes and principles to the phaenomena, which
 appear in the visible world, the former opens a world of its own, and
 presents us with scenes, and beings, and objects, which are altogether
 new. Since therefore it is almost impossible for the mind of man to
 rest, like those of beasts, in that narrow circle of objects, which
 are the subject of daily conversation and action, we ought only to
 deliberate concerning the choice of our guide, and ought to prefer that
 which is safest and most agreeable. And in this respect I make bold to
 recommend philosophy, and shall not scruple to give it the preference to
 superstition of every kind or denomination. For as superstition arises
 naturally and easily from the popular opinions of mankind, it seizes
 more strongly on the mind, and is often able to disturb us in the
 conduct of our lives and actions. Philosophy on the contrary, if just,
 can present us only with mild and moderate sentiments; and if false and
 extravagant, its opinions are merely the objects of a cold and general
 speculation, and seldom go so far as to interrupt the course of our
 natural propensities. The CYNICS are an extraordinary instance of
 philosophers, who from reasonings purely philosophical ran into as great
 extravagancies of conduct as any Monk or Dervise that ever was in the
 world. Generally speaking, the errors in religion are dangerous; those
 in philosophy only ridiculous.
 
 I am sensible, that these two cases of the strength and weakness of the
 mind will not comprehend all mankind, and that there are in England, in
 particular, many honest gentlemen, who being always employed in their
 domestic affairs, or amusing themselves in common recreations, have
 carried their thoughts very little beyond those objects, which are every
 day exposed to their senses. And indeed, of such as these I pretend not
 to make philosophers, nor do I expect them either to be associates in
 these researches or auditors of these discoveries. They do well to keep
 themselves in their present situation; and instead of refining them into
 philosophers, I wish we coued communicate to our founders of systems,
 a share of this gross earthy mixture, as an ingredient, which they
 commonly stand much in need of, and which would serve to temper those
 fiery particles, of which they are composed. While a warm imagination
 is allowed to enter into philosophy, and hypotheses embraced merely for
 being specious and agreeable, we can never have any steady principles,
 nor any sentiments, which will suit with common practice and experience.
 But were these hypotheses once removed, we might hope to establish a
 system or set of opinions, which if not true (for that, perhaps, is too
 much to be hoped for) might at least be satisfactory to the human mind,
 and might stand the test of the most critical examination. Nor should we
 despair of attaining this end, because of the many chimerical systems,
 which have successively arisen and decayed away among men, would we
 consider the shortness of that period, wherein these questions have been
 the subjects of enquiry and reasoning. Two thousand years with such long
 interruptions, and under such mighty discouragements are a small space
 of time to give any tolerable perfection to the sciences; and perhaps we
 are still in too early an age of the world to discover any principles,
 which will bear the examination of the latest posterity. For my part,
 my only hope is, that I may contribute a little to the advancement
 of knowledge, by giving in some particulars a different turn to the
 speculations of philosophers, and pointing out to them more distinctly
 those subjects, where alone they can expect assurance and conviction.
 Human Nature is the only science of man; and yet has been hitherto the
 most neglected. It will be sufficient for me, if I can bring it a little
 more into fashion; and the hope of this serves to compose my temper
 from that spleen, and invigorate it from that indolence, which
 sometimes prevail upon me. If the reader finds himself in the same easy
 disposition, let him follow me in my future speculations. If not, let
 him follow his inclination, and wait the returns of application and good
 humour. The conduct of a man, who studies philosophy in this careless
 manner, is more truly sceptical than that of one, who feeling in himself
 an inclination to it, is yet so overwhelmed with doubts and scruples,
 as totally to reject it. A true sceptic will be diffident of his
 philosophical doubts, as well as of his philosophical conviction; and
 will never refuse any innocent satisfaction, which offers itself, upon
 account of either of them.
 
 Nor is it only proper we should in general indulge our inclination
 in the most elaborate philosophical researches, notwithstanding our
 sceptical principles, but also that we should yield to that propensity,
 which inclines us to be positive and certain in particular points,
 according to the light, in which we survey them in any particular
 instant. It is easier to forbear all examination and enquiry, than
 to check ourselves in so natural a propensity, and guard against that
 assurance, which always arises from an exact and full survey of
 an object. On such an occasion we are apt not only to forget our
 scepticism, but even our modesty too; and make use of such terms as
 these, it is evident, it is certain, it is undeniable; which a due
 deference to the public ought, perhaps, to prevent. I may have fallen
 into this fault after the example of others; but I here enter a caveat
 against any Objections, which may be offered on that head; and declare
 that such expressions were extorted from me by the present view of the
 object, and imply no dogmatical spirit, nor conceited idea of my own
 judgment, which are sentiments that I am sensible can become no body,
 and a sceptic still less than any other.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 BOOK II OF THE PASSIONS
 
 
 
 
 
 PART I OF PRIDE AND HUMILITY
 
 
 
 
 SECT. I DIVISION OF THE SUBJECT
 
 
 As all the perceptions of the mind may be divided into impressions and
 ideas, so the impressions admit of another division into original and
 secondary. This division of the impressions is the same with that which
 I formerly made use of [Book I. Part I. Sect. 2.] when I distinguished
 them into impressions of sensation and reflection. Original impressions
 or impressions of sensation are such as without any antecedent
 perception arise in the soul, from the constitution of the body, from
 the animal spirits, or from the application of objects to the external
 organs. Secondary, or reflective impressions are such as proceed from
 some of these original ones, either immediately or by the interposition
 of its idea. Of the first kind are all the impressions of the senses,
 and all bodily pains and pleasures: Of the second are the passions, and
 other emotions resembling them.
 
 It is certain, that the mind, in its perceptions, must begin somewhere;
 and that since the impressions precede their correspondent ideas, there
 must be some impressions, which without any introduction make their
 appearance in the soul. As these depend upon natural and physical
 causes, the examination of them would lead me too far from my present
 subject, into the sciences of anatomy and natural philosophy. For this
 reason I shall here confine myself to those other impressions, which
 I have called secondary and reflective, as arising either from the
 original impressions, or from their ideas. Bodily pains and pleasures
 are the source of many passions, both when felt and considered by the
 mind; but arise originally in the soul, or in the body, whichever you
 please to call it, without any preceding thought or perception. A fit of
 the gout produces a long train of passions, as grief, hope, fear; but
 is not derived immediately from any affection or idea. The reflective
 impressions may be divided into two kinds, viz. the calm and the
 VIOLENT. Of the first kind is the sense of beauty and deformity in
 action, composition, and external objects. Of the second are the
 passions of love and hatred, grief and joy, pride and humility. This
 division is far from being exact. The raptures of poetry and music
 frequently rise to the greatest height; while those other impressions,
 properly called PASSIONS, may decay into so soft an emotion, as to
 become, in a manner, imperceptible. But as in general the passions are
 more violent than the emotions arising from beauty and deformity,
 these impressions have been commonly distinguished from each other. The
 subject of the human mind being so copious and various, I shall here
 take advantage of this vulgar and spacious division, that I may
 proceed with the greater order; and having said ali I thought necessary
 concerning our ideas, shall now explain those violent emotions or
 passions, their nature, origin, causes, and effects.
 
 When we take a survey of the passions, there occurs a division of them
 into DIRECT and INDIRECT. By direct passions I understand such as arise
 immediately from good or evil, from pain or pleasure. By indirect such
 as proceed from the same principles, but by the conjunction of other
 qualities. This distinction I cannot at present justify or explain any
 farther. I can only observe in general, that under the indirect passions
 I comprehend pride, humility, ambition, vanity, love, hatred, envy,
 pity, malice, generosity, with their dependants. And under the direct
 passions, desire, aversion, grief, joy, hope, fear, despair and
 security. I shall begin with the former.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. II OF PRIDE AND HUMILITY, THEIR OBJECTS AND CAUSES
 
 
 The passions of PRIDE and HUMILITY being simple and uniform impressions,
 it is impossible we can ever, by a multitude of words, give a just
 definition of them, or indeed of any of the passions. The utmost we
 can pretend to is a description of them, by an enumeration of such
 circumstances, as attend them: But as these words, PRIDE and humility,
 are of general use, and the impressions they represent the most common
 of any, every one, of himself, will be able to form a just idea of them,
 without any danger of mistake. For which reason, not to lose time upon
 preliminaries, I shall immediately enter upon the examination of these
 passions.
 
 It is evident, that pride and humility, though directly contrary, have
 yet the same OBJECT. This object is self, or that succession of
 related ideas and impressions, of which we have an intimate memory and
 consciousness. Here the view always fixes when we are actuated by either
 of these passions. According as our idea of ourself is more or less
 advantageous, we feel either of those opposite affections, and are
 elated by pride, or dejected with humility. Whatever other objects may
 be comprehended by the mind, they are always considered with a view to
 ourselves; otherwise they would never be able either to excite these
 passions, or produce the smallest encrease or diminution of them. When
 self enters not into the consideration, there is no room either for
 pride or humility.
 
 But though that connected succession of perceptions, which we call SELF,
 be always the object of these two passions, it is impossible it can
 be their CAUSE, or be sufficient alone to excite them. For as these
 passions are directly contrary, and have the same object in common; were
 their object also their cause; it coued never produce any degree of the
 one passion, but at the same time it must excite an equal degree of
 the other; which opposition and contrariety must destroy both. It is
 impossible a man can at the same time be both proud and humble; and
 where he has different reasons for these passions, as frequently
 happens, the passions either take place alternately; or if they
 encounter, the one annihilates the other, as far as its strength goes,
 and the remainder only of that, which is superior, continues to operate
 upon the mind. But in the present case neither of the passions coued
 ever become superior; because supposing it to be the view only of
 ourself, which excited them, that being perfectly indifferent to either,
 must produce both in the very same proportion; or in other words, can
 produce neither. To excite any passion, and at the same time raise an
 equal share of its antagonist, is immediately to undo what was done, and
 must leave the mind at last perfectly calm and indifferent.
 
 We must therefore, make a distinction betwixt the cause and the object
 of these passions; betwixt that idea, which excites them, and that to
 which they direct their view, when excited. Pride and humility, being
 once raised, immediately turn our attention to ourself, and regard
 that as their ultimate and final object; but there is something farther
 requisite in order to raise them: Something, which is peculiar to one of
 the passions, and produces not both in the very same degree. The first
 idea, that is presented to the mind, is that of the cause or productive
 principle. This excites the passion, connected with it; and that
 passion, when excited, turns our view to another idea, which is that of
 self. Here then is a passion placed betwixt two ideas, of which the one
 produces it, and the other is produced by it. The first idea, therefore,
 represents the cause, the second the object of the passion.
 
 To begin with the causes of pride and humility; we may observe, that
 their most obvious and remarkable property is the vast variety of
 subjects, on which they may be placed. Every valuable quality of the
 mind, whether of the imagination, judgment, memory or disposition; wit,
 good-sense, learning, courage, justice, integrity; all these are the
 cause of pride; and their opposites of humility. Nor are these passions
 confined to the mind but extend their view to the body likewise. A man
 may be proud of his beauty, strength, agility, good mein, address
 in dancing, riding, and of his dexterity in any manual business
 or manufacture. But this is not all. The passions looking farther,
 comprehend whatever objects are in the least allyed or related to us.
 Our country, family, children, relations, riches, houses, gardens,
 horses, dogs, cloaths; any of these may become a cause either of pride
 or of humility.
 
 From the consideration of these causes, it appears necessary we shoud
 make a new distinction in the causes of the passion, betwixt that
 QUALITY, which operates, and the subject, on which it is placed. A man,
 for instance, is vain of a beautiful house, which belongs to him, or
 which he has himself built and contrived. Here the object of the passion
 is himself, and the cause is the beautiful house: Which cause again is
 sub-divided into two parts, viz. the quality, which operates upon the
 passion, and the subject in which the quality inheres. The quality is
 the beauty, and the subject is the house, considered as his property or
 contrivance. Both these parts are essential, nor is the distinction vain
 and chimerical. Beauty, considered merely as such, unless placed upon
 something related to us, never produces any pride or vanity; and the
 strongest relation alone, without beauty, or something else in its
 place, has as little influence on that passion. Since, therefore, these
 two particulars are easily separated and there is a necessity for their
 conjunction, in order to produce the passion, we ought to consider them
 as component parts of the cause; and infix in our minds an exact idea of
 this distinction.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. III WHENCE THESE OBJECTS AND CAUSES ARE DERIVED
 
 
 Being so far advanced as to observe a difference betwixt the object
 of the passions and their cause, and to distinguish in the cause the
 quality, which operates on the passions, from the subject, in which it
 inheres; we now proceed to examine what determines each of them to
 be what it is, and assigns such a particular object, and quality, and
 subject to these affections. By this means we shall fully understand the
 origin of pride and humility.
 
 It is evident in the first place, that these passions are derermined
 to have self for their object, not only by a natural but also by an
 original property. No one can doubt but this property is natural from
 the constancy and steadiness of its operations. It is always self, which
 is the object of pride and humility; and whenever the passions look
 beyond, it is still with a view to ourselves, nor can any person or
 object otherwise have any influence upon us.
 
 That this proceeds from an original quality or primary impulse, will
 likewise appear evident, if we consider that it is the distinguishing
 characteristic of these passions Unless nature had given some original
 qualities to the mind, it coued never have any secondary ones; because
 in that case it would have no foundation for action, nor coued ever
 begin to exert itself. Now these qualities, which we must consider as
 original, are such as are most inseparable from the soul, and can be
 resolved into no other: And such is the quality, which determines
 the object of pride and humility. We may, perhaps, make it a greater
 question, whether the causes, that produce the passion, be as natural as
 the object, to which it is directed, and whether all that vast variety
 proceeds from caprice or from the constitution of the mind. This doubt
 we shall soon remove, if we cast our eye upon human nature, and consider
 that in all nations and ages, the same objects still give rise to pride
 and humility; and that upon the view even of a stranger, we can know
 pretty nearly, what will either encrease or diminish his passions of
 this kind. If there be any variation in this particular, it proceeds
 from nothing but a difference in the tempers and complexions of men; and
 is besides very inconsiderable. Can we imagine it possible, that while
 human nature remains the same, men will ever become entirely indifferent
 to their power, riches, beauty or personal merit, and that their pride
 and vanity will not be affected by these advantages?
 
 But though the causes of pride and humility be plainly natural, we
 shall find upon examination, that they are not original, and that it is
 utterly impossible they should each of them be adapted to these passions
 by a particular provision, and primary constitution of nature, Beside
 their prodigious number, many of them are the effects of art, and arise
 partly from the industry, partly from the caprice, and partly from
 the good fortune of men, Industry produces houses, furniture, cloaths.
 Caprice determines their particular kinds and qualities. And good
 fortune frequently contributes to all this, by discovering the effects
 that result from the different mixtures and combinations of bodies. It
 is absurd, therefore, to imagine, that each of these was foreseen and
 provided for by nature, and that every new production of art, which
 causes pride or humility; instead of adapting itself to the passion by
 partaking of some general quality, that naturally operates on the mind;
 is itself the object of an original principle, which till then lay
 concealed in the soul, and is only by accident at last brought to light.
 Thus the first mechanic, that invented a fine scritoire, produced pride
 in him, who became possest of it, by principles different from those,
 which made him proud of handsome chairs and tables. As this appears
 evidently ridiculous, we must conclude, that each cause of pride and
 humility is not adapted to the passions by a distinct original quality;
 but that there are some one or more circumstances common to all of them,
 on which their efficacy depends.
 
 Besides, we find in the course of nature, that though the effects be
 many, the principles, from which they arise, are commonly but few and
 simple, and that it is the sign of an unskilful naturalist to have
 recourse to a different quality, in order to explain every different
 operation. How much more must this be true with regard to the human
 mind, which being so confined a subject may justly be thought incapable
 of containing such a monstrous heap of principles, as would be necessary
 to excite the passions of pride and humility, were each distinct cause
 adapted to the passion by a distinct set of principles?
 
 Here, therefore, moral philosophy is in the same condition as natural,
 with regard to astronomy before the time of COPERNICUS. The antients,
 though sensible of that maxim, THAT NATURE DOES NOTHING IN VAIN,
 contrived such intricate systems of the heavens, as seemed inconsistent
 with true philosophy, and gave place at last to something more simple
 and natural. To invent without scruple a new principle to every
 new phaenomenon, instead of adapting it to the old; to overload our
 hypotheses with a variety of this kind; are certain proofs, that none of
 these principles is the just one, and that we only desire, by a number
 of falsehoods, to cover our ignorance of the truth.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. IV OF THE RELATIONS OF IMPRESSIONS AND IDEAS
 
 
 Thus we have established two truths without any obstacle or difficulty,
 that IT IS FROM NATURAL PRINCIPLES THIS VARIETY OF CAUSES EXCITES PRIDE
 AND HUMILITY, and that IT IS NOT BY A DIFFERENT PRINCIPLE EACH DIFFERENT
 CAUSE IS ADAPTED TO ITS PASSION. We shall now proceed to enquire how
 we may reduce these principles to a lesser number, and find among the
 causes something common, on which their influence depends.
 
 In order to this we must reflect on certain properties of human nature,
 which though they have a mighty influence on every operation both of
 the understanding and passions, are not commonly much insisted on by
 philosophers. The first of these is the association of ideas, which I
 have so often observed and explained. It is impossible for the mind to
 fix itself steadily upon one idea for any considerable time; nor can
 it by its utmost efforts ever arrive at such a constancy. But however
 changeable our thoughts may be, they are not entirely without rule and
 method in their changes. The rule, by which they proceed, is to pass
 from one object to what is resembling, contiguous to, or produced by it.
 When one idea is present to the imagination, any other, united by these
 relations, naturally follows it, and enters with more facility by means
 of that introduction.
 
 The second property I shall observe in the human mind is a like
 association of impressions. All resembling impressions are connected
 together, and no sooner one arises than the rest immediately follow.
 Grief and disappointment give rise to anger, anger to envy, envy to
 malice, and malice to grief again, till the whole circle be compleated.
 In like manner our temper, when elevated with joy, naturally throws
 itself into love, generosity, pity, courage, pride, and the other
 resembling affections. It is difficult for the mind, when actuated by
 any passion, to confine itself to that passion alone, without any
 change or variation. Human nature is too inconstant to admit of any such
 regularity. Changeableness is essential to it. And to what can it so
 naturally change as to affections or emotions, which are suitable to the
 temper, and agree with that set of passions, which then prevail? It is
 evident, then, there is an attraction or association among impressions,
 as well as among ideas; though with this remarkable difference, that
 ideas are associated by resemblance, contiguity, and causation; and
 impressions only by resemblance.
 
 In the THIRD place, it is observable of these two kinds of association,
 that they very much assist and forward each other, and that the
 transition is more easily made where they both concur in the same
 object. Thus a man, who, by any injury from another, is very much
 discomposed and ruffled in his temper, is apt to find a hundred subjects
 of discontent, impatience, fear, and other uneasy passions; especially
 if he can discover these subjects in or near the person, who was
 the cause of his first passion. Those principles, which forward the
 transition of ideas, here concur with those, which operate on the
 passions; and both uniting in one action, bestow on the mind a double
 impulse. The new passion, therefore, must arise with so much greater
 violence, and the transition to it must be rendered so much more easy
 and natural.
 
 Upon this occasion I may cite the authority of an elegant writer, who
 expresses himself in the following manner.
 
 "As the fancy delights in every thing that is great, strange, or
 beautiful, and is still more pleased the more it finds of these
 perfections in the same object, so it is capable of receiving a new
 satisfaction by the assistance of another sense. Thus any continued
 sound, as the music of birds, or a fall of waters, awakens every moment
 the mind of the beholder, and makes him more attentive to the several
 beauties of the place, that lie before him. Thus if there arises a
 fragrancy of smells or perfumes, they heighten the pleasure of the
 imagination, and make even the colours and verdure of the landschape
 appear more agreeable; for the ideas of both senses recommend each
 other, and are pleasanter together than when they enter the mind
 separately: As the different colours of a picture, when they are well
 disposed, set off one another, and receive an additional beauty from the
 advantage of the situation." [Addison, SPECTATOR 412, final paragraph.]
 
 In this phaenomenon we may remark the association both of impressions
 and ideas, as well as the mutual assistance they lend each other.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. V OF THE INFLUENCE OF THESE RELATIONS ON PRIDE AND HUMILITY
 
 
 These principles being established on unquestionable experience, I begin
 to consider how we shall apply them, by revolving over all the causes of
 pride and humility, whether these causes be regarded, as the qualities,
 that operate, or as the subjects, on which the qualities are placed. In
 examining these qualities I immediately find many of them to concur
 in producing the sensation of pain and pleasure, independent of those
 affections, which I here endeavour to explain. Thus the beauty of our
 person, of itself, and by its very appearance, gives pleasure, as well
 as pride; and its deformity, pain as well as humility. A magnificent
 feast delights us, and a sordid one displeases. What I discover to
 be true in some instances, I suppose to be so in all; and take it for
 granted at present, without any farther proof, that every cause of
 pride, by its peculiar qualities, produces a separate pleasure, and of
 humility a separate uneasiness.
 
 Again, in considering the subjects, to which these qualities adhere, I
 make a new supposition, which also appears probable from many obvious
 instances, viz, that these subjects are either parts of ourselves, or
 something nearly related to us. Thus the good and bad qualities of
 our actions and manners constitute virtue and vice, and determine our
 personal character, than which nothing operates more strongly on these
 passions. In like manner, it is the beauty or deformity of our person,
 houses, equipage, or furniture, by which we are rendered either vain or
 humble. The same qualities, when transfered to subjects, which bear
 us no relation, influence not in the smallest degree either of these
 affections.
 
 Having thus in a manner supposed two properties of the causes of these
 affections, viz, that the qualities produce a separate pain or pleasure,
 and that the subjects, on which the qualities are placed, are related
 to self; I proceed to examine the passions themselves, in order to find
 something in them, correspondent to the supposed properties of their
 causes. First, I find, that the peculiar object of pride and humility
 is determined by an original and natural instinct, and that it is
 absolutely impossible, from the primary constitution of the mind, that
 these passions should ever look beyond self, or that individual person.
 of whose actions and sentiments each of us is intimately conscious. Here
 at last the view always rests, when we are actuated by either of these
 passions; nor can we, in that situation of mind, ever lose sight of this
 object. For this I pretend not to give any reason; but consider such a
 peculiar direction of the thought as an original quality.
 
 The SECOND quality, which I discover in these passions, and which I
 likewise consider an an original quality, is their sensations, or the
 peculiar emotions they excite in the soul, and which constitute their
 very being and essence. Thus pride is a pleasant sensation, and humility
 a painful; and upon the removal of the pleasure and pain, there is in
 reality no pride nor humility. Of this our very feeling convinces us;
 and beyond our feeling, it is here in vain to reason or dispute.
 
 If I compare, therefore, these two established properties of the
 passions, viz, their object, which is self, and their sensation, which
 is either pleasant or painful, to the two supposed properties of the
 causes, viz, their relation to self, and their tendency to produce a
 pain or pleasure, independent of the passion; I immediately find, that
 taking these suppositions to be just, the true system breaks in upon me
 with an irresistible evidence. That cause, which excites the passion, is
 related to the object, which nature has attributed to the passion;
 the sensation, which the cause separately produces, is related to
 the sensation of the passion: From this double relation of ideas and
 impressions, the passion is derived. The one idea is easily converted
 into its correlative; and the one impression into that, which resembles
 and corresponds to it: With how much greater facility must this
 transition be made, where these movements mutually assist each other,
 and the mind receives a double impulse from the relations both of its
 impressions and ideas?
 
 That we may comprehend this the better, we must suppose, that nature has
 given to the organs of the human mind, a certain disposition fitted to
 produce a peculiar impression or emotion, which we call pride: To this
 emotion she has assigned a certain idea, viz, that of self, which it
 never fails to produce. This contrivance of nature is easily conceived.
 We have many instances of such a situation of affairs. The nerves of the
 nose and palate are so disposed, as in certain circumstances to convey
 such peculiar sensations to the mind: The sensations of lust and hunger
 always produce in us the idea of those peculiar objects, which are
 suitable to each appetite. These two circumstances are united in pride.
 The organs are so disposed as to produce the passion; and the passion,
 after its production, naturally produces a certain idea. All this needs
 no proof. It is evident we never should be possest of that passion, were
 there not a disposition of mind proper for it; and it is as evident,
 that the passion always turns our view to ourselves, and makes us think
 of our own qualities and circumstances.
 
 This being fully comprehended, it may now be asked, WHETHER NATURE
 PRODUCES THE PASSION IMMEDIATELY, OF HERSELF; OR WHETHER SHE MUST BE
 ASSISTED BY THE CO-OPERATION OF OTHER CAUSES? For it is observable, that
 in this particular her conduct is different in the different passions
 and sensations. The palate must be excited by an external object, in
 order to produce any relish: But hunger arises internally, without the
 concurrence of any external object. But however the case may stand with
 other passions and impressions, it is certain, that pride requires the
 assistance of some foreign object, and that the organs, which produce
 it, exert not themselves like the heart and arteries, by an original
 internal movement. For first, daily experience convinces us, that pride
 requires certain causes to excite it, and languishes when unsupported by
 some excellency in the character, in bodily accomplishments, in cloaths,
 equipage or fortune. SECONDLY, it is evident pride would be perpetual,
 if it arose immediately from nature; since the object is always the
 same, and there is no disposition of body peculiar to pride, as there
 is to thirst and hunger. Thirdly, Humility is in the very same situation
 with pride; and therefore, either must, upon this supposition, be
 perpetual likewise, or must destroy the contrary passion from, the very
 first moment; so that none of them coued ever make its appearance. Upon
 the whole, we may rest satisfyed with the foregoing conclusion, that
 pride must have a cause, as well as an object, and that the one has no
 influence without the other.
 
 The difficulty, then, is only to discover this cause, and find what
 it is that gives the first motion to pride, and sets those organs in
 action, which are naturally fitted to produce that emotion. Upon
 my consulting experience, in order to resolve this difficulty, I
 immediately find a hundred different causes, that produce pride; and
 upon examining these causes, I suppose, what at first I perceive to be
 probable, that all of them concur in two circumstances; which are, that
 of themselves they produce an impression, allyed to the passion, and
 are placed on a subject, allyed to the object of the passion. When I
 consider after this the nature of relation, and its effects both on the
 passions and ideas, I can no longer doubt, upon these suppositions, that
 it is the very principle, which gives rise to pride, and bestows
 motion on those organs, which being naturally disposed to produce that
 affection, require only a first impulse or beginning to their action.
 Any thing, that gives a pleasant sensation, and is related to self,
 excites the passion of pride, which is also agreeable, and has self for
 its object.
 
 What I have said of pride is equally true of humility. The sensation of
 humility is uneasy, as that of pride is agreeable; for which reason the
 separate sensation, arising from the causes, must be reversed, while
 the relation to self continues the same. Though pride and humility are
 directly contrary in their effects, and in their sensations, they have
 notwithstanding the same object; so that it is requisite only to change
 the relation of impressions, without making any change upon that
 of ideas. Accordingly we find, that a beautiful house, belonging to
 ourselves, produces pride; and that the same house, still belonging to
 ourselves, produces humility, when by any accident its beauty is
 changed into deformity, and thereby the sensation of pleasure, which
 corresponded to pride, is transformed into pain, which is related to
 humility. The double relation between the ideas and impressions subsists
 in both cases, and produces an easy transition from the one emotion to
 the other.
 
 In a word, nature has bestowed a kind of attraction on certain
 impressions and ideas, by which one of them, upon its appearance,
 naturally introduces its correlative. If these two attractions or
 associations of impressions and ideas concur on the same object, they
 mutually assist each other, and the transition of the affections and
 of the imagination is made with the greatest ease and facility. When
 an idea produces an impression, related to an impression, which is
 connected with an idea, related to the first idea, these two impressions
 must be in a manner inseparable, nor will the one in any case be
 unattended with the other. It is after this manner, that the particular
 causes of pride and humility are determined. The quality, which operates
 on the passion, produces separately an impression resembling it; the
 subject, to which the quality adheres, is related to self, the object of
 the passion: No wonder the whole cause, consisting of a quality and of a
 subject, does so unavoidably give rise to the pass on.
 
 To illustrate this hypothesis we may compare it to that, by which I
 have already explained the belief attending the judgments, which we form
 from causation. I have observed, that in all judgments of this kind,
 there is always a present impression and a related idea; and that
 the present impression gives a vivacity to the fancy, and the relation
 conveys this vivacity, by an easy transition, to the related idea.
 Without the present impression, the attention is not fixed, nor the
 spirits excited. Without the relation, this attention rests on its
 first object, and has no farther consequence. There is evidently a great
 analogy betwixt that hypothesis and our present one of an impression
 and idea, that transfuse themselves into another impression and idea by
 means of their double relation: Which analogy must be allowed to be no
 despicable proof of both hypotheses.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VI LIMITATIONS OF THIS SYSTEM
 
 
 But before we proceed farther in this subject, and examine particularly
 all the causes of pride and humility, it will be proper to make some
 limitations to the general system, THAT ALL AGREEABLE OBJECTS, RELATED
 TO OURSELVES, BY AN ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS AND OF IMPRESSIONS, PRODUCE
 PRIDE, AND DISAGREEABLE ONES, HUMILITY: And these limitations are
 derived from the very nature of the subject.
 
 I. Suppose an agreeable object to acquire a relation to self, the
 first passion, that appears on this occasion, is joy; and this passion
 discovers itself upon a slighter relation than pride and vain-glory. We
 may feel joy upon being present at a feast, where our senses are regard
 with delicacies of every kind: But it is only the master of the feast,
 who, beside the same joy, has the additional passion of self-applause
 and vanity. It is true, men sometimes boast of a great entertainment,
 at which they have only been present; and by so small a relation convert
 their pleasure into pride: But however, this must in general be owned,
 that joy arises from a more inconsiderable relation than vanity, and
 that many things, which are too foreign to produce pride, are yet able
 to give us a delight and pleasure, The reason of the difference may be
 explained thus. A relation is requisite to joy, in order to approach
 the object to us, and make it give us any satisfaction. But beside this,
 which is common to both passions, it is requisite to pride, in order
 to produce a transition from one passion to another, and convert the
 falsification into vanity. As it has a double task to perform, it must
 be endowed with double force and energy. To which we may add, that where
 agreeable objects bear not a very close relation to ourselves, they
 commonly do to some other person; and this latter relation not only
 excels, but even diminishes, and sometimes destroys the former, as we
 shall see afterwards. [Part II. Sec. 4.]
 
 Here then is the first limitation, we must make to our general position,
 that every thing related to us, which produces pleasure or pain,
 produces likewise pride or humility. There is not only a relation
 required, but a close one, and a closer than is required to joy.
 
 II. The second limitation is, that the agreeable or disagreeable object
 be not only closely related, but also peculiar to ourselves, or at least
 common to us with a few persons. It is a quality observable in human
 nature, and which we shall endeavour to explain afterwards, that
 every thing, which is often presented and to which we have been
 long accustomed, loses its value in our eyes, and is in a little
 time despised and neglected. We likewise judge of objects more from
 comparison than from their real and intrinsic merit; and where we cannot
 by some contrast enhance their value, we are apt to overlook even what
 is essentially good in them. These qualities of the mind have an effect
 upon joy as well as pride; and it is remarkable, that goods which are
 common to all mankind, and have become familiar to us by custom, give us
 little satisfaction; though perhaps of a more excellent kind, than those
 on which, for their singularity, we set a much higher value. But though
 this circumstance operates on both these passions, it has a much greater
 influence on vanity. We are rejoiced for many goods, which, on account
 of their frequency, give us no pride. Health, when it returns after a
 long absence, affords us a very sensible satisfaction; but is seldom
 regarded as a subject of vanity, because it is shared with such vast
 numbers.
 
 The reason, why pride is so much more delicate in this particular than
 joy, I take to be, as follows. In order to excite pride, there are
 always two objects we must contemplate, viz. the cause or that object
 which produces pleasure; and self, which is the real object of the
 passion. But joy has only one object necessary to its production, viz.
 that which gives pleasure; and though it be requisite, that this bear
 some relation to self, yet that is only requisite in order to render it
 agreeable; nor is self, properly speaking, the object of this passion.
 Since, therefore, pride has in a manner two objects, to which it directs
 our view; it follows, that where neither of them have any singularity,
 the passion must be more weakened upon that account, than a passion,
 which has only one object. Upon comparing ourselves with others, as
 we are every moment apt to do, we find we are not in the least
 distinguished; and upon comparing the object we possess, we
 discover still the same unlucky circumstance. By two comparisons so
 disadvantageous the passion must be entirely destroyed.
 
 III The third limitation is, that the pleasant or painful object be very
 discernible and obvious, and that not only to ourselves, but to others
 also. This circumstance, like the two foregoing, has an effect upon
 joy, as well as pride. We fancy Ourselves more happy, as well as more
 virtuous or beautiful, when we appear so to others; but are still more
 ostentatious of our virtues than of our pleasures. This proceeds from
 causes, which I shall endeavour to explain afterwards.
 
 IV. The fourth limitation is derived from the inconstancy of the cause
 of these passions, and from the short duration of its connexion with
 ourselves. What is casual and inconstant gives but little joy, and less
 pride. We are not much satisfyed with the thing itself; and are still
 less apt to feel any new degrees of self-satisfaction upon its account.
 We foresee and anticipate its change by the imagination; which makes
 us little satisfyed with the thing: We compare it to ourselves, whose
 existence is more durable; by which means its inconstancy appears still
 greater. It seems ridiculous to infer an excellency in ourselves from an
 object, which is of so much shorter duration, and attends us during so
 small a part of our existence. It will be easy to comprehend the reason,
 why this cause operates not with the same force in joy as in pride;
 since the idea of self is not so essential to the former passion as to
 the latter.
 
 V. I may add as a fifth limitation, or rather enlargement of this
 system, that general rules have a great influence upon pride and
 humility, as well as on all the other passions. Hence we form a notion
 of different ranks of men, suitable to the power of riches they
 are possest of; and this notion we change not upon account of any
 peculiarities of the health or temper of the persons, which may deprive
 them of all enjoyment in their possessions. This may be accounted for
 from the same principles, that explained the influence of general rules
 on the understanding. Custom readily carries us beyond the just bounds
 in our passions, as well as in our reasonings.
 
 It may not be amiss to observe on this occasion, that the influence
 of general rules and maxims on the passions very much contributes to
 facilitate the effects of all the principles, which we shall explain
 in the progress of this treatise. For it is evident, that if a
 person full-grown, and of the same nature with ourselves, were on a
 sudden-transported into our world, he would be very much embarrased with
 every object, and would not readily find what degree of love or hatred,
 pride or humility, or any other passion he ought to attribute to it. The
 passions are often varyed by very inconsiderable principles; and these
 do not always play with a perfect regularity, especially on the first
 trial. But as custom and practice have brought to light all these
 principles, and have settled the just value of every thing; this must
 certainly contribute to the easy production of the passions, and guide
 us, by means of general established maxims, in the proportions we
 ought to observe in preferring one object to another. This remark may,
 perhaps, serve to obviate difficulties, that mayarise concerning some
 causes, which I shall hereafter ascribe to particular passions,
 and which may be esteemed too refined to operate so universally and
 certainly, as they are found to do.
 
 I shall close this subject with a reflection derived from these five
 limitations. This reflection is, that the persons, who are proudest, and
 who in the eye of the world have most reason for their pride, are not
 always the happiest; nor the most humble always the most miserable, as
 may at first sight be imagined from this system. An evil may be real.
 though its cause has no relation to us: It may be real, without being
 peculiar: It may be real, without shewing itself to others: It may be
 real, without being constant: And it may be real, without falling
 under the general rules. Such evils as these will not fail to render
 us miserable, though they have little tendency to diminish pride: And
 perhaps the most real and the most solid evils of life will be found of
 this nature.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VII OF VICE AND VIRTUE
 
 
 Taking these limitations along with us, let us proceed to examine the
 causes of pride and humility; and see, whether in every case we can
 discover the double relations, by which they operate on the passions.
 If we find that all these causes are related to self, and produce a
 pleasure or uneasiness separate from the passion, there will remain no
 farther scruple with regard to the present system. We shall principally
 endeavour to prove the latter point; the former being in a manner
 self-evident.
 
 To begin, with vice and virtue; which are the most obvious causes of
 these passions; it would be entirely foreign to my present purpose to
 enter upon the controversy, which of late years has so much excited the
 curiosity of the publick. WHETHER THESE MORAL DISTINCTIONS BE FOUNDED ON
 NATURAL AND ORIGINAL PRINCIPLES, OR ARISE FROM INTEREST AND EDUCATION.
 The examination of this I reserve for the following book; and in the
 mean time I shall endeavour to show, that my system maintains its ground
 upon either of these hypotheses; which will be a strong proof of its
 solidity.
 
 For granting that morality had no foundation in nature, it must still
 be allowed, that vice and virtue, either from self-interest or the
 prejudices of education, produce in us a real pain and pleasure; and
 this we may observe to be strenuously asserted by the defenders of that
 hypothesis. Every passion, habit, or turn of character (say they)
 which has a tendency to our advantage or prejudice, gives a delight
 or uneasiness; and it is from thence the approbation or disapprobation
 arises. We easily gain from the liberality of others, but are always
 in danger of losing by their avarice: Courage defends us, but cowardice
 lays us open to every attack: Justice is the support of society, but
 injustice, unless checked would quickly prove its ruin: Humility exalts;
 but pride mortifies us. For these reasons the former qualities are
 esteemed virtues, and the latter regarded as vices. Now since it is
 granted there is a delight or uneasiness still attending merit or
 demerit of every kind, this is all that is requisite for my purpose.
 
 But I go farther, and observe, that this moral hypothesis and my present
 system not only agree together, but also that, allowing the former to be
 just, it is an absolute and invincible proof of the latter. For if
 all morality be founded on the pain or pleasure, which arises from
 the prospect of any loss or advantage, that may result from our own
 characters, or from those of others, all the effects of morality must-be
 derived from the same pain or pleasure, and among the rest, the passions
 of pride and humility. The very essence of virtue, according to this
 hypothesis, is to produce pleasure and that of vice to give pain. The
 virtue and vice must be part of our character in order to excite pride
 or humility. What farther proof can we desire for the double relation of
 impressions and ideas?
 
 The same unquestionable argument may be derived from the opinion of
 those, who maintain that morality is something real, essential, and
 founded on nature. The most probable hypothesis, which has been advanced
 to explain the distinction betwixt vice and virtue, and the origin of
 moral rights and obligations, is, that from a primary constitution
 of nature certain characters and passions, by the very view and
 contemplation, produce a pain, and others in like manner excite a
 pleasure. The uneasiness and satisfaction are not only inseparable
 from vice and virtue, but constitute their very nature and essence.
 To approve of a character is to feel an original delight upon its
 appearance. To disapprove of it is to be sensible of an uneasiness.
 The pain and pleasure, therefore, being the primary causes of vice and
 virtue, must also be the causes of all their effects, and consequently
 of pride and humility, which are the unavoidable attendants of that
 distinction.
 
 But supposing this hypothesis of moral philosophy should be allowed to
 be false, it is still evident, that pain and pleasure, if not the causes
 of vice and virtue, are at least inseparable from them. A generous and
 noble character affords a satisfaction even in the survey; and when
 presented to us, though only in a poem or fable, never fails to charm
 and delight us. On the other hand cruelty and treachery displease from
 their very nature; nor is it possible ever to reconcile us to these
 qualities, either in ourselves or others. Thus one hypothesis of
 morality is an undeniable proof of the foregoing system, and the other
 at worst agrees with it. But pride and humility arise not from these
 qualities alone of the mind, which, according to the vulgar systems of
 ethicks, have been comprehended as parts of moral duty, but from
 any other that has a connexion with pleasure and uneasiness. Nothing
 flatters our vanity more than the talent of pleasing by our wit,
 good humour, or any other accomplishment; and nothing gives us a more
 sensible mortification than a disappointment in any attempt of that
 nature. No one has ever been able to tell what wit is, and to-shew why
 such a system of thought must be received under that denomination, and
 such another rejected. It is only by taste we can decide concerning
 it, nor are we possest of any other standard, upon which we can form a
 judgment of this kind. Now what is this taste, from which true and false
 wit in a manner receive their being, and without which no thought can
 have a title to either of these denominations? It is plainly nothing
 but a sensation of pleasure from true wit, and of uneasiness from
 false, without oar being able to tell the reasons of that pleasure
 or uneasiness. The power of bestowing these opposite sensations is.
 therefore, the very essence of true and false wit; and consequently the
 cause of that pride or humility, which arises from them.
 
 There may, perhaps, be some, who being accustomed to the style of the
 schools and pulpit, and having never considered human nature in any
 other light, than that in which they place it, may here be surprized
 to hear me talk of virtue as exciting pride, which they look upon as a
 vice; and of vice as producing humility, which they have been taught to
 consider as a virtue. But not to dispute about words, I observe, that by
 pride I understand that agreeable impression, which arises in the mind,
 when the view either of our virtue, beauty, riches or power makes us
 satisfyed with ourselves: and that by humility I mean the opposite
 impression. It is evident the former impression is not always vicious,
 nor the latter virtuous. The most rigid morality allows us to receive
 a pleasure from reflecting on a generous action; and it is by none
 esteemed a virtue to feel any fruitless remorses upon the thoughts
 of past villainy and baseness. Let us, therefore, examine these
 impressions, considered in themselves; and enquire into their causes,
 whether placed on the mind or body, without troubling ourselves at
 present with that merit or blame, which may attend them.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VIII OF BEAUTY AND DEFORMITY
 
 
 Whether we consider the body as a part of ourselves, or assent to those
 philosophers, who regard it as something external, it must still be
 allowed to be near enough connected with us to form one of these double
 relations, which I have asserted to be necessary to the causes of pride
 and humility. Wherever, therefore, we can find the other relation of
 impressions to join to this of ideas, we may expect with assurance
 either of these passions, according as the impression is pleasant
 or uneasy. But beauty of all kinds gives us a peculiar delight and
 satisfaction; as deformity produces pain, upon whatever subject it may
 be placed, and whether surveyed in an animate or inanimate object. If
 the beauty or deformity, therefore, be placed upon our own bodies, this
 pleasure or uneasiness must be converted into pride or humility, as
 having in this case all the circumstances requisite to produce a perfect
 transition of impressions and ideas. These opposite sensations are
 related to the opposite passions. The beauty or deformity is closely
 related to self, the object of both these passions. No wonder, then our
 own beauty becomes an object of pride, and deformity of humility.
 
 But this effect of personal and bodily qualities is not only a proof of.
 the present system, by shewing that the passions arise not in this case
 without all the circumstances I have required, but may be employed as
 a stronger and more convincing argument. If we consider all the
 hypotheses, which have been formed either by philosophy or common
 reason, to explain the difference betwixt beauty and deformity, we shall
 find that all of them resolve into this, that beauty is such an order
 and construction of parts, as either by the primary constitution of
 our nature, by custom, or by caprice, is fitted to give a pleasure
 and satisfaction to the soul. This is the distinguishing character of
 beauty, and forms all the difference betwixt it and deformity, whose
 natural tendency is to produce uneasiness. Pleasure and pain, therefore,
 are not only necessary attendants of beauty and deformity, but
 constitute their very essence. And indeed, if we consider, that a
 great part of the beauty, which we admire either in animals or in other
 objects, is derived from the idea of convenience and utility, we shall
 make no scruple to assent to this opinion. That shape, which produces
 strength, is beautiful in one animal; and that which is a sign of
 agility in another. The order and convenience of a palace are no less
 essential to its beauty, than its mere figure and appearance. In like
 manner the rules of architecture require, that the top of a pillar
 should be more slender than its base, and that because such a figure
 conveys to us the idea of security, which is pleasant; whereas the
 contrary form gives us the apprehension of danger, which is uneasy. From
 innumerable instances of this kind, as well as from considering that
 beauty like wit, cannot be defined, but is discerned only by a taste
 or sensation, we may conclude, that beauty is nothing but a form, which
 produces pleasure, as deformity is a structure of parts, which conveys
 pain; and since the power of producing pain and pleasure make in this
 manner the essence of beauty and deformity, all the effects of these
 qualities must be derived from the sensation; and among the rest
 pride and humility, which of all their effects are the most common and
 remarkable.
 
 This argument I esteem just and decisive; but in order to give greater
 authority to the present reasoning, let us suppose it false for a
 moment, and see what will follow. It is certain, then, that if the
 power of producing pleasure and pain forms not the essence of beauty and
 deformity, the sensations are at least inseparable from the qualities,
 and it is even difficult to consider them apart. Now there is nothing
 common to natural and moral beauty, (both of which are the causes of
 pride) but this power of producing pleasure; and as a common effect
 supposes always a common cause, it is plain the pleasure must in both
 cases be the real and influencing cause of the passion. Again; there is
 nothing originally different betwixt the beauty of our bodies and the
 beauty of external and foreign objects, but that the one has a near
 relation to ourselves, which is wanting in the other. This original
 difference, therefore, must be the cause of all their other differences,
 and among the rest, of their different influence upon the passion of
 pride, which is excited by the beauty of our person, but is not affected
 in the lcast by that of foreign and external objects. Placing, then,
 these two conclusions together, we find they compose the preceding
 system betwixt them, viz, that pleasure, as a related or resembling
 impression, when placed on a related object by a natural transition,
 produces pride; and its contrary, humility. This system, then, seems
 already sufficiently confirmed by experience; that we have not yet
 exhausted all our arguments.
 
 It is not the beauty of the body alone that produces pride, but also
 its strength and force. Strength is a kind of power; and therefore the
 desire to excel in strength is to be considered as an inferior
 species of ambition. For this reason the present phaenomenon will be
 sufficiently accounted for, in explaining that passion.
 
 Concerning all other bodily accomplishments we may observe in general,
 that whatever in ourselves is either useful, beautiful, or surprising,
 is an object of pride; and it's contrary, of humility. Now it is
 obvious, that every thing useful, beautiful or surprising, agrees in
 producing a separate pleasure and agrees in nothing else. The pleasure,
 therefore, with the relation to self must be the cause of the passion.
 
 Though it should be questioned, whether beauty be not something real,
 and different from the power of producing pleasure, it can never be
 disputed, that as surprize is nothing but a pleasure arising from
 novelty, it is not, properly speaking, a quality in any object, but
 merely a passion or impression in the soul. It must, therefore, be
 from that impression, that pride by a natural transition arises. And
 it arises so naturally, that there is nothing in us or belonging to
 us, which produces surprize, that does not at the same time excite that
 other passion. Thus we are vain of the surprising adventures we have
 met with, the escapes we have made, and dangers we have been exposed to.
 Hence the origin of vulgar lying; where men without any interest, and
 merely out of vanity, heap up a number of extraordinary events, which
 are either the fictions of their brain, or if true, have at least no
 connexion with themselves. Their fruitful invention supplies them with
 a variety of adventures; and where that talent is wanting, they
 appropriate such as belong to others, in order to satisfy their vanity.
 
 In this phaenomenon are contained two curious experiments, which if we
 compare them together, according to the known rules, by which we judge
 of cause and effect in anatomy, natural philosophy, and other sciences,
 will be an undeniable argument for that influence of the double
 relations above-mentioned. By one of these experiments we find, that an
 object produces pride merely by the interposition of pleasure; and that
 because the quality, by which it produces pride, is in reality nothing
 but the power of producing pleasure. By the other experiment we find,
 that the pleasure produces the pride by a transition along related
 ideas; because when we cut off that relation the passion is immediately
 destroyed.. A surprising adventure, in which we have been ourselves
 engaged, is related to us, and by that means produces pride: But the
 adventures of others, though they may cause pleasure, yet for want of
 this relation of ideas, never excite that passion. What farther proof
 can be desired for the present system?
 
 There is only one objection to this system with regard to our body:
 which is, that though nothing be more agreeable than health, and more
 painful than sickness, yet commonly men are neither proud of the one,
 nor mortifyed with the other. This will easily be accounted for, if
 we consider the second and fourth limitations, proposed to our general
 system. It was observed, that no object ever produces pride or humility,
 if it has not something peculiar to ourself; as also, that every
 cause of that passion must be in some measure constant, and hold some
 proportion to the duration of our self, which, is its object. Now as
 health and sickness vary incessantly to all men, and there is none, who
 is solely or certainly fixed in either, these accidental blessings and
 calamities are in a manner separated from us, and are never considered
 as connected with our being and existence. And that this account is just
 appears hence, that wherever a malady of any kind is so rooted in our
 constitution, that we no longer entertain any hopes of recovery, from
 that moment it becomes an object of humility; as is evident in old men,
 whom nothing mortifies more than the consideration of their age and
 infirmities. They endeavour, as long as possible, to conceal their
 blindness and deafness, their rheums and gouts; nor do they ever confess
 them without reluctance and uneasiness. And though young men are not
 ashamed of every head-ach or cold they fall into, yet no topic is so
 proper to mortify human pride, and make us entertain a mean opinion of
 our nature, than this, that we are every moment of our lives subject to
 such infirmities. This sufficiently proves that bodily pain and sickness
 are in themselves proper causes of humility; though the custom of
 estimating every thing by comparison more than by its intrinsic worth
 and value, makes us overlook these calamities, which we find to be
 incident to every one, and causes us to form an idea of our merit and
 character independent of them.
 
 We are ashamed of such maladies as affect others, and are either
 dangerous or disagreeable to them. Of the epilepsy; because it gives a
 horror to every one present: Of the itch; because it is infectious:
 Of the king's-evil; because it commonly goes to posterity. Men always
 consider the sentiments of others in their judgment of themselves. This
 has evidently appeared in some of the foregoing reasonings; and will
 appear still more evidently, and be more fully explained afterwards.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. IX OF EXTERNAL ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES
 
 
 But though pride and humility have the qualities of our mind and body
 that is self, for their natural and more immediate causes, we find
 by experience, that there are many other objects, which produce these
 affections, and that the primary one is, in some measure, obscured and
 lost by the multiplicity of foreign and extrinsic. We found a vanity
 upon houses, gardens, equipages, as well as upon personal merit and
 accomplishments; and though these external advantages be in themselves
 widely distant from thought or a person, yet they considerably influence
 even a passion, which is directed to that as its ultimate object,
 This, happens when external objects acquire any particular relation to
 ourselves, and are associated or connected with us. A beautiful fish
 in the ocean, an animal in a desart, and indeed any thing that neither
 belongs, nor is related to us, has no manner of influence on our vanity,
 whatever extraordinary qualities it may be endowed with, and whatever
 degree of surprize and admiration it may naturally occasion. It must be
 some way associated with us in order to touch our pride. Its idea must
 hang in a manner, upon that of ourselves and the transition from the one
 to the other must be easy and natural.
 
 But here it is remarkable, that though the relation of resemblance
 operates upon the mind in the same manner as contiguity and causation,
 in conveying us from one idea to another, yet it is seldom a foundation
 either of pride or of humility. If we resemble a person in any of the
 valuable parts of his character, we must, in some degree, possess the
 quality, in which we resemble him; and this quality we always chuse to
 survey directly in ourselves rather than by reflexion in another person,
 when we would found upon it any degree of vanity. So that though a
 likeness may occasionally produce that passion by suggesting a more
 advantageous idea of ourselves, it is there the view fixes at last, and
 the passion finds its ultimate and final cause.
 
 There are instances, indeed, wherein men shew a vanity in resembling a
 great man in his countenance, shape, air, or other minute circumstances,
 that contribute not in any degree to his reputation; but it must be
 confessed that this extends not very far, nor is of any considerable
 moment in these affections. For this I assign the following reason. We
 can never have a vanity of resembling in trifles any person, unless
 he be possessed of very shining qualities, which give us a respect and
 veneration for him. These qualities, then, are, properly speaking, the
 causes of our vanity, by means of their relation to ourselves. Now after
 what manner are they related to ourselves? They are parts of the person
 we value, and consequently connected with these trifles; which are
 also supposed to be parts of him. These trifles are connected with the
 resembling qualities in us; and these qualities in us, being parts,
 are connected with the whole; and by that means form a chain of several
 links of the person we resemble. But besides that this multitude of
 relations must weaken the connexion; it is evident the mind, in passing
 from the shining qualities to the trivial ones, must by that contrast
 the better perceive the minuteness of the latter, and be in some measure
 ashamed of the comparison and resemblance.
 
 The relation, therefore, of contiguity, or that of causation, betwixt
 the cause and object of pride and humility, is alone requisite to
 give rise to these passions; and these relations are nothing else
 but qualities, by which the imagination is conveyed from one idea to
 another. Now let us consider what effect these can possibly have upon
 the mind, and by what means they become so requisite to the production
 of the passions. It is evident, that the association of ideas operates
 in so silent and imperceptible a manner, that we are scarce sensible of
 it, and discover it more by its effects than by any immediate feeling or
 perception. It produces no emotion, and gives rise to no new impression
 of any kind, but only modifies those ideas, of which the mind was
 formerly possessed, and which it coued recal upon occasion. From this
 reasoning, as well as from undoubted experience, we may conclude, that
 an association of ideas, however necessary, is not alone sufficient to
 give rise to any passion.
 
 It is evident, then, that when the mind feels the passion either of
 pride or humility upon the appearance of related object, there is,
 beside the relation or transition of thought, an emotion or original
 impression produced by some other principle. The question is, whether
 the emotion first produced be the passion itself, or some other
 impression related to it. This question we cannot be long in deciding,
 For besides all the other arguments, with which this subject abounds,
 it must evidently appear, that the relation of ideas, which experience
 shews to be so requisite a circumstance to the production of the
 passion, would be entirely superfluous, were it not to second a relation
 of affections, and facilitate the transition from one impression
 to another. If nature produced immediately the passion of pride or
 humility, it would be compleated in itself, and would require no farther
 addition or encrease from any other affection. But supposing the first
 emotion to be only related to pride or humility, it is easily conceived
 to what purpose the relation of objects may serve, and how the two
 different associations, of impressions and ideas, by uniting their
 forces, may assist each other's operation. This is not only easily
 conceived, but I will venture to affirm it is the only manner, in which
 we can conceive this subject. An easy transition of ideas, which, of
 itself, causes no emotion, can never be necessary, or even useful to
 the passions, but by forwarding the transition betwixt some related
 impressions. Not to mention, that the same object causes a greater
 or smaller degree of pride, not only in proportion to the encrease or
 decrease of its qualities, but also to the distance or nearness of the
 relation; which is a clear argument for the transition of affections
 along the relation of ideas; since every change in the relation produces
 a proportionable change in the passion. Thus one part of the preceding
 system, concerning the relations of ideas is a sufficient proof of
 the other, concerning that of impressions; and is itself so evidently
 founded on experience, that it would be lost time to endeavour farther
 to prove it.
 
 This will appear still more evidently in particular instances. Men are
 vain of the beauty of their country, of their county, of their parish.
 Here the idea of beauty plainly produces a pleasure. This pleasure
 is related to pride. The object or cause of this pleasure is, by the
 supposition, related to self, or the object of pride. By this double
 relation of impressions and ideas, a transition is made from the one
 impression to the other.
 
 Men are also vain of the temperature of the climate, in which they were
 born; of the fertility of their native soil; of the goodness of the
 wines, fruits or victuals, produced by it; of the softness or force of
 their language; with other particulars of that kind. These objects have
 plainly a reference to the pleasures of the senses, and are originally
 considered as agreeable to the feeling, taste or hearing. How is it
 possible they coued ever become objects of pride, except by means of
 that transition above-explained?
 
 There are some, that discover a vanity of an opposite kind, and affect
 to depreciate their own country, in comparison of those, to which
 they have travelled. These persons find, when they are at home, and
 surrounded with their countrymen, that the strong relation betwixt them
 and their own nation is shared with so many, that it is in a manner lost
 to them; whereas their distant relation to a foreign country, which is
 formed by their having seen it and lived in it, is augmented by their
 considering how few there are who have done the same. For this reason
 they always admire the beauty, utility and rarity of what is abroad,
 above what is at home.
 
 Since we can be vain of a country, climate or any inanimate object,
 which bears a relation to us, it is no wonder we are vain of the
 qualities of those, who are connected with us by blood or friendship.
 Accordingly we find, that the very same qualities, which in ourselves
 produce pride, produce also in a lesser degree the same affection, when
 discovered in persons related to us. The beauty, address, merit, credit
 and honours of their kindred are carefully displayed by the proud, as
 some of their most considerable sources of their vanity.
 
 As we are proud of riches in ourselves, so to satisfy our vanity we
 desire that every one, who has any connexion with us, should likewise be
 possest of them, and are ashamed of any one, that is mean or poor, among
 our friends and relations. For this reason we remove the poor as far
 from us as possible; and as we cannot prevent poverty in some distant
 collaterals, and our forefathers are taken to be our nearest relations;
 upon this account every one affects to be of a good family, and to be
 descended from a long succession of rich and honourable ancestors.
 
 I have frequently observed, that those, who boast of the antiquity of
 their families, are glad when they can join this circumstance, that
 their ancestors for many generations have been uninterrupted proprietors
 of the same portion of land, and that their family has never changed its
 possessions, or been transplanted into any other county or province.
 I have also observed, that it is an additional subject of vanity, when
 they can boast, that these possessions have been transmitted through
 a descent composed entirely of males, and that the honour, and fortune
 have never past through any female. Let us endeavour to explain these
 phaenomena by the foregoing system.
 
 It is evident, that when any one boasts of the antiquity of his family,
 the subjects of his vanity are not merely the extent of time and number
 of ancestors, but also their riches and credit, which are supposed to
 reflect a lustre on himself on account of his relation to them. He first
 considers these objects; is affected by them in an agreeable manner;
 and then returning back to himself, through the relation of parent and
 child, is elevated with the passion of pride, by means of the double
 relation, of impressions and ideas. Since therefore the passion depends
 on these relations, whatever strengthens any of the relations must also
 encrease the passion, and whatever weakens the relations must diminish
 the passion. Now it is certain the identity of the possesion strengthens
 the relation of ideas arising from blood and kindred, and conveys the
 fancy with greater facility from one generation to another, from the
 remote ancestors to their posterity, who are both their heirs and their
 descendants. By this facility the impression is transmitted more entire,
 and excites a greater degree of pride and vanity.
 
 The case is the same with the transmission of the honours and fortune
 through a succession of males without their passing through any female.
 It is a quality of human nature, which we shall consider [Part II. Sect,
 2.] afterwards, that the imagination naturally turns to whatever is
 important and considerable; and where two objects are presented to it,
 a small and a great one, usually leaves the former, and dwells entirely
 upon the latter. As in the society of marriage, the male sex has the
 advantage above the female, the husband first engages our attention;
 and whether we consider him directly, or reach him by passing
 through related objects, the thought both rests upon him with greater
 satisfaction, and arrives at him with greater facility than his consort.
 It is easy to see, that this property must strengthen the child's
 relation to the father, and weaken that to the mother. For as all
 relations are nothing hut a propensity to pass from one idea ma another,
 whatever strengthens the propensity strengthens the relation; and as we
 have a stronger propensity to pass from the idea of the children to that
 of the father, than from the same idea to that of the mother, we ought
 to regard the former relation as the closer and more considerable. This
 is the reason why children commonly bear their father's name, and are
 esteemed to be of nobler or baser birth, according to his family. And
 though the mother should be possest of a superior spirit and genius to
 the father, as often happens, the general rule prevails, notwithstanding
 the exceprion, according to the doctrine above-explained. Nay even when
 a superiority of any kind is so great, or when any other reasons have
 such an effect, as to make the children rather represent: the mother's
 family than the father's, the general rule still retains such an
 efficacy that it weakens the relation, and makes a kind of break in the
 line of ancestors. The imagination runs not along them with facility,
 nor is able to transfer the honour and credit of the ancestors to their
 posterity of the same name and family so readily, as when the transition
 is conformable to the general rules, and passes from father to son, or
 from brother to brother.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. X OF PROPERTY AND RICHES
 
 
 But the relation, which is esteemed the closest, and which of all others
 produces most commonly the passion of pride, is that of property. This
 relation it will be impossible for me fully to explain before I come
 to treat of justice and the other moral virtues. It is sufficient to
 observe on this occasion, that property may be defined, such a relation
 betwixt a person and an object as permits him, but forbids any other,
 the free use and possession of it, without violating the laws of justice
 and moral equity. If justice, therefore, be a virtue, which has a
 natural and original influence on the human mind, property may be looked
 upon as a particular species of causation; whether we consider the
 liberty it gives the proprietor to operate as he please upon the object
 or the advantages, which he reaps from it. It is the same case, if
 justice, according to the system of certain philosophers, should be
 esteemed an artificial and not a natural virtue. For then honour, and
 custom, and civil laws supply the place of natural conscience, and
 produce, in some degree, the same effects. This in the mean time is
 certain, that the mention of the property naturally carries our thought
 to the proprietor, and of the proprietor to the property; which being
 a proof of a perfect relation of ideas is all that is requisite to our
 present purpose. A relation of ideas, joined to that of impressions,
 always produces a transition of affections; and therefore, whenever any
 pleasure or pain arises from an object, connected with us by property.
 we may be certain, that either pride or humility must arise from
 this conjunction of relations; if the foregoing system be solid and
 satisfactory. And whether it be so or not, we may soon satisfy ourselves
 by the most cursory view of human life.
 
 Every thing belonging to a vain man is the best that is any where to be
 found. His houses, equipage, furniture, doaths, horses, hounds, excel
 all others in his conceit; and it is easy to observe, that from the
 least advantage in any of these, he draws a new subject of pride and
 vanity. His wine, if you'll believe him, has a finer flavour than
 any other; his cookery is more exquisite; his table more orderly; his
 servants more expert; the air, in which he lives, more healthful; the
 soil he cultivates more fertile; his fruits ripen earlier and to greater
 perfection: Such a thing is remarkable for its novelty; such another for
 its antiquity: This is the workmanship of a famous artist; that belonged
 once to such a prince or great man: All objects, in a word, that are
 useful, beautiful or surprising, or are related to such, may, by means
 of property, give rise to this passion. These agree in giving pleasure,
 and agree in nothing else. This alone is common to them; and therefore
 must be the quality that produces the passion, which is their common
 effect. As every new instance is a new argument, and as the instances
 are here without number, I may venture to affirm, that scarce any
 system was ever so fully proved by experience, as that which I have here
 advanced.
 
 If the property of any thing, that gives pleasure either by its
 utility, beauty or novelty, produces also pride by a double relation
 of impressions and ideas; we need not be surprized, that the power of
 acquiring this property, should have the same effect. Now riches are to
 be considered as the power of acquiring the property of what pleases;
 and it is only in this view they have any influence on the passions.
 Paper will, on many occasions, be considered as riches, and that because
 it may convey the power of acquiring money: And money is not riches,
 as it is a metal endowed with certain qualities of solidity, weight
 and fusibility; but only as it has a relation to the pleasures and
 conveniences of life. Taking then this for granted, which is in itself
 so evident, we may draw from it one of the strongest arguments I have
 yet employed to prove the influence of the double relations on pride and
 humility.
 
 It has been observed in treating of the understanding, that the
 distinction, which we sometimes make betwixt a power and the exercise
 of it, is entirely frivolous, and that neither man nor any other being
 ought ever to be thought possest of any ability, unless it be exerted
 and put in action. But though this be strictly true in a just and
 philosophical way of thinking, it is certain it is not the philosophy
 of our passions; but that many things operate upon them by means of the
 idea and supposition of power, independent of its actual exercise. We
 are pleased when we acquire an ability of procuring pleasure, and are
 displeased when another acquires a power of giving pain. This is evident
 from experience; but in order to give a just explication of the matter,
 and account for this satisfaction and uneasiness, we must weigh the
 following reflections.
 
 It is evident the error of distinguishing power from its exercise
 proceeds not entirely from the scholastic doctrine of free-will, which,
 indeed, enters very little into common life, and has but small influence
 on our vulgar and popular ways of thinking. According to that doctrine,
 motives deprive us not of free-will, nor take away our power of
 performing or forbearing any action. But according to common notions a
 man has no power, where very considerable motives lie betwixt him and
 the satisfaction of his desires, and determine him to forbear what he
 wishes to perform. I do not think I have fallen into my enemy's power,
 when I see him pass me in the streets with a sword by his side, while
 I am unprovided of any weapon. I know that the fear of the civil
 magistrate is as strong a restraint as any of iron, and that I am in as
 perfect safety as if he were chained or imprisoned. But when a person
 acquires such an authority over me, that not only there is no external
 obstacle to his actions; but also that he may punish or reward me as he
 pleases, without any dread of punishment in his turn, I then attribute a
 full power to him, and consider myself as his subject or vassal.
 
 Now if we compare these two cases, that of a person, who has very
 strong motives of interest or safety to forbear any action, and that of
 another, who lies under no such obligation, we shall find, according
 to the philosophy explained in the foregoing book, that the only
 known difference betwixt them lies in this, that in the former case we
 conclude from past experience, that the person never will perform that
 action, and in the latter, that he possibly or probably will perform it.
 Nothing is more fluctuating and inconstant on many occasions, than the
 will of man; nor is there any thing but strong motives, which can give
 us an absolute certainty in pronouncing concerning any of his future
 actions. When we see a person free from these motives, we suppose a
 possibility either of his acting or forbearing; and though in general
 we may conclude him to be determined by motives and causes, yet this
 removes not the uncertainty of our judgment concerning these causes, nor
 the influence of that uncertainty on the passions. Since therefore we
 ascribe a power of performing an action to every one, who has no very
 powerful motive to forbear it, and refuse it to such as have; it may
 justly be concluded, that power has always a reference to its exercise,
 either actual or probable, and that we consider a person as endowed with
 any ability when we find from past experience, that it is probable, or
 at least possible he may exert it. And indeed, as our passions always
 regard the real existence of objects, and we always judge of this
 reality from past instances; nothing can be more likely of itself,
 without any farther reasoning, than that power consists in the
 possibility or probability of any action, as discovered by experience
 and the practice of the world.
 
 Now it is evident, that wherever a person is in such a situadon with
 regard to me, that there is no very powerful motive to deter him from
 injuring me, and consequently it is uncertain whether he will injure me
 or not, I must be uneasy in such a situation, and cannot consider the
 possibility or probability of that injury without a sensible concern.
 The passions are not only affected by such events as are certain and
 infallible, but also in an inferior degree by such as are possible
 and contingent. And though perhaps I never really feel any harm, and
 discover by the event, that, philosophically speaking, the person never
 had any power of harming me; since he did not exert any; this prevents
 not my uneasiness from the preceding uncertainty. The agreeable passions
 may here operate as well as the uneasy, and convey a pleasure when I
 perceive a good to become either possible or probable by the possibility
 or probability of another's bestowing it on me, upon the removal of any
 strong motives, which might formerly have hindered him.
 
 But we may farther observe, that this satisfaction encreases, when any
 good approaches in such a manner that it it in one's own power to take
 or leave it, and there neither is any physical impediment, nor any
 very strong motive to hinder our enjoyment. As all men desire pleasure,
 nothing can be more probable, than its existence when there is no
 external obstacle to the producing it, and men perceive no danger in
 following their inclinations. In that case their imagination easily
 anticipates the satisfaction, and conveys the same joy, as if they were
 persuaded of its real and actual existence.
 
 But this accounts not sufficiently for the satisfaction, which attends
 riches. A miser receives delight from his money; that is, from the power
 it affords him of procuring all the pleasures and conveniences of life,
 though he knows he has enjoyed his riches for forty years without ever
 employing them; and consequently cannot conclude by any species of
 reasoning, that the real existence of these pleasures is nearer, than if
 he were entirely deprived of all his possessions. But though he cannot
 form any such conclusion in a way of reasoning concerning she nearer
 approach of the pleasure, it is certain he imagines it to approach
 nearer, whenever all external obstacles are removed, along with the more
 powerful motives of interest and danger, which oppose it. For farther
 satisfaction on this head I must refer to my account of the will, where
 I shall [Part III. Sect. 2.] explain that false sensation of liberty,
 which make, us imagine we can perform any thing, that is not very
 dangerous or destructive. Whenever any other person is under no
 strong obligations of interest to forbear any pleasure, we judge from
 experience, that the pleasure will exist, and that he will probably
 obtain it. But when ourselves are in that situation, we judge from
 an illusion of the fancy, that the pleasure is still closer and more
 immediate. The will seems to move easily every way, and casts a shadow
 or image of itself, even to that side, on which it did not settle. By
 means of this image the enjoyment seems to approach nearer to us, and
 gives us the same lively satisfaction, as if it were perfectly certain
 and unavoidable.
 
 It will now be easy to draw this whole reasoning to a paint, and to
 prove, that when riches produce any pride or vanity in their possessors,
 as they never fail so do, it is only by means of a double relation of
 impressions and ideas. The very essence of riches consists in the power
 of procuring the pleasures and conveniences of life. The very essence of
 this consists in the probability of its exercise, and in its causing us
 to anticipate, by a true or false reasoning, the real existence of
 the pleasure. This anticipation of pleasure is, in itself, a very
 considerable pleasure; and as its cause is some possession or property,
 which we enjoy, and which is thereby related to us, we here dearly see
 all the parts of the foregoing system most exactly and distinctly drawn
 out before us. For the same reason, that riches cause pleasure and
 pride, and poverty excites uneasiness and humility, power must produce
 the former emotions, and slavery the latter. Power or an authority over
 others makes us capable of satisfying all our desires; as slavery, by
 subjecting us to the will of others, exposes us to a thousand wants, and
 mortifications.
 
 It is here worth observing, that the vanity of power, or shame of
 slavery, are much augmented by the consideration of the persons,
 over whom we exercise our authority, or who exercise it over us. For
 supposing it possible to frame statues of such an admirable mechanism,
 that they coued move and act in obedience to the will; it is evident
 the possession of them would give pleasure and pride, but not to such a
 degree, as the same authority, when exerted over sensible and rational
 creatures, whose condition, being compared to our own, makes it seem
 more agreeable and honourable. Comparison is in every case a sure method
 of augmenting our esteem of any thing. A rich man feels the felicity of
 his condition better by opposing it to that of a beggar. But there is
 a peculiar advantage in power, by the contrast, which is, in a manner,
 presented to us, betwixt ourselves and the person we command. The
 comparison is obvious and natural: The imagination finds it in the very
 subject: The passage of the thought to its conception is smooth and
 easy. And that this circumstance has a considerable effect in augmenting
 its influence, will appear afterwards in examining the nature of malice
 and envy.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. XI OF THE LOVE OF FAME
 
 
 But beside these original causes of pride and humility, there is a
 secondary one in the opinions of others, which has an equal influence
 on the affections. Our reputation, our character, our name are
 considerations of vast weight and importance; and even the other causes
 of pride; virtue, beauty and riches; have little influence, when not
 seconded by the opinions and sentiments of others. In order to account
 for this phaenomenon it will be necessary to take some compass, and
 first explain the nature of sympathy.
 
 No quality of human nature is more remarkable, both in itself and in its
 consequences, than that propensity we have to sympathize with others,
 and to receive by communication their inclinations and sentiments,
 however different from, or even contrary to our own. This is not only
 conspicuous in children, who implicitly embrace every opinion proposed
 to them; but also in men of the greatest judgment and understanding,
 who find it very difficult to follow their own reason or inclination,
 in opposition to that of their friends and daily companions. To this
 principle we ought to ascribe the great uniformity we may observe in the
 humours and turn of thinking of those of the same nation; and it is much
 more probable, that this resemblance arises from sympathy, than from
 any influence of the soil and climate, which, though they continue
 invariably the same, are not able to preserve the character of a nation
 the same for a century together. A good-natured man finds himself in an
 instant of the same humour with his company; and even the proudest and
 most surly take a tincture from their countrymen and acquaintance. A
 chearful countenance infuses a sensible complacency and serenity into my
 mind; as an angry or sorrowful one throws a sudden dump upon me. Hatred,
 resentment, esteem, love, courage, mirth and melancholy; all these
 passions I feel more from communication than from my own natural temper
 and disposition. So remarkable a phaenomenon merits our attention, and
 must be traced up to its first principles.
 
 When any affection is infused by sympathy, it is at first known only
 by its effects, and by those external signs in the countenance and
 conversation, which convey an idea of it. This idea is presently
 converted into an impression, and acquires such a degree of force and
 vivacity, as to become the very passion itself, and produce an equal
 emotion, as any original affection. However instantaneous this change of
 the idea into an impression may be, it proceeds from certain views
 and reflections, which will not escape the strict scrutiny of a.
 philosopher, though they may the person himself, who makes them.
 
 It is evident, that the idea, or rather impression of ourselves is
 always intimately present with us, and that our consciousness gives us
 so lively a conception of our own person, that it is not possible to
 imagine, that any thing can in this particular go beyond it. Whatever
 object, therefore, is related to ourselves must be conceived with a
 little vivacity of conception, according to the foregoing principles;
 and though this relation should not be so strong as that of causation,
 it must still have a considerable influence. Resemblance and contiguity
 are relations not to be neglected; especially when by an inference
 from cause and effect, and by the observation of external signs, we are
 informed of the real existence of the object, which is resembling or
 contiguous.
 
 Now it is obvious, that nature has preserved a great resemblance among
 all human creatures, and that we never remark any passion or principle
 in others, of which, in some degree or other, we may not find a parallel
 in ourselves. The case is the same with the fabric of the mind, as with
 that of the body. However the parts may differ in shape or size, their
 structure and composition are in general the same. There is a very
 remarkable resemblance, which preserves itself amidst all their variety;
 and this resemblance must very much contribute to make us enter into
 the sentiments of others; and embrace them with facility and pleasure.
 Accordingly we find, that where, beside the general resemblance of our
 natures, there is any peculiar similarity in our manners, or character,
 or country, or language, it facilitates the sympathy. The stronger the
 relation is betwixt ourselves and any object, the more easily does the
 imagination make the transition, and convey to the related idea the
 vivacity of conception, with which we always form the idea of our own
 person.
 
 Nor is resemblance the only relation, which has this effect, but
 receives new force from other relations, that may accompany it. The
 sentiments of others have little influence, when far removed from
 us, and require the relation of contiguity, to make them communicate
 themselves entirely. The relations of blood, being a species of
 causation, may sometimes contribute to the same effect; as also
 acquaintance, which operates in the same manner with education and
 custom; as we shall see more fully [Part II. Sect. 4.] afterwards.
 All these relations, when united together, convey the impression
 or consciousness of our own person to the idea of the sentiments or
 passions of others, and makes us conceive them in the strongest and most
 lively manner.
 
 It has been remarked in the beginning of this treatise, that all ideas
 are borrowed from impressions, and that these two kinds of perceptions
 differ only in the degrees of force and vivacity, with which they
 strike upon the soul. The component part of ideas and impressions are
 precisely alike. The manner and order of their appearance may be the
 same. The different degrees of their force and vivacity are, therefore,
 the only particulars, that distinguish them: And as this difference may
 be removed, in some measure, by a relation betwixt the impressions and
 ideas, it is no wonder an idea of a sentiment or passion, may by this
 means be inlivened as to become the very sentiment or passion. The
 lively idea of any object always approaches is impression; and it
 is certain we may feel sickness and pain from the mere force of
 imagination, and make a malady real by often thinking of it. But this
 is most remarkable in the opinions and affections; and it is there
 principally that a lively idea is converted into an impression. Our
 affections depend more upon ourselves, and the internal operations of
 the mind, than any other impressions; for which reason they arise more
 naturally from the imagination, and from every lively idea we form of
 them. This is the nature and cause of sympathy; and it is after this
 manner we enter so deep into the opinions and affections of others,
 whenever we discover them.
 
 What is principally remarkable in this whole affair is the strong
 confirmation these phaenomena give to the foregoing system concerning
 the understanding, and consequently to the present one concerning the
 passions; since these are analogous to each other. It is indeed evident,
 that when we sympathize with the passions and sentiments of others,
 these movements appear at first in our mind as mere ideas, and are
 conceived to belong to another person, as we conceive any other matter
 of fact. It is also evident, that the ideas of the affections of others
 are converted into the very impressions they represent, and that the
 passions arise in conformity to the images we form of them. All this is
 an object of the plainest experience, and depends not on any hypothesis
 of philosophy. That science can only be admitted to explain the
 phaenomena; though at the same time it must be confest, they are so
 clear of themselves, that there is but little occasion to employ it. For
 besides the relation of cause and effect, by which we are convinced of
 the reality of the passion, with which we sympathize; besides this, I
 say, we must be assisted by the relations of resemblance and contiguity,
 in order to feel the sympathy in its full perfection. And since these
 relations can entirely convert an idea into an impression, and convey
 the vivacity of the latter into the former, so perfectly as to lose
 nothing of it in the transition, we may easily conceive how the relation
 of cause and effect alone, may serve to strengthen and inliven an
 idea. In sympathy there is an evident conversion of an idea into an
 impression. This conversion arises from the relation of objects to
 ourself. Ourself is always intimately present to us. Let us compare
 all these circumstances, and we shall find, that sympathy is exactly
 correspondent to the operations of our understanding; and even contains
 something more surprizing and extraordinary.
 
 It is now time to turn our view from the general consideration of
 sympathy, to its influence on pride and humility, when these passions
 arise from praise and blame, from reputation and infamy. We may observe,
 that no person is ever praised by another for any quality, which would
 not, if real, produce, of itself, a pride in the person possest of
 it. The elogiums either turn upon his power, or riches, or family,
 or virtue; all of which are subjects of vanity, that we have already
 explained and accounted for. It is certain, then, that if a person
 considered himself in the same light, in which he appears to his
 admirer, he would first receive a separate pleasure, and afterwards a
 pride or self-satisfaction, according to the hypothesis above explained.
 Now nothing is more natural than for us to embrace the opinions of
 others in this particular; both from sympathy, which renders all their
 sentiments intimately present to us; and from reasoning, which makes us
 regard their judgment, as a kind of argument for what they affirm.
 These two principles of authority and sympathy influence almost all our
 opinions; but must have a peculiar influence, when we judge of our own
 worth and character. Such judgments are always attended with passion
 [Book I, Part III. Sect. 10.]; and nothing tends more to disturb
 our understanding, and precipitate us into any opinions, however
 unreasonable, than their connexion with passion; which diffuses itself
 over the imagination, and gives an additional force to every related
 idea. To which we may add, that being conscious of great partiality in
 our own favour, we are peculiarly pleased with any thing, that confirms
 the good opinion we have of ourselves, and are easily shocked with
 whatever opposes it.
 
 All this appears very probable in theory; but in order to bestow a
 full certainty on this reasoning, we must examine the phaenonena of the
 passions, and see if they agree with it.
 
 Among these phaenomena we may esteem it a very favourable one to our
 present purposes that though fame in general be agreeable, yet we
 receive a much greater satisfaction from the approbation of those, whom
 we ourselves esteem and approve of, than of those, whom we hate and
 despise. In like measure we are principally mortifyed with the contempt
 of persons, upon whose judgment we set some value, and are, in a peat
 measure, indifferent about the opinions of the rest of mankind. But
 if the mind received from any original instinct a desire of fame
 and aversion to infamy, fame and infamy would influence us without
 distinction; and every opinion, according as it were favourabk or
 unfavourable, would equally excite that desire or aversion. The judgment
 of a fool is the judgment of another person, as well as that of a wise
 man, and is only inferior in its influence on our own judgment.
 
 We are not only better pleased with the approbation of a wise man than
 with that of a fool, but receive an additional satisfaction from the
 former, when it is obtained after a long and intimate acquaintance. This
 is accounted for after the same manner.
 
 The praises of others never give us much pleasure, unless they concur
 with our own opinion, and extol us for those qualities, in which we
 chiefly excel. A mere soldier little values the character of eloquence:
 A gownman of courage: A bishop of humour: Or a merchant of learning.
 Whatever esteem a man may have for any quality, abstractedly considered;
 when he is conscious he is not possest of it; the opinions of the whole
 world will give him little pleasure in that particular, and that because
 they never will be able to draw his own opinion after them.
 
 Nothing is more usual than for men of good families, but narrow
 circumstances, to leave their friends and country, and rather seek their
 livelihood by mean and mechanical employments among strangers, than
 among those, who are acquainted with their birth and education. We shall
 be unknown, say they, where we go. No body will suspect from what
 family we are sprung. We shall be removed from all our friends and
 acquaintance, and our poverty and meanness will by that means sit more
 easy upon us. In examining these sentiments, I find they afford many
 very convincing arguments for my present purpose.
 
 First, We may infer from them, that the uneasiness of being contemned
 depends on sympathy, and that sympathy depends on the relation of
 objects to ourselves; since we are most uneasy under the contempt of
 persons, who are both related to us by blood, and contiguous in place.
 Hence we-seek to diminish this sympathy and uneasiness by separating
 these relations, and placing ourselves in a contiguity to strangers, and
 at a distance from relations.
 
 Secondly, We may conclude, that relations are requisite to sympathy, not
 absolutely considered as relations, but by their influence in converting
 our ideas of the sentiments of others into the very sentiments, by means
 of the association betwixt the idea of their persons, and that of our
 own. For here the relations of kindred and contiguity both subsist; but
 not being united in the same persons, they contribute in a less degree
 to the sympathy.
 
 Thirdly, This very circumstance of the diminution of sympathy by the
 separation of relations is worthy of our attention. Suppose I am placed
 in a poor condition among strangers, and consequently am but lightly
 treated; I yet find myself easier in that situation, than when I was
 every day exposed to the contempt of my kindred and countrymen. Here
 I feel a double contempt; from my relations, but they are absent; from
 those about me, but they are strangers. This double contempt is likewise
 strengthened by the two relations of kindred and contiguity. But as
 the persons are not the same, who are connected with me by those two
 relations, this difference of ideas separates the impressions arising
 from the contempt, and keeps them from running into each other. The
 contempt of my neighbours has a certain influence; as has also that of
 my kindred: But these influences are distinct, and never unite; as when
 the contempt proceeds from persons who are at once both my neighbours
 and kindred. This phaenomenon is analogous to the system of pride and
 humility above-explained, which may seem so extraordinary to vulgar
 apprehensions.
 
 Fourthly, A person in these circumstances naturally conceals his birth
 from those among whom he lives, and is very uneasy, if any one suspects
 him to be of a family, much superior to his present fortune and way of
 living. Every thing in this world is judged of by comparison. What is
 an immense fortune for a private gentleman is beggary for a prince. A
 peasant would think himself happy in what cannot afford necessaries for
 a gentleman. When a man has either been acustomed to a more splendid way
 of living, or thinks himself intitled to it by his birth and quality,
 every thing below is disagreeable and even shameful; and it is with she
 greatest industry he conceals his pretensions to a better fortune. Here
 he himself knows his misfortunes; but as those, with whom he lives.
 are ignorant of them, he has the disagreeable reflection and comparison
 suggested only by his own thoughts, and never receives it by a
 sympathy with others; which must contribute very much so his ease and
 satisfaction.
 
 If there be any objections to this hypothesis, THAT THE PLEASURE, WHICH
 WE RECEIVE FROM PRAISE, ARISES FROM A COMMUNICATION OF SENTIMENTS, we
 shall find, uponexamination, that these objections, when taken in a
 properlight, will serve to confirm it. Popular fame may be agreeable
 even to a man, who despises the vulgar; but it is because their
 multitude gives them additional weight and authority. Plagiaries are
 delighted with praises, which they are conscious they do not deserve;
 but this is a kind of castle-building, where the imagination amuses
 itself with its own fictions, and strives to render them firm and stable
 by a sympathy with the sentiments of others. Proud men are most shocked
 with contempt, should they do not most readily assent to it; but it is
 because of the opposition betwixt the passion, which is natural so them,
 and that received by sympathy. A violent lover in like manner is very
 much disp pleased when you blame and condemn his love; though it is
 evident your opposition can have no influence, but by the hold it
 takes of himself, and by his sympathy with you. If he despises you, or
 perceives you are in jest, whatever you say has no effect upon him.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. XII OF THE PRIDE AND HUMILITY OF ANIMALS
 
 
 Thus in whatever light we consider this subject, we may still observe,
 that die causes of pride and humility correspond exactly to our
 hypothesis, and that nothing can excite either of these passions,
 unless it be both related to ourselves, and produces a pleasure or pain
 independent of the passion. We have not only proved, that a tendency
 to produce pleasure or pain is common to all the causes of pride or
 humility, but also that it is the only thing, which is common; and
 consequently is the quality, by which they operate. We have farther
 proved, that the most considerable causes of these passions are
 really nothing but the power of producing either agreeable or uneasy
 sensations; and therefore that all their effects, and amongst the rest,
 pride and humility, are derived solely from that origin. Such simple
 and natural principles, founded on such solid proofs, cannot fail to be
 received by philosophers, unless opposed by some objections, that have
 escaped me.
 
 It is usual with anatomists to join their observations and experiments
 on human bodies to those on beasts, and from the agreement of these
 experiments to derive an additional argument for any particular
 hypothesis. It is indeed certain, that where the structure of parts in
 brutes is the same as in men, and the operation of these parts also
 the same, the causes of that operation cannot be different, and that
 whatever we discover to be true of the one species, may be concluded
 without hesitation to be certain of the other. Thus though the mixture
 of humours and the composition of minute parts may justly be presumed
 so be somewhat different in men from what it is in mere animals; and
 therefore any experiment we make upon the one concerning the effects of
 medicines will not always apply to the other; yet as the structure of
 the veins and muscles, the fabric and situation of the heart, of the
 lungs, the stomach, the liver and other parts, are the same or nearly
 the same in all animals, the very same hypothesis, which in one species
 explains muscular motion, the progress of the chyle, the circulation of
 the blood, must be applicable to every one; and according as it
 agrees or disagrees with the experiments we may make in any species of
 creatures, we may draw a proof of its truth or falshood on the whole.
 Let us, therefore, apply this method of enquiry, which is found so just
 and useful in reasonings concerning the body, to our present anatomy of
 the mind, and see what discoveries we can make by it.
 
 In order to this we must first shew the correspondence of passions in
 men and animals, and afterwards compare the causes, which produce these
 passions.
 
 It is plain, that almost in every species of creatures, but especially
 of the nobler kind, there are many evident marks of pride and humility.
 The very port and gait of a swan, or turkey, or peacock show the high
 idea he has entertained of himself, and his contempt of all others. This
 is the more remarkable, that in the two last species of animals, the
 pride always attends the beauty, and is discovered in the male only.
 The vanity and emulation of nightingales in singing have been commonly
 remarked; as likewise that of horses in swiftness, of hounds in sagacity
 and smell, of the bull and cock in strength, and of every other animal
 in his particular excellency. Add to this, that every species of
 creatures, which approach so often to man, as to familiarize themselves
 with him, show an evident pride in his approbation, and are pleased with
 his praises and caresses, independent of every other consideration. Nor
 are they the caresses of every one without distinction, which give them
 this vanity, but those principally of the persons they know and love;
 in the same manner as that passion is excited in mankind. All these are
 evident proofs, that pride and humility are not merely human passions,
 but extend themselves over the whole animal creation.
 
 The CAUSES of these passions are likewise much the same in beasts as
 in us, making a just allowance for our superior knowledge and
 understanding. Thus animals have little or no sense of virtue or vice;
 they quickly lose sight of the relations of blood; and are incapable of
 that of right and property: For which reason the causes of their pride
 and humility must lie solely in the body, and can never be placed either
 in the mind or external objects. But so far as regards the body, the
 same qualities cause pride in the animal as in the human kind; and it is
 on beauty, strength, swiftness or some other useful or agreeable quality
 that this passion is always founded.
 
 The next question is, whether, since those passions are the same, and
 arise from the same causes through the whole creation, the manner, in
 which the causes operate, be also the same. According to all rules of
 analogy, this is justly to be expected; and if we find upon trial,
 that the explication of these phaenomena, which we make use of in
 one species, will not apply to the rest, we may presume that that
 explication, however specious, is in reality without foundation.
 
 In order to decide this question, let us consider, that there is
 evidently the same relation of ideas, and derived from the same causes,
 in the minds of animals as in those of men. A dog, that has hid a bone,
 often forgets the place; but when brought to it, his thought passes
 easily to what he formerly concealed, by means of the contiguity, which
 produces a relation among his ideas. In like manner, when he has been
 heartily beat in any place, he will tremble on his approach to it,
 even though he discover no signs of any present danger. The effects
 of resemblance are not so remarkable; but as that relation makes a
 considerable ingredient in causation, of which all animals shew
 so evident a judgment, we may conclude that the three relations of
 resemblance, contiguity and causation operate in the same manner upon
 beasts as upon human creatures.
 
 There are also instances of the relation of impressions, sufficient
 to convince us, that there is an union of certain affections with each
 other in the inferior species of creatures as well as in the superior,
 and that their minds are frequently conveyed through a series of
 connected emotions. A dog, when elevated with joy, runs naturally into
 love and kindness, whether of his master or of the sex. In like manner,
 when full of pain and sorrow, he becomes quarrelsome and illnatured;
 and that passion; which at first was grief, is by the smallest occasion
 converted into anger.
 
 Thus all the internal principles, that are necessary in us to produce
 either pride or humility, are commcm to all creaturn; and since the
 causes, which excite these passions, are likewise the same, we may
 justly conclude, that these causes operate after the same manner through
 the whole animal creation. My hypothesis Is so simple, and supposes so
 little reflection and judgment, that it is applicable to every sensible
 creature; which must not only be allowed to be a convincing proof of its
 veracity, but, I am confident, will be found an objection to every other
 system.
 
 
 
 
 
 PART II OF LOVE AND HATRED
 
 
 
 
 SECT. I OF THE OBJECT AND CAUSES OF LOVE AND HATRED
 
 
 It is altogether impossible to give any definition of the passions
 of love and hatred; and that because they produce merely a simple
 impression, without any mixture or composition. Twould be as unnecessary
 to attempt any description of them, drawn from their nature, origin,
 causes and objects; and that both because these are the subjects of
 our present enquiry, and because these passions of themselves are
 sufficiently known from our common feeling and experience. This we
 have already observed concerning pride and humility, and here repeat it
 concerning love and hatred; and indeed there is so great a resemblance
 betwixt these two sets of passions, that we shall be obliged to begin
 with a kind of abridgment of our reasonings concerning the former, in
 order to explain the latter.
 
 As the immediate object of pride and humility is self or that identical
 person, of whose thoughts, actions, and sensations we are intimately
 conscious; so the object of love and hatred is some other person, of
 whose thoughts, actions, and sensations we are not conscious. This is
 sufficiently evident from experience. Our love and hatred are always
 directed to some sensible being external to us; and when we talk
 of self-love, it is not in a proper sense, nor has the sensation it
 produces any thing in common with that tender emotion which is excited
 by a friend or mistress. It is the same case with hatred. We may be
 mortified by our own faults and follies; but never feel any anger or
 hatred except from the injuries of others.
 
 But though the object of love and hatred be always some other person, it
 is plain that the object is not, properly speaking, the cause of these
 passions, or alone sufficient to excite them. For since love and hatred
 are directly contrary in their sensation, and have the same object in
 common, if that object were also their cause, it would produce these
 opposite passions in an equal degree; and as they must, from the very
 first moment, destroy each other, none of them would ever be able to
 make its appearance. There must, therefore, be some cause different from
 the object.
 
 If we consider the causes of love and hatred, we shall find they are
 very much diversifyed, and have not many things in common. The virtue,
 knowledge, wit, good sense, good humour of any person, produce love
 and esteem; as the opposite qualities, hatred and contempt. The same
 passions arise from bodily accomplishments, such as beauty, force,
 swiftness, dexterity; and from their contraries; as likewise from the
 external advantages and disadvantages of family, possession, cloaths,
 nation and climate. There is not one of these objects, but what by its
 different qualities may produce love and esteem, or hatred and contempt.
 
 From the view of these causes we may derive a new distinction betwixt
 the quality that operates, and the subject on which it is placed. A
 prince, that is possessed of a stately palace, commands the esteem
 of the people upon that account; and that first, by the beauty of the
 palace, and secondly, by the relation of property, which connects it
 with him. The removal of either of these destroys the passion; which
 evidently proves that the cause Is a compounded one.
 
 Twould be tedious to trace the passions of love and hatred, through all
 the observations which we have formed concerning pride and humility,
 and which are equally applicable to both sets of passions. Twill be
 sufficient to remark in general, that the object of love and hatred is
 evidently some thinking person; and that the sensation of the former
 passion is always agreeable, and of the latter uneasy. We may also
 suppose with some shew of probability, THAT THE CAUSE OF BOTH THESE
 PASSIONS IS ALWAYS RELATED TO A THINKING BEING, AND THAT THE CAUSE OF
 THE FORMER PRODUCE A SEPARATE PLEASURE, AND OF THE LATTER A SEPARATE
 UNEASINESS.
 
 One of these suppositions, viz, that the cause of love and hatred must
 be related to a person or thinking being, in order to produce these
 passions, is not only probable, but too evident to be contested. Virtue
 and vice, when considered in the abstract; beauty and deformity, when
 placed on inanimate objects; poverty and riches when belonging to a
 third person, excite no degree of love or hatred, esteem or contempt
 towards those, who have no relation to them. A person looking out at a
 window, sees me in the street, and beyond me a beautiful palace, with
 which I have no concern: I believe none will pretend, that this person
 will pay me the same respect, as if I were owner of the palace.
 
 It is not so evident at first sight, that a relation of impressions is
 requisite to these passions, and that because in the transition the one
 impression is so much confounded with the other, that they become in a
 manner undistinguishable. But as in pride and humility, we have easily
 been able to make the separation, and to prove, that every cause of
 these passions, produces a separate pain or pleasure, I might here
 observe the same method with the same success, in examining particularly
 the several causes of love and hatred. But as I hasten a full and
 decisive proof of these systems, I delay this examination for a moment:
 And in the mean time shall endeavour to convert to my present purpose
 all my reaaonings concerning pride and humility, by an argument that
 is founded on unquestionable examination.
 
 There are few persons, that are satisfyed with their own character, or
 genius, or fortune, who are nor desirous of shewing themselves to the
 world, and of acquiring the love and approbation of mankind. Now it is
 evident, that the very same qualities and circumstances, which are the
 causes of pride or self-esteem, are also the causes of vanity or the
 desire of reputation; and that we always put to view those particulars
 with which in ourselves we are best satisfyed. But if love and esteem
 were not produced by the same qualities as pride, according as these
 qualities are related to ourselves or others, this method of proceeding
 would be very absurd, nor coued men expect a correspondence in
 the sentiments of every other person, with those themselves have
 entertained. It is true, few can form exact systems of the passions, or
 make reflections on their general nature and resemblances. But without
 such a progress in philosophy, we are not subject to many mistakes in
 this particular, but are sufficiently guided by common experience, as
 well as by a kind of presentation; which tells us what will operate on
 others, by what we feel immediately in ourselves. Since then the same
 qualities that produce pride or humility, cause love or hatred; all
 the arguments that have been employed to prove, that the causes of the
 former passions excite a pain or pleasure independent of the passion,
 will be applicable with equal evidence to the causes of the latter.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. II EXPERIMENTS TO CONFIRM THIS SYSTEM
 
 
 Upon duly weighing these arguments, no one will make any scruple to
 assent to that condusion I draw from them, concerning the transition
 along related impressions and ideas, especially as it is a principle,
 in itself, so easy and natural. But that we may place this system beyond
 doubt both with regard to love and hatred, pride and humility, it will
 be proper to make some new experiments upon all these passions, as well
 as to recal a few of these observations, which I have formerly touched
 upon.
 
 In order to make these experiments, let us suppose I am in company with
 a person, whom I formerly regarded without any sentiments either of
 friendship or enmity. Here I have the natural and ultimate object of all
 these four passions placed before me. Myself am the proper object of
 pride or humility; the other person of love or hatred.
 
 Regard now with attention the nature of these passions, and their
 situation with respect to each other. It is evident here are four
 affections, placed, as it were, in a square or regular connexion with,
 and distance from each other. The passions of pride and humility, as
 well as those of love and hatred, are connected together by the identity
 of their object, which to the first set of passions is self, to the
 second some other person. These two lines of communication or connexion
 form two opposite sides of the square. Again, pride and love are
 agreeable passions; hatred and humility uneasy. This similitude of
 sensation betwixt pride and love, and that betwixt humility and hatred
 form a new connexion, and may be considered as the other two sides of
 the square. Upon the whole, pride is connected with humility, love
 with hatred, by their objects or ideas: Pride with love, humility with
 hatred, by their sensations or impressions.
 
 I say then, that nothing can produce any of these passions without
 bearing it a double relation, viz, of ideas to the object of the
 passion, and of sensation to the passion itself. This we must prove by
 our experiments. First Experiment. To proceed with the greater order
 in these experiments, let us first suppose, that being placed in the
 situation above-mentioned, viz, in company with some other person, there
 is an object presented, that has no relation either of impressions
 or ideas to any of these passions. Thus suppose we regard together an
 ordinary stone, or other common object, belonging to neither of us, and
 causing of itself no emotion, or independent pain and pleasure: It is
 evident such an object will produce none of these four passions. Let
 us try it upon each of them successively. Let us apply it to love, to
 hatred, to humility, to pride; none of them ever arises in the smallest
 degree imaginable. Let us change the object, as oft as we please;
 provided still we choose one, that has neither of these two relations.
 Let us repeat the experiment in all the dispositions, of which the mind
 is susceptible. No object, in the vast variety of nature, will, in any
 disposition, produce any passion without these relations.
 
 Second Experiment. Since an object, that wants both these relations
 can never produce any passion, let us bestow on it only one of these
 relations; and see what will follow. Thus suppose, I regard a stone or
 any common object, that belongs either to me or my companion, and by
 that means acquires a relation of ideas to the object of the passions:
 It is plain, that to consider the matter a priori, no emotion of any
 kind can reasonably be expected. For besides, that a relation of ideas
 operates secretly and calmly on the mind, it bestows an equal impulse
 towards the opposite passions of pride and humility, love and hatred,
 according as the object belongs to ourselves or others; which opposition
 of the passions must destroy both, and leave the mind perfectly free
 from any affection or emotion. This reasoning a priori is confirmed
 by experience. No trivial or vulgar object, that causes not a pain or
 pleasure, independent of the passion, will ever, by its property or
 other relations either to ourselves or others, be able to produce the
 affections of pride or humility, love or hatred.
 
 Third Experiment. It is evident, therefore, that a relation of ideas is
 not able alone to give rise to these affections. Let us now remove
 this relation, and in its stead place a relation of impressions, by
 presenting an object, which is agreeable or disagreeable, but has
 no relation either to ourself or companion; and let us observe the
 consequences. To consider the matter first a priori, as in the preceding
 experiment; we may conclude, that the object will have a small, but an
 uncertain connexion with these passions. For besides, that this relation
 is not a cold and imperceptible one, it has not the inconvenience of
 the relation of ideas, nor directs us with equal force to two contrary
 passions, which by their opposition destroy each other. But if we
 consider, on the other hand, that this transition from the sensation
 to the affection is not forwarded by any principle, that produces
 a transition of ideas; but, on the contrary, that though the one
 impression be easily transfused into the other, yet the change of
 objects is supposed contrary to all the principles, that cause a
 transition of that kind; we may from thence infer, that nothing will
 ever be a steady or durable cause of any passion, that is connected with
 the passion merely by a relation of impressions. What our reason would
 conclude from analogy, after balancing these arguments, would be, that
 an object, which produces pleasure or uneasiness, but has no manner of
 connexion either with ourselves or others, may give such a turn to the
 disposition, as that may naturally fall into pride or love, humility or
 hatred, and search for other objects, upon which by a double relation,
 it can found these affections; but that an object, which has only one of
 these relations, though the most advantageous one, can never give rise
 to any constant and established passion.
 
 Most fortunately all this reasoning is found to be exactly conformable
 to experience, and the phaenomena of the passions. Suppose I were
 travelling with a companion through a country, to which we are both
 utter strangers; it is evident, that if the prospects be beautiful,
 the roads agreeable, and the inns commodious, this may put me into good
 humour both with myself and fellow-traveller. But as we suppose, that
 this country has no relation either to myself or friend it can never be
 the immediate cause of pride or love; and therefore if I found not the
 passion on some other object, that bears either of us a closer relation,
 my emotions are rather to be considerd as the overflowings of an elevate
 or humane disposition, than as an established passion. The case is the
 same where the object produces uneasiness.
 
 Fourth Experiment. Having found, that neither an object without any
 relation of ideas or impressions, nor an object, that has only one
 relation, can ever cause pride or humility, love or hatred; reason alone
 may convince us, without any farther experiment, that whatever has a
 double relation must necessarily excite these passions; since it is
 evident they must have some cause. But to leave as little room for doubt
 as possible, let us renew our experiments, and see whether the event in
 this case answers our expectation. I choose an object, such as virtue,
 that causes a separate satisfaction: On this object I bestow a relation
 to self; and find, that from this disposition of affairs, there
 immediately arises a passion. But what passion? That very one of pride,
 to which this object bears a double relation. Its idea is related
 to that of self, the object of the passion: The sensation it causes
 resembles the sensation of the passion. That I may be sure I am not
 mistaken in this experiment, I remove first one relation; then another;
 and find, that each removal destroys the passion, and leaves the object
 perfectly indifferent. But I am not content with this. I make a still
 farther trial; and instead of removing the relation, I only change
 it for one of a different kind. I suppose the virtue to belong to my
 companion, not to myself; and observe what follows from this alteration.
 I immediately perceive the affections wheel to about, and leaving pride,
 where there is only one relation, viz, of impressions, fall to the side
 of love, where they are attracted by a double relation of impressions
 and ideas. By repeating the same experiment, in changing anew the
 relation of ideas, I bring the affections back to pride; and by a new
 repetition I again place them at love or kindness. Being fully convinced
 of the influence of this relation, I try the effects of the other; and
 by changing virtue for vice, convert the pleasant impression, which
 arises from the former, into the disagreeable one, which proceeds from
 the latter. The effect still answers expectation. Vice, when placed
 on another, excites, by means of its double relations, the passion of
 hatred, instead of love, which for the same reason arises from virtue.
 To continue the experiment, I change anew the relation of ideas, and
 suppose the vice to belong to myself. What follows? What is usual. A
 subsequent change of the passion from hatred to humility. This humility
 I convert into pride by a new change of the impression; and find after
 all that I have compleated the round, and have by these changes brought
 back the passion to that very situation, in which I first found it.
 
 But to make the matter still more certain, I alter the object; and
 instead of vice and virtue, make the trial upon beauty and deformity,
 riches and poverty, power and servitude. Each of these objects runs
 the circle of the passions in the same manner, by a change of their
 relations: And in whatever order we proceed, whether through pride,
 love, hatred, humility, or through humility, hatred, love, pride, the
 experiment is not in the least diversifyed. Esteem and contempt, indeed,
 arise on some occasions instead of love and hatred; but these are at
 the bottom the same passions, only diversifyed by some causes, which we
 shall explain afterwards.
 
 Fifth Experiment. To give greater authority to these experiments, let
 us change the situation of affairs as much as possible, and place the
 passions and objects in all the different positions, of which they are
 susceptible. Let us suppose, beside the relations above-mentioned, that
 the person, along with whom I make all these experiments, is closely
 connected with me either by blood or friendship. He is, we shall
 suppose, my son or brother, or is united to me by a long and familiar
 acquaintance. Let us next suppose, that the cause of the passion
 acquires a double relation of impressions and ideas to this person; and
 let us see what the effects are of all these complicated attractions and
 relations.
 
 Before we consider what they are in fact, let us determine what they
 ought to be, conformable to my hypothesis. It is plain, that, according
 as the impression is either pleasant or uneasy, the passion of love or
 hatred must arise towards the person, who is thus connected to the cause
 of the impression by these double relations, which I have all along
 required. The virtue of a brother must make me love him; as his vice
 or infamy must excite the contrary passion. But to judge only from the
 situation of affairs, I should not expect, that the affections would
 rest there, and never transfuse themselves into any other impression. As
 there is here a person, who by means of a double relation is the object
 of my passion, the very same reasoning leads me to think the passion
 will be carryed farther. The person has a relation of ideas to myself,
 according to the supposition; the passion, of which he is the object, by
 being either agreeable or uneasy, has a relation of impressions to pride
 or humility. It is evident, then, that one of these passions must arise
 from the love or hatred.
 
 This is the reasoning I form in conformity to my hypothesis; and am
 pleased to find upon trial that every thing answers exactly to my
 expectation. The virtue or vice of a son or brother not only excites
 love or hatred, but by a new transition, from similar causes, gives rise
 to pride or humility. Nothing causes greater vanity than any shining
 quality in our relations; as nothing mortifies us more than their vice
 or infamy. This exact conformity of experience to our reasoning is
 a convincing proof of the solidity of that hypothesis, upon which we
 reason.
 
 Sixth Experiment. This evidence will be still augmented, if we reverse
 the experiment, and preserving still the same relations, begin only with
 a different passion. Suppose, that instead of the virtue or vice of a
 son or brother, which causes first love or hatred, and afterwards pride
 or humility, we place these good or bad qualities on ourselves,
 without any immediate connexion with the person, who is related to us:
 Experience shews us, that by this change of situation the whole chain is
 broke, and that the mind is not conveyed from one passion to another,
 as in the preceding instance. We never love or hate a son or brother
 for the virtue or vice we discern in ourselves; though it is evident
 the same qualities in him give us a very sensible pride or humility. The
 transition from pride or humility to love or hatred is not so natural
 as from love or hatred to pride or humility. This may at first sight be
 esteemed contrary to my hypothesis; since the relations of impressions
 and ideas are in both cases precisely the same. Pride and humility are
 impressions related to love and hatred. Myself am related to the person.
 It should, therefore, be expected, that like causes must produce like
 effects, and a perfect transition arise from the double relation, as in
 all other cases. This difficulty we may easily solve by the following
 reflections.
 
 It is evident, that as we are at all times intimately conscious of
 ourselves, our sentiments and passions, their ideas must strike upon us
 with greater vivacity than the ideas of the sentiments and passions of
 any other person. But every thing, that strikes upon us with vivacity,
 and appears in a full and strong light, forces itself, in a manner, into
 our consideration, and becomes present to the mind on the smallest hint
 and most trivial relation. For the same reason, when it is once present,
 it engages the attention, and keeps it from wandering to other
 objects, however strong may be their relation to our first object.
 The imagination passes easily from obscure to lively ideas, but with
 difficulty from lively to obscure. In the one case the relation is aided
 by another principle: In the other case, it is opposed by it.
 
 Now I have observed, that those two faculties of the mind, the
 imagination and passions, assist each other in their operations when
 their propensities are similar, and when they act upon the same object.
 The mind has always a propensity to pass from a passion to any other
 related to it; and this propensity is forwarded when the object of the
 one passion is related to that of the other. The two impulses concur
 with each other, and render the whole transition more smooth and easy.
 But if it should happen, that while the relation of ideas, strictly
 speaking, continues the same, its influence, in causing a transition
 of the imagination, should no longer take place, it is evident its
 influence on the passions must also cease, as being dependent entirely
 on that transition. This is the reason why pride or humility is not
 transfused into love or hatred with the same ease, that the latter
 passions are changed into the former. If a person be my brother I am
 his likewise: but though the relations be reciprocal they have very
 different effects on the imagination. The passage is smooth and open
 from the consideration of any person related to us to that of ourself,
 of whom we are every moment conscious. But when the affections are once
 directed to ourself, the fancy passes not with the same facility from
 that object to any other person, how closely so ever connected with us.
 This easy or difficult transition of the imagination operates upon the
 passions, and facilitates or retards their transition, which is a clear
 proof, that these two faculties of the passions and imagination are
 connected together, and that the relations of ideas have an influence
 upon the affections. Besides innumerable experiments that prove this,
 we here find, that even when the relation remains; if by any particular
 circumstance its usual effect upon the fancy in producing an association
 or transition of ideas, is prevented; its usual effect upon the
 passions, in conveying us from one to another, is in like manner
 prevented.
 
 Some may, perhaps, find a contradiction betwixt this phaenomenon
 and that of sympathy, where the mind passes easily from the idea of
 ourselves to that of any other object related to us. But this difficulty
 will vanish, if we consider that in sympathy our own person is not the
 object of any passion, nor is there any thing, that fixes our attention
 on ourselves; as in the present case, where we are supposed to be
 actuated with pride or humility. Ourself, independent of the perception
 of every other object, is in reality nothing: For which reason we must
 turn our view to external objects; and it is natural for us to consider
 with most attention such as lie contiguous to us, or resemble us. But
 when self is the object of a passion, it is not natural to quit the
 consideration of it, till the passion be exhausted: in which case the
 double relations of impressions and ideas can no longer operate.
 
 Seventh Experiment. To put this whole reasoning to a farther trial, let
 us make a new experiment; and as we have already seen the effects of
 related passions and ideas, let us here suppose an identity of passions
 along with a relation of ideas; and let us consider the effects of this
 new situation. It is evident a transition of the passions from the one
 object to the other is here in all reason to be expected; since the
 relation of ideas is supposed still to continue, and identity of
 impressions must produce a stronger connexion, than the most perfect
 resemblance, that can be imagined. If a double relation, therefore, of
 impressions and ideas is able to produce a transition from one to the
 other, much more an identity of impressions with a relation of ideas.
 Accordingly we find, that when we either love or hate any person,
 the passions seldom continue within their first bounds; but extend
 themselves towards all the contiguous objects, and comprehend the
 friends and relations of him we love or hate. Nothing is more natural
 than to bear a kindness to one brother on account of our friendship for
 another, without any farther examination of his character. A quarrel
 with one person gives us a hatred for the whole family, though entirely
 innocent of that, which displeases us. Instances of this kind are every
 where to be met with.
 
 There is only one difficulty in this experiment, which it will be
 necessary to account for, before we proceed any farther. It is evident,
 that though all passions pass easily from one object to another related
 to it, yet this transition is made with greater facility, where the more
 considerable object is first presented, and the lesser follows it, than
 where this order is reversed, and the lesser takes the precedence. Thus
 it is more natural for us to love the son upon account of the father,
 than the father upon account of the son; the servant for the master,
 than the master for the servant; the subject for the prince, than the
 prince for the subject. In like manner we more readily contract a hatred
 against a whole family, where our first quarrel is with the head of it,
 than where we are displeased with a son, or servant, or some inferior
 member. In short, our passions, like other objects, descend with greater
 facility than they ascend.
 
 That we may comprehend, wherein consists the difficulty of explaining
 this phaenomenon, we must consider, that the very same reason, which
 determines the imagination to pass from remote to contiguous objects,
 with more facility than from contiguous to remote, causes it likewise
 to change with more ease, the less for the greater, than the greater for
 the less. Whatever has the greatest influence is most taken notice of;
 and whatever is most taken notice of, presents itself most readily to
 the imagination. We are more apt to over-look in any subject, what is
 trivial, than what appears of considerable moment; but especially if the
 latter takes the precedence, and first engages our attention. Thus if
 any accident makes us consider the Satellites of JUPITER, our fancy is
 naturally determined to form the idea of that planet; but if we first
 reflect on the principal planet, it is more natural for us to overlook
 its attendants. The mention of the provinces of any empire conveys our
 thought to the seat of the empire; but the fancy returns not with the
 same facility to the consideration of the provinces. The idea of the
 servant makes us think of the master; that of the subject carries our
 view to the prince. But the same relation has not an equal influence
 in conveying us back again. And on this is founded that reproach of
 Cornelia to her sons, that they ought to be ashamed she should be more
 known by the title of the daughter of Scipio than by that of the mother
 of the Gracchi. This was, in other words, exhorting them to render
 themselves as illustrious and famous as their grandfather, otherwise the
 imagination of the people, passing from her who was intermediate,
 and placed in an equal relation to both, would always leave them, and
 denominate her by what was more considerable and of greater moment. On
 the same principle is founded that common custom of making wives bear
 the name of their husbands, rather than husbands that of their wives; as
 also the ceremony of giving the precedency to those, whom we honour and
 respect. We might find many other instances to confirm this principle,
 were it not already sufficiently evident.
 
 Now since the fancy finds the same facility in passing from the lesser
 to the greater, as from remote to contiguous, why does not this easy
 transition of ideas assist the transition of passions in the former
 case, as well as in the latter? The virtues of a friend or brother
 produce first love, and then pride; because in that case the imagination
 passes from remote to contiguous, according to its propensity. Our own
 virtues produce not first pride, and then love to a friend or brother;
 because the passage in that case would be from contiguous to remote,
 contrary to its propensity. But the love or hatred of an inferior causes
 not readily any passion to the superior, though that be the natural
 propensity of the imagination: While the love or hatred of a superior,
 causes a passion to the inferior, contrary to its propensity. In short,
 the same facility of transition operates not in the same manner
 upon superior and inferior as upon contiguous and remote. These two
 phaenomena appear contradictory, and require some attention to be
 reconciled.
 
 As the transition of ideas is here made contrary to the natural
 propensity of the imagination, that faculty must be overpowered by some
 stronger principle of another kind; and as there is nothing ever present
 to the mind but impressions and ideas, this principle must necessarily
 lie in the impressions. Now it has been observed, that impressions or
 passions are connected only by their resemblance, and that where any two
 passions place the mind in the same or in similar dispositions, it
 very naturally passes from the one to the other: As on the contrary, a
 repugnance in the dispositions produces a difficulty in the transition
 of the passions. But it is observable, that this repugnance may arise
 from a difference of degree as well as of kind; nor do we experience a
 greater difficulty in passing suddenly from a small degree of love to a
 small degree of hatred, than from a small to a great degree of either
 of these affections. A man, when calm or only moderately agitated, is so
 different, in every respect, from himself, when disturbed with a violent
 passion, that no two persons can be more unlike; nor is it easy to
 pass from the one extreme to the other, without a considerable interval
 betwixt them.
 
 The difficulty is not less, if it be not rather greater, in passing from
 the strong passion to the weak, than in passing from the weak to the
 strong, provided the one passion upon its appearance destroys the other,
 and they do not both of them exist at once. But the case is entirely
 altered, when the passions unite together, and actuate the mind at
 the same time. A weak passion, when added to a strong, makes not so
 considerable a change in the disposition, as a strong when added to a
 weak; for which reason there is a closer connexion betwixt the great
 degree and the small, than betwixt the small degree and the great.
 
 The degree of any passion depends upon the nature of its object; and an
 affection directed to a person, who is considerable in our eyes, fills
 and possesses the mind much more than one, which has for its object
 a person we esteem of less consequence. Here then the contradiction
 betwixt the propensities of the imagination and passion displays itself.
 When we turn our thought to a great and a small object, the imagination
 finds more facility in passing from the small to the great, than from
 the great to the small; but the affections find a greater difficulty:
 And as the affections are a more powerful principle than the
 imagination, no wonder they prevail over it, and draw the mind to their
 side. In spite of the difficulty of passing from the idea of great to
 that of little, a passion directed to the former, produces always
 a similar passion towards the latter; when the great and little are
 related together. The idea of the servant conveys our thought most
 readily to the master; but the hatred or love of the master produces
 with greater facility anger or good-will to the servant. The strongest
 passion in this case takes the precedence; and the addition of the
 weaker making no considerable change on the disposition, the passage is
 by that means rendered more easy and natural betwixt them.
 
 As in the foregoing experiment we found, that a relation of ideas,
 which, by any particular circumstance, ceases to produce its usual
 effect of facilitating the transition of ideas, ceases likewise to
 operate on the passions; so in the present experiment we find the same
 property of the impressions. Two different degrees of the same passion
 are surely related together; but if the smaller be first present, it
 has little or no tendency to introduce the greater; and that because the
 addition of the great to the little, produces a more sensible alteration
 on the temper, than the addition of the little to the great. These
 phaenomena, when duly weighed, will be found convincing proofs of this
 hypothesis.
 
 And these proofs will be confirmed, if we consider the manner in which
 the mind here reconciles the contradiction, I have observed betwixt the
 passions and the imagination. The fancy passes with more facility from
 the less to the greater, than from the greater to the less: But on the
 contrary a violent passion produces more easily a feeble, than that does
 a violent. In this opposition the passion in the end prevails over the
 imagination; but it is commonly by complying with it, and by seeking
 another quality, which may counter-ballance that principle, from whence
 the opposition arises. When we love the father or master of a family,
 we little think of his children or servants. But when these are present
 with us, or when it lies any ways in our power to serve them, the
 nearness and contiguity in this case encreases their magnitude, or at
 least removes that opposition, which the fancy makes to the transition
 of the affections. If the imagination finds a difficulty in passing from
 greater to less, it finds an equal facility in passing from remote to
 contiguous, which brings the matter to an equality, and leaves the way
 open from the one passion to the other.
 
 Eighth Experiment. I have observed that the transition from love or
 hatred to pride or humility, is more easy than from pride or humility to
 love or hatred; and that the difficulty, which the imagination finds in
 passing from contiguous to remote, is the cause why we scarce have any
 instance of the latter transition of the affections. I must, however,
 make one exception, viz, when the very cause of the pride and humility
 is placed in some other person. For in that case the imagination is
 necessitated to consider the person, nor can it possibly confine its
 view to ourselves. Thus nothing more readily produces kindness and
 affection to any person, than his approbation of our conduct and
 character: As on the other hand, nothing inspires us with a stronger
 hatred, than his blame or contempt. Here it is evident, that the
 original passion is pride or humility, whose object is self; and that
 this passion is transfused into love or hatred, whose object is some
 other person, notwithstanding the rule I have already established, THAT
 THE IMAGINATION PASSES WITH DIFFICULTY FROM CONTIGUOUS TO REMOTE.
 But the transition in this case is not made merely on account of the
 relation betwixt ourselves and the person; but because that very person
 is the real cause of our first passion, and of consequence is intimately
 connected with it. It is his approbation that produces pride; and
 disapprobation, humility. No wonder, then, the imagination returns back
 again attended with the related passions of love and hatred. This is
 not a contradiction, but an exception to the rule; and an exception that
 arises from the same reason with the rule itself.
 
 Such an exception as this is, therefore, rather a confirmation of
 the rule. And indeed, if we consider all the eight experiments I have
 explained, we shall find that the same principle appears in all of them,
 and that it is by means of a transition arising from a double relation
 of impressions and ideas, pride and humility, love and hatred are
 produced. An object without [First Experiment.] a relation, or [Second
 and Third Experiments] with but one, never produces either of these
 passions; and it is [Fourth Experiment.] found that the passion always
 varies in conformity to the relation. Nay we may observe, that where the
 relation, by any particular circumstance, has not its usual effect
 of producing a transition either of [Sixth Experiment.] ideas or of
 impressions, it ceases to operate upon the passions, and gives rise
 neither to pride nor love, humility nor hatred. This rule we find still
 to hold good [Seventh and Eighth Experiments.] even under the appearance
 of its contrary; and as relation is frequently experienced to have no
 effect; which upon examination is found to proceed from some particular
 circumstance, that prevents the transition; so even in instances, where
 that circumstance, though present, prevents not the transition, it is
 found to arise from some other circumstance, which counter-balances
 it. Thus not only the variations resolve themselves into the general
 principle, but even the variations of these variations.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. III DIFFICULTIES SOLVED
 
 
 After so many and such undeniable proofs drawn from daily experience
 and observation, it may seem superfluous to enter into a particular
 examination of all the causes of love and hatred. I shall, therefore,
 employ the sequel of this part, First, In removing some difficulties,
 concerning particular causes of these passions. Secondly, In examining
 the compound affections, which arise from the mixture of love and hatred
 with other emotions.
 
 Nothing is more evident, than that any person acquires our kindness, or
 is exposed to our ill-will, in proportion to the pleasure or uneasiness
 we receive from him, and that the passions keep pace exactly with the
 sensations in all their changes and variations. Whoever can find the
 means either by his services, his beauty, or his flattery, to render
 himself useful or agreeable to us, is sure of our affections: As on the
 other hand, whoever harms or displeases us never fails to excite our
 anger or hatred. When our own nation is at war with any other, we detest
 them under the character of cruel, perfidious, unjust and violent: But
 always esteem ourselves and allies equitable, moderate, and merciful. If
 the general of our enemies be successful, it is with difficulty we
 allow him the figure and character of a man. He is a sorcerer: He has a
 communication with daemons; as is reported of OLIVER CROMWELL, and the
 DUKE OF LUXEMBOURG: He is bloody-minded, and takes a pleasure in death
 and destruction. But if the success be on our side, our commander has
 all the opposite good qualities, and is a pattern of virtue, as well as
 of courage and conduct. His treachery we call policy: His cruelty is an
 evil inseparable from war. In short, every one of his faults we either
 endeavour to extenuate, or dignify it with the name of that virtue,
 which approaches it. It is evident the same method of thinking runs
 through common life.
 
 There are some, who add another condition, and require not only that
 the pain and pleasure arise from the person, but likewise that it arise
 knowingly, and with a particular design and intention. A man, who wounds
 and harms us by accident, becomes not our enemy upon that account, nor
 do we think ourselves bound by any ties of gratitude to one, who does
 us any service after the same manner. By the intention we judge of the
 actions, and according as that is good or bad, they become causes of
 love or hatred.
 
 But here we must make a distinction. If that quality in another, which
 pleases or displeases, be constant and inherent in his person and
 character, it will cause love or hatred independent of the intention:
 But otherwise a knowledge and design is requisite, in order to give rise
 to these passions. One that is disagreeable by his deformity or folly is
 the object of our aversion, though nothing be more certain, than that he
 has not the least intention of displeasing us by these qualities. But
 if the uneasiness proceed not from a quality, but an action, which
 is produced and annihilated in a moment, it is necessary, in order to
 produce some relation, and connect this action sufficiently with the
 person, that it be derived from a particular fore-thought and design. It
 is not enough, that the action arise from the person, and have him for
 its immediate cause and author. This relation alone is too feeble and
 inconstant to be a foundation for these passions. It reaches not the
 sensible and thinking part, and neither proceeds from any thing durable
 in him, nor leaves any thing behind it; but passes in a moment, and is
 as if it had never been. On the other hand, an intention shews certain
 qualities, which remaining after the action is performed, connect it
 with the person, and facilitate the transition of ideas from one to the
 other. We can never think of him without reflecting on these qualities;
 unless repentance and a change of life have produced an alteration
 in that respect: In which case the passion is likewise altered. This
 therefore is one reason, why an intention is requisite to excite either
 love or hatred.
 
 But we must farther consider, that an intention, besides its
 strengthening the relation of ideas, is often necessary to produce a
 relation of impressions, and give rise to pleasure and uneasiness. For
 it is observable, that the principal part of an injury is the contempt
 and hatred, which it shews in the person, that injures us; and without
 that, the mere harm gives us a less sensible uneasiness. In like manner,
 a good office is agreeable, chiefly because it flatters our vanity, and
 is a proof of the kindness and esteem of the person, who performs it.
 The removal of the intention, removes the mortification in the one
 case, and vanity in the other, and must of course cause a remarkable
 diminution in the passions of love and hatred.
 
 I grant, that these effects of the removal of design, in diminishing the
 relations of impressions and ideas, are not entire, nor able to remove
 every degree of these relations. But then I ask, if the removal of
 design be able entirely to remove the passion of love and hatred?
 Experience, I am sure, informs us of the contrary, nor is there any
 thing more certain, than that men often fall into a violent anger for
 injuries, which they themselves must own to be entirely involuntary and
 accidental. This emotion, indeed, cannot be of long continuance; but
 still is sufficient to shew, that there is a natural connexion betwixt
 uneasiness and anger, and that the relation of impressions will operate
 upon a very small relation of ideas. But when the violence of the
 impression is once a little abated, the defect of the relation begins to
 be better felt; and as the character of a person is no wise interested
 in such injuries as are casual and involuntary, it seldom happens that
 on their account, we entertain a lasting enmity.
 
 To illustrate this doctrine by a parallel instance, we may observe, that
 not only the uneasiness, which proceeds from another by accident, has
 but little force to excite our passion, but also that which arises
 from an acknowledged necessity and duty. One that has a real design of
 harming us, proceeding not from hatred and ill-will, but from justice
 and equity, draws not upon him our anger, if we be in any degree
 reasonable; notwithstanding he is both the cause, and the knowing cause
 of our sufferings. Let us examine a little this phaenomenon.
 
 It is evident in the first place, that this circumstance is not
 decisive; and though it may be able to diminish the passions, it is
 seldom it can entirely remove them. How few criminals are there, who
 have no ill-will to the person, that accuses them, or to the judge, that
 condemns them, even though they be conscious of their own deserts? In
 like manner our antagonist in a law-suit, and our competitor for
 any office, are commonly regarded as our enemies; though we must
 acknowledge, if we would but reflect a moment, that their motive is
 entirely as justifiable as our own.
 
 Besides we may consider, that when we receive harm from any person, we
 are apt to imagine him criminal, and it is with extreme difficulty
 we allow of his justice and innocence. This is a clear proof, that,
 independent of the opinion of iniquity, any harm or uneasiness has a
 natural tendency to excite our hatred, and that afterwards we seek for
 reasons upon which we may justify and establish the passion. Here the
 idea of injury produces not the passion, but arises from it.
 
 Nor is it any wonder that passion should produce the opinion of injury;
 since otherwise it must suffer a considerable diminution, which all the
 passions avoid as much as possible. The removal of injury may remove the
 anger, without proving that the anger arises only from the injury. The
 harm and the justice are two contrary objects, of which the one has a
 tendency to produce hatred, and the other love; and it is according
 to their different degrees, and our particular turn of thinking, that
 either of the objects prevails, and excites its proper passion.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. IV OF THE LOVE OF RELATIONS
 
 
 Having given a reason, why several actions, that cause a real pleasure
 or uneasiness, excite not any degree, or but a small one, of the passion
 of love or hatred towards the actors; it will be necessary to shew,
 wherein consists the pleasure or uneasiness of many objects, which we
 find by experience to produce these passions.
 
 According to the preceding system there is always required a double
 relation of impressions and ideas betwixt the cause and effect, in order
 to produce either love or hatred. But though this be universally true,
 it is remarkable that the passion of love may be excited by only one
 relation of a different kind, viz, betwixt ourselves and the object; or
 more properly speaking, that this relation is always attended with both
 the others. Whoever is united to us by any connexion is always sure of a
 share of our love, proportioned to the connexion, without enquiring into
 his other qualities. Thus the relation of blood produces the strongest
 tie the mind is capable of in the love of parents to their children, and
 a lesser degree of the same affection, as the relation lessens. Nor
 has consanguinity alone this effect, but any other relation without
 exception. We love our country-men, our neighbours, those of the same
 trade, profession, and even name with ourselves. Every one of these
 relations is esteemed some tie, and gives a title to a share of our
 affection.
 
 There is another phaenomenon, which is parallel to this, viz, that
 acquaintance, without any kind of relation, gives rise to love and
 kindness. When we have contracted a habitude and intimacy with any
 person; though in frequenting his company we have not been able to
 discover any very valuable quality, of which he is possessed; yet we
 cannot forebear preferring him to strangers, of whose superior merit we
 are fully convinced. These two phaenomena of the effects of relation
 and acquaintance will give mutual light to each other, and may be both
 explained from the same principle.
 
 Those, who take a pleasure in declaiming against human nature, have
 observed, that man is altogether insufficient to support himself; and
 that when you loosen all the holds, which he has of external objects,
 he immediately drops down into the deepest melancholy and despair.
 From this, say they, proceeds that continual search after amusement
 in gaming, in hunting, in business; by which we endeavour to forget
 ourselves, and excite our spirits from the languid state, into which
 they fall, when not sustained by some brisk and lively emotion. To
 this method of thinking I so far agree, that I own the mind to be
 insufficient, of itself, to its own entertainment, and that it naturally
 seeks after foreign objects, which may produce a lively sensation, and
 agitate the spirits. On the appearance of such an object it awakes, as
 it were, from a dream: The blood flows with a new tide: The heart is
 elevated: And the whole man acquires a vigour, which he cannot command
 in his solitary and calm moments. Hence company is naturally so
 rejoicing, as presenting the liveliest of all objects, viz, a rational
 and thinking Being like ourselves, who communicates to us all the
 actions of his mind; makes us privy to his inmost sentiments and
 affections; and lets us see, in the very instant of their production,
 all the emotions, which are caused by any object. Every lively idea
 is agreeable, but especially that of a passion, because such an idea
 becomes a kind of passion, and gives a more sensible agitation to the
 mind, than any other image or conception.
 
 This being once admitted, all the rest is easy. For as the company
 of strangers is agreeable to us for a short time, by inlivening our
 thought; so the company of our relations and acquaintance must be
 peculiarly agreeable, because it has this effect in a greater degree,
 and is of more durable influence. Whatever is related to us is conceived
 in a lively manner by the easy transition from ourselves to the related
 object. Custom also, or acquaintance facilitates the entrance, and
 strengthens the conception of any object. The first case is parallel to
 our reasonings from cause and effect; the second to education. And as
 reasoning and education concur only in producing a lively and strong
 idea of any object; so is this the only particular, which is common
 to relation and acquaintance. This must, therefore, be the influencing
 quality, by which they produce all their common effects; and love or
 kindness being one of these effects, it must be from the force and
 liveliness of conception, that the passion is derived. Such a conception
 is peculiarly agreeable, and makes us have an affectionate regard for
 every thing, that produces it, when the proper object of kindness and
 goodwill.
 
 It is obvious, that people associate together according to their
 particular tempers and dispositions, and that men of gay tempers
 naturally love the gay; as the serious bear an affection to the serious.
 This not only happens, where they remark this resemblance betwixt
 themselves and others, but also by the natural course of the
 disposition, and by a certain sympathy, which always arises betwixt
 similar characters. Where they remark the resemblance, it operates after
 the manner of a relation, by producing a connexion of ideas. Where
 they do not remark it, it operates by some other principle; and if this
 latter principle be similar to the former, it must be received as a
 confirmation of the foregoing reasoning.
 
 The idea of ourselves is always intimately present to us, and conveys a
 sensible degree of vivacity to the idea of any other object, to which we
 are related. This lively idea changes by degrees into a real impression;
 these two kinds of perception being in a great measure the same, and
 differing only in their degrees of force and vivacity. But this change
 must be produced with the greater ease, that our natural temper gives
 us a propensity to the same impression, which we observe in others,
 and makes it arise upon any slight occasion. In that case resemblance
 converts the idea into an impression, not only by means of the relation,
 and by transfusing the original vivacity into the related idea; but also
 by presenting such materials as take fire from the least spark. And as
 in both cases a love or affection arises from the resemblance, we may
 learn that a sympathy with others is agreeable only by giving an emotion
 to the spirits, since an easy sympathy and correspondent emotions are
 alone common to RELATION, ACQUAINTANCE, and RESEMBLANCE.
 
 The great propensity men have to pride may be considered as another
 similar phaenomenon. It often happens, that after we have lived a
 considerable time in any city; however at first it might be disagreeable
 to us; yet as we become familiar with the objects, and contact an
 acquaintance, though merely with the streets and buildings, the aversion
 diminishes by degrees, and at last changes into the opposite passion.
 The mind finds a satisfaction and ease in the view of objects, to which
 it is accustomed, and naturally prefers them to others, which, though,
 perhaps, in themselves more valuable, are less known to it. By the same
 quality of the mind we are seduced into a good opinion of ourselves, and
 of all objects, that belong to us. They appear in a stronger light; are
 more agreeable; and consequently fitter subjects of pride and vanity,
 than any other.
 
 It may not be amiss, in treating of the affection we bear our
 acquaintance and relations, to observe some pretty curious phaenomena,
 which attend it. It is easy to remark in common life, that children
 esteem their relation to their mother to be weakened, in a great
 measure, by her second marriage, and no longer regard her with the same
 eye, as if she had continued in her state of widow-hood. Nor does this
 happen only, when they have felt any inconveniences from her second
 marriage, or when her husband is much her inferior; but even without
 any of these considerations, and merely because she has become part of
 another family. This also takes place with regard to the second marriage
 of a father; but in a much less degree: And it is certain the ties of
 blood are not so much loosened in the latter case as by the marriage of
 a mother. These two phaenomena are remarkable in themselves, but much
 more so when compared.
 
 In order to produce a perfect relation betwixt two objects, it is
 requisite, not only that the imagination be conveyed from one to the
 other by resemblance, contiguity or causation, but also that it return
 back from the second to the first with the same ease and facility. At
 first sight this may seem a necessary and unavoidable consequence. If
 one object resemble another, the latter object must necessarily resemble
 the former. If one object be the cause of another, the second object is
 effect to its cause. It is the same case with contiguity: And therefore
 the relation being always reciprocal, it may be thought, that the return
 of the imagination from the second to the first must also, in every
 case, be equally natural as its passage from the first to the second.
 But upon farther examination we shall easily discover our mistake.
 For supposing the second object, beside its reciprocal relation to the
 first, to have also a strong relation to a third object; in that case
 the thought, passing from the first object to the second, returns not
 back with the same facility, though the relation continues the same; but
 is readily carryed on to the third object, by means of the new relation,
 which presents itself, and gives a new impulse to the imagination. This
 new relation, therefore, weakens the tie betwixt the first and second
 objects. The fancy is by its very nature wavering and inconstant; and
 considers always two objects as more strongly related together, where it
 finds the passage equally easy both in going and returning, than where
 the transition is easy only in one of these motions. The double motion
 is a kind of a double tie, and binds the objects together in the closest
 and most intimate manner.
 
 The second marriage of a mother breaks not the relation of child and
 parent; and that relation suffices to convey my imagination from myself
 to her with the greatest ease and facility. But after the imagination is
 arrived at this point of view, it finds its object to be surrounded with
 so many other relations, which challenge its regard, that it knows not
 which to prefer, and is at a loss what new object to pitch upon. The
 ties of interest and duty bind her to another family, and prevent that
 return of the fancy from her to myself, which is necessary to support
 the union. The thought has no longer the vibration, requisite to set it
 perfectly at ease, and indulge its inclination to change. It goes with
 facility, but returns with difficulty; and by that interruption finds
 the relation much weakened from what it would be were the passage open
 and easy on both sides.
 
 Now to give a reason, why this effect follows not in the same degree
 upon the second marriage of a father: we may reflect on what has been
 proved already, that though the imagination goes easily from the view of
 a lesser object to that of a greater, yet it returns not with the same
 facility from the greater to the less. When my imagination goes from
 myself to my father, it passes not so readily from him to his second
 wife, nor considers him as entering into a different family, but as
 continuing the head of that family, of which I am myself a part. His
 superiority prevents the easy transition of the thought from him to his
 spouse, but keeps the passage still open for a return to myself along
 the same relation of child and parent. He is not sunk in the new
 relation he acquires; so that the double motion or vibration of thought
 is still easy and natural. By this indulgence of the fancy in its
 inconstancy, the tie of child and parent still preserves its full force
 and influence. A mother thinks not her tie to a son weakened, because it
 is shared with her husband: Nor a son his with a parent, because it is
 shared with a brother. The third object is here related to the first, as
 well as to the second; so that the imagination goes and comes along all
 of them with the greatest facility.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. V OF OUR ESTEEM FOR THE RICH AND POWERFUL
 
 
 Nothing has a greater tendency to give us an esteem for any person, than
 his power and riches; or a contempt, than his poverty and meanness:
 And as esteem and contempt are to be considered as species of love and
 hatred, it will be proper in this place to explain these phaenomena.
 
 Here it happens most fortunately, that the greatest difficulty is not to
 discover a principle capable of producing such an effect, but to choose
 the chief and predominant among several, that present themselves. The
 satisfaction we take in the riches of others, and the esteem we have for
 the possessors may be ascribed to three different causes. FIRST, To the
 objects they possess; such as houses, gardens, equipages; which, being
 agreeable in themselves, necessarily produce a sentiment of pleasure
 in every one; that either considers or surveys them. SECONDLY, To the
 expectation of advantage from the rich and powerful by our sharing
 their possessions. THIRDLY, To sympathy, which makes us partake of the
 satisfaction of every one, that approaches us. All these principles may
 concur in producing the present phaenomenon. The question is, to which
 of them we ought principally to ascribe it.
 
 It is certain, that the first principle, viz, the reflection on
 agreeable objects, has a greater influence, than what, at first sight,
 we may be apt to imagine. We seldom reflect on what is beautiful or
 ugly, agreeable or disagreeable, without an emotion of pleasure or
 uneasiness; and though these sensations appear not much in our common
 indolent way of thinking, it is easy, either in reading or conversation,
 to discover them. Men of wit always turn the discourse on subjects that
 are entertaining to the imagination; and poets never present any objects
 but such as are of the same nature. Mr Philips has chosen CYDER for the
 subject of an excellent poem. Beer would not have been so proper, as
 being neither so agreeable to the taste nor eye. But he would certainly
 have preferred wine to either of them, coued his native country have
 afforded him so agreeable a liquor. We may learn from thence, that
 every thing, which is agreeable to the senses, is also in some measure
 agreeable to the fancy, and conveys to the thought an image of that
 satisfaction, which it gives by its real application to the bodily
 organs.
 
 But though these reasons may induce us to comprehend this delicacy of
 the imagination among the causes of the respect, which we pay the
 rich and powerful, there are many other reasons, that may keep us from
 regarding it as the sole or principal. For as the ideas of pleasure
 can have an influence only by means of their vivacity, which makes them
 approach impressions, it is most natural those ideas should have that
 influence, which are favoured by most circumstances, and have a natural
 tendency to become strong and lively; such as our ideas of the passions
 and sensations of any human creature. Every human creature resembles
 ourselves, and by that means has an advantage above any other object, in
 operating on the imagination.
 
 Besides, if we consider the nature of that faculty, and the great
 influence which all relations have upon it, we shall easily be
 persuaded, that however the ideas of the pleasant wines, music, or
 gardens, which the rich man enjoys, may become lively and agreeable, the
 fancy will not confine itself to them, but will carry its view to the
 related objects; and in particular, to the person, who possesses them.
 And this is the more natural, that the pleasant idea or image produces
 here a passion towards the person, by means of his relation to the
 object; so that it is unavoidable but he must enter into the original
 conception, since he makes the object of the derivative passion: But if
 he enters into the original conception, and is considered as enjoying
 these agreeable objects, it is sympathy, which is properly the cause of
 the affection; and the third principle is more powerful and universal
 than the first.
 
 Add to this, that riches and power alone, even though unemployed,
 naturally cause esteem and respect: And consequently these passions
 arise not from the idea of any beautiful or agreeable objects. It is
 true; money implies a kind of representation of such objects, by the
 power it affords of obtaining them; and for that reason may still be
 esteemed proper to convey those agreeable images, which may give rise
 to the passion. But as this prospect is very distant, it is more natural
 for us to take a contiguous object, viz, the satisfaction, which this
 power affords the person, who is possest of it. And of this we shall be
 farther satisfyed, if we consider, that riches represent the goods of
 life, only by means of the will; which employs them; and therefore imply
 in their very nature an idea of the person, and cannot be considered
 without a kind of sympathy with his sensations and enjoyments.
 
 This we may confirm by a reflection, which to some will, perhaps,
 appear too subtile and refined. I have already observed, that power,
 as distinguished from its exercise, has either no meaning at all, or
 is nothing but a possibility or probability of existence; by which any
 object approaches to reality, and has a sensible influence on the mind.
 I have also observed, that this approach, by an illusion of the fancy,
 appears much greater, when we ourselves are possest of the power, than
 when it is enjoyed by another; and that in the former case the objects
 seem to touch upon the very verge of reality, and convey almost an equal
 satisfaction, as if actually in our possession. Now I assert, that where
 we esteem a person upon account of his riches, we must enter into this
 sentiment of the proprietor, and that without such a sympathy the idea
 of the agreeable objects, which they give him the power to produce,
 would have but a feeble influence upon us. An avaritious man is
 respected for his money, though he scarce is possest of a power; that
 is, there scarce is a probability or even possibility of his employing
 it in the acquisition of the pleasures and conveniences of life. To
 himself alone this power seems perfect and entire; and therefore we must
 receive his sentiments by sympathy, before we can have a strong intense
 idea of these enjoyments, or esteem him upon account of them.
 
 Thus we have found, that the first principle, viz, the agreeable idea of
 those objects, which riches afford the enjoyment of; resolves itself in
 a great measure into the third, and becomes a sympathy with the person
 we esteem or love. Let us now examine the second principle, viz, the
 agreeable expectation of advantage, and see what force we may justly
 attribute to it.
 
 It is obvious, that though riches and authority undoubtedly give
 their owner a power of doing us service, yet this power is not to be
 considered as on the same footing with that, which they afford him, of
 pleasing himself, and satisfying his own appetites. Self-love approaches
 the power and exercise very near each other in the latter case; but
 in order to produce a similar effect in the former, we must suppose a
 friendship and good-will to be conjoined with the riches. Without that
 circumstance it is difficult to conceive on what we can found our hope
 of advantage from the riches of others, though there is nothing more
 certain, than that we naturally esteem and respect the rich, even before
 we discover in them any such favourable disposition towards us.
 
 But I carry this farther, and observe, not only that we respect the rich
 and powerful, where they shew no inclination to serve us, but also when
 we lie so much out of the sphere of their activity, that they cannot
 even be supposed to be endowed with that power. Prisoners of war are
 always treated with a respect suitable to their condition; and it is
 certain riches go very far towards fixing the condition of any person.
 If birth and quality enter for a share, this still affords us an
 argument of the same kind. For what is it we call a man of birth,
 but one who is descended from a long succession of rich and powerful
 ancestors, and who acquires our esteem by his relation to persons whom
 we esteem? His ancestors, therefore, though dead, are respected, in some
 measure, on account of their riches, and consequently without any kind
 of expectation.
 
 But not to go so far as prisoners of war and the dead to find instances
 of this disinterested esteem for riches, let us observe with a
 little attention those phaenomena that occur to us in common life and
 conversation. A man, who is himself of a competent fortune, upon coming
 into a company of strangers, naturally treats them with different
 degrees of respect and deference, as he is informed of their different
 fortunes and conditions; though it is impossible he can ever propose,
 and perhaps would not accept of any advantage from them. A traveller is
 always admitted into company, and meets with civility, in proportion as
 his train and equipage speak him a man of great or moderate fortune. In
 short, the different ranks of men are, in a great measure, regulated
 by riches, and that with regard to superiors as well as inferiors,
 strangers as well as acquaintance.
 
 There is, indeed, an answer to these arguments, drawn from the influence
 of general rules. It may be pretended, that being accustomed to expect
 succour and protection from the rich and powerful, and to esteem them
 upon that account, we extend the same sentiments to those, who
 resemble them in their fortune, but from whom we can never hope for any
 advantage. The general rule still prevails, and by giving a bent to the
 imagination draws along the passion, in the same manner as if its proper
 object were real and existent.
 
 But that this principle does not here take place, will easily appear,
 if we consider, that in order to establish a general rule, and extend it
 beyond its proper bounds, there is required a certain uniformity in
 our experience, and a great superiority of those instances, which are
 conformable to the rule, above the contrary. But here the case is quite
 otherwise. Of a hundred men of credit and fortune I meet with, there
 is not, perhaps, one from whom I can expect advantage; so that it is
 impossible any custom can ever prevail in the present case.
 
 Upon the whole, there remains nothing, which can give us an esteem for
 power and riches, and a contempt for meanness and poverty, except the
 principle of sympathy, by which we enter into the sentiments of the
 rich and poor, and partake of their pleasure and uneasiness. Riches give
 satisfaction to their possessor; and this satisfaction is conveyed to
 the beholder by the imagination, which produces an idea resembling
 the original impression in force and vivacity. This agreeable idea or
 impression is connected with love, which is an agreeable passion. It
 proceeds from a thinking conscious being, which is the very object of
 love. From this relation of impressions, and identity of ideas, the
 passion arises, according to my hypothesis.
 
 The best method of reconciling us to this opinion is to take a general
 survey of the universe, and observe the force of sympathy through the
 whole animal creation, and the easy communication of sentiments from one
 thinking being to another. In all creatures, that prey not upon others,
 and are not agitated with violent passions, there appears a remarkable
 desire of company, which associates them together, without any
 advantages they can ever propose to reap from their union. This is still
 more conspicuous in man, as being the creature of the universe, who
 has the most ardent desire of society, and is fitted for it by the most
 advantages. We can form no wish, which has not a reference to society.
 A perfect solitude is, perhaps, the greatest punishment we can suffer.
 Every pleasure languishes when enjoyed a-part from company, and every
 pain becomes more cruel and intolerable. Whatever other passions we may
 be actuated by; pride, ambition, avarice, curiosity, revenge or lust;
 the soul or animating principle of them all is sympathy; nor would
 they have any force, were we to abstract entirely from the thoughts and
 sentiments of others. Let all the powers and elements of nature conspire
 to serve and obey one man: Let the sun rise and set at his command: The
 sea and rivers roll as he pleases, and the earth furnish spontaneously
 whatever may be useful or agreeable to him: He will still be miserable,
 till you give him some one person at least, with whom he may share his
 happiness, and whose esteem and friendship he may enjoy.
 
 This conclusion from a general view of human nature, we may confirm by
 particular instances, wherein the force of sympathy is very remarkable.
 Most kinds of beauty are derived from this origin; and though our first
 object be some senseless inanimate piece of matter, it is seldom we rest
 there, and carry not our view to its influence on sensible and rational
 creatures. A man, who shews us any house or building, takes particular
 care among other things to point out the convenience of the apartments,
 the advantages of their situation, and the little room lost in the
 stairs, antichambers and passages; and indeed it is evident, the chief
 part of the beauty consists in these particulars. The observation of
 convenience gives pleasure, since convenience is a beauty. But after
 what manner does it give pleasure? It is certain our own interest is
 not in the least concerned; and as this is a beauty of interest, not of
 form, so to speak, it must delight us merely by communication, and by
 our sympathizing with the proprietor of the lodging. We enter into his
 interest by the force of imagination, and feel the same satisfaction,
 that the objects naturally occasion in him.
 
 This observation extends to tables, chairs, scritoires, chimneys,
 coaches, sadles, ploughs, and indeed to every work of art; it being an
 universal rule, that their beauty is chiefly derived from their utility,
 and from their fitness for that purpose, to which they are destined.
 But this is an advantage, that concerns only the owner, nor is there any
 thing but sympathy, which can interest the spectator.
 
 It is evident, that nothing renders a field more agreeable than its
 fertility, and that scarce any advantages of ornament or situation will
 be able to equal this beauty. It is the same case with particular trees
 and plants, as with the field on which they grow. I know not but a
 plain, overgrown with furze and broom, may be, in itself, as beautiful
 as a hill covered with vines or olive-trees; though it will never appear
 so to one, who is acquainted with the value of each. But this is a
 beauty merely of imagination, and has no foundation in what appears to
 the senses. Fertility and value have a plain reference to use; and
 that to riches, joy, and plenty; in which though we have no hope of
 partaking, yet we enter into them by the vivacity of the fancy, and
 share them, in some measure, with the proprietor.
 
 There is no rule in painting more reasonable than that of ballancing the
 figures, and placing them with the greatest exactness on their proper
 centers of gravity. A figure, which is not justly ballanced, is
 disagreeable; and that because it conveys the ideas of its fall, of
 harm, and of pain: Which ideas are painful, when by sympathy they
 acquire any degree of force and vivacity.
 
 Add to this, that the principal part of personal beauty is an air
 of health and vigour, and such a construction of members as promises
 strength and activity. This idea of beauty cannot be accounted for but
 by sympathy.
 
 In general we may remark, that the minds of men are mirrors to one
 another, not only because they reflect each others emotions, but also
 because those rays of passions, sentiments and opinions may be often
 reverberated, and may decay away by insensible degrees. Thus the
 pleasure, which a rich man receives from his possessions, being thrown
 upon the beholder, causes a pleasure and esteem; which sentiments again,
 being perceived and sympathized with, encrease the pleasure of the
 possessor; and being once more reflected, become a new foundation for
 pleasure and esteem in the beholder. There is certainly an original
 satisfaction in riches derived from that power, which they bestow, of
 enjoying all the pleasures of life; and as this is their very nature and
 essence, it must be the first source of all the passions, which arise
 from them. One of the most considerable of these passions is that of
 love or esteem in others, which therefore proceeds from a sympathy with
 the pleasure of the possessor. But the possessor has also a secondary
 satisfaction in riches arising from the love and esteem he acquires by
 them, and this satisfaction is nothing but a second reflexion of
 that original pleasure, which proceeded from himself. This secondary
 satisfaction or vanity becomes one of the principal recommendations
 of riches, and is the chief reason, why we either desire them for
 ourselves, or esteem them in others. Here then is a third rebound of the
 original pleasure; after which it is difficult to distinguish the images
 and reflexions, by reason of their faintness and confusion.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VI OF BENEVOLENCE AND ANGER
 
 
 Ideas may be compared to the extension and solidity of matter, and
 impressions, especially reflective ones, to colours, tastes, smells and
 other sensible qualities. Ideas never admit of a total union, but are
 endowed with a kind of impenetrability, by which they exclude each
 other, and are capable of forming a compound by their conjunction,
 not by their mixture. On the other hand, impressions and passions are
 susceptible of an entire union; and like colours, may be blended so
 perfectly together, that each of them may lose itself, and contribute
 only to vary that uniform impression, which arises from the whole. Some
 of the most curious phaenomena of the human mind are derived from this
 property of the passions.
 
 In examining those ingredients, which are capable of uniting with love
 and hatred, I begin to be sensible, in some measure, of a misfortune,
 that has attended every system of philosophy, with which the world has
 been yet acquainted. It is commonly found, that in accounting for the
 operations of nature by any particular hypothesis; among a number
 of experiments, that quadrate exactly with the principles we would
 endeavour to establish; there is always some phaenomenon, which is more
 stubborn, and will not so easily bend to our purpose. We need not be
 surprized, that this should happen in natural philosophy. The essence
 and composition of external bodies are so obscure, that we must
 necessarily, in our reasonings, or rather conjectures concerning
 them, involve ourselves in contradictions and absurdities. But as
 the perceptions of the mind are perfectly known, and I have used all
 imaginable caution in forming conclusions concerning them, I have always
 hoped to keep clear of those contradictions, which have attended every
 other system. Accordingly the difficulty, which I have at present in
 my eye, is nowise contrary to my system; but only departs a little from
 that simplicity, which has been hitherto its principal force and beauty.
 
 The passions of love and hatred are always followed by, or rather
 conjoined with benevolence and anger. It is this conjunction, which
 chiefly distinguishes these affections from pride and humility. For
 pride and humility are pure emotions in the soul, unattended with any
 desire, and not immediately exciting us to action. But love and hatred
 are not compleated within themselves, nor rest in that emotion, which
 they produce, but carry the mind to something farther. Love is always
 followed by a desire of the happiness of the person beloved, and an
 aversion to his misery: As hatred produces a desire of the misery and
 an aversion to the happiness of the person hated. So remarkable a
 difference betwixt these two sets of passions of pride and humility,
 love and hatred, which in so many other particulars correspond to each
 other, merits our attention.
 
 The conjunction of this desire and aversion with love and hatred may be
 accounted for by two different hypotheses. The first is, that love and
 hatred have not only a cause, which excites them, viz, pleasure and
 pain; and an object, to which they are directed, viz, a person or
 thinking being; but likewise an end, which they endeavour to attain,
 viz, the happiness or misery of the person beloved or hated; all which
 views, mixing together, make only one passion. According to this system,
 love is nothing but the desire of happiness to another person, and
 hatred that of misery. The desire and aversion constitute the very
 nature of love and hatred. They are not only inseparable but the same.
 
 But this is evidently contrary to experience. For though it is certain
 we never love any person without desiring his happiness, nor hate any
 without wishing his misery, yet these desires arise only upon the ideas
 of the happiness or misery of our friend or enemy being presented by the
 imagination, and are not absolutely essential to love and hatred. They
 are the most obvious and natural sentiments of these affections, but not
 the only ones. The passions may express themselves in a hundred ways,
 and may subsist a considerable time, without our reflecting on the
 happiness or misery of their objects; which clearly proves, that these
 desires are not the same with love and hatred, nor make any essential
 part of them.
 
 We may, therefore, infer, that benevolence and anger are passions
 different from love and hatred, and only conjoined with them, by the
 original constitution of the mind. As nature has given to the body
 certain appetites and inclinations, which she encreases, diminishes,
 or changes according to the situation of the fluids or solids; she
 has proceeded in the same manner with the mind. According as we are
 possessed with love or hatred, the correspondent desire of the happiness
 or misery of the person, who is the object of these passions, arises
 in the mind, and varies with each variation of these opposite passions.
 This order of things, abstractedly considered, is not necessary. Love
 and hatred might have been unattended with any such desires, or their
 particular connexion might have been entirely reversed. If nature had
 so pleased, love might have had the same effect as hatred, and hatred as
 love. I see no contradiction in supposing a desire of producing misery
 annexed to love, and of happiness to hatred. If the sensation of the
 passion and desire be opposite, nature coued have altered the sensation
 without altering the tendency of the desire, and by that means made them
 compatible with each other.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VII OF COMPASSION
 
 
 But though the desire of the happiness or misery of others, according to
 the love or hatred we bear them, be an arbitrary and original instinct
 implanted in our nature, we find it may be counterfeited on many
 occasions, and may arise from secondary principles. Pity is a concern
 for, and malice a joy in the misery of others, without any friendship or
 enmity to occasion this concern or joy. We pity even strangers, and
 such as are perfectly indifferent to us: And if our ill-will to another
 proceed from any harm or injury, it is not, properly speaking, malice,
 but revenge. But if we examine these affections of pity and malice we
 shall find them to be secondary ones, arising from original affections,
 which are varied by some particular turn of thought and imagination.
 
 It will be easy to explain the passion of pity, from the precedent
 reasoning concerning sympathy. We have a lively idea of every thing
 related to us. All human creatures are related to us by resemblance.
 Their persons, therefore, their interests, their passions, their pains
 and pleasures must strike upon us in a lively manner, and produce an
 emotion similar to the original one; since a lively idea is easily
 converted into an impression. If this be true in general, it must be
 more so of affliction and sorrow. These have always a stronger and more
 lasting influence than any pleasure or enjoyment.
 
 A spectator of a tragedy passes through a long train of grief, terror,
 indignation, and other affections, which the poet represents in the
 persons he introduces. As many tragedies end happily, and no excellent
 one can be composed without some reverses of fortune, the spectator must
 sympathize with all these changes, and receive the fictitious joy as
 well as every other passion. Unless, therefore, it be asserted, that
 every distinct passion is communicated by a distinct original
 quality, and is not derived from the general principle of sympathy
 above-explained, it must be allowed, that all of them arise from
 that principle. To except any one in particular must appear highly
 unreasonable. As they are all first present in the mind of one person,
 and afterwards appear in the mind of another; and as the manner of their
 appearance, first as an idea, then as an impression, is in every case
 the same, the transition must arise from the same principle. I am
 at least sure, that this method of reasoning would be considered as
 certain, either in natural philosophy or common life.
 
 Add to this, that pity depends, in a great measure, on the contiguity,
 and even sight of the object; which is a proof, that it is derived from
 the imagination. Not to mention that women and children are most subject
 to pity, as being most guided by that faculty. The same infirmity, which
 makes them faint at the sight of a naked sword, though in the hands of
 their best friend, makes them pity extremely those, whom they find in
 any grief or affliction. Those philosophers, who derive this passion
 from I know not what subtile reflections on the instability of fortune,
 and our being liable to the same miseries we behold, will find this
 observation contrary to them among a great many others, which it were
 easy to produce.
 
 There remains only to take notice of a pretty remarkable phaenomenon
 of this passion; which is, that the communicated passion of sympathy
 sometimes acquires strength from the weakness of its original, and even
 arises by a transition from affections, which have no existence.
 Thus when a person obtains any honourable office, or inherits a great
 fortune, we are always the more rejoiced for his prosperity, the
 less sense he seems to have of it, and the greater equanimity and
 indifference he shews in its enjoyment. In like manner a man, who is
 not dejected by misfortunes, is the more lamented on account of his
 patience; and if that virtue extends so far as utterly to remove all
 sense of uneasiness, it still farther encreases our compassion. When a
 person of merit falls into what is vulgarly esteemed a great misfortune,
 we form a notion of his condition; and carrying our fancy from the cause
 to the usual effect, first conceive a lively idea of his sorrow, and
 then feel an impression of it, entirely over-looking that greatness of
 mind, which elevates him above such emotions, or only considering it so
 far as to encrease our admiration, love and tenderness for him. We find
 from experience, that such a degree of passion is usually connected with
 such a misfortune; and though there be an exception in the present
 case, yet the imagination is affected by the general rule, and makes
 us conceive a lively idea of the passion, or rather feel the passion
 itself, in the same manner, as if the person were really actuated by it.
 From the same principles we blush for the conduct of those, who behave
 themselves foolishly before us; and that though they shew no sense of
 shame, nor seem in the least conscious of their folly. All this proceeds
 from sympathy; but it is of a partial kind, and views its objects only
 on one side, without considering the other, which has a contrary effect,
 and would entirely destroy that emotion, which arises from the first
 appearance.
 
 We have also instances, wherein an indifference and insensibility under
 misfortune encreases our concern for the misfortunate, even though
 the indifference proceed not from any virtue and magnanimity. It is an
 aggravation of a murder, that it was committed upon persons asleep and
 in perfect security; as historians readily observe of any infant prince,
 who is captive in the hands of his enemies, that he is the more worthy
 of compassion the less sensible he is of his miserable condition. As we
 ourselves are here acquainted with the wretched situation of the person,
 it gives us a lively idea and sensation of sorrow, which is the passion
 that generally attends it; and this idea becomes still more lively,
 and the sensation more violent by a contrast with that security and
 indifference, which we observe in the person himself. A contrast of any
 kind never fails to affect the imagination, especially when presented by
 the subject; and it is on the imagination that pity entirely depends.
 
 
      [Footnote 11.  To prevent all ambiguity, I must observe,
      that where I oppose the imagination to the memory, I mean in
      general the faculty that presents our fainter ideas. In all
      other places, and particularly when it is opposed to the
      understanding, I understand the same faculty, excluding only
      our demonstrative and probable reasonings.]
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VIII OF MALICE AND ENVY
 
 
 We must now proceed to account for the passion of malice, which imitates
 the effects of hatred, as pity does those of love; and gives us a joy in
 the sufferings and miseries of others, without any offence or injury on
 their part.
 
 So little are men governed by reason in their sentiments and opinions,
 that they always judge more of objects by comparison than from their
 intrinsic worth and value. When the mind considers, or is accustomed
 to, any degree of perfection, whatever falls short of it, though really
 esteemable, has notwithstanding the same effect upon the passions; as
 what is defective and ill. This is an original quality of the soul, and
 similar to what we have every day experience of in our bodies. Let a man
 heat one band and cool the other; the same water will, at the same time,
 seem both hot and cold, according to the disposition of the different
 organs. A small degree of any quality, succeeding a greater, produces
 the same sensation, as if less than it really is, and even sometimes as
 the opposite quality. Any gentle pain, that follows a violent one, seems
 as nothing, or rather becomes a pleasure; as on the other hand a violent
 pain, succeeding a gentle one, is doubly grievous and uneasy.
 
 This no one can doubt of with regard to our passions and sensations. But
 there may arise some difficulty with regard to our ideas and objects.
 When an object augments or diminishes to the eye or imagination from a
 comparison with others, the image and idea of the object are still the
 same, and are equally extended in the retina, and in the brain or organ
 of perception. The eyes refract the rays of light, and the optic nerves
 convey the images to the brain in the very same manner, whether a great
 or small object has preceded; nor does even the imagination alter the
 dimensions of its object on account of a comparison with others. The
 question then is, how from the same impression and the same idea we can
 form such different judgments concerning the same object, and at one
 time admire its bulk, and at another despise its littleness. This
 variation in our judgments must certainly proceed from a variation
 in some perception; but as the variation lies not in the immediate
 impression or idea of the object, it must lie in some other impression,
 that accompanies it.
 
 In order to explain this matter, I shall just touch upon two principles,
 one of which shall be more fully explained in the progress of this
 treatise; the other has been already accounted for. I believe it may
 safely be established for a general maxim, that no object is presented
 to the senses, nor image formed in the fancy, but what is accompanyed
 with some emotion or movement of spirits proportioned to it; and however
 custom may make us insensible of this sensation and cause us to confound
 it with the object or idea, it will be easy, by careful and exact
 experiments, to separate and distinguish them. For to instance only in
 the cases of extension and number; it is evident, that any very bulky
 object, such as the ocean, an extended plain, a vast chain of mountains,
 a wide forest: or any very numerous collection of objects, such as an
 army, a fleet, a crowd, excite in the mind a sensible emotion; and that
 the admiration, which arises on the appearance of such objects, is one
 of the most lively pleasures, which human nature is capable of enjoying.
 Now as this admiration encreases or diminishes by the encrease or
 diminution of the objects, we may conclude, according to our foregoing
 [Book I. Part III. Sect. 15.] principles, that it is a compound effect,
 proceeding from the conjunction of the several effects, which arise from
 each part of the cause. Every part, then, of extension, and every unite
 of number has a separate emotion attending it; and though that emotion
 be not always agreeable, yet by its conjunction with others, and by its
 agitating the spirits to a just pitch, it contributes to the production
 of admiration, which is always agreeable. If this be allowed with
 respect to extension and number, we can make no difficulty with respect
 to virtue and vice, wit and folly, riches and poverty, happiness and
 misery, and other objects of that kind, which are always attended with
 an evident emotion.
 
 The second principle I shall take notice of is that of our adherence
 to general rules; which has such a mighty influence on the actions and
 understanding, and is able to impose on the very senses. When an object
 is found by-experience to be always accompanyed with another; whenever
 the first object appears, though changed in very material circumstances;
 we naturally fly to the conception of the second, and form an idea of it
 in as lively and strong a manner, as if we had infered its existence by
 the justest and most authentic conclusion of our understanding. Nothing
 can undeceive us, not even our senses, which, instead of correcting this
 false judgment, are often perverted by it, and seem to authorize its
 errors.
 
 The conclusion I draw from these two principles, joined to the influence
 of comparison above-mentioned, is very short and decisive. Every object
 is attended with some emotion proportioned to it; a great object with
 a great emotion, a small object with a small emotion. A great object,
 therefore, succeeding a small one makes a great emotion succeed a small
 one. Now a great emotion succeeding a small one becomes still greater,
 and rises beyond its ordinary proportion. But as there is a certain
 degree of an emotion, which commonly attends every magnitude of an
 object; when the emotion encreases, we naturally imagine that the object
 has likewise encreased. The effect conveys our view to its usual cause,
 a certain degree of emotion to a certain magnitude of the object; nor
 do we consider, that comparison may change the emotion without changing
 anything in the object. Those who are acquainted with the metaphysical
 part of optics and know how we transfer the judgments and conclusions
 of the understanding to the senses, will easily conceive this whole
 operation.
 
 But leaving this new discovery of an impression, that secretly attends
 every idea; we must at least allow of that principle, from whence the
 discovery arose, that objects appear greater or less by a comparison
 with others. We have so many instances of this, that it is impossible
 we can dispute its veracity; and it is from this principle I derive the
 passions of malice and envy.
 
 It is evident we must receive a greater or less satisfaction or
 uneasiness from reflecting on our own condition and circumstances,
 in proportion as they appear more or less fortunate or unhappy,
 in proportion to the degrees of riches, and power, and merit, and
 reputation, which we think ourselves possest of. Now as we seldom judge
 of objects from their intrinsic value, but form our notions of them
 from a comparison with other objects; it follows, that according as we
 observe a greater or less share of happiness or misery in others,
 we must make an estimate of our own, and feel a consequent pain or
 pleasure. The misery of another gives us a more lively idea of our
 happiness, and his happiness of our misery. The former, therefore,
 produces delight; and the latter uneasiness.
 
 Here then is a kind of pity reverst, or contrary sensations arising
 in the beholder, from those which are felt by the person, whom he
 considers. In general we may observe, that in all kinds of comparison an
 object makes us always receive from another, to which it is compared,
 a sensation contrary to what arises from itself in its direct and
 immediate survey. A small object makes a great one appear still greater.
 A great object makes a little one appear less. Deformity of itself
 produces uneasiness; but makes us receive new pleasure by its contrast
 with a beautiful object, whose beauty is augmented by it; as on the
 other hand, beauty, which of itself produces pleasure, makes us receive
 a new pain by the contrast with any thing ugly, whose deformity it
 augments. The case, therefore, must be the same with happiness and
 misery. The direct survey of another's pleasure naturally gives us
 plcasure, and therefore produces pain when cornpared with our own. His
 pain, considered in itself, is painful to us, but augments the idea of
 our own happiness, and gives us pleasure.
 
 Nor will it appear strange, that we may feel a reverst sensation from
 the happiness and misery of others; since we find the same comparison
 may give us a kind of malice against ourselves, and make us rejoice for
 our pains, and grieve for our pleasures. Thus the prospect of past pain
 is agreeable, when we are satisfyed with our present condition; as on
 the other hand our past pleasures give us uneasiness, when we enjoy
 nothing at present equal to them. The comparison being the same, as when
 we reflect on the sentiments of others, must be attended with the same
 effects.
 
 Nay a person may extend this malice against himself, even to his present
 fortune, and carry it so far as designedly to seek affliction, and
 encrease his pains and sorrows. This may happen upon two occasions.
 First, Upon the distress and misfortune of a friend, or person dear to
 him. Secondly, Upon the feeling any remorses for a crime, of which he
 has been guilty. It is from the principle of comparison that both these
 irregular appetites for evil arise. A person, who indulges himself
 in any pleasure, while his friend lies under affliction, feels the
 reflected uneasiness from his friend more sensibly by a comparison with
 the original pleasure, which he himself enjoys. This contrast, indeed,
 ought also to inliven the present pleasure. But as grief is here
 supposed to be the predominant passion, every addition falls to that
 side, and is swallowed up in it, without operating in the least upon the
 contrary affection. It is the same case with those penances, which men
 inflict on themselves for their past sins and failings. When a criminal
 reflects on the punishment he deserves, the idea of it is magnifyed by a
 comparison with his present ease and satisfaction; which forces him,
 in a manner, to seek uneasiness, in order to avoid so disagreeable a
 contrast.
 
 This reasoning will account for the origin of envy as well as of malice.
 The only difference betwixt these passions lies in this, that envy
 is excited by some present enjoyment of another, which by comparison
 diminishes our idea of our own: Whereas malice is the unprovoked desire
 of producing evil to another, in order to reap a pleasure from the
 comparison. The enjoyment, which is the object of envy, is commonly
 superior to our own. A superiority naturally seems to overshade us,
 and presents a disagreeable comparison. But even in the case of an
 inferiority, we still desire a greater distance, in order to augment,
 still more the idea of ourself. When this distance diminishes, the
 comparison is less to our advantage; and consequently gives us less
 pleasure, and is even disagreeable. Hence arises that species of envy,
 which men feel, when they perceive their inferiors approaching or
 overtaking them in the pursuits of glory or happiness. In this envy we
 may see the effects of comparison twice repeated. A man, who compares
 himself to his inferior, receives a pleasure from the comparison: And
 when the inferiority decreases by the elevation of the inferior, what
 should only have been a decrease of pleasure, becomes a real pain, by a
 new comparison with its preceding condition.
 
 It is worthy of observation concerning that envy, which arises from a
 superiority in others, that it is not the great disproportion betwixt
 ourself and another, which produces it; but on the contrary, our
 proximity. A common soldier bears no such envy to his general as to
 his sergeant or corporal; nor does an eminent writer meet with so great
 jealousy in common hackney scriblers, as in authors, that more
 nearly approach him. It may, indeed, be thought, that the greater
 the disproportion is, the greater must be the uneasiness from the
 comparison. But we may consider on the other hand, that the great
 disproportion cuts off the relation, and either keeps us from comparing
 ourselves with what is remote from us, or diminishes the effects of
 the comparison. Resemblance and proximity always produce a relation of
 ideas; and where you destroy these ties, however other accidents may
 bring two ideas together; as they have no bond or connecting quality
 to join them in the imagination; it is impossible they can remain long
 united, or have any considerable influence on each other.
 
 I have observed in considering the nature of ambition, that the great
 feel a double pleasure in authority from the comparison of their own
 condition with that of their slaves; and that this comparison has a
 double influence, because it is natural, and presented by the subject.
 When the fancy, in the comparison of objects, passes not easily from the
 one object to the other, the action of the mind is, in a great measure,
 broke, and the fancy, in considering the second object, begins, as it
 were, upon a new footing. The impression, which attends every object,
 seems not greater in that case by succeeding a less of the same kind;
 but these two impressions are distinct, and produce their distinct
 effects, without any communication together. The want of relation in the
 ideas breaks the relation of the impressions, and by such a separation
 prevents their mutual operation and influence.
 
 To confirm this we may observe, that the proximity in the degree of
 merit is not alone sufficient to give rise to envy, but must be assisted
 by other relations. A poet is not apt to envy a philosopher, or a poet
 of a different kind, of a different nation, or of a different age. All
 these differences prevent or weaken the comparison, and consequently the
 passion.
 
 This too is the reason, why all objects appear great or little, merely
 by a comparison with those of the same species. A mountain neither
 magnifies nor diminishes a horse in our eyes; but when a Flemish and
 a Welsh horse are seen together, the one appears greater and the other
 less, than when viewed apart.
 
 From the same principle we may account for that remark of historians,
 that any party in a civil war always choose to call in a foreign enemy
 at any hazard rather than submit to their fellow-citizens. Guicciardin
 applies this remark to the wars in Italy, where the relations betwixt
 the different states are, properly speaking, nothing but of name,
 language, and contiguity. Yet even these relations, when joined with
 superiority, by making the comparison more natural, make it likewise
 more grievous, and cause men to search for some other superiority, which
 may be attended with no relation, and by that means may have a less
 sensible influence on the imagination. The mind quickly perceives its
 several advantages and disadvantages; and finding its situation to be
 most uneasy, where superiority is conjoined with other relations, seeks
 its repose as much as possible, by their separation, and by breaking
 that association of ideas, which renders the comparison so much more
 natural and efficacious. When it cannot break the association, it feels
 a stronger desire to remove the superiority; and this is the reason why
 travellers are commonly so lavish of their praises to the Chinese and
 Persians, at the same time, that they depreciate those neighbouring
 nations, which may stand upon a foot of rivalship with their native
 country.
 
 These examples from history and common experience are rich and curious;
 but we may find parallel ones in the arts, which are no less remarkable.
 should an author compose a treatise, of which one part was serious and
 profound, another light and humorous, every one would condemn so strange
 a mixture, and would accuse him of the neglect of all rules of art and
 criticism. These rules of art are founded on the qualities of human
 nature; and the quality of human nature, which requires a consistency in
 every performance is that which renders the mind incapable of passing
 in a moment from one passion and disposition to a quite different
 one. Yet this makes us not blame Mr Prior for joining his Alma and his
 Solomon in the same volume; though that admirable poet has succeeded
 perfectly well in the gaiety of the one, as well as in the melancholy
 of the other. Even supposing the reader should peruse these two
 compositions without any interval, he would feel little or no difficulty
 in the change of passions: Why, but because he considers these
 performances as entirely different, and by this break in the ideas,
 breaks the progress of the affections, and hinders the one from
 influencing or contradicting the other?
 
 An heroic and burlesque design, united in one picture, would be
 monstrous; though we place two pictures of so opposite a character in
 the same chamber, and even close by each other, without any scruple or
 difficulty.
 
 In a word, no ideas can affect each other, either by comparison, or by
 the passions they separately produce, unless they be united together
 by some relation, which may cause an easy transition of the ideas, and
 consequently of the emotions or impressions, attending the ideas; and
 may preserve the one impression in the passage of the imagination to the
 object of the other. This principle is very remarkable, because it is
 analogous to what we have observed both concerning the understanding and
 the passions. Suppose two objects to be presented to me, which are not
 connected by any kind of relation. Suppose that each of these objects
 separately produces a passion; and that these two passions are in
 themselves contrary: We find from experience, that the want of relation
 in the objects or ideas hinders the natural contrariety of the passions,
 and that the break in the transition of the thought removes the
 affections from each other, and prevents their opposition. It is the
 same case with comparison; and from both these phaenomena we may safely
 conclude, that the relation of ideas must forward the transition of
 impressions; since its absence alone is able to prevent it, and to
 separate what naturally should have operated upon each other. When the
 absence of an object or quality re moves any usual or natural effect, we
 may certalnly conclude that its presence contributes to the production
 of the effect.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. IX OF THE MIXTURE OF BENEVOLENCE AND ANGER WITH COMPASSION AND MALICE
 
 
 Thus we have endeavoured to account for pity and malice. Both these
 affections arise from the imagination, according to the light, in which
 it places its object. When our fancy considers directly the sentiments
 of others, and enters deep into them, it makes us sensible of all the
 passions it surveys, but in a particular manner of grief or sorrow. On
 the contrary, when we compare the sentiments of others to our own, we
 feel a sensation directly opposite to the original one, viz. a joy from
 the grief of others, and a grief from their joy. But these are only the
 first foundations of the affections of pity and malice. Other passions
 are afterwards confounded with them. There is always a mixture of love
 or tenderness with pity, and of hatred or anger with malice. But it must
 be confessed, that this mixture seems at first sight to be contradictory
 to my system. For as pity is an uneasiness, and malice a joy, arising
 from the misery of others, pity should naturally, as in all other cases,
 produce hatred; and malice, love. This contradiction I endeavour to
 reconcile, after the following manner.
 
 In order to cause a transition of passions, there is required a double
 relation of impressions and ideas, nor is one relation sufficient to
 produce this effect. But that we may understand the full force of this
 double relation, we must consider, that it is not the present sensation
 alone or momentary pain or pleasure, which determines the character of
 any passion, but the whole bent or tendency of it from the beginning to
 the end. One impression may be related to another, not only when
 their sensations are resembling, as we have all along supposed in the
 preceding cases; but also when their im pulses or directions are similar
 and correspondent. This cannot take place with regard to pride and
 humility; because these are only pure sensations, without any direction
 or tendency to action. We are, therefore, to look for instances of
 this peculiar relation of impressions only in such affections, as are
 attended with a certain appetite or desire; such as those of love and
 hatred.
 
 Benevolence or the appetite, which attends love, is a desire of the
 happiness of the person beloved, and an aversion to his misery; as anger
 or the appetite, which attends hatred, is a desire of the misery of the
 person hated, and an aversion to his happiness. A desire, therefore,
 of the happiness of another, and aversion to his misery, are similar to
 benevolence; and a desire of his misery and aversion to his happiness
 are correspondent to anger. Now pity is a desire of happiness to
 another, and aversion to his misery; as malice is the contrary appetite.
 Pity, then, is related to benevolence; and malice to anger: And as
 benevolence has been already found to be connected with love, by a
 natural and original quality, and anger with hatred; it is by this chain
 the passions of pity and malice are connected with love and hatred.
 
 This hypothesis is founded on sufficient experience. A man, who from any
 motives has entertained a resolution of performing an action, naturally
 runs into every other view or motive, which may fortify that resolution,
 and give it authority and influence on the mind. To confirm us in any
 design, we search for motives drawn from interest, from honour, from
 duty. What wonder, then, that pity and benevolence, malice, and anger,
 being the same desires arising from different principles, should so
 totally mix together as to be undistinguishable? As to the connexion
 betwixt benevolence and love, anger and hatred, being original and
 primary, it admits of no difficulty.
 
 We may add to this another experiment, viz, that benevolence and anger,
 and consequently love and hatred, arise when our happiness or misery
 have any dependance on the happiness or misery of another person,
 without any farther relation. I doubt not but this experiment will
 appear so singular as to excuse us for stopping a moment to consider it.
 
 Suppose, that two persons of the same trade should seek employment in a
 town, that is not able to maintain both, it is plain the success of one
 is perfectly incompatible with that of the other, and that whatever is
 for the interest of either is contrary to that of his rival, and so vice
 versa. Suppose again, that two merchants, though living in different
 parts of the world, should enter into co-partnership together, the
 advantage or loss of one becomes immediately the advantage or loss of
 his partner, and the same fortune necessarily attends both. Now it
 is evident, that in the first case, hatred always follows upon the
 contrariety of interests; as in the second, love arises from their
 union. Let us consider to what principle we can ascribe these passions.
 
 It is plain they arise not from the double relations of impressions and
 ideas, if we regard only the present sensation. For takeing the first
 case of rivalship; though the pleasure and advantage of an antagonist
 necessarily causes my pain and loss, yet to counter-ballance this, his
 pain and loss causes my pleasure and advantage; and supposing him to be
 unsuccessful, I may by this means receive from him a superior degree of
 satisfaction. In the same manner the success of a partner rejoices me,
 but then his misfortunes afflict me in an equal proportion; and it
 is easy to imagine, that the latter sentiment may in many cases
 preponderate. But whether the fortune of a rival or partner be good or
 bad, I always hate the former and love the latter.
 
 This love of a partner cannot proceed from the relation or connexion
 betwixt us; in the same manner as I love a brother or countryman. A
 rival has almost as close a relation to me as a partner. For as the
 pleasure of the latter causes my pleasure, and his pain my pain; so the
 pleasure of the former causes my pain, and his pain my pleasure. The
 connexion, then, of cause and effect is the same in both cases; and
 if in the one case, the cause and effect have a farther relation of
 resemblance, they have that of contrariety in the other; which, being
 also a species of resemblance, leaves the matter pretty equal.
 
 The only explication, then, we can give of this phaenomenon is derived
 from that principle of a parallel direction above-mentioned. Our concern
 for our own interest gives us a pleasure in the pleasure, and a pain in
 the pain of a partner, after the same manner as by sympathy we feel a
 sensation correspondent to those, which appear in any person, who is
 present with us. On the other hand, the same concern for our interest
 makes us feel a pain in the pleasure, and a pleasure in the pain of a
 rival; and in short the same contrariety of sentiments as arises from
 comparison and malice. Since, therefore, a parallel direction of the
 affections, proceeding from interest, can give rise to benevolence or
 anger, no wonder the same parallel direction, derived from sympathy and
 from comparison, should have the same effect.
 
 In general we may observe, that it is impossible to do good to others,
 from whatever motive, without feeling some touches of kindness and
 good-will towards them; as the injuries we do, not only cause hatred in
 the person, who suffers them, but even in ourselves. These phaenomena,
 indeed, may in part be accounted for from other principles.
 
 But here there occurs a considerable objection, which it will be
 necessary to examine before we proceed any farther. I have endeavoured
 to prove, that power and riches, or poverty and meanness; which give
 rise to love or hatred, without producing any original pleasure or
 uneasiness; operate upon us by means of a secondary sensation derived
 from a sympathy with that pain or satisfaction, which they produce in
 the person, who possesses them. From a sympathy with his pleasure there
 arises love; from that with his uneasiness, hatred. But it is a maxim,
 which I have just now established, and which is absolutely necessary to
 the explication of the phaenomena of pity and malice, that it is not the
 present sensation or momentary pain or pleasure, which determines the
 character of any passion, but the general bent or tendency of it from
 the beginning to the end. For this reason, pity or a sympathy with
 pain produces love, and that because it interests us in the fortunes of
 others, good or bad, and gives us a secondary sensation correspondent
 to the primary; in which it has the same influence with love and
 benevolence. Since then this rule holds good in one case, why does it
 not prevail throughout, and why does sympathy in uneasiness ever produce
 any passion beside good-will and kindness? Is it becoming a philosopher
 to alter his method of reasoning, and run from one principle to its
 contrary, according to the particular phaenomenon, which he would
 explain?
 
 I have mentioned two different causes, from which a transition of
 passion may arise, viz, a double relation of ideas and impressions, and
 what is similar to it, a conformity in the tendency and direction of any
 two desires, which arise from different principles. Now I assert, that
 when a sympathy with uneasiness is weak, it produces hatred or contempt
 by the former cause; when strong, it produces love or tenderness by the
 latter. This is the solution of the foregoing difficulty, which seems so
 urgent; and this is a principle founded on such evident arguments, that
 we ought to have established it, even though it were not necessary to
 the explication of any phaenomenon.
 
 It is certain, that sympathy is not always limited to the present
 moment, but that we often feel by communication the pains and pleasures
 of others, which are not in being, and which we only anticipate by the
 force of imagination. For supposing I saw a person perfectly unknown to
 me, who, while asleep in the fields, was in danger of being trod under
 foot by horses, I should immediately run to his assistance; and in this
 I should be actuated by the same principle of sympathy, which makes me
 concerned for the present sorrows of a stranger. The bare mention of
 this is sufficient. Sympathy being nothing but a lively idea converted
 into an impression, it is evident, that, in considering the future
 possible or probable condition of any person, we may enter into it with
 so vivid a conception as to make it our own concern; and by that means
 be sensible of pains and pleasures, which neither belong to ourselves,
 nor at the present instant have any real existence.
 
 But however we may look forward to the future in sympathizing with any
 person, the extending of our sympathy depends in a great measure upon
 our sense of his present condition. It is a great effort of imagination,
 to form such lively ideas even of the present sentiments of others as
 to feel these very sentiments; but it is impossible we coued extend this
 sympathy to the future, without being aided by some circumstance in
 the present, which strikes upon us in a lively manner. When the present
 misery of another has any strong influence upon me, the vivacity of the
 conception is not confined merely to its immediate object, but diffuses
 its influence over all the related ideas, and gives me a lively notion
 of all the circumstances of that person, whether past, present, or
 future; possible, probable or certain. By means of this lively notion
 I am interested in them; take part with them; and feel a sympathetic
 motion in my breast, conformable to whatever I imagine in his. If I
 diminish the vivacity of the first conception, I diminish that of the
 related ideas; as pipes can convey no more water than what arises at
 the fountain. By this diminution I destroy the future prospect, which is
 necessary to interest me perfectly in the fortune of another. I may
 feel the present impression, but carry my sympathy no farther, and never
 transfuse the force of the first conception into my ideas of the related
 objects. If it be another's misery, which is presented in this feeble
 manner, I receive it by communication, and am affected with all the
 passions related to it: But as I am not so much interested as to
 concern myself in his good fortune, as well as his bad, I never feel the
 extensive sympathy, nor the passions related to it.
 
 Now in order to know what passions are related to these different kinds
 of sympathy, we must consider, that benevolence is an original pleasure
 arising from the pleasure of the person beloved, and a pain proceeding
 from his pain: From which correspondence of impressions there arises a
 subsequent desire of his pleasure, and aversion to his pain. In order,
 then, to make a passion run parallel with benevolence, it is requisite
 we should feel these double impressions, correspondent to those of the
 person, whom we consider; nor is any one of them alone sufficient for
 that purpose. When we sympathize only with one impression, and that
 a painful one, this sympathy is related to anger and to hatred, upon
 account of the uneasiness it conveys to us. But as the extensive or
 limited sympathy depends upon the force of the first sympathy; it
 follows, that the passion of love or hatred depends upon the same
 principle. A strong impression, when communicated, gives a double
 tendency of the passions; which is related to benevolence and love by a
 similarity of direction; however painful the first impression might have
 been. A weak impression, that is painful, is related to anger and hatred
 by the resemblance of sensations. Benevolence, therefore, arises from a
 great degree of misery, or any degree strongly sympathized with: Hatred
 or contempt from a small degree, or one weakly sympathized with; which
 is the principle I intended to prove and explain.
 
 Nor have we only our reason to trust to for this principle, but also
 experience. A certain degree of poverty produces contempt; but a degree
 beyond causes compassion and good-will. We may under-value a peasant
 or servant; but when the misery of a beggar appears very great, or
 is painted in very lively colours, we sympathize with him in his
 afflictions; and feel in our heart evident touches of pity and
 benevolence. The same object causes contrary passions according to its
 different degrees. The passions, therefore, must depend upon principles,
 that operate in such certain degrees, according to my hypothesis. The
 encrease of the sympathy has evidently the same effect as the encrease
 of the misery.
 
 A barren or desolate country always seems ugly and disagreeable, and
 commonly inspires us with contempt for the inhabitants. This deformity,
 however, proceeds in a great measure from a sympathy with the
 inhabitants, as has been already observed; but it is only a weak
 one, and reaches no farther than the immediate sensation, which is
 disagreeable. The view of a city in ashes conveys benevolent sentiments;
 because we there enter so deep into the interests of the miserable
 inhabitants, as to wish for their prosperity, as well as feel their
 adversity.
 
 But though the force of the impression generally produces pity and
 benevolence, it is certain, that by being carryed too far it ceases
 to have that effect. This, perhaps, may be worth our notice. When the
 uneasiness is either small in itself, or remote from us, it engages not
 the imagination, nor is able to convey an equal concern for the future
 and contingent good, as for the present and real evil Upon its acquiring
 greater force, we become so interested in the concerns of the person, as
 to be sensible both of his good and had fortune; and from that compleat
 sympathy there arises pity and benevolence. But it will easily be
 imagined, that where the present evil strikes with more than ordinary
 force, it may entirely engage our attention, and prevent that double
 sympathy, above-mentioned. Thus we find, that though every one, but
 especially women, are apt to contract a kindness for criminals, who go
 to the scaffold, and readily imagine them to be uncommonly handsome and
 wellshaped; yet one, who is present at the cruel execution of the rack,
 feels no such tender emotions; but is in a manner overcome with horror,
 and has no leisure to temper this uneasy sensation by any opposite
 sympathy.
 
 But the instance, which makes the most clearly for my hypothesis, is
 that wherein by a change of the objects we separate the double sympathy
 even from a midling degree of the passion; in which case we find, that
 pity, instead of producing love and tenderness as usual, always gives
 rise to the contrary affection. When we observe a person in misfortunes,
 we are affected with pity and love; but the author of that misfortune
 becomes the object of our strongest hatred, and is the more detested in
 proportion to the degree of our compassion. Now for what reason should
 the same passion of pity produce love to the person, who suffers the
 misfortune, and hatred to the person, who causes it; unless it be
 because in the latter case the author bears a relation only to the
 misfortune; whereas in considering the sufferer we carry our view on
 every side, and wish for his prosperity, as well as are sensible of his
 affliction?
 
 I. shall just observe, before I leave the present subject, that this
 phaenomenon of the double sympathy, and its tendency to cause love, may
 contribute to the production of the kindness, which we naturally bear
 our relations and acquaintance. Custom and relation make us enter deeply
 into the sentiments of others; and whatever fortune we suppose to attend
 them, is rendered present to us by the imagination, and operates as if
 originally our own. We rejoice in their pleasures, and grieve for their
 sorrows, merely from the force of sympathy. Nothing that concerns them
 is indifferent to us; and as this correspondence of sentiments is the
 natural attendant of love, it readily produces that affection.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. X OF RESPECT AND CONTEMPT
 
 
 There now remains only to explain the passion of respect and contempt,
 along with the amorous affection, in order to understand all the
 passions which have any mixture of love or hatred. Let us begin with
 respect and contempt.
 
 In considering the qualities and circumstances of others, we may either
 regard them as they really are in themselves; or may make a comparison
 betwixt them and our own qualities and circumstances; or may join these
 two methods of consideration. The good qualities of others, from the
 first point of view, produce love; from the second, humility; and from
 the third, respect; which is a mixture of these two passions. Their
 bad qualities, after the same manner, cause either hatred, or pride, or
 contempt, according to the light in which we survey them.
 
 That there is a mixture of pride in contempt, and of humility
 in respect, is, I think, too evident, from their very feeling or
 appearance, to require any particular proof. That this mixture arises
 from a tacit comparison of the person contemned or respected with
 ourselves is no less evident. The same man may cause either respect,
 love, or contempt by his condition and talents, according as the person,
 who considers him, from his inferior becomes his equal or superior. In
 changing the point of view, though the object may remain the same,
 its proportion to ourselves entirely alters; which is the cause of an
 alteration in the passions. These passions, therefore, arise from our
 observing the proportion; that is, from a comparison.
 
 I have already observed, that the mind has a much stronger propensity
 to pride than to humility, and have endeavoured, from the principles
 of human nature, to assign a cause for this phaenomenon. Whether my
 reasoning be received or not, the phaenomenon is undisputed, and appears
 in many instances. Among the rest, it is the reason why there is a much
 greater mixture of pride in contempt, than of humility in respect, and
 why we are more elevated with the view of one below us, than mortifyed
 with the presence of one above us. Contempt or scorn has so strong a
 tincture of pride, that there scarce is any other passion discernable:
 Whereas in esteem or respect, love makes a more considerable ingredient
 than humility. The passion of vanity is so prompt, that it rouzes at the
 least call; while humility requires a stronger impulse to make it exert
 itself.
 
 But here it may reasonably be asked, why this mixture takes place only
 in some cases, and appears not on every occasion. All those objects,
 which cause love, when placed on another person, are the causes of
 pride, when transfered to ourselves; and consequently ought to be causes
 of humility, as well as love, while they belong to others, and are only
 compared to those, which we ourselves possess. In like manner every
 quality, which, by being directly considered, produces hatred, ought
 always to give rise to pride by comparison, and by a mixture of these
 passions of hatred and pride ought to excite contempt or scorn. The
 difficulty then is, why any objects ever cause pure love or hatred, and
 produce not always the mixt passions of respect and contempt.
 
 I have supposed all along, that the passions of love and pride, and
 those of humility and hatred are similar in their sensations, and that
 the two former are always agreeable, and the two latter painful.
 But though this be universally true, it is observable, that the two
 agreeable, as well as the two painful passions, have some difference,
 and even contrarieties, which distinguish them. Nothing invigorates and
 exalts the mind equally with pride and vanity; though at the same time
 love or tenderness is rather found to weaken and infeeble it. The same
 difference is observable betwixt the uneasy passions. Anger and hatred
 bestow a new force on all our thoughts and actions; while humility and
 shame deject and discourage us. Of these qualities of the passions, it
 will be necessary to form a distinct idea. Let us remember, that pride
 and hatred invigorate the soul; and love and humility infeeble it.
 
 From this it follows, that though the conformity betwixt love and hatred
 in the agreeableness of their sensation makes them always be excited by
 the same objects, yet this other contrariety is the reason, why they are
 excited in very different degrees. Genius and learning are pleasant
 and magnificent objects, and by both these circumstances are adapted to
 pride and vanity; but have a relation to love by their pleasure only.
 Ignorance and simplicity are disagreeable and mean, which in the same
 manner gives them a double connexion with humility, and a single one
 with hatred. We may, therefore, consider it as certain, that though
 the same object always produces love and pride, humility and hatred,
 according to its different situations, yet it seldom produces either the
 two former or the two latter passions, in the same proportion.
 
 It is here we must seek for a solution of the difficulty
 above-mentioned, why any object ever excites pure love or hatred, and
 does not always produce respect or contempt, by a mixture of humility
 or pride. No quality in another gives rise to humility by comparison,
 unless it would have produced pride by being placed in ourselves; and
 vice versa no object excites pride by comparison, unless it would have
 produced humility by the direct survey. This is evident, objects always
 produce by comparison a sensation directly contrary to their original
 one. Suppose, therefore, an object to be presented, which is peculiarly
 fitted to produce love, but imperfectly to excite pride; this object,
 belonging to another, gives rise directly to a great degree of love, but
 to a small one of humility by comparison; and consequently that latter
 passion is scarce felt in the compound, nor is able to convert the love
 into respect. This is the case with good nature, good humour, facility,
 generosity, beauty, and many other qualities. These have a peculiar
 aptitude to produce love in others; but not so great a tendency to
 excite pride in ourselves: For which reason the view of them, as
 belonging to another person, produces pure love, with but a small
 mixture of humility and respect. It is easy to extend the same reasoning
 to the opposite passions.
 
 Before we leave this subject, it may not be amiss to account for a
 pretty curious phaenomenon, viz, why we commonly keep at a distance such
 as we contemn, and allow not our inferiors to approach too near even
 in place and situation. It has already been observed, that almost every
 kind of idea is attended with some emotion, even the ideas of number
 and extension, much more those of such objects as are esteemed of
 consequence in life, and fix our attention. It is not with entire
 indifference we can survey either a rich man or a poor one, but must
 feel some faint touches at least, of respect in the former case, and of
 contempt in the latter. These two passions are contrary to each other;
 but in order to make this contrariety be felt, the objects must be
 someway related; otherwise the affections are totally separate and
 distinct, and never encounter. The relation takes place wherever the
 persons become contiguous; which is a general reason why we are uneasy
 at seeing such disproportioned objects, as a rich man and a poor one, a
 nobleman and a porter, in that situation.
 
 This uneasiness, which is common to every spectator, must be more
 sensible to the superior; and that because the near approach of the
 inferior is regarded as a piece of ill-breeding, and shews that he is not
 sensible of the disproportion, and is no way affected by it. A sense
 of superiority in another breeds in all men an inclination to keep
 themselves at a distance from him, and determines them to redouble the
 marks of respect and reverence, when they are obliged to approach him;
 and where they do not observe that conduct, it is a proof they are not
 sensible of his superiority. From hence too it proceeds, that any great
 difference in the degrees of any quality is called a distance by a
 common metaphor, which, however trivial it may appear, is founded on
 natural principles of the imagination. A great difference inclines us to
 produce a distance. The ideas of distance and difference are, therefore,
 connected together. Connected ideas are readily taken for each other;
 and this is in general the source of the metaphor, as we shall have
 occasion to observe afterwards.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. XI OF THE AMOROUS PASSION, OR LOVE BETWIXT THE SEXES
 
 
 Of all the compound passions, which proceed from a mixture of love and
 hatred with other affections, no one better deserves our attention, than
 that love, which arises betwixt the sexes, as well on account of its
 force and violence, as those curious principles of philosophy, for
 which it affords us an uncontestable argument. It is plain, that this
 affection, in its most natural state, is derived from the conjunction
 of three different impressions or passions, viz. The pleasing sensation
 arising from beauty; the bodily appetite for generation; and a generous
 kindness or good-will. The origin of kindness from beauty may be
 explained from the foregoing reasoning. The question is how the bodily
 appetite is excited by it.
 
 The appetite of generation, when confined to a certain degree, is
 evidently of the pleasant kind, and has a strong connexion with, all the
 agreeable emotions. Joy, mirth, vanity, and kindness are all incentives
 to this desire; as well as music, dancing, wine, and good cheer. On the
 other hand, sorrow, melancholy, poverty, humility are destructive of it.
 From this quality it is easily conceived why it should be connected with
 the sense of beauty.
 
 But there is another principle that contributes to the same effect.
 I have observed that the parallel direction of the desires is a real
 relation, and no less than a resemblance in their sensation, produces
 a connexion among them. That we may fully comprehend the extent of this
 relation, we must consider, that any principal desire may be attended
 with subordinate ones, which are connected with it, and to which if
 other desires are parallel, they are by that means related to the
 principal one. Thus hunger may oft be considered as the primary
 inclination of the soul, and the desire of approaching the meat as the
 secondary one; since it is absolutely necessary to the satisfying that
 appetite. If an object, therefore, by any separate qualities, inclines
 us to approach the meat, it naturally encreases our appetite; as on the
 contrary, whatever inclines us to set our victuals at a distance, is
 contradictory to hunger, and diminishes our inclination to them. Now
 it is plain that beauty has the first effect, and deformity the second:
 Which is the reason why the former gives us a keener appetite for our
 victuals, and the latter is sufficient to disgust us at the most savoury
 dish that cookery has invented. All this is easily applicable to the
 appetite for generation.
 
 From these two relations, viz, resemblance and a parallel desire,
 there arises such a connexion betwixt the sense of beauty, the bodily
 appetite, and benevolence, that they become in a manner inseparable: And
 we find from experience that it is indifferent which of them advances
 first; since any of them is almost sure to be attended with the related
 affections. One, who is inflamed with lust, feels at least a momentary
 kindness towards the object of it, and at the same time fancies her more
 beautiful than ordinary; as there are many, who begin with kindness and
 esteem for the wit and merit of the person, and advance from that to the
 other passions. But the most common species of love is that which first
 arises from beauty, and afterwards diffuses itself into kindness and
 into the bodily appetite. Kindness or esteem, and the appetite to
 generation, are too remote to unite easily together. The one is,
 perhaps, the most refined passion of the soul; the other the most gross
 and vulgar. The love of beauty is placed in a just medium betwixt them,
 and partakes of both their natures: From whence it proceeds, that it is
 so singularly fitted to produce both.
 
 This account of love is not peculiar to my system, but is unavoidable
 on any hypothesis. The three affections, which compose this passion,
 are evidently distinct, and has each of them its distinct object. It is
 certain, therefore, that it is only by their relation they produce
 each other. But the relation of passions is not alone sufficient. It is
 likewise necessary, there should be a relation of ideas. The beauty
 of one person never inspires us with love for another. This then is a
 sensible proof of the double relation of impressions and ideas. From one
 instance so evident as this we may form a judgment of the rest.
 
 This may also serve in another view to illustrate what I have insisted
 on concerning the origin of pride and humility, love and hatred. I have
 observed, that though self be the object of the first set of passions,
 and some other person of the second, yet these objects cannot alone be
 the causes of the passions; as having each of them a relation to two
 contrary affections, which must from the very first moment destroy
 each other. Here then is the situation of the mind, as I have already
 described it. It has certain organs naturally fitted to produce a
 passion; that passion, when produced, naturally turns the view to a
 certain object. But this not being sufficient to produce the passion,
 there is required some other emotion, which by a double relation of
 impressions and ideas may set these principles in action, and bestow on
 them their first impulse. This situation is still more remarkable with
 regard to the appetite of generation. Sex is not only the object, but
 also the cause of the appetite. We not only turn our view to it, when
 actuated by that appetite; but the reflecting on it suffices to excite
 the appetite. But as this cause loses its force by too great frequency,
 it is necessary it should be quickened by some new impulse; and that
 impulse we find to arise from the beauty of the person; that is, from a
 double relation of impressions and ideas. Since this double relation is
 necessary where an affection has both a distinct cause, and object,
 how much more so, where it has only a distinct object, without any
 determinate cause?
 
 
 
 
 SECT. XII OF THE LOVE AND HATRED OF ANIMALS
 
 
 But to pass from the passions of love and hatred, and from their
 mixtures and compositions, as they appear m man, to the same affections,
 as they display themselves in brutes; we may observe, not only that love
 and hatred are common to the whole sensitive creation, but likewise that
 their causes, as above-explained, are of so simple a nature, that they
 may easily be supposed to operate on mere animals. There is no force of
 reflection or penetration required. Every thing is conducted by springs
 and principles, which are not peculiar to man, or any one species of
 animals. The conclusion from this is obvious in favour of the foregoing
 system.
 
 Love in animals, has not for its only object animals of the same
 species, but extends itself farther, and comprehends almost every
 sensible and thinking being. A dog naturally loves a man above his own
 species, and very commonly meets with a return of affection.
 
 As animals are but little susceptible either of the pleasures or pains
 of the imagination, they can judge of objects only by the sensible
 good or evil, which they produce, and from that must regulate their
 affections towards them. Accordingly we find, that by benefits or
 injuries we produce their love or hatred; and that by feeding and
 cherishing any animal, we quickly acquire his affections; as by beating
 and abusing him we never fail to draw on us his enmity and ill-will.
 
 Love in beasts is not caused so much by relation, as in our species;
 and that because their thoughts are not so active as to trace relations,
 except in very obvious instances. Yet it is easy to remark, that on some
 occasions it has a considerable influence upon them. Thus acquaintance,
 which has the same effect as relation, always produces love in animals
 either to men or to each other. For the same reason any likeness among
 them is the source of affection. An ox confined to a park with horses,
 will naturally join their company, if I may so speak, but always leaves
 it to enjoy that of his own species, where he has the choice of both.
 
 The affection of parents to their young proceeds from a peculiar
 instinct in animals, as well as in our species.
 
 It is evident, that sympathy, or the communication of passions, takes
 place among animals, no less than among men. Fear, anger, courage, and
 other affections are frequently communicated from one animal to another,
 without their knowledge of that cause, which produced the original
 passion. Grief likewise is received by sympathy; and produces almost all
 the same consequences, and excites the same emotions as in our species.
 The howlings and lamentations of a dog produce a sensible concern in
 his fellows. And it is remarkable, that though almost all animals use in
 play the same member, and nearly the same action as in fighting; a lion,
 a tyger, a cat their paws; an ox his horns; a dog his teeth; a horse
 his heels: Yet they most carefully avoid harming their companion,
 even though they have nothing to fear from his resentment; which is
 an evident proof of the sense brutes have of each other's pain and
 pleasure.
 
 Every one has observed how much more dogs are animated when they hunt in
 a pack, than when they pursue their game apart; and it is evident this
 can proceed from nothing but from sympathy. It is also well known to
 hunters, that this effect follows in a greater degree, and even in
 too great a degree, where two packs, that are strangers to each other,
 are joined together. We might, perhaps, be at a loss to explain this
 phaenomenon, if we had not experience of a similar in ourselves.
 
 Envy and malice are passions very remarkable in animals. They are
 perhaps more common than pity; as requiring less effort of thought and
 imagination.
 
 
 
 
 
 PART III OF THE WILL AND DIRECT PASSIONS
 
 
 
 
 SECT. I OF LIBERTY AND NECESSITY
 
 
 We come now to explain the direct passions, or the impressions, which
 arise immediately from good or evil, from pain or pleasure. Of this kind
 are, desire and aversion, grief and joy, hope and fear.
 
 Of all the immediate effects of pain and pleasure, there is none more
 remarkable than the WILL; and though properly speaking, it be not
 comprehended among the passions, yet as the full understanding of its
 nature and properties, is necessary to the explanation of them, we shall
 here make it the subject of our enquiry. I desire it may be observed,
 that by the will, I mean nothing but the internal impression we feel and
 are conscious of, when we knowingly give rise to any new motion of our
 body, or new perception of our mind. This impression, like the preceding
 ones of pride and humility, love and hatred, it is impossible to define,
 and needless to describe any farther; for which reason we shall cut off
 all those definitions and distinctions, with which philosophers are wont
 to perplex rather than dear up this question; and entering at first
 upon the subject, shall examine that long disputed question concerning
 liberty and necessity; which occurs so naturally in treating of the
 will.
 
 It is universally acknowledged, that the operations of external bodies
 are necessary, and that in the communication of their motion, in their
 attraction, and mutual cohesion, there are nor the least traces of
 indifference or liberty. Every object is determined by an absolute fate
 toa certain degree and direction of irs motion, and can no more depart
 from that precise line, in which it moves, than it can convert itself
 into an angel, or spirit, or any superior substance. The actions,
 therefore, of matter are to be regarded as instances of necessary
 actions; and whatever is in this respect on the same footing with
 matter, must be acknowledged to be necessary. That we may know whether
 this be the case with the actions of the mind, we shall begin with
 examining matter, and considering on what the idea of a necessity in its
 operations are founded, and why we conclude one body or action to be the
 infallible cause of another.
 
 It has been observed already, that in no single instance the ultimate
 connexion of any objects is discoverable, either by our senses or
 reason, and that we can never penetrate so far into the essence and
 construction of bodies, as to perceive the principle, on which their
 mutual influence depends. It is their constant union alone, with which
 we are acquainted; and it is from the constant union the necessity
 arises. If objects had nor an uniform and regular conjunction with each
 other, we should never arrive at any idea of cause and effect; and even
 after all, the necessity, which enters into that idea, is nothing but
 a determination of the mind to pass from one object to its usual
 attendant, and infer the existence of one from that of the other. Here
 then are two particulars, which we are to consider as essential to
 necessity, viz, the constant union and the inference of the mind; and
 wherever we discover these we must acknowledge a necessity. As the
 actions of matter have no necessity, but what is derived from these
 circumstances, and it is not by any insight into the essence of bodies
 we discover their connexion, the absence of this insight, while
 the union and inference remain, will never, in any case, remove the
 necessity. It is the observation of the union, which produces the
 inference; for which reason it might be thought sufficient, if we prove
 a constant union in the actions of the mind, in order to establish the
 inference, along with the necessity of these actions. But that I
 may bestow a greater force on my reasoning, I shall examine these
 particulars apart, and shall first prove from experience that
 our actions have a constant union with our motives, tempers, and
 circumstances, before I consider the inferences we draw from it.
 
 To this end a very slight and general view of the common course of human
 affairs will be sufficient. There is no light, in which we can take
 them, that does nor confirm this principle. Whether we consider mankind
 according to the difference of sexes, ages, governments, conditions,
 or methods of education; the same uniformity and regular operation
 of natural principles are discernible. Uke causes still produce like
 effects; in the same manner as in the mutual action of the elements and
 powers of nature.
 
 There are different trees, which regularly produce fruit, whose relish
 is different from each other; and this regularity will be admitted as
 an instance of necessity and causes in external bodies. But are the
 products of Guienne and of Champagne more regularly different than the
 sentiments, actions, and passions of the two sexes, of which the one are
 distinguished by their force and maturity, the other by their delicacy
 and softness?
 
 Are the changes of our body from infancy to old age more regular and
 certain than those of our mind and conduct? And would a man be more
 ridiculous, who would expect that an infant of four years old will raise
 a weight of three hundred pound, than one, who from a person of the
 same age would look for a philosophical reasoning, or a prudent and
 well-concerted action?
 
 We must certainly allow, that the cohesion of the parts of matter arises
 from natural and necessary principles, whatever difficulty we may find
 in explaining them: And for a reason we must allow, that human society
 is founded on like principles; and our reason in the latter case, is
 better than even that in the former; because we not only observe, that
 men always seek society, but can also explain the principles, on which
 this universal propensity is founded. For is it more certain, that two
 flat pieces of marble will unite together, than that two young savages
 of different sexes will copulate? Do the children arise from this
 copulation more uniformly, than does the parents care for their safety
 and preservation? And after they have arrived at years of discretion
 by the care of their parents, are the inconveniencies attending their
 separation more certain than their foresight of these inconveniencies
 and their care of avoiding them by a close union and confederacy?
 
 The skin, pores, muscles, and nerves of a day-labourer are different
 from those of a man of quality: So are his sentiments, actions and
 manners. The different stations of life influence the whole fabric,
 external and internal; and different stations arise necessarily, because
 uniformly, from the necessary and uniform principles of human nature.
 Men cannot live without society, and cannot be associated without
 government. Government makes a distinction of property, and establishes
 the different ranks of men. This produces industry, traffic,
 manufactures, law-suits, war, leagues, alliances, voyages, travels,
 cities, fleets, ports, and all those other actions and objects, which
 cause such a diversity, and at the same time maintain such an uniformity
 in human life.
 
 Should a traveller, returning from a far country, tell us, that he had
 seen a climate in the fiftieth degree of northern latitude, where all
 the fruits ripen and come to perfection in the winter, and decay in the
 summer, after the same manner as in England they are produced and decay
 in the contrary seasons, he would find few so credulous as to believe
 him. I am apt to think a travellar would meet with as little credit, who
 should inform us of people exactly of the same character with those in
 Plato's republic on the one hand, or those in Hobbes's Leviathan on the
 other. There is a general course of nature in human actions, as well as
 in the operations of the sun and the climate. There are also characters
 peculiar to different nations and particular persons, as well as
 common to mankind. The knowledge of these characters is founded on the
 observation of an uniformity in the actions, that flow from them; and
 this uniformity forms the very essence of necessity.
 
 I can imagine only one way of eluding this argument, which is by denying
 that uniformity of human actions, on which it is founded. As long as
 actions have a constant union and connexion with the situation and
 temper of the agent, however we may in words refuse to acknowledge the
 necessity, we really allow the thing. Now some may, perhaps, find a
 pretext to deny this regular union and connexion. For what is more
 capricious than human actions? What more inconstant than the desires of
 man? And what creature departs more widely, not only from right reason,
 but from his own character and disposition? An hour, a moment is
 sufficient to make him change from one extreme to another, and overturn
 what cost the greatest pain and labour to establish. Necessity is
 regular and certain. Human conduct is irregular and uncertain. The one,
 therefore, proceeds not from the other.
 
 To this I reply, that in judging of the actions of men we must proceed
 upon the same maxims, as when we reason concerning external objects.
 When any phaenomena are constantly and invariably conjoined together,
 they acquire such a connexion in the imagination, that it passes from
 one to the other, without any doubt or hesitation. But below this there
 are many inferior degrees of evidence and probability, nor does one
 single contrariety of experiment entirely destroy all our reasoning. The
 mind ballances the contrary experiments, and deducting the inferior from
 the superior, proceeds with that degree of assurance or evidence, which
 remains. Even when these contrary experiments are entirely equal, we
 remove not the notion of causes and necessity; but supposing that the
 usual contrariety proceeds from the operation of contrary and concealed
 causes, we conclude, that the chance or indifference lies only in
 our judgment on account of our imperfect knowledge, not in the things
 themselves, which are in every case equally necessary, though to
 appearance not equally constant or certain. No union can be more
 constant and certain, than that of some actions with some motives and
 characters; and if in other cases the union is uncertain, it is no more
 than what happens in the operations of body, nor can we conclude any
 thing from the one irregularity, which will not follow equally from the
 other.
 
 It is commonly allowed that mad-men have no liberty. But were we to
 judge by their actions, these have less regularity and constancy than
 the actions of wise-men, and consequently are farther removed from
 necessity. Our way of thinking in this particular is, therefore,
 absolutely inconsistent; but is a natural consequence of these confused
 ideas and undefined terms, which we so commonly make use of in our
 reasonings, especially on the present subject.
 
 We must now shew, that as the union betwixt motives and actions has the
 same constancy, as that in any natural operations, so its influence
 on the understanding is also the same, in determining us to infer the
 existence of one from that of another. If this shall appear, there is no
 known circumstance, that enters into the connexion and production of the
 actions of matter, that is not to be found in all the operations of
 the mind; and consequently we cannot, without a manifest absurdity,
 attribute necessity to the one, and refuse into the other.
 
 There is no philosopher, whose judgment is so riveted to this
 fantastical system of liberty, as not to acknowledge the force of moral
 evidence, and both in speculation and practice proceed upon it, as upon
 a reasonable foundation. Now moral evidence is nothing but a conclusion
 concerning the actions of men, derived from the consideration of their
 motives, temper and situation. Thus when we see certain characters or
 figures described upon paper, we infer that the person, who produced
 them, would affirm such facts, the death of Caesar, the success of
 Augustus, the cruelty of Nero; and remembering many other concurrent
 testimonies we conclude, that those facts were once really existant, and
 that so many men, without any interest, would never conspire to deceive
 us; especially since they must, in the attempt, expose themselves to the
 derision of all their contemporaries, when these facts were asserted to
 be recent and universally known. The same kind of reasoning runs through
 politics, war, commerce, economy, and indeed mixes itself so entirely
 in human life, that it is impossible to act or subsist a moment without
 having recourse to it. A prince, who imposes a tax upon his subjects,
 expects their compliance. A general, who conducts an army, makes account
 of a certain degree of courage. A merchant looks for fidelity and skill
 in his factor or super-cargo. A man, who gives orders for his dinner,
 doubts not of the obedience of his servants. In short, as nothing
 more nearly interests us than our own actions and those of others, the
 greatest part of our reasonings is employed in judgments concerning
 them. Now I assert, that whoever reasons after this manner, does ipso
 facto believe the actions of the will to arise from necessity, and that
 he knows not what he means, when he denies it.
 
 All those objects, of which we call the one cause and the other effect,
 considered in themselves, are as distinct and separate from each other,
 as any two things in nature, nor can we ever, by the most accurate
 survey of them, infer the existence of the one from that of the other.
 It is only from experience and the observation of their constant
 union, that we are able to form this inference; and even after all, the
 inference is nothing but the effects of custom on the imagination. We
 must not here be content with saying, that the idea of cause and effect
 arises from objects constantly united; but must affirm, that it is
 the very same with the idea of those objects, and that the necessary
 connexion is not discovered by a conclusion of the understanding, but
 is merely a perception of the mind. Wherever, therefore, we observe the
 same union, and wherever the union operates in the same manner upon the
 belief and opinion, we have the idea of causes and necessity, though
 perhaps we may avoid those expressions. Motion in one body in all past
 instances, that have fallen under our observation, is followed upon
 impulse by motion in another. It is impossible for the mind to penetrate
 farther. From this constant union it forms the idea of cause and
 effect, and by its influence feels the necessity. As there is the same
 constancy, and the same influence in what we call moral evidence, I ask
 no more. What remains can only be a dispute of words.
 
 And indeed, when we consider how aptly natural and moral evidence cement
 together, and form only one chain of argument betwixt them, we shall
 make no scruple to allow, that they are of the same nature, and
 derived from the same principles. A prisoner, who has neither money nor
 interest, discovers the impossibility of his escape, as well from the
 obstinacy of the goaler, as from the walls and bars with which he is
 surrounded; and in all attempts for his freedom chuses rather to work
 upon the stone and iron of the one, than upon the inflexible nature of
 the other. The same prisoner, when conducted to the scaffold, foresees
 his death as certainly from the constancy and fidelity of his guards
 as from the operation of the ax or wheel. His mind runs along a certain
 train of ideas: The refusal of the soldiers to consent to his escape,
 the action of the executioner; the separation of the head and body;
 bleeding, convulsive motions, and death. Here is a connected chain of
 natural causes and voluntary actions; but the mind feels no difference
 betwixt them in passing from one link to another; nor is less certain of
 the future event than if it were connected with the present impressions
 of the memory and senses by a train of causes cemented together by what
 we are pleased to call a physical necessity. The same experienced union
 has the same effect on the mind, whether the united objects be motives,
 volitions and actions; or figure and motion. We may change the names of
 things; but their nature and their operation on the understanding never
 change.
 
 I dare be positive no one will ever endeavour to refute these reasonings
 otherwise than by altering my definitions, and assigning a different
 meaning to the terms of cause, and effect, and necessity, and liberty,
 and chance. According to my definitions, necessity makes an essential
 part of causation; and consequently liberty, by removing necessity,
 removes also causes, and is the very same thing with chance. As chance
 is commonly thought to imply a contradiction, and is at least directly
 contrary to experience, there are always the same arguments against
 liberty or free-will. If any one alters the definitions, I cannot
 pretend to argue with him, until I know the meaning he assigns to these
 terms.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. II THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUed
 
 
 I believe we may assign the three following reasons for the prevalance
 of the doctrine of liberty, however absurd it may be in one sense, and
 unintelligible in any other. First, After we have performed any action;
 though we confess we were influenced by particular views and motives; it
 is difficult for us to persuade ourselves we were governed by necessity,
 and that it was utterly impossible for us to have acted otherwise; the
 idea of necessity seeming to imply something of force, and violence,
 and constraint, of which we are not sensible. Few are capable of
 distinguishing betwixt the liberty of spontaniety, as it is called in
 the schools, and the liberty of indifference; betwixt that which is
 opposed to violence, and that which means a negation of necessity and
 causes. The first is even the most common sense of the word; and as it
 is only that species of liberty, which it concerns us to preserve,
 our thoughts have been principally turned towards it, and have almost
 universally confounded it with the other.
 
 Secondly, There is a false sensation or experience even of the
 liberty of indifference; which is regarded as an argument for its real
 existence. The necessity of any action, whether of matter or of the
 mind, is not properly a quality in the agent, but in any thinking or
 intelligent being, who may consider the action, and consists in the
 determination of his thought to infer its existence from some preceding
 objects: As liberty or chance, on the other hand, is nothing but the
 want of that determination, and a certain looseness, which we feel in
 passing or not passing from the idea of one to that of the other. Now we
 may observe, that though in reflecting on human actions we seldom feel
 such a looseness or indifference, yet it very commonly happens, that in
 performing the actions themselves we are sensible of something like
 it: And as all related or resembling objects are readily taken for each
 other, this has been employed as a demonstrative or even an intuitive
 proof of human liberty. We feel that our actions are subject to our will
 on most occasions, and imagine we feel that the will itself is subject
 to nothing; because when by a denial of it we are provoked to try, we
 feel that it moves easily every way, and produces an image of itself
 even on that side, on which it did not settle. This image or faint
 motion, we persuade ourselves, coued have been compleated into the thing
 itself; because, should that be denyed, we find, upon a second trial,
 that it can. But these efforts are all in vain; and whatever capricious
 and irregular actions we may perform; as the desire of showing our
 liberty is the sole motive of our actions; we can never free ourselves
 from the bonds of necessity. We may imagine we feel a liberty within
 ourselves; but a spectator can commonly infer our actions from our
 motives and character; and even where he cannot, he concludes in
 general, that he might, were he perfectly acquainted with every
 circumstance of our situation and temper, and the most secret springs
 of our complexion and disposition. Now this is the very essence of
 necessity, according to the foregoing doctrine.
 
 A third reason why the doctrine of liberty has generally been better
 received in the world, than its antagonist, proceeds from religion,
 which has been very unnecessarily interested in this question. There is
 no method of reasoning more common, and yet none more blameable, than in
 philosophical debates to endeavour to refute any hypothesis by a pretext
 of its dangerous consequences to religion and morality. When any opinion
 leads us into absurdities, it is certainly false; but it is not certain
 an opinion is false, because it is of dangerous consequence. Such
 topics, therefore, ought entirely to be foreborn, as serving nothing
 to the discovery of truth, but only to make the person of an antagonist
 odious. This I observe in general, without pretending to draw any
 advantage from it. I submit myself frankly to an examination of this
 kind, and dare venture to affirm, that the doctrine of necessity,
 according to my explication of it, is not only innocent, but even
 advantageous to religion and morality.
 
 I define necessity two ways, conformable to the two definitions of
 cause, of which it makes an essential part. I place it either in the
 constant union and conjunction of like objects, or in the inference of
 the mind from the one to the other. Now necessity, in both these senses,
 has universally, though tacitely, in the schools, in the pulpit, and in
 common life, been allowed to belong to the will of man, and no one has
 ever pretended to deny, that we can draw inferences concerning human
 actions, and that those inferences are founded on the experienced union
 of like actions with like motives and circumstances. The only particular
 in which any one can differ from me, is either, that perhaps he will
 refuse to call this necessity. But as long as the meaning is understood,
 I hope the word can do no harm. Or that he will maintain there is
 something else in the operations of matter. Now whether it be so or
 not is of no consequence to religion, whatever it may be to natural
 philosophy. I may be mistaken in asserting, that we have no idea of any
 other connexion in the actions of body, and shall be glad to be farther
 instructed on that head: But sure I am, I ascribe nothing to the actions
 of the mind, but what must readily be allowed of. Let no one, therefore,
 put an invidious construction on my words, by saying simply, that
 I assert the necessity of human actions, and place them on the same
 footing with the operations of senseless matter. I do not ascribe to the
 will that unintelligible necessity, which is supposed to lie in matter.
 But I ascribe to matter, that intelligible quality, call it necessity or
 not, which the most rigorous orthodoxy does or must allow to belong to
 the will. I change, therefore, nothing in the received systems, with
 regard to the will, but only with regard to material objects.
 
 Nay I shall go farther, and assert, that this kind of necessity is so
 essential to religion and morality, that without it there must ensue
 an absolute subversion of both, and that every other supposition is
 entirely destructive to all laws both divine and human. It is indeed
 certain, that as all human laws are founded on rewards and punishments,
 it is supposed as a fundamental principle, that these motives have an
 influence on the mind, and both produce the good and prevent the evil
 actions. We may give to this influence what name we please; but as it
 is usually conjoined with the action, common sense requires it should be
 esteemed a cause, and be booked upon as an instance of that necessity,
 which I would establish.
 
 This reasoning is equally solid, when applied to divine laws, so far
 as the deity is considered as a legislator, and is supposed to inflict
 punishment and bestow rewards with a design to produce obedience. But I
 also maintain, that even where he acts not in his magisterial capacity,
 but is regarded as the avenger of crimes merely on account of their
 odiousness and deformity, not only it is impossible, without the
 necessary connexion of cause and effect in human actions, that
 punishments coued be inflicted compatible with justice and moral equity;
 but also that it coued ever enter into the thoughts of any reasonable
 being to inflict them. The constant and universal object of hatred or
 anger is a person or creature endowed with thought and consciousness;
 and when any criminal or injurious actions excite that passion, it
 is only by their relation to the person or connexion with him. But
 according to the doctrine of liberty or chance, this connexion is
 reduced to nothing, nor are men more accountable for those actions,
 which are designed and premeditated, than for such as are the most
 casual and accidental. Actions are by their very nature temporary and
 perishing; and where they proceed not from some cause in the characters
 and disposition of the person, who performed them, they infix not
 themselves upon him, and can neither redound to his honour, if good, nor
 infamy, if evil. The action itself may be blameable; it may be contrary
 to all the rules of morality and religion: But the person is not
 responsible for it; and as it proceeded from nothing in him, that is
 durable or constant, and leaves nothing of that nature behind it, it is
 impossible he can, upon its account, become the object of punishment or
 vengeance. According to the hypothesis of liberty, therefore, a man is
 as pure and untainted, after having committed the most horrid crimes, as
 at the first moment of his birth, nor is his character any way concerned
 in his actions; since they are not derived from it, and the wickedness
 of the one can never be used as a proof of the depravity of the other.
 It is only upon the principles of necessity, that a person acquires
 any merit or demerit from his actions, however the common opinion may
 incline to the contrary.
 
 But so inconsistent are men with themselves, that though they often
 assert, that necessity utterly destroys all merit and demerit either
 towards mankind or superior powers, yet they continue still to
 reason upon these very principles of necessity in all their judgments
 concerning this matter. Men are not blamed for such evil actions as they
 perform ignorantly and casually, whatever may be their consequences.
 Why? but because the causes of these actions are only momentary, and
 terminate in them alone. Men are less blamed for such evil actions, as
 they perform hastily and unpremeditately, than for such as proceed from
 thought and deliberation. For what reason? but because a hasty temper,
 though a constant cause in the mind, operates only by intervals, and
 infects not the whole character. Again, repentance wipes off every
 crime, especially if attended with an evident reformation of life and
 manners. How is this to be accounted for? But by asserting that actions
 render a person criminal, merely as they are proofs of criminal
 passions or principles in the mind; and when by any alteration of these
 principles they cease to be just proofs, they likewise cease to be
 criminal. But according to the doctrine of liberty or chance they never
 were just proofs, and consequently never were criminal.
 
 Here then I turn to my adversary, and desire him to free his own system
 from these odious consequences before he charge them upon others. Or if
 he rather chuses, that this question should be decided by fair arguments
 before philosophers, than by declamations before the people, let him
 return to what I have advanced to prove that liberty and chance
 are synonimous; and concerning the nature of moral evidence and the
 regularity of human actions. Upon a review of these reasonings, I
 cannot doubt of an entire victory; and therefore having proved, that all
 actions of the will have particular causes, I proceed to explain what
 these causes are, and how they operate.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. III OF THE INFLUENCING MOTIVES OF THE WILL
 
 
 Nothing is more usual in philosophy, and even in common life, than to
 talk of the combat of passion and reason, to give the preference to
 reason, and assert that men are only so far virtuous as they conform
 themselves to its dictates. Every rational creature, it is said, is
 obliged to regulate his actions by reason; and if any other motive or
 principle challenge the direction of his conduct, he ought to oppose it,
 till it be entirely subdued, or at least brought to a conformity with
 that superior principle. On this method of thinking the greatest part of
 moral philosophy, antient and modern, seems to be founded; nor is
 there an ampler field, as well for metaphysical arguments, as popular
 declamations, than this supposed pre-eminence of reason above passion.
 The eternity, invariableness, and divine origin of the former have
 been displayed to the best advantage: The blindness, unconstancy, and
 deceitfulness of the latter have been as strongly insisted on. In order
 to shew the fallacy of all this philosophy, I shall endeavour to prove
 first, that reason alone can never be a motive to any action of the
 will; and secondly, that it can never oppose passion in the direction of
 the will.
 
 The understanding exerts itself after two different ways, as it judges
 from demonstration or probability; as it regards the abstract relations
 of our ideas, or those relations of objects, of which experience only
 gives us information. I believe it scarce will be asserted, that the
 first species of reasoning alone is ever the cause of any action. As its
 proper province is the world of ideas, and as the will always places
 us in that of realities, demonstration and volition seem, upon that
 account, to be totally removed, from each other. Mathematics, indeed,
 are useful in all mechanical operations, and arithmetic in almost every
 art and profession: But it is not of themselves they have any influence:
 Mechanics are the art of regulating the motions of bodies to some
 designed end or purpose; and the reason why we employ arithmetic in
 fixing the proportions of numbers, is only that we may discover the
 proportions of their influence and operation. A merchant is desirous of
 knowing the sum total of his accounts with any person: Why? but that he
 may learn what sum will have the same effects in paying his debt, and
 going to market, as all the particular articles taken together. Abstract
 or demonstrative reasoning, therefore, never influences any of our
 actions, but only as it directs our judgment concerning causes and
 effects; which leads us to the second operation of the understanding.
 
 It is obvious, that when we have the prospect of pain or pleasure from
 any object, we feel a consequent emotion of aversion or propensity,
 and are carryed to avoid or embrace what will give us this uneasines or
 satisfaction. It is also obvious, that this emotion rests not here, but
 making us cast our view on every side, comprehends whatever objects are
 connected with its original one by the relation of cause and effect.
 Here then reasoning takes place to discover this relation; and according
 as our reasoning varies, our actions receive a subsequent variation. But
 it is evident in this case that the impulse arises not from reason, but
 is only directed by it. It is from the prospect of pain or pleasure that
 the aversion or propensity arises towards any object: And these emotions
 extend themselves to the causes and effects of that object, as they are
 pointed out to us by reason and experience. It can never in the least
 concern us to know, that such objects are causes, and such others
 effects, if both the causes and effects be indifferent to us. Where the
 objects themselves do not affect us, their connexion can never give
 them any influence; and it is plain, that as reason is nothing but the
 discovery of this connexion, it cannot be by its means that the objects
 are able to affect us.
 
 Since reason alone can never produce any action, or give rise to
 volition, I infer, that the same faculty is as incapable of preventing
 volition, or of disputing the preference with any passion or emotion.
 This consequence is necessary. It is impossible reason coued have the
 latter effect of preventing volition, but by giving an impulse in a
 contrary direction to our passion; and that impulse, had it operated
 alone, would have been able to produce volition. Nothing can oppose
 or retard the impulse of passion, but a contrary impulse; and if this
 contrary impulse ever arises from reason, that latter faculty must have
 an original influence on the will, and must be able to cause, as well as
 hinder any act of volition. But if reason has no original influence,
 it is impossible it can withstand any principle, which has such an
 efficacy, or ever keep the mind in suspence a moment. Thus it appears,
 that the principle, which opposes our passion, cannot be the same
 with reason, and is only called so in an improper sense. We speak not
 strictly and philosophically when we talk of the combat of passion and
 of reason. Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions,
 and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey
 them. As this opinion may appear somewhat extraordinary, it may not be
 improper to confirm it by some other considerations.
 
 A passion is an original existence, or, if you will, modification of
 existence, and contains not any representative quality, which renders
 it a copy of any other existence or modification. When I am angry, I am
 actually possest with the passion, and in that emotion have no more a
 reference to any other object, than when I am thirsty, or sick, or more
 than five foot high. It is impossible, therefore, that this passion
 can be opposed by, or be contradictory to truth and reason; since this
 contradiction consists in the disagreement of ideas, considered as
 copies, with those objects, which they represent.
 
 What may at first occur on this head, is, that as nothing can be
 contrary to truth or reason, except what has a reference to it, and as
 the judgments of our understanding only have this reference, it must
 follow, that passions can be contrary to reason only so far as they are
 accompanyed with some judgment or opinion. According to this principle,
 which is so obvious and natural, it is only in two senses, that any
 affection can be called unreasonable. First, When a passion, such as
 hope or fear, grief or joy, despair or security, is founded on the
 supposition or the existence of objects, which really do not exist.
 Secondly, When in exerting any passion in action, we chuse means
 insufficient for the designed end, and deceive ourselves in our judgment
 of causes and effects. Where a passion is neither founded on
 false suppositions, nor chuses means insufficient for the end, the
 understanding can neither justify nor condemn it. It is not contrary to
 reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of
 my finger. It is not contrary to reason for me to chuse my total ruin,
 to prevent the least uneasiness of an Indian or person wholly unknown
 to me. It is as little contrary to reason to prefer even my own
 acknowledgeed lesser good to my greater, and have a more ardent
 affection for the former than the latter. A trivial good may, from
 certain circumstances, produce a desire superior to what arises from
 the greatest and most valuable enjoyment; nor is there any thing more
 extraordinary in this, than in mechanics to see one pound weight raise
 up a hundred by the advantage of its situation. In short, a passion
 must be accompanyed with some false judgment in order to its being
 unreasonable; and even then it is not the passion, properly speaking,
 which is unreasonable, but the judgment.
 
 The consequences are evident. Since a passion can never, in any sense,
 be called unreasonable, but when founded on a false supposition or when
 it chuses means insufficient for the designed end, it is impossible,
 that reason and passion can ever oppose each other, or dispute for the
 government of the will and actions. The moment we perceive the falshood
 of any supposition, or the insufficiency of any means our passions yield
 to our reason without any opposition. I may desire any fruit as of an
 excellent relish; but whenever you convince me of my mistake, my longing
 ceases. I may will the performance of certain actions as means of
 obtaining any desired good; but as my willing of these actions is only
 secondary, and founded on the supposition, that they are causes of the
 proposed effect; as soon as I discover the falshood of that supposition,
 they must become indifferent to me.
 
 It is natural for one, that does not examine objects with a strict
 philosophic eye, to imagine, that those actions of the mind are
 entirely the same, which produce not a different sensation, and are not
 immediately distinguishable to the feeling and perception. Reason, for
 instance, exerts itself without producing any sensible emotion; and
 except in the more sublime disquisitions of philosophy, or in the
 frivolous subtilties of the school, scarce ever conveys any pleasure
 or uneasiness. Hence it proceeds, that every action of the mind, which
 operates with the same calmness and tranquillity, is confounded with
 reason by all those, who judge of things from the first view and
 appearance. Now it is certain, there are certain calm desires and
 tendencies, which, though they be real passions, produce little emotion
 in the mind, and are more known by their effects than by the immediate
 feeling or sensation. These desires are of two kinds; either certain
 instincts originally implanted in our natures, such as benevolence and
 resentment, the love of life, and kindness to children; or the general
 appetite to good, and aversion to evil, considered merely as such. When
 any of these passions are calm, and cause no disorder in the soul,
 they are very readily taken for the determinations of reason, and are
 supposed to proceed from the same faculty, with that, which judges of
 truth and falshood. Their nature and principles have been supposed the
 same, because their sensations are not evidently different.
 
 Beside these calm passions, which often determine the will, there are
 certain violent emotions of the same kind, which have likewise a great
 influence on that faculty. When I receive any injury from another, I
 often feel a violent passion of resentment, which makes me desire his
 evil and punishment, independent of all considerations of pleasure and
 advantage to myself. When I am immediately threatened with any grievous
 ill, my fears, apprehensions, and aversions rise to a great height, and
 produce a sensible emotion.
 
 The common error of metaphysicians has lain in ascribing the direction
 of the will entirely to one of these principles, and supposing the other
 to have no influence. Men often act knowingly against their interest:
 For which reason the view of the greatest possible good does not always
 influence them. Men often counter-act a violent passion in prosecution
 of their interests and designs: It is not therefore the present
 uneasiness alone, which determines them. In general we may observe, that
 both these principles operate on the will; and where they are contrary,
 that either of them prevails, according to the general character or
 present disposition of the person. What we call strength of mind,
 implies the prevalence of the calm passions above the violent; though
 we may easily observe, there is no man so constantly possessed of this
 virtue, as never on any occasion to yield to the sollicitations of
 passion and desire. From these variations of temper proceeds the great
 difficulty of deciding concerning the actions and resolutions of men,
 where there is any contrariety of motives and passions.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. IV OF THE CAUSES OF THE VIOLENT PASSIONS
 
 
 There is not-in philosophy a subject of more nice speculation than this
 of the different causes and effects of the calm and violent passions.
 It is evident passions influence not the will in proportion to their
 violence, or the disorder they occasion in the temper; but on the
 contrary, that when a passion has once become a settled principle of
 action, and is the predominant inclination of the soul, it commonly
 produces no longer any sensible agitation. As repeated custom and its
 own force have made every thing yield to it, it directs the actions and
 conduct without that opposition and emotion, which so naturally attend
 every momentary gust of passion. We must, therefore, distinguish betwixt
 a calm and a weak passion; betwixt a violent and a strong one. But
 notwithstanding this, it is certain, that when we would govern a man,
 and push him to any action, it will commonly be better policy to work
 upon the violent than the calm passions, and rather take him by his
 inclination, than what is vulgarly called his reason. We ought to place
 the object in such particular situations as are proper to encrease the
 violence of the passion. For we may observe, that all depends upon the
 situation of the object, and that a variation in this particular will be
 able to change the calm and the violent passions into each other. Both
 these kinds of passions pursue good, and avoid evil; and both of them
 are encreased or diminished by the encrease or diminution of the good or
 evil. But herein lies the difference betwixt them: The same good, when
 near, will cause a violent passion, which, when remote, produces only a
 calm one. As this subject belongs very properly to the present question
 concerning the will, we shall here examine it to the bottom, and shall
 consider some of those circumstances and situations of objects, which
 render a passion either calm or violent.
 
 It is a remarkable property of human nature, that any emotion, which
 attends a passion, is easily converted into it, though in their natures
 they be originally different from, and even contrary to each other.
 It is true; in order to make a perfect union among passions, there is
 always required a double relation of impressions and ideas; nor is one
 relation sufficient for that purpose. But though this be confirmed by
 undoubted experience, we must understand it with its proper limitations,
 and must regard the double relation, as requisite only to make one
 passion produce another. When two passions are already produced by their
 separate causes, and are both present in the mind, they readily mingle
 and unite, though they have but one relation, and sometimes without any.
 The predominant passion swallows up the inferior, and converts it into
 itself. The spirits, when once excited, easily receive a change in their
 direction; and it is natural to imagine this change will come from the
 prevailing affection. The connexion is in many respects closer betwixt
 any two passions, than betwixt any passion and indifference.
 
 When a person is once heartily in love, the little faults and caprices
 of his mistress, the jealousies and quarrels, to which that commerce is
 so subject; however unpleasant and related to anger and hatred; are yet
 found to give additional force to the prevailing passion. It is a common
 artifice of politicians, when they would affect any person very much by
 a matter of fact, of which they intend to inform him, first to excite
 his curiosity; delay as long as possible the satisfying it; and by that
 means raise his anxiety and impatience to the utmost, before they give
 him a full insight into the business. They know that his curiosity will
 precipitate him into the passion they design to raise, and assist the
 object in its influence on the mind. A soldier advancing to the battle,
 is naturally inspired with courage and confidence, when he thinks on his
 friends and fellow-soldiers; and is struck with fear and terror, when
 he reflects on the enemy. Whatever new emotion, therefore, proceeds
 from the former naturally encreases the courage; as the same emotion,
 proceeding from the latter, augments the fear; by the relation of ideas,
 and the conversion of the inferior emotion into the predominant. Hence
 it is that in martial discipline, the uniformity and lustre of our
 habit, the regularity of our figures and motions, with all the pomp and
 majesty of war, encourage ourselves and allies; while the same objects
 in the enemy strike terror into us, though agreeable and beautiful in
 themselves.
 
 Since passions, however independent, are naturally transfused into each
 other, if they are both present at the same time; it follows, that when
 good or evil is placed in such a situation, as to cause any particular
 emotion, beside its direct passion of desire or aversion, that latter
 passion must acquire new force and violence.
 
 This happens, among other cases, whenever any object excites contrary
 passions. For it is observable that an opposition of passions commonly
 causes a new emotion in the spirits, and produces more disorder, than
 the concurrence of any two affections of equal force. This new emotion
 is easily converted into the predominant passion, and encreases its
 violence, beyond the pitch it would have arrived at had it met with
 no opposition. Hence we naturally desire what is forbid, and take a
 pleasure in performing actions, merely because they are unlawful.
 The notion of duty, when opposite to the passions, is seldom able
 to overcome them; and when it fails of that effect, is apt rather to
 encrease them, by producing an opposition in our motives and principles.
 The same effect follows whether the opposition arises from internal
 motives or external obstacles. The passion commonly acquires new force
 and violence in both cases.
 
 The efforts, which the mind makes to surmount the obstacle, excite the
 spirits and inliven the passion.
 
 Uncertainty has the same influence as opposition. The agitation of the
 thought; the quick turns it makes from one view to another; the variety
 of passions, which succeed each other, according to the different views;
 All these produce an agitation in the mind, and transfuse themselves
 into the predominant passion.
 
 There is not in my opinion any other natural cause, why security
 diminishes the passions, than because it removes that uncertainty, which
 encreases them. The mind, when left to itself, immediately languishes;
 and in order to preserve its ardour, must be every moment supported by
 a new flow of passion. For the same reason, despair, though contrary to
 security, has a like influence.
 
 It is certain nothing more powerfully animates any affection, than to
 conceal some part of its object by throwing it into a kind of shade,
 which at the same time that it chews enough to pre-possess us in favour
 of the object, leaves still some work for the imagination. Besides that
 obscurity is always attended with a kind of uncertainty; the effort,
 which the fancy makes to compleat the idea, rouzes the spirits, and
 gives an additional force to the passion.
 
 As despair and security, though contrary to each other, produce the
 same effects; so absence is observed to have contrary effects, and in
 different circumstances either encreases or diminishes our affections.
 The Duc de La Rochefoucault has very well observed, that absence
 destroys weak passions, but encreases strong; as the wind extinguishes
 a candle, but blows up a fire. Long absence naturally weakens our idea,
 and diminishes the passion: But where the idea is so strong and lively
 as to support itself, the uneasiness, arising from absence, encreases
 the passion and gives it new force and violence.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. V OF THE EFFECTS OF CUSTOM
 
 
 But nothing has a greater effect both to encrease and diminish our
 passions, to convert pleasure into pain, and pain into pleasure, than
 custom and repetition. Custom has two original effects upon the mind, in
 bestowing a facility in the performance of any action or the conception
 of any object; and afterwards a tendency or inclination towards it;
 and from these we may account for all its other effects, however
 extraordinary.
 
 When the soul applies itself to the performance of any action, or the
 conception of any object, to which it is not accustomed, there is a
 certain unpliableness in the faculties, and a difficulty of the spirit's
 moving in their new direction. As this difficulty excites the spirits,
 it is the source of wonder, surprize, and of all the emotions, which
 arise from novelty; and is in itself very agreeable, like every thing,
 which inlivens the mind to a moderate degree. But though surprize be
 agreeable in itself, yet as it puts the spirits in agitation, it not
 only augments our agreeable affections, but also our painful, according
 to the foregoing principle, that every emotion, which precedes or
 attends a passion, is easily converted into it. Hence every thing, that
 is new, is most affecting, and gives us either more pleasure or pain,
 than what, strictly speaking, naturally belongs to it. When it often
 returns upon us, the novelty wears off; the passions subside; the
 hurry of the spirits is over; and we survey the objects with greater
 tranquillity.
 
 By degrees the repetition produces a facility of the human mind, and
 an infallible source of pleasure, where the facility goes not beyond
 a certain degree. And here it is remarkable that the pleasure, which
 arises from a moderate facility, has not the same tendency with that
 which arises from novelty, to augment the painful, as well as the
 agreeable affections. The pleasure of facility does not so much consist
 in any ferment of the spirits, as in their orderly motion; which will
 sometimes be so powerful as even to convert pain into pleasure, and give
 us a relish in time what at first was most harsh and disagreeable.
 
 But again, as facility converts pain into pleasure, so it often converts
 pleasure into pain, when it is too great, and renders the actions of the
 mind so faint and languid, that they are no longer able to interest and
 support it. And indeed, scarce any other objects become disagreeable
 through custom; but such as are naturally attended with some emotion or
 affection, which is destroyed by the too frequent repetition. One
 can consider the clouds, and heavens, and trees, and stones, however
 frequently repeated, without ever feeling any aversion. But when the
 fair sex, or music, or good cheer, or any thing, that naturally ought
 to be agreeable, becomes indifferent, it easily produces the opposite
 affection.
 
 But custom not only gives a facility to perform any action, but likewise
 an inclination and tendency towards it, where it is not entirely
 disagreeable, and can never be the object of inclination. And this
 is the reason why custom encreases all active habits, but diminishes
 passive, according to the observation of a late eminent philosopher. The
 facility takes off from the force of the passive habits by rendering
 the motion of the spirits faint and languid. But as in the active, the
 spirits are sufficiently supported of themselves, the tendency of the
 mind gives them new force, and bends them more strongly to the action.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VI OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE IMAGINATION ON THE PASSIONS
 
 
 It is remarkable, that the imagination and affections have close union
 together, and that nothing, which affects the former, can be entirely
 indifferent to the latter. Wherever our ideas of good or evil acquire a
 new vivacity, the passions become more violent; and keep pace with
 the imagination in all its variations. Whether this proceeds from
 the principle above-mentioned, that any attendant emotion is easily
 converted into the predominant, I shall not determine. It is sufficient
 for my present purpose, that we have many instances to confirm this
 influence of the imagination upon the passions.
 
 Any pleasure, with which we are acquainted, affects us more than any
 other, which we own to be superior, but of whose nature we are wholly
 ignorant. Of the one we can form a particular and determinate idea:
 The other we conceive under the general notion of pleasure; and it is
 certain, that the more general and universal any of our ideas are, the
 less influence they have upon the imagination. A general idea, though
 it be nothing but a particular one considered in a certain view, is
 commonly more obscure; and that because no particular idea, by which we
 represent a general one, is ever fixed or determinate, but may easily
 be changed for other particular ones, which will serve equally in the
 representation.
 
 There is a noted passage in the history of Greece, which may serve for
 our present purpose. Themistocles told the Athenians, that he had formed
 a design, which would be highly useful to the public, but which it was
 impossible for him to communicate to them without ruining the execution,
 since its success depended entirely on the secrecy with which it should
 be conducted. The Athenians, instead of granting him full power to
 act as he thought fitting, ordered him to communicate his design to
 Aristides, in whose prudence they had an entire confidence, and
 whose opinion they were resolved blindly to submit to. The design of
 Themistocles was secretly to set fire to the fleet of all the Grecian
 commonwealths, which was assembled in a neighbouring port, and which
 being once destroyed would give the Athenians the empire of the sea
 without any rival Aristides returned to the assembly, and told them,
 that nothing coued be more advantageous than the design of Themistocles
 but at the same time that nothing coued be more unjust: Upon which the
 people unanimously rejected the project.
 
 A late celebrated historian [Mons. Rollin {Charles Rollin, HISTOIRE
 ANCIENNE.(Paris 1730-38)}.] admires this passage of antient history, as
 one of the most singular that is any where to be met.
 
 "Here," says he, "they are not philosophers, to whom it is easy in
 their schools to establish the finest maxims and most sublime rules of
 morality, who decide that interest ought never to prevail above justice.
 It is a whole people interested in the proposal which is made to
 them, who consider it as of importance to the public good, and who
 notwithstanding reject it unanimously, and without hesitation, merely
 because it is contrary to justice."
 
 For my part I see nothing so extraordinary in this proceeding of the
 Athenians. The same reasons, which render it so easy for philosophers to
 establish these sublime maxims, tend, in part, to diminish the merit
 of such a conduct in that people. Philosophers never ballance betwixt
 profit and honesty, because their decisions are general, and neither
 their passions nor imaginations are interested in the objects. And
 though in the present case the advantage was immediate to the Athenians,
 yet as it was known only under the general notion of advantage,
 without being conceived by any particular idea, it must have had a
 less considerable influence on their imaginations, and have been a
 less violent temptation, than if they had been acquainted with all
 its circumstances: Otherwise it is difficult to conceive, that a whole
 people, unjust and violent as men commonly are, should so unanimously
 have adhered to justice, and rejected any considerable advantage.
 
 Any satisfaction, which we lately enjoyed, and of which the memory is
 fresh and recent, operates on the will with more violence, than another
 of which the traces are decayed, and almost obliterated. From whence
 does this proceed, but that the memory in the first case assists the
 fancy and gives an additional force and vigour to its conceptions?
 The image of the past pleasure being strong and violent, bestows these
 qualities on the idea of the future pleasure, which is connected with it
 by the relation of resemblance.
 
 A pleasure, which is suitable to the way of life, in which we are
 engaged, excites more our desires and appetites than another, which
 is foreign to it. This phaenomenon may be explained from the same
 principle.
 
 Nothing is more capable of infusing any passion into the mind, than
 eloquence, by which objects are represented in their strongest and most
 lively colours. We may of ourselves acknowledge, that such an object
 is valuable, and such another odious; but until an orator excites the
 imagination, and gives force to these ideas, they may have but a feeble
 influence either on the will or the affections.
 
 But eloquence is not always necessary. The bare opinion of another,
 especially when inforced with passion, will cause an idea of good or
 evil to have an influence upon us, which would otherwise have been
 entirely neglected. This proceeds from the principle of sympathy or
 communication; and sympathy, as I have already observed, is nothing
 but the conversion of an idea into an impression by the force of
 imagination.
 
 It is remarkable, that lively passions commonly attend a lively
 imagination. In this respect, as well as others, the force of the
 passion depends as much on the temper of the person, as the nature or
 situation of the object.
 
 I have already observed, that belief is nothing but a lively idea
 related to a present impression. This vivacity is a requisite
 circumstance to the exciting all our passions, the calm as well as the
 violent; nor has a mere fiction of the imagination any considerable
 influence upon either of them. It is too weak to take hold of the mind,
 or be attended with emotion.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VII OF CONTIGUITY AND DISTANCE IN SPACE AND TIME
 
 
 There is an easy reason, why every thing contiguous to us, either in
 space or time, should be conceived with a peculiar force and vivacity,
 and excel every other object, in its influence on the imagination.
 Ourself is intimately present to us, and whatever is related to self
 must partake of that quality. But where an object is so far removed
 as to have lost the advantage of this relation, why, as it is farther
 removed, its idea becomes still fainter and more obscure, would,
 perhaps, require a more particular examination.
 
 It is obvious, that the imagination can never totally forget the points
 of space and time, in which we are existent; but receives such frequent
 advertisements of them from the passions and senses, that however it
 may turn its attention to foreign and remote objects, it is necessitated
 every moment to reflect on the present. IOt is also remarkable, that in
 the conception of those objects, which we regard as real and existent,
 we take them in their proper order and situation, and never leap from
 one object to another, which is distant from it, without running over,
 at least in a cursory manner, all those objects, which are interposed
 betwixt them. When we reflect, therefore, on any object distant from
 ourselves, we are obliged not only to reach it at first by passing
 through all the intermediate space betwixt ourselves and the object, but
 also to renew our progress every moment; being every moment recalled to
 the consideration of ourselves and our present situation. It is easily
 conceived, that this interruption must weaken the idea by breaking the
 action of the mind, and hindering the conception from being so intense
 and continued, as when we reflect on a nearer object. The fewer steps
 we make to arrive at the object, and the smoother the road is, this
 diminution of vivacity is less sensibly felt, but still may be observed
 more or less in proportion to the degrees of distance and difficulty.
 
 Here then we are to consider two kinds of objects, the contiguous and
 remote; of which the former, by means of their relation to ourselves,
 approach an impression in force and vivacity; the latter by reason of
 the interruption in our manner of conceiving them, appear in a weaker
 and more imperfect light. This is their effect on the imagination. If
 my reasoning be just, they must have a proportionable effect on the will
 and passions. Contiguous objects must have an influence much superior to
 the distant and remote. Accordingly we find in common life, that men are
 principally concerned about those objects, which are not much removed
 either in space or time, enjoying the present, and leaving what is afar
 off to the care of chance and fortune. Talk to a man of his condition
 thirty years hence, and he will not regard you. Speak of what is to
 happen tomorrow, and he will lend you attention. The breaking of a
 mirror gives us more concern when at home, than the burning of a house,
 when abroad, and some hundred leagues distant.
 
 But farther; though distance both in space and time has a considerable
 effect on the imagination, and by that means on the will and passions,
 yet the consequence of a removal in space are much inferior to those of
 a removal in time. Twenty years are certainly but a small distance
 of time in comparison of what history and even the memory of some may
 inform them of, and yet I doubt if a thousand leagues, or even the
 greatest distance of place this globe can admit of, will so remarkably
 weaken our ideas, and diminish our passions. A West-Indian merchant will
 tell you, that he is not without concern about what passes in Jamaica;
 though few extend their views so far into futurity, as to dread very
 remote accidents.
 
 The cause of this phaenomenon must evidently lie in the different
 properties of space and time. Without having recourse to metaphysics,
 any one may easily observe, that space or extension consists of a number
 of co-existent parts disposed in a certain order, and capable of being
 at once present to the sight or feeling. On the contrary, time or
 succession, though it consists likewise of parts, never presents to us
 more than one at once; nor is it possible for any two of them ever to
 be co-existent. These qualities of the objects have a suitable effect on
 the imagination. The parts of extension being susceptible of an union to
 the senses, acquire an union in the fancy; and as the appearance of
 one part excludes not another, the transition or passage of the thought
 through the contiguous parts is by that means rendered more smooth and
 easy. On the other hand, the incompatibility of the parts of time in
 their real existence separates them in the imagination, and makes it
 more difficult for that faculty to trace any long succession or series
 of events. Every part must appear single and alone, nor can regularly
 have entrance into the fancy without banishing what is supposed to have
 been immediately precedent. By this means any distance in time causes a
 greater interruption in the thought than an equal distance in space, and
 consequently weakens more considerably the idea, and consequently the
 passions; which depend in a great measure, on the imagination, according
 to my system.
 
 There is another phaenomenon of a like nature with the foregoing, viz,
 the superior effects of the same distance in futurity above that in the
 past. This difference with respect to the will is easily accounted for.
 As none of our actions can alter the past, it is not strange it should
 never determine the will. But with respect to the passions the question
 is yet entire, and well worth the examining.
 
 Besides the propensity to a gradual progression through the points of
 space and time, we have another peculiarity in our method of thinking,
 which concurs in producing this phaenomenon. We always follow the
 succession of time in placing our ideas, and from the consideration of
 any object pass more easily to that, which follows immediately after
 it, than to that which went before it. We may learn this, among other
 instances, from the order, which is always observed in historical
 narrations. Nothing but an absolute necessity can oblige an historian to
 break the order of time, and in his narration give the precedence to an
 event, which was in reality posterior to another.
 
 This will easily be applied to the question in hand, if we reflect on
 what I have before observed, that the present situation of the person is
 always that of the imagination, and that it is from thence we proceed
 to the conception of any distant object. When the object is past, the
 progression of the thought in passing to it from the present is contrary
 to nature, as proceeding from one point of time to that which is
 preceding, and from that to another preceding, in opposition to the
 natural course of the succession. On the other hand, when we turn our
 thought to a future object, our fancy flows along the stream of time,
 and arrives at the object by an order, which seems most natural, passing
 always from one point of time to that which is immediately posterior to
 it. This easy progression of ideas favours the imagination, and makes
 it conceive its object in a stronger and fuller light, than when we
 are continually opposed in our passage, and are obliged to overcome the
 difficulties arising from the natural propensity of the fancy. A small
 degree of distance in the past has, therefore, a greater effect, in
 interupting and weakening the conception, than a much greater in
 the future. From this effect of it on the imagination is derived its
 influence on the will and passions.
 
 There is another cause, which both contributes to the same effect, and
 proceeds from the same quality of the fancy, by which we are determined
 to trace the succession of time by a similar succession of ideas. When
 from the present instant we consider two points of time equally distant
 in the future and in the past, it is evident, that, abstractedly
 considered, their relation to the present is almost equal. For as the
 future will sometime be present, so the past was once present. If we
 coued, therefore, remove this quality of the imagination, an equal
 distance in the past and in the future, would have a similar influence.
 Nor is this only true, when the fancy remains fixed, and from the
 present instant surveys the future and the past; but also when it
 changes its situation, and places us in different periods of time. For
 as on the one hand, in supposing ourselves existent in a point of time
 interposed betwixt the present instant and the future object, we find
 the future object approach to us, and the past retire, and become more
 distant: so on the other hand, in supposing ourselves existent in a
 point of time interposed betwixt the present and the past, the past
 approaches to us, and the future becomes more distant. But from the
 property of the fancy above-mentioned we rather chuse to fix our thought
 on the point of time interposed betwixt the present and the future, than
 on that betwixt the present and the past. We advance, rather than retard
 our existence; and following what seems the natural succession of time,
 proceed from past to present, and from present to future. By which means
 we conceive the future as flowing every moment nearer us, and the
 past as retiring. An equal distance, therefore, in the past and in the
 future, has not the same effect on the imagination; and that because we
 consider the one as continually encreasing, and the other as continually
 diminishing. The fancy anticipates the course of things, and surveys the
 object in that condition, to which it tends, as well as in that, which
 is regarded as the present.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VIII THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUed
 
 
 Thus we have accounted for three phaenomena, which seem pretty
 remarkable. Why distance weakens the conception and passion: Why
 distance in time has a greater effect than that in space: And why
 distance in past time has still a greater effect than that in future. We
 must now consider three phaenomena, which seem to be, in a manner, the
 reverse of these: Why a very great distance encreases our esteem and
 admiration for an object; Why such a distance in time encreases it
 more than that in space: And a distance in past time more than that in
 future. The curiousness of the subject will, I hope, excuse my dwelling
 on it for some time.
 
 To begin with the first phaenomenon, why a great distance encreases our
 esteem and admiration for an object; it is evident that the mere view
 and contemplation of any greatness, whether successive or extended,
 enlarges the soul, and give it a sensible delight and pleasure. A wide
 plain, the ocean, eternity, a succession of several ages; all these are
 entertaining objects, and excel every thing, however beautiful, which
 accompanies not its beauty with a suitable greatness. Now when any very
 distant object is presented to the imagination, we naturally reflect on
 the interposed distance, and by that means, conceiving something great
 and magnificent, receive the usual satisfaction. But as the fancy passes
 easily from one idea to another related to it, and transports to the
 second all the passions excited by the first, the admiration, which is
 directed to the distance, naturally diffuses itself over the distant
 object. Accordingly we find, that it is not necessary the object should
 be actually distant from us, in order to cause our admiration; but that
 it is sufficient, if, by the natural association of ideas, it conveys
 our view to any considerable distance. A great traveller, though in
 the same chamber, will pass for a very extraordinary person; as a Greek
 medal, even in our cabinet, is always esteemed a valuable curiosity.
 Here the object, by a natural transition, conveys our views to the
 distance; and the admiration, which arises from that distance, by
 another natural transition, returns back to the object.
 
 But though every great distance produces an admiration for the distant
 object, a distance in time has a more considerable effect than that in
 space. Antient busts and inscriptions are more valued than Japan tables:
 And not to mention the Greeks and Romans, it is certain we regard with
 more veneration the old Chaldeans and Egyptians, than the modern Chinese
 and Persians, and bestow more fruitless pains to dear up the history and
 chronology of the former, than it would cost us to make a voyage, and
 be certainly informed of the character, learning and government of the
 latter. I shall be obliged to make a digression in order to explain this
 phaenomenon.
 
 It is a quality very observable in human nature, that any opposition,
 which does not entirely discourage and intimidate us, has rather a
 contrary effect, and inspires us with a more than ordinary grandeur
 and magnanimity. In collecting our force to overcome the opposition, we
 invigorate the soul, and give it an elevation with which otherwise it
 would never have been acquainted. Compliance, by rendering our strength
 useless, makes us insensible of it: but opposition awakens and employs
 it.
 
 This is also true in the universe. Opposition not only enlarges the
 soul; but the soul, when full of courage and magnanimity, in a manner
 seeks opposition.
 
 
 SPUMANTEMQUE DARI PECORA INTER INERTIA VOTIS OPTAT APRUM, AUT FULVUM
 DESCENDERE MONTE LEONEM.
 
 [And, among the tamer beasts, [he] longs to be granted, in answer to his
 prayers, a slavering boar, or to have a tawny lion come down from the
 mountain.]
 
 
 Whatever supports and fills the passions is agreeable to us; as on the
 contrary, what weakens and infeebles them is uneasy. As opposition
 has the first effect, and facility the second, no wonder the mind, in
 certain dispositions, desires the former, and is averse to the latter.
 
 These principles have an effect on the imagination as well as on the
 passions. To be convinced of this we need only consider the influence
 of heights and depths on that faculty. Any great elevation of place
 communicates a kind of pride or sublimity of imagination, and gives
 a fancyed superiority over those that lie below; and, vice versa, a
 sublime and strong imagination conveys the idea of ascent and elevation.
 Hence it proceeds, that we associate, in a manner, the idea of whatever
 is good with that of height, and evil with lowness. Heaven is supposed
 to be above, and hell below. A noble genius is called an elevate and
 sublime one. ATQUE UDAM SPERNIT HUMUM FUGIENTE PENNA. [Spurns the dank
 soil in winged flight.] On the contrary, a vulgar and trivial conception
 is stiled indifferently low or mean. Prosperity is denominated ascent,
 and adversity descent. Kings and princes are supposed to be placed at
 the top of human affairs; as peasants and day-labourers are said to be
 in the lowest stations. These methods of thinking, and of expressing
 ourselves, are not of so little consequence as they may appear at first
 sight.
 
 It is evident to common sense, as well as philosophy, that there is no
 natural nor essential difference betwixt high and low, and that this
 distinction arises only from the gravitation of matter, which produces a
 motion from the one to the other. The very same direction, which in
 this part of the globe is called ascent, is denominated descent in our
 antipodes; which can proceed from nothing but the contrary tendency
 of bodies. Now it is certain, that the tendency of bodies, continually
 operating upon our senses, must produce, from custom, a like tendency in
 the fancy, and that when we consider any object situated in an ascent,
 the idea of its weight gives us a propensity to transport it from the
 place, in which it is situated, to the place immediately below it, and
 so on, until we come to the ground, which equally stops the body and
 our imagination. For a like reason we feel a difficulty in mounting, and
 pass not without a kind of reluctance from the inferior to that which is
 situated above it; as if our ideas acquired a kind of gravity from their
 objects. As a proof of this, do we not find, that the facility, which
 is so much studyed in music and poetry, is called the fail or cadency of
 the harmony or period; the idea of facility communicating to us that of
 descent, in the same manner as descent produces a facility?
 
 Since the imagination, therefore, in running from low to high, finds an
 opposition in its internal qualities and principles, and since the soul,
 when elevated with joy and courage, in a manner seeks opposition, and
 throws itself with alacrity into any scene of thought or action, where
 its courage meets with matter to nourish and employ it; it follows, that
 everything, which invigorates and inlivens the soul, whether by touching
 the passions or imagination naturally conveys to the fancy this
 inclination for ascent, and determines it to run against the natural
 stream of its thoughts and conceptions. This aspiring progress of
 the imagination suits the present disposition of the mind; and the
 difficulty, instead of extinguishing its vigour and alacrity, has the
 contrary affect, of sustaining and encreasing it. Virtue, genius, power,
 and riches are for this reason associated with height and sublimity; as
 poverty, slavery, and folly are conjoined with descent and lowness. Were
 the case the same with us as Milton represents it to be with the angels,
 to whom descent is adverse, and who cannot sink without labour and
 compulsion, this order of things would be entirely inverted; as appears
 hence, that the very nature of ascent and descent is derived from the
 difficulty and propensity, and consequently every one of their effects
 proceeds from that origin.
 
 All this is easily applied to the present question, why a considerable
 distance in time produces a greater veneration for the distant objects
 than a like removal in space. The imagination moves with more difficulty
 in passing from one portion of time to another, than in a transition
 through the parts of space; and that because space or extension appears
 united to our senses, while time or succession is always broken and
 divided. This difficulty, when joined with a small distance, interrupts
 and weakens the fancy: But has a contrary effect in a great removal. The
 mind, elevated by the vastness of its object, is still farther elevated
 by the difficulty of the conception; and being obliged every moment to
 renew its efforts in the transition from one part of time to another,
 feels a more vigorous and sublime disposition, than in a transition
 through the parts of space, where the ideas flow along with easiness and
 facility. In this disposition, the imagination, passing, as is usual,
 from the consideration of the distance to the view of the distant
 objects, gives us a proportionable veneration for it; and this is the
 reason why all the relicts of antiquity are so precious in our eyes, and
 appear more valuable than what is brought even from the remotest parts
 of the world.
 
 The third phaenomenon I have remarked will be a full confirmation of
 this. It is not every removal in time, which has the effect of producing
 veneration and esteem. We are not apt to imagine our posterity
 will excel us, or equal our ancestors. This phaenomenon is the more
 remarkable, because any distance in futurity weakens not our ideas so
 much as an equal removal in the past. Though a removal in the past, when
 very great, encreases our passions beyond a like removal in the future,
 yet a small removal has a greater influence in diminishing them.
 
 In our common way of thinking we are placed in a kind of middle station
 betwixt the past and future; and as our imagination finds a kind of
 difficulty in running along the former, and a facility in following the
 course of the latter, the difficulty conveys the notion of ascent, and
 the facility of the contrary. Hence we imagine our ancestors to be, in
 a manner, mounted above us, and our posterity to lie below us. Our fancy
 arrives not at the one without effort, but easily reaches the other:
 Which effort weakens the conception, where the distance is small; but
 enlarges and elevates the imagination, when attended with a suitable
 object. As on the other hand, the facility assists the fancy in a
 small removal, but takes off from its force when it contemplates any
 considerable distance.
 
 It may not be improper, before we leave this subject of the will, to
 resume, in a few words, all that has been said concerning it, in order
 to set the whole more distinctly before the eyes of the reader. What
 we commonly understand by passion is a violent and sensible emotion of
 mind, when any good or evil is presented, or any object, which, by the
 original formation of our faculties, is fitted to excite an appetite.
 By reason we mean affections of the very same kind with the former; but
 such as operate more calmly, and cause no disorder in the temper: Which
 tranquillity leads us into a mistake concerning them, and causes us to
 regard them as conclusions only of our intellectual faculties. Both
 the causes and effects of these violent and calm passions are pretty
 variable, and depend, in a great measure, on the peculiar temper
 and disposition of every individual. Generally speaking, the violent
 passions have a more powerful influence on the will; though it is often
 found, that the calm ones, when corroborated by reflection, and
 seconded by resolution, are able to controul them in their most furious
 movements. What makes this whole affair more uncertain, is, that a calm
 passion may easily be changed into a violent one, either by a change of
 temper, or of the circumstances and situation of the object, as by the
 borrowing of force from any attendant passion, by custom, or by exciting
 the imagination. Upon the whole, this struggle of passion and of reason,
 as it is called, diversifies human life, and makes men so different
 not only from each other, but also from themselves in different times.
 Philosophy can only account for a few of the greater and more sensible
 events of this war; but must leave all the smaller and more delicate
 revolutions, as dependent on principles too fine and minute for her
 comprehension.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. IX OF THE DIRECT PASSIONS
 
 
 It is easy to observe, that the passions, both direct and indirect, are
 founded on pain and pleasure, and that in order to produce an affection
 of any kind, it is only requisite to present some good or evil. Upon the
 removal of pain and pleasure there immediately follows a removal of love
 and hatred, pride and humility, desire and aversion, and of most of our
 reflective or secondary impressions.
 
 The impressions, which arise from good and evil most naturally, and with
 the least preparation are the direct passions of desire and aversion,
 grief and joy, hope and fear, along with volition. The mind by an
 original instinct tends to unite itself with the good, and to avoid the
 evil, though they be conceived merely in idea, and be considered as to
 exist in any future period of time.
 
 But supposing that there is an immediate impression of pain or pleasure,
 and that arising from an object related to ourselves or others, this
 does not prevent the propensity or aversion, with the consequent
 emotions, but by concurring with certain dormant principles of the human
 mind, excites the new impressions of pride or humility, love or hatred.
 That propensity, which unites us to the object, or separates us from
 it, still continues to operate, but in conjunction with the indirect
 passions, which arise from a double relation of impressions and ideas.
 
 These indirect passions, being always agreeable or uneasy, give in their
 turn additional force to the direct passions, and encrease our desire
 and aversion to the object. Thus a suit of fine cloaths produces
 pleasure from their beauty; and this pleasure produces the direct
 passions, or the impressions of volition and desire. Again, when these
 cloaths are considered as belonging to ourself, the double relation
 conveys to us the sentiment of pride, which is an indirect passion; and
 the pleasure, which attends that passion, returns back to the direct
 affections, and gives new force to our desire or volition, joy or hope.
 
 When good is certain or probable, it produces joy. When evil is in the
 same situation there arises GRIEF or SORROW.
 
 When either good or evil is uncertain, it gives rise to FEAR or HOPE,
 according to the degrees of uncertainty on the one side or the other.
 
 DESIRE arises from good considered simply, and AVERSION is derived from
 evil. The WILL exerts itself, when either the good or the absence of the
 evil may be attained by any action of the mind or body.
 
 Beside good and evil, or in other words, pain and pleasure, the direct
 passions frequently arise from a natural impulse or instinct, which is
 perfectly unaccountable. Of this kind is the desire of punishment to our
 enemies, and of happiness to our friends; hunger, lust, and a few other
 bodily appetites. These passions, properly speaking, produce good and
 evil, and proceed not from them, like the other affections.
 
 None of the direct affections seem to merit our particular attention,
 except hope and fear, which we shall here endeavour to account for.
 It is evident that the very same event, which by its certainty would
 produce grief or joy, gives always rise to fear or hope, when only
 probable and uncertain. In order, therefore, to understand the reason
 why this circumstance makes such a considerable difference, we must
 reflect on what I have already advanced in the preceding book concerning
 the nature of probability.
 
 Probability arises from an opposition of contrary chances or causes, by
 which the mind is not allowed to fix on either side, but is incessantly
 tost from one to another, and at one moment is determined to consider
 an object as existent, and at another moment as the contrary. The
 imagination or understanding, call it which you please, fluctuates
 betwixt the opposite views; and though perhaps it may be oftener turned
 to the one side than the other, it is impossible for it, by reason of
 the opposition of causes or chances, to rest on either. The pro and con
 of the question alternately prevail; and the mind, surveying the object
 in its opposite principles, finds such a contrariety as utterly destroys
 all certainty and established opinion.
 
 Suppose, then, that the object, concerning whose reality we are
 doubtful, is an object either of desire or aversion, it is evident,
 that, according as the mind turns itself either to the one side or the
 other, it must feel a momentary impression of joy or sorrow. An object,
 whose existence we desire, gives satisfaction, when we reflect on those
 causes, which produce it; and for the same reason excites grief
 or uneasiness from the opposite consideration: So that as the
 understanding, in all probable questions, is divided betwixt the
 contrary points of view, the affections must in the same manner be
 divided betwixt opposite emotions.
 
 Now if we consider the human mind, we shall find, that with regard to
 the passions, it is not the nature of a wind-instrument of music, which
 in running over all the notes immediately loses the sound after the
 breath ceases; but rather resembles a string-instrument, where after
 each stroke the vibrations still retain some sound, which gradually and
 insensibly decays. The imagination is extreme quick and agile; but the
 passions are slow and restive: For which reason, when any object is
 presented, that affords a variety of views to the one, and emotions to
 the other; though the fancy may change its views with great celerity;
 each stroke will not produce a clear and distinct note of passion,
 but the one passion will always be mixt and confounded with the other.
 According as the probability inclines to good or evil, the passion of
 joy or sorrow predominates in the composition: Because the nature of
 probability is to cast a superior number of views or chances on one
 side; or, which is the same thing, a superior number of returns of
 one passion; or since the dispersed passions are collected into one, a
 superior degree of that passion. That is, in other words, the grief and
 joy being intermingled with each other, by means of the contrary views
 of the imagination, produce by their union the passions of hope and
 fear.
 
 Upon this head there may be started a very curious question concerning
 that contrariety of passions, which is our present subject. It is
 observable, that where the objects of contrary passions are presented
 at once, beside the encrease of the predominant passion (which has
 been already explained, and commonly arises at their first shock
 or rencounter) it sometimes happens, that both the passions exist
 successively, and by short intervals; sometimes, that they destroy each
 other, and neither of them takes place; and sometimes that both of them
 remain united in the mind. It may, therefore, be asked, by what theory
 we can explain these variations, and to what general principle we can
 reduce them.
 
 When the contrary passions arise from objects entirely different, they
 take place alternately, the want of relation in the ideas separating the
 impressions from each other, and preventing their opposition. Thus when
 a man is afflicted for the loss of a law-suit, and joyful for the birth
 of a son, the mind running from the agreeable to the calamitous object,
 with whatever celerity it may perform this motion, can scarcely temper
 the one affection with the other, and remain betwixt them in a state of
 indifference.
 
 It more easily attains that calm situation, when the same event is of a
 mixt nature, and contains something adverse and something prosperous
 in its different circumstances. For in that case, both the passions,
 mingling with each other by means of the relation, become mutually
 destructive, and leave the mind in perfect tranquility.
 
 But suppose, in the third place, that the object is not a compound of
 good or evil, but is considered as probable or improbable in any degree;
 in that case I assert, that the contrary passions will both of them be
 present at once in the soul, and instead of destroying and tempering
 each other, will subsist together, and produce a third impression
 or affection by their union. Contrary passions are not capable of
 destroying each other, except when their contrary movements exactly
 rencounter, and are opposite in their direction, as well as in the
 sensation they produce. This exact rencounter depends upon the relations
 of those ideas, from which they are derived, and is more or less
 perfect, according to the degrees of the relation. In the case of
 probability the contrary chances are so far related, that they determine
 concerning the existence or non-existence of the same object. But this
 relation is far from being perfect; since some of the chances lie on
 the side of existence, and others on that of non-existence; which are
 objects altogether incompatible. It is impossible by one steady view to
 survey the opposite chances, and the events dependent on them; but it is
 necessary, that the imagination should run alternately from the one to
 the other. Each view of the imagination produces its peculiar passion,
 which decays away by degrees, and is followed by a sensible vibration
 after the stroke. The incompatibility of the views keeps the passions
 from shocking in a direct line, if that expression may be allowed; and
 yet their relation is sufficient to mingle their fainter emotions. It is
 after this manner that hope and fear arise from the different mixture of
 these opposite passions of grief and joy, and from their imperfect union
 and conjunction.
 
 Upon the whole, contrary passions succeed each other alternately, when
 they arise from different objects: They mutually destroy each other,
 when they proceed from different parts of the same: And they subsist
 both of them and mingle together, when they are derived from the
 contrary and incompatible chances or possibilities, on which any one
 object depends. The influence of the relations of ideas is plainly seen
 in this whole affair. If the objects of the contrary passions be totally
 different, the passions are like two opposite liquors in different
 bottles, which have no influence on each other. If the objects be
 intimately connected, the passions are like an alcali and an acid,
 which, being mingled, destroy each other. If the relation be more
 imperfect, and consists in the contradictory views of the same object,
 the passions are like oil and vinegar, which, however mingled, never
 perfectly unite and incorporate.
 
 As the hypothesis concerning hope and fear carries its own evidence
 along with it, we shall be the more concise in our proofs. A few strong
 arguments are better than many weak ones.
 
 The passions of fear and hope may arise when the chances are equal on
 both sides, and no superiority can be discovered in the one above the
 other. Nay, in this situation the passions are rather the strongest, as
 the mind has then the least foundation to rest upon, and is tossed with
 the greatest uncertainty. Throw in a superior degree of probability to
 the side of grief, you immediately see that passion diffuse itself over
 the composition, and tincture it into fear. Encrease the probability,
 and by that means the grief, the fear prevails still more and more, till
 at last it runs insensibly, as the joy continually diminishes, into pure
 grief. After you have brought it to this situation, diminish the
 grief, after the same manner that you encreased it; by diminishing the
 probability on that side, and you'll see the passion clear every moment,
 until it changes insensibly into hope; which again runs, after the same
 manner, by slow degrees, into joy, as you encrease that part of the
 composition by the encrease of the probability. Are not these as plain
 proofs, that the passions of fear and hope are mixtures of grief and
 joy, as in optics it is a proof, that a coloured ray of the sun passing
 through a prism, is a composition of two others, when, as you diminish
 or encrease the quantity of either, you find it prevail proportionably
 more or less in the composition? I am sure neither natural nor moral
 philosophy admits of stronger proofs.
 
 Probability is of two kinds, either when the object is really in itself
 uncertain, and to be determined by chance; or when, though the object
 be already certain, yet it is uncertain to our judgment, which finds
 a number of proofs on each side of the question. Both these kinds of
 probabilities cause fear and hope; which can only proceed from that
 property, in which they agree, viz, the uncertainty and fluctuation they
 bestow on the imagination by that contrariety of views, which is common
 to both.
 
 It is a probable good or evil, that commonly produces hope or fear;
 because probability, being a wavering and unconstant method of surveying
 an object, causes naturally a like mixture and uncertainty of passion.
 But we may observe, that wherever from other causes this mixture can be
 produced, the passions of fear and hope will arise, even though there
 be no probability; which must be allowed to be a convincing proof of the
 present hypothesis. We find that an evil, barely conceived as possible,
 does sometimes produce fear; especially if the evil be very great. A man
 cannot think of excessive pains and tortures without trembling, if he be
 in the least danger of suffering them. The smallness of the probability
 is compensated by the greatness of the evil; and the sensation is
 equally lively, as if the evil were more probable. One view or glimpse
 of the former, has the same effect as several of the latter.
 
 But they are not only possible evils, that cause fear, but even
 some allowed to be impossible; as when we tremble on the brink of a
 precipice, though we know ourselves to be in perfect security, and have
 it in our choice whether we wili advance a step farther. This
 proceeds from the immediate presence of the evil, which influences the
 imagination in the same manner as the certainty of it would do; but
 being encountered by the reflection on our security, is immediately
 retracted, and causes the same kind of passion, as when from a
 contrariety of chances contrary passions are produced.
 
 Evils, that are certain, have sometimes the same effect in producing
 fear, as the possible or impossible. Thus a man in a strong prison
 well-guarded, without the least means of escape, trembles at the thought
 of the rack, to which he is sentenced. This happens only when the
 certain evil is terrible and confounding; in which case the mind
 continually rejects it with horror, while it continually presses in
 upon the thought. The evil is there flxed and established, but the mind
 cannot endure to fix upon it; from which fluctuation and uncertainty
 there arises a passion of much the same appearance with fear.
 
 But it is not only where good or evil is uncertain, as to its existence,
 but also as to its kind, that fear or hope arises. Let one be told by
 a person, whose veracity he cannot doubt of, that one of his sons is
 suddenly killed, it is evident the passion this event would occasion,
 would not settle into pure grief, till he got certain information, which
 of his sons he had lost. Here there is an evil certain, but the kind of
 it uncertain. Consequently the fear we feel on this occasion is without
 the least mixture of joy, and arises merely from the fluctuation of the
 fancy betwixt its objects. And though each side of the question produces
 here the same passion, yet that passion cannot settle, but receives
 from the imagination a tremulous and unsteady motion, resembling in its
 cause, as well as in its sensation, the mixture and contention of grief
 and joy.
 
 From these principles we may account for a phaenomenon in the passions,
 which at first sight seems very extraordinary, viz, that surprize is apt
 to change into fear, and every thing that is unexpected affrights
 us. The most obvious conclusion from this is, that human nature is in
 general pusillanimous; since upon the sudden appearance of any object.
 we immediately conclude it to be an evil, and without waiting till we
 can examine its nature, whether it be good or bad, are at first affected
 with fear. This I say is the most obvious conclusion; but upon farther
 examination we shall find that the phaenomenon is otherwise to be
 accounted for. The suddenness and strangeness of an appearance naturally
 excite a commotion in the mind, like every thing for which we are not
 prepared, and to which we are not accustomed. This commotion, again,
 naturally produces a curiosity or inquisitiveness, which being very
 violent, from the strong and sudden impulse of the object, becomes
 uneasy, and resembles in its fluctuation and uncertainty, the sensation
 of fear or the mixed passions of grief and joy. This image of
 fear naturally converts into the thing itself, and gives us a real
 apprehension of evil, as the mind always forms its judgments more from
 its present disposition than from the nature of its objects.
 
 Thus all kinds of uncertainty have a strong connexion with fear, even
 though they do not cause any opposition of passions by the opposite
 views and considerations they present to us. A person, who has left his
 friend in any malady, will feel more anxiety upon his account, than if
 he were present, though perhaps he is not only incapable of giving him
 assistance, but likewise of judging of the event of his sickness. In
 this case, though the principal object of the passion, viz, the life or
 death of his friend, be to him equally uncertain when present as when
 absent; yet there are a thousand little circumstances of his friend's
 situation and condition, the knowledge of which fixes the idea, and
 prevents that fluctuation and uncertainty so near allyed to fear.
 Uncertainty is, indeed, in one respect as near allyed to hope as to
 fear, since it makes an essential part in the composition of the former
 passion; but the reason, why it inclines not to that side, is, that
 uncertainty alone is uneasy, and has a reladon of impressions to the
 uneasy passions.
 
 It is thus our uncertainty concerning any minute circumstance relating
 to a person encreases our apprehensions of his death or misfortune.
 Horace has remarked this phaenomenon.
 
 
 UT ASSIDENS IMPLUMI BUS PULLUS AVIS SERPENTIUM ALLAPSUS TIRNET, MAGIS
 RELICTIS; NON, UT ADSIT, AUXILI LATURA PLUS PRESENTIBUS.
 
 [As a bird, watching over her fledgelings, is more afraid of their being
 attacked by snakes if she were to leave them even though, were she to
 stay, she would not be any more capable of helping them, when they were
 with her.]
 
 
 But this principle of the connexion of fear with uncertainty I carry
 farther, and observe that any doubt produces that passion, even though
 it presents nothing to us on any side but what is good and desireable. A
 virgin, on her bridalnight goes to bed full of fears and apprehensions,
 though she expects nothing but pleasure of the highest kind, and what
 she has long wished for. The newness and greatness of the event, the
 confusion of wishes and joys so embarrass the mind, that it knows not
 on what passion to fix itself; from whence arises a fluttering or
 unsettledness of the spirits which being, in some degree, uneasy, very
 naturally degenerates into fear.
 
 Thus we still find, that whatever causes any fluctuation or mixture of
 passions, with any degree of uneasiness, always produces fear, or at
 least a passion so like it, that they are scarcely to be distinguished.
 
 I have here confined myself to the examination of hope and fear in
 their most simple and natural situation, without considering all the
 variations they may receive from the mixture of different views and
 reflections. Terror, consternation, astonishment, anxiety, and other
 passions of that kind, are nothing but different species and degrees of
 fear. It is easy to imagine how a different situation of the object, or
 a different turn of thought, may change even the sensation of a passion;
 and this may in general account for all the particular sub-divisions of
 the other affections, as well as of fear. Love may shew itself in the
 shape of tenderness, friendship, intimacy, esteem, good-will, and in
 many other appearances; which at the bottom are the same affections; and
 arise from the same causes, though with a small variation, which it is
 not necessary to give any particular account of. It is for this reason I
 have all along confined myself to the principal passion.
 
 The same care of avoiding prolixity is the reason why I wave the
 examination of the will and direct passions, as they appear in animals;
 since nothing is more evident, than that they are of the same nature,
 and excited by the same causes as in human creatures. I leave this to
 the reader's own observation; desiring him at the same time to consider
 the additional force this bestows on the present system.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. X OF CURIOSITY, OR THE LOVE OF TRUTH
 
 
 But methinks we have been not a little inattentive to run over so many
 different parts of the human mind, and examine so many passions, without
 taking once into the consideration that love of truth, which was the
 first source of all our enquiries. Twill therefore be proper, before
 we leave this subject, to bestow a few reflections on that passion, and
 shew its origin in human nature. It is an affection of so peculiar a
 kind, that it would have been impossible to have treated of it under any
 of those heads, which we have examined, without danger of obscurity and
 confusion.
 
 Truth is of two kinds, consisting either in the discovery of the
 proportions of ideas, considered as such, or in the conformity of our
 ideas of objects to their real existence. It is certain, that the former
 species of truth, is not desired merely as truth, and that it is not the
 justness of our conclusions, which alone gives the pleasure. For these
 conclusions are equally just, when we discover the equality of two
 bodies by a pair of compasses, as when we learn it by a mathematical
 demonstration; and though in the one case the proofs be demonstrative,
 and in the other only sensible, yet generally speaking, the mind
 acquiesces with equal assurance in the one as in the other. And in an
 arithmetical operation, where both the truth and the assurance are
 of the same nature, as in the most profound algebraical problem, the
 pleasure is very inconsiderable, if rather it does not degenerate
 into pain: Which is an evident proof, that the satisfaction, which we
 sometimes receive from the discovery of truth, proceeds not from it,
 merely as such, but only as endowed with certain qualities.
 
 The first and most considerable circumstance requisite to render
 truth agreeable, is the genius and capacity, which is employed in its
 invention and discovery. What is easy and obvious is never valued; and
 even what is in itself difficult, if we come to the knowledge of it
 without difficulty, and without any stretch of thought or judgment,
 is but little regarded. We love to trace the demonstrations of
 mathematicians; but should receive small entertainment from a person,
 who should barely inform us of the proportions of lines and angles,
 though we reposed the utmost confidence both in his judgment and
 veracity. In this case it is sufficient to have ears to learn the truth.
 We never are obliged to fix our attention or exert our genius; which of
 all other exercises of the mind is the most pleasant and agreeable.
 
 But though the exercise of genius be the principal source of that
 satisfaction we receive from the sciences, yet I doubt, if it be alone
 sufficient to give us any considerable enjoyment. The truth we discover
 must also be of some importance. It is easy to multiply algebraical
 problems to infinity, nor is there any end in the discovery of the
 proportions of conic sections; though few mathematicians take any
 pleasure in these researches, but turn their thoughts to what is more
 useful and important. Now the question is, after what manner this
 utility and importance operate upon us? The difficulty on this head
 arises from hence, that many philosophers have consumed their time, have
 destroyed their health, and neglected their fortune, in the search of
 such truths, as they esteemed important and useful to the world, though
 it appeared from their whole conduct and behaviour, that they were not
 endowed with any share of public spirit, nor had any concern for the
 interests of mankind. Were they convinced, that their discoveries
 were of no consequence, they would entirely lose all relish for their
 studies, and that though the consequences be entirely indifferent to
 them; which seems to be a contradiction.
 
 To remove this contradiction, we must consider, that there are certain
 desires and inclinations, which go no farther than the imagination,
 and are rather the faint shadows and images of passions, than any
 real affections. Thus, suppose a man, who takes a survey of the
 fortifications of any city; considers their strength and advantages,
 natural or acquired; observes the disposition and contrivance of the
 bastions, ramparts, mines, and other military works; it is plain, that
 in proportion as all these are fitted to attain their ends he will
 receive a suitable pleasure and satisfaction. This pleasure, as it
 arises from the utility, not the form of the objects, can be no other
 than a sympathy with the inhabitants, for whose security all this art is
 employed; though it is possible, that this person, as a stranger or an
 enemy, may in his heart have no kindness for them, or may even entertain
 a hatred against them.
 
 It may indeed be objected, that such a remote sympathy is a very slight
 foundation for a passion, and that so much industry and application,
 as we frequently observe in philosophers, can never be derived from so
 inconsiderable an original. But here I return to what I have already
 remarked, that the pleasure of study conflicts chiefly in the action
 of the mind, and the exercise of the genius and understanding in the
 discovery or comprehension of any truth. If the importance of the truth
 be requisite to compleat the pleasure, it is not on account of any
 considerable addition, which of itself it brings to our enjoyment, but
 only because it is, in some measure, requisite to fix our attention.
 When we are careless and inattentive, the same action of the
 understanding has no effect upon us, nor is able to convey any of that
 satisfaction, which arises from it, when we are in another disposition.
 
 But beside the action of the mind, which is the principal foundation
 of the pleasure, there is likewise required a degree of success in the
 attainment of the end, or the discovery of that truth we examine. Upon
 this head I shall make a general remark, which may be useful on many
 occasions, viz, that where the mind pursues any end with passion; though
 that passion be not derived originally from the end, but merely from
 the action and pursuit; yet by the natural course of the affections,
 we acquire a concern for the end itself, and are uneasy under any
 disappointment we meet with in the pursuit of it. This proceeds from the
 relation and parallel direction of the passions above-mentioned.
 
 To illustrate all this by a similar instance, I shall observe, that
 there cannot be two passions more nearly resembling each other, than
 those of hunting and philosophy, whatever disproportion may at first
 sight appear betwixt them. It is evident, that the pleasure of hunting
 conflicts in the action of the mind and body; the motion, the attention,
 the difficulty, and the uncertainty. It is evident likewise, that these
 actions must be attended with an idea of utility, in order to their
 having any effect upon us. A man of the greatest fortune, and the
 farthest removed from avarice, though he takes a pleasure in hunting
 after patridges and pheasants, feels no satisfaction in shooting crows
 and magpies; and that because he considers the first as fit for the
 table, and the other as entirely useless. Here it is certain, that the
 utility or importance of itself causes no real passion, but is
 only requisite to support the imagination; and the same person, who
 over-looks a ten times greater profit in any other subject, is pleased
 to bring home half a dozen woodcocks or plovers, after having employed
 several hours in hunting after them. To make the parallel betwixt
 hunting and philosophy more compleat, we may observe, that though in
 both cases the end of our action may in itself be despised, yet in the
 heat of the action we acquire such an attention to this end, that we are
 very uneasy under any disappointments, and are sorry when we either miss
 our game, or fall into any error in our reasoning.
 
 If we want another parallel to these affections, we may consider the
 passion of gaming, which affords a pleasure from the same principles
 as hunting and philosophy. It has been remarked, that the pleasure of
 gaming arises not from interest alone; since many leave a sure gain for
 this entertainment: Neither is it derived from the game alone; since
 the same persons have no satisfaction, when they play for nothing: But
 proceeds from both these causes united, though separately they have
 no effect. It is here, as in certain chymical preparations, where the
 mixture of two clear and transparent liquids produces a third, which is
 opaque and coloured..
 
 The interest, which we have in any game, engages our attention, without
 which we can have no enjoyment, either in that or in any other action.
 Our attention being once engaged, the difficulty, variety, and sudden
 reverses of fortune, still farther interest us; and it is from that
 concern our satisfaction arises. Human life is so tiresome a scene, and
 men generally are of such indolent dispositions, that whatever amuses
 them, though by a passion mixt with pain, does in the main give them a
 sensible pleasure. And this pleasure is here encreased by the nature of
 the objects, which being sensible, and of a narrow compass, are entered
 into with facility, and are agreeable to the imagination.
 
 The same theory, that accounts for the love of truth in mathematics and
 algebra may be extended to morals, politics, natural philosophy, and
 other studies, where we consider not the other abstract relations of
 ideas, but their real connexions and existence. But beside the love of
 knowledge, which displays itself in the sciences, there is a certain
 curiosity implanted in human nature, which is a passion derived from
 a quite different principle. Some people have an insatiable desire of
 knowing the actions and circumstances of their neighbours, though their
 interest be no way concerned in them, and they must entirely depend on
 others for their information; in which case there is no room for study
 or application. Let us search for the reason of this phaenomenon.
 
 It has been proved at large, that the influence of belief is at once to
 inliven and infix any idea in the imagination, and prevent all kind
 of hesitation and uncertainty about it. Both these circumstances are
 advantageous. By the vivacity of the idea we interest the fancy, and
 produce, though in a lesser degree, the same pleasure, which arises from
 a moderate passion. As the vivacity of the idea gives pleasure, so its
 certainty prevents uneasiness, by fixing one particular idea in the
 mind, and keeping it from wavering in the choice of its objects. It is a
 quality of human nature, which is conspicuous on many occasions, and is
 common both to the mind and body, that too sudden and violent a change
 is unpleasant to us, and that however any objects may in themselves be
 indifferent, yet their alteration gives uneasiness. As it is the nature
 of doubt to cause a variation in the thought, and transport us suddenly
 from one idea to another, it must of consequence be the occasion of
 pain. This pain chiefly takes place, where interest, relation, or the
 greatness and novelty of any event interests us in it. It is not every
 matter of fact, of which we have a curiosity to be informed; neither are
 they such only as we have an interest to know. It is sufficient if the
 idea strikes on us with such force, and concerns us so nearly, as to
 give us an uneasiness in its instability and inconstancy. A stranger,
 when he arrives first at any town, may be entirely indifferent about
 knowing the history and adventures of the inhabitants; but as he becomes
 farther acquainted with them, and has lived any considerable time among
 them, he acquires the same curiosity as the natives. When we are reading
 the history of a nation, we may have an ardent desire of clearing up
 any doubt or difficulty, that occurs in it; but become careless in such
 researches, when the ideas of these events are, in a great measure,
 obliterated.

 PART I OF VIRTUE AND VICE IN GENERAL
 
 
 
 
 SECT. I MORAL DISTINCTIONS NOT DERIVed FROM REASON
 
 
 There is an inconvenience which attends all abstruse reasoning that
 it may silence, without convincing an antagonist, and requires the
 same intense study to make us sensible of its force, that was at first
 requisite for its invention. When we leave our closet, and engage in
 the common affairs of life, its conclusions seem to vanish, like the
 phantoms of the night on the appearance of the morning; and it is
 difficult for us to retain even that conviction, which we had attained
 with difficulty. This is still more conspicuous in a long chain of
 reasoning, where we must preserve to the end the evidence of the first
 propositions, and where we often lose sight of all the most received
 maxims, either of philosophy or common life. I am not, however, without
 hopes, that the present system of philosophy will acquire new force as
 it advances; and that our reasonings concerning morals will corroborate
 whatever has been said concerning the UNDERSTANDING and the PASSIONS.
 Morality is a subject that interests us above all others: We fancy the
 peace of society to be at stake in every decision concerning it; and
 it is evident, that this concern must make our speculations appear
 more real and solid, than where the subject is, in a great measure,
 indifferent to us. What affects us, we conclude can never be a chimera;
 and as our passion is engaged on the one side or the other, we naturally
 think that the question lies within human comprehension; which, in other
 cases of this nature, we are apt to entertain some doubt of. Without
 this advantage I never should have ventured upon a third volume of such
 abstruse philosophy, in an age, wherein the greatest part of men seem
 agreed to convert reading into an amusement, and to reject every thing
 that requires any considerable degree of attention to be comprehended.
 
 It has been observed, that nothing is ever present to the mind but
 its perceptions; and that all the actions of seeing, hearing, judging,
 loving, hating, and thinking, fall under this denomination. The mind can
 never exert itself in any action, which we may not comprehend under the
 term of perception; and consequently that term is no less applicable to
 those judgments, by which we distinguish moral good and evil, than
 to every other operation of the mind. To approve of one character, to
 condemn another, are only so many different perceptions.
 
 Now as perceptions resolve themselves into two kinds, viz. impressions
 and ideas, this distinction gives rise to a question, with which we
 shall open up our present enquiry concerning morals. WHETHER IT IS
 BY MEANS OF OUR IDEAS OR IMPRESSIONS WE DISTINGUISH BETWIXT VICE AND
 VIRTUE, AND PRONOUNCE AN ACTION BLAMEABLE OR PRAISEWORTHY? This will
 immediately cut off all loose discourses and declamations, and reduce us
 to something precise and exact on the present subject.
 
 Those who affirm that virtue is nothing but a conformity to reason; that
 there are eternal fitnesses and unfitnesses of things, which are the
 same to every rational being that considers them; that the immutable
 measures of right and wrong impose an obligation, not only on human
 creatures, but also on the Deity himself: All these systems concur in
 the opinion, that morality, like truth, is discerned merely by ideas,
 and by their juxta-position and comparison. In order, therefore, to
 judge of these systems, we need only consider, whether it be possible,
 from reason alone, to distinguish betwixt moral good and evil, or
 whether there must concur some other principles to enable us to make
 that distinction.
 
 If morality had naturally no influence on human passions and actions,
 it were in vain to take such pains to inculcate it; and nothing would be
 more fruitless than that multitude of rules and precepts, with which all
 moralists abound. Philosophy is commonly divided into speculative and
 practical; and as morality is always comprehended under the latter
 division, it is supposed to influence our passions and actions, and to
 go beyond the calm and indolent judgments of the understanding. And this
 is confirmed by common experience, which informs us, that men are often
 governed by their duties, and are detered from some actions by the
 opinion of injustice, and impelled to others by that of obligation.
 
 Since morals, therefore, have an influence on the actions and
 affections, it follows, that they cannot be derived from reason; and
 that because reason alone, as we have already proved, can never have any
 such influence. Morals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions.
 Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of
 morality therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.
 
 No one, I believe, will deny the justness of this inference; nor is
 there any other means of evading it, than by denying that principle,
 on which it is founded. As long as it is allowed, that reason has no
 influence on our passions and action, it is in vain to pretend,
 that morality is discovered only by a deduction of reason. An active
 principle can never be founded on an inactive; and if reason be inactive
 in itself, it must remain so in all its shapes and appearances, whether
 it exerts itself in natural or moral subjects, whether it considers the
 powers of external bodies, or the actions of rational beings.
 
 It would be tedious to repeat all the arguments, by which I have proved
 [Book II. Part III. Sect 3.], that reason is perfectly inert, and can
 never either prevent or produce any action or affection, it will be easy
 to recollect what has been said upon that subject. I shall only recall
 on this occasion one of these arguments, which I shall endeavour
 to render still more conclusive, and more applicable to the present
 subject.
 
 Reason is the discovery of truth or falshood. Truth or falshood consists
 in an agreement or disagreement either to the real relations of ideas,
 or to real existence and matter of fact. Whatever, therefore, is not
 susceptible of this agreement or disagreement, is incapable of being
 true or false, and can never be an object of our reason. Now it is
 evident our passions, volitions, and actions, are not susceptible of
 any such agreement or disagreement; being original facts and realities,
 compleat in themselves, and implying no reference to other passions,
 volitions, and actions. It is impossible, therefore, they can be
 pronounced either true or false, and be either contrary or conformable
 to reason.
 
 This argument is of double advantage to our present purpose. For
 it proves DIRECTLY, that actions do not derive their merit from a
 conformity to reason, nor their blame from a contrariety to it; and it
 proves the same truth more INDIRECTLY, by shewing us, that as reason
 can never immediately prevent or produce any action by contradicting or
 approving of it, it cannot be the source of moral good and evil, which
 are found to have that influence. Actions may be laudable or blameable;
 but they cannot be reasonable: Laudable or blameable, therefore, are
 not the same with reasonable or unreasonable. The merit and demerit
 of actions frequently contradict, and sometimes controul our natural
 propensities. But reason has no such influence. Moral distinctions,
 therefore, are not the offspring of reason. Reason is wholly inactive,
 and can never be the source of so active a principle as conscience, or a
 sense of morals.
 
 But perhaps it may be said, that though no will or action can
 be immediately contradictory to reason, yet we may find such a
 contradiction in some of the attendants of the action, that is, in its
 causes or effects. The action may cause a judgment, or may be obliquely
 caused by one, when the judgment concurs with a passion; and by an
 abusive way of speaking, which philosophy will scarce allow of, the same
 contrariety may, upon that account, be ascribed to the action. How
 far this truth or faishood may be the source of morals, it will now be
 proper to consider.
 
 It has been observed, that reason, in a strict and philosophical sense,
 can have influence on our conduct only after two ways: Either when it
 excites a passion by informing us of the existence of something which is
 a proper object of it; or when it discovers the connexion of causes and
 effects, so as to afford us means of exerting any passion. These are the
 only kinds of judgment, which can accompany our actions, or can be
 said to produce them in any manner; and it must be allowed, that these
 judgments may often be false and erroneous. A person may be affected
 with passion, by supposing a pain or pleasure to lie in an object, which
 has no tendency to produce either of these sensations, or which produces
 the contrary to what is imagined. A person may also take false measures
 for the attaining his end, and may retard, by his foolish conduct,
 instead of forwarding the execution of any project. These false
 judgments may be thought to affect the passions and actions, which are
 connected with them, and may be said to render them unreasonable, in
 a figurative and improper way of speaking. But though this be
 acknowledged, it is easy to observe, that these errors are so far
 from being the source of all immorality, that they are commonly
 very innocent, and draw no manner of guilt upon the person who is so
 unfortunate as to fail into them. They extend not beyond a mistake of
 fact, which moralists have not generally supposed criminal, as being
 perfectly involuntary. I am more to be lamented than blamed, if I am
 mistaken with regard to the influence of objects in producing pain or
 pleasure, or if I know not the proper means of satisfying my desires.
 No one can ever regard such errors as a defect in my moral character.
 A fruit, for instance, that is really disagreeable, appears to me at a
 distance, and through mistake I fancy it to be pleasant and delicious.
 Here is one error. I choose certain means of reaching this fruit, which
 are not proper for my end. Here is a second error; nor is there any
 third one, which can ever possibly enter into our reasonings concerning
 actions. I ask, therefore, if a man, in this situation, and guilty of
 these two errors, is to be regarded as vicious and criminal, however
 unavoidable they might have been? Or if it be possible to imagine, that
 such errors are the sources of all immorality?
 
 And here it may be proper to observe, that if moral distinctions be
 derived from the truth or falshood of those judgments, they must take
 place wherever we form the judgments; nor will there be any difference,
 whether the question be concerning an apple or a kingdom, or whether the
 error be avoidable or unavoidable. For as the very essence of morality
 is supposed to consist in an agreement or disagreement to reason, the
 other circumstances are entirely arbitrary, and can never either bestow
 on any action the character of virtuous or vicious, or deprive it
 of that character. To which we may add, that this agreement or
 disagreement, not admitting of degrees, all virtues and vices would of
 course be equal.
 
 Should it be pretended, that though a mistake of fact be not criminal,
 yet a mistake of right often is; and that this may be the source of
 immorality: I would answer, that it is impossible such a mistake can
 ever be the original source of immorality, since it supposes a real
 right and wrong; that is, a real distinction in morals, independent of
 these judgments. A mistake, therefore, of right may become a species
 of immorality; but it is only a secondary one, and is founded on some
 other, antecedent to it.
 
 As to those judgments which are the effects of our actions, and which,
 when false, give occasion to pronounce the actions contrary to truth
 and reason; we may observe, that our actions never cause any judgment,
 either true or false, in ourselves, and that it is only on others
 they have such an influence. It is certain, that an action, on many
 occasions, may give rise to false conclusions in others; and that a
 person, who through a window sees any lewd behaviour of mine with my
 neighbour's wife, may be so simple as to imagine she is certainly my
 own. In this respect my action resembles somewhat a lye or falshood;
 only with this difference, which is material, that I perform not the
 action with any intention of giving rise to a false judgment in another,
 but merely to satisfy my lust and passion. It causes, however, a mistake
 and false judgment by accident; and the falshood of its effects may be
 ascribed, by some odd figurative way of speaking, to the action itself.
 But still I can see no pretext of reason for asserting, that the
 tendency to cause such an error is the first spring or original source
 of all immorality.
 
 
 
      [Footnote 12.  One might think it were entirely superfluous
      to prove this, if a late author [William Wollaston, THE
      RELIGION OF NATURE DELINEATED (London 1722)], who has had
      the good fortune to obtain some reputation, had not
      seriously affirmed, that such a falshood is the foundation
      of all guilt and moral deformity. That we may discover the
      fallacy of his hypothesis, we need only consider, that a
      false conclusion is drawn from an action, only by means of
      an obscurity of natural principles, which makes a cause be
      secretly interrupted In its operation, by contrary causes,
      and renders the connexion betwixt two objects uncertain and
      variable. Now, as a like uncertainty and variety of causes
      take place, even in natural objects, and produce a like
      error in our judgment, if that tendency to produce error
      were the very essence of vice and immorality, it should
      follow, that even inanimate objects might be vicious and
      immoral.
 
      One might think It were entirely superfluous to prove this,
      if a late author [William Wollaston, THE RELIGION OF NATURE
      DELINEATED (London 1722)], who has had the good fortune to
      obtain some reputation, had not seriously affirmed, that
      such a falshood is the foundation of all guilt and moral
      deformity. That we may discover the fallacy of his
      hypothesis, we need only consider, that a false conclusion
      is drawn from an action, only by means of an obscurity of
      natural principles, which makes a cause be secretly
      interrupted In its operation, by contrary causes, and
      renders the connexion betwixt two objects uncertain and
      variable. Now, as a like uncertainty and variety of causes
      take place, even in natural objects, and produce a like
      error in our judgment, if that tendency to produce error
      were the very essence of vice and immorality, it should
      follow, that even inanimate objects might be vicious and
      immoral.
 
      It is in vain to urge, that inanimate objects act without
      liberty and choice. For as liberty and choice are not
      necessary to make an action produce in us an erroneous
      conclusion, they can be, in no respect, essential to
      morality; and I do not readily perceive, upon this system,
      how they can ever come to be regarded by it. If the tendency
      to cause error be the origin of immorality, that tendency
      and immorality would in every case be inseparable.
 
      Add to this, that if I had used the precaution of shutting
      the windows, while I indulged myself in those liberties with
      my neighbour's wife, I should have been guilty of no
      immorality; and that because my action, being perfectly
      concealed, would have had no tendency to produce any false
      conclusion.
 
      For the same reason, a thief, who steals In by a ladder at a
      window, and takes all imaginable care to cause no
      disturbance, is in no respect criminal. For either he will
      not be perceived, or if he be, it is impossible he can
      produce any error, nor will any one, from these
      circumstances, take him to be other than what he really is.
 
      It is well known, that those who are squint-sighted, do very
      readily cause mistakes in others, and that we Imagine they
      salute or are talking to one person, while they address
      themselves to anther. Are they therefore, upon that account,
      immoral?
 
      Besides, we may easily observe, that in all those arguments
      there is an evident reasoning in a circle. A person who
      takes possession of another's goods, and uses them as his
      own, in a manner declares them to be his own; and this
      falshood is the source of the immorality of injustice. But
      is property, or right, or obligation, intelligible, without
      an antecedent morality?
 
      A man that is ungrateful to his benefactor, in a manner
      affirms, that he never received any favours from him. But in
      what manner? Is it because it is his duty to be grateful?
      But this supposes, that there is some antecedent rule of
      duty and morals. Is it because human nature is generally
      grateful, and makes us conclude, that a man who does any
      harm never received any favour from the person he harmed?
      But human nature is not so generally grateful, as to justify
      such a conclusion. Or if it were, is an exception to a
      general rule in every case criminal, for no other reason
      than because it is an exception?
 
      But what may suffice entirely to destroy this whimsical
      system is, that it leaves us under the same difficulty to
      give a reason why truth is virtuous and falshood vicious, as
      to account for the merit or turpitude of any other action. I
      shall allow, if you please, that all immorality is derived
      from this supposed falshood in action, provided you can give
      me any plausible reason, why such a falshood is immoral. If
      you consider rightly of the matter, you will find yourself
      in the same difficulty as at the beginning.
 
      This last argument is very conclusive; because, if there be
      not an evident merit or turpitude annexed to this species of
      truth or falahood, It can never have any influence upon our
      actions. For, who ever thought of forbearing any action,
      because others might possibly draw false conclusions from
      it? Or, who ever performed any, that he might give rise to
      true conclusions?]
 
 
 Thus upon the whole, it is impossible, that the distinction betwixt
 moral good and evil, can be made to reason; since that distinction
 has an influence upon our actions, of which reason alone is incapable.
 Reason and judgment may, indeed, be the mediate cause of an action, by
 prompting, or by directing a passion: But it is not pretended, that a
 judgment of this kind, either in its truth or falshood, is attended
 with virtue or vice. And as to the judgments, which are caused by our
 judgments, they can still less bestow those moral qualities on the
 actions, which are their causes.
 
 But to be more particular, and to shew, that those eternal immutable
 fitnesses and unfitnesses of things cannot be defended by sound
 philosophy, we may weigh the following considerations.
 
 If the thought and understanding were alone capable of fixing the
 boundaries of right and wrong, the character of virtuous and vicious
 either must lie in some relations of objects, or must be a matter of
 fact, which is discovered by our reasoning. This consequence is evident.
 As the operations of human understanding divide themselves into two
 kinds, the comparing of ideas, and the inferring of matter of fact; were
 virtue discovered by the understanding; it must be an object of one of
 these operations, nor is there any third operation of the understanding.
 which can discover it. There has been an opinion very industriously
 propagated by certain philosophers, that morality is susceptible of
 demonstration; and though no one has ever been able to advance a single
 step in those demonstrations; yet it is taken for granted, that this
 science may be brought to an equal certainty with geometry or algebra.
 Upon this supposition vice and virtue must consist in some relations;
 since it is allowed on all hands, that no matter of fact is capable
 of being demonstrated. Let us, therefore, begin with examining this
 hypothesis, and endeavour, if possible, to fix those moral qualities,
 which have been so long the objects of our fruitless researches. Point
 out distinctly the relations, which constitute morality or obligation,
 that we may know wherein they consist, and after what manner we must
 judge of them.
 
 If you assert, that vice and virtue consist in relations susceptible
 of certainty and demonstration, you must confine yourself to those four
 relations, which alone admit of that degree of evidence; and in that
 case you run into absurdities, from which you will never be able to
 extricate yourself. For as you make the very essence of morality to lie
 in the relations, and as there is no one of these relations but what is
 applicable, not only to an irrational, but also to an inanimate object;
 it follows, that even such objects must be susceptible of merit or
 demerit. RESEMBLANCE, CONTRARIETY, DEGREES IN QUALITY, and PROPORTIONS
 IN QUANTITY AND NUMBER; all these relations belong as properly
 to matter, as to our actions, passions, and volitions. It is
 unquestionable, therefore, that morality lies not in any of these
 relations, nor the sense of it in their discovery.
 
 
      [Footnote 13.  As a proof, how confused our way of thinking
      on this subject commonly is, we may observe, that those who
      assert, that morality is demonstrable, do not say, that
      morality lies in the relations, and that the relations are
      distinguishable by reason. They only say, that reason can
      discover such an action, In such relations, to be virtuous,
      and such another vicious. It seems they thought it
      sufficient, if they could bring the word, Relation, into the
      proposition, without troubling themselves whether it was to
      the purpose or not. But here, I think, is plain argument.
      Demonstrative reason discovers only relations. But that
      reason, according to this hypothesis, discovers also vice
      and virtue. These moral qualities, therefore, must be
      relations. When we blame any action, in any situation, the
      whole complicated object, of action and situation, must form
      certain relations, wherein the essence of vice consists.
      This hypothesis is not otherwise intelligible. For what does
      reason discover, when it pronounces any action vicious? Does
      it discover a relation or a matter of fact? These questions
      are decisive, and must not be eluded.]
 
 Should it be asserted, that the sense of morality consists in
 the discovery of some relation, distinct from these, and that our
 enumeration was not compleat, when we comprehended all demonstrable
 relations under four general heads: To this I know not what to reply,
 till some one be so good as to point out to me this new relation. It is
 impossible to refute a system, which has never yet been explained. In
 such a manner of fighting in the dark, a man loses his blows in the air,
 and often places them where the enemy is not present.
 
 I must, therefore, on this occasion, rest contented with requiring the
 two following conditions of any one that would undertake to clear up
 this system. First, As moral good and evil belong only to the actions
 of the mind, and are derived from our situation with regard to external
 objects, the relations, from which these moral distinctions arise, must
 lie only betwixt internal actions, and external objects, and must not be
 applicable either to internal actions, compared among themselves, or to
 external objects, when placed in opposition to other external objects.
 For as morality is supposed to attend certain relations, if these
 relations coued belong to internal actions considered singly, it would
 follow, that we might be guilty of crimes in ourselves, and independent
 of our situation, with respect to the universe: And in like manner, if
 these moral relations coued be applied to external objects, it would
 follow, that even inanimate beings would be susceptible of moral beauty
 and deformity. Now it seems difficult to imagine, that any relation can
 be discovered betwixt our passions, volitions and actions, compared
 to external objects, which relation might not belong either to these
 passions and volitions, or to these external objects, compared among
 themselves. But it will be still more difficult to fulfil the second
 condition, requisite to justify this system. According to the principles
 of those who maintain an abstract rational difference betwixt moral good
 and evil, and a natural fitness and unfitness of things, it is not only
 supposed, that these relations, being eternal and immutable, are the
 same, when considered by every rational creature, but their effects are
 also supposed to be necessarily the same; and it is concluded they have
 no less, or rather a greater, influence in directing the will of the
 deity, than in governing the rational and virtuous of our own species.
 These two particulars are evidently distinct. It is one thing to know
 virtue, and another to conform the will to it. In order, therefore, to
 prove, that the measures of right and wrong are eternal laws, obligatory
 on every rational mind, it is not sufficient to shew the relations upon
 which they are founded: We must also point out the connexion betwixt
 the relation and the will; and must prove that this connexion is so
 necessary, that in every well-disposed mind, it must take place and have
 its influence; though the difference betwixt these minds be in other
 respects immense and infinite. Now besides what I have already proved,
 that even in human nature no relation can ever alone produce any
 action: besides this, I say, it has been shewn, in treating of the
 understanding, that there is no connexion of cause and effect, such
 as this is supposed to be, which is discoverable otherwise than by
 experience, and of which we can pretend to have any security by the
 simple consideration of the objects. All beings in the universe,
 considered in themselves, appear entirely loose and independent of each
 other. It is only by experience we learn their influence and connexion;
 and this influence we ought never to extend beyond experience.
 
 Thus it will be impossible to fulfil the first condition required to the
 system of eternal measures of right and wrong; because it is impossible
 to shew those relations, upon which such a distinction may be founded:
 And it is as impossible to fulfil the second condition; because we
 cannot prove A PRIORI, that these relations, if they really existed and
 were perceived, would be universally forcible and obligatory.
 
 But to make these general reflections more dear and convincing, we may
 illustrate them by some particular instances, wherein this character of
 moral good or evil is the most universally acknowledged. Of all crimes
 that human creatures are capable of committing, the most horrid and
 unnatural is ingratitude, especially when it is committed against
 parents, and appears in the more flagrant instances of wounds and death.
 This is acknowledged by all mankind, philosophers as well as the people;
 the question only arises among philosophers, whether the guilt or moral
 deformity of this action be discovered by demonstrative reasoning, or
 be felt by an internal sense, and by means of some sentiment, which the
 reflecting on such an action naturally occasions. This question will
 soon be decided against the former opinion, if we can shew the same
 relations in other objects, without the notion of any guilt or iniquity
 attending them. Reason or science is nothing but the comparing of ideas,
 and the discovery of their relations; and if the same relations have
 different characters, it must evidently follow, that those characters
 are not discovered merely by reason. To put the affair, therefore, to
 this trial, let us chuse any inanimate object, such as an oak or elm;
 and let us suppose, that by the dropping of its seed, it produces a
 sapling below it, which springing up by degrees, at last overtops and
 destroys the parent tree: I ask, if in this instance there be wanting
 any relation, which is discoverable in parricide or ingratitude? Is
 not the one tree the cause of the other's existence; and the latter the
 cause of the destruction of the former, in the same manner as when a
 child murders his parent? It is not sufficient to reply, that a choice
 or will is wanting. For in the case of parricide, a will does not give
 rise to any DIFFERENT relations, but is only the cause from which the
 action is derived; and consequently produces the same relations, that in
 the oak or elm arise from some other principles. It is a will or choice,
 that determines a man to kill his parent; and they are the laws of
 matter and motion, that determine a sapling to destroy the oak, from
 which it sprung. Here then the same relations have different causes; but
 still the relations are the same: And as their discovery is not in both
 cases attended with a notion of immorality, it follows, that that notion
 does not arise from such a discovery.
 
 But to chuse an instance, still more resembling; I would fain ask any
 one, why incest in the human species is criminal, and why the very same
 action, and the same relations in animals have not the smallest moral
 turpitude and deformity? If it be answered, that this action is innocent
 in animals, because they have not reason sufficient to discover its
 turpitude; but that man, being endowed with that faculty which ought to
 restrain him to his duty, the same action instantly becomes criminal to
 him; should this be said, I would reply, that this is evidently
 arguing in a circle. For before reason can perceive this turpitude, the
 turpitude must exist; and consequently is independent of the decisions
 of our reason, and is their object more properly than their effect.
 According to this system, then, every animal, that has sense, and
 appetite, and will; that is, every animal must be susceptible of all the
 same virtues and vices, for which we ascribe praise and blame to human
 creatures. All the difference is, that our superior reason may serve to
 discover the vice or virtue, and by that means may augment the blame
 or praise: But still this discovery supposes a separate being in these
 moral distinctions, and a being, which depends only on the will and
 appetite, and which, both in thought and reality, may be distinguished
 from the reason. Animals are susceptible of the same relations, with
 respect to each other, as the human species, and therefore would also be
 susceptible of the same morality, if the essence of morality consisted
 in these relations. Their want of a sufficient degree of reason may
 hinder them from perceiving the duties and obligations of morality,
 but can never hinder these duties from existing; since they must
 antecedently exist, in order to their being perceived. Reason must find
 them, and can never produce them. This argument deserves to be weighed,
 as being, in my opinion, entirely decisive.
 
 Nor does this reasoning only prove, that morality consists not in any
 relations, that are the objects of science; but if examined, will prove
 with equal certainty, that it consists not in any matter of fact, which
 can be discovered by the understanding. This is the second part of our
 argument; and if it can be made evident, we may conclude, that morality
 is not an object of reason. But can there be any difficulty in proving,
 that vice and virtue are not matters of fact, whose existence we can
 infer by reason? Take any action allowed to be vicious: Wilful murder,
 for instance. Examine it in all lights, and see if you can find that
 matter of fact, or real existence, which you call vice. In which-ever
 way you take it, you find only certain passions, motives, volitions
 and thoughts. There is no other matter of fact in the case. The vice
 entirely escapes you, as long as you consider the object. You never can
 find it, till you turn your reflection into your own breast, and find a
 sentiment of disapprobation, which arises in you, towards this action.
 Here is a matter of fact; but it is the object of feeling, not of
 reason. It lies in yourself, not in the object. So that when you
 pronounce any action or character to be vicious, you mean nothing,
 but that from the constitution of your nature you have a feeling or
 sentiment of blame from the contemplation of it. Vice and virtue,
 therefore, may be compared to sounds, colours, heat and cold, which,
 according to modern philosophy, are not qualities in objects, but
 perceptions in the mind: And this discovery in morals, like that other
 in physics, is to be regarded as a considerable advancement of the
 speculative sciences; though, like that too, it has little or no
 influence on practice. Nothing can be more real, or concern us more,
 than our own sentiments of pleasure and uneasiness; and if these be
 favourable to virtue, and unfavourable to vice, no more can be requisite
 to the regulation of our conduct and behaviour.
 
 I cannot forbear adding to these reasonings an observation, which may,
 perhaps, be found of some importance. In every system of morality,
 which I have hitherto met with, I have always remarked, that the author
 proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes
 the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs;
 when of a sudden I am surprized to find, that instead of the usual
 copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no proposition
 that is not connected with an ought, or an ought not. This change is
 imperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence. For as this
 ought, or ought not, expresses some new relation or affirmation, it is
 necessary that it should be observed and explained; and at the same time
 that a reason should be given, for what seems altogether inconceivable,
 how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely
 different from it. But as authors do not commonly use this precaution,
 I shall presume to recommend it to the readers; and am persuaded, that
 this small attention would subvert all the vulgar systems of morality,
 and let us see, that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded
 merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceived by reason.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. II MORAL DISTINCTIONS DERIVed FROM A MORAL SENSE
 
 
 Thus the course of the argument leads us to conclude, that since vice
 and virtue are not discoverable merely by reason, or the comparison
 of ideas, it must be by means of some impression or sentiment they
 occasion, that we are able to mark the difference betwixt them. Our
 decisions concerning moral rectitude and depravity are evidently
 perceptions; and as all perceptions are either impressions or ideas, the
 exclusion of the one is a convincing argument for the other. Morality,
 therefore, is more properly felt than judged of; though this feeling or
 sentiment is commonly so soft and gentle, that we are apt to confound
 it with an idea, according to our common custom of taking all things for
 the same, which have any near resemblance to each other.
 
 The next question is, Of what nature are these impressions, and after
 what manner do they operate upon us? Here we cannot remain long in
 suspense, but must pronounce the impression arising from virtue, to
 be agreeable, and that proceding from vice to be uneasy. Every moments
 experience must convince us of this. There is no spectacle so fair and
 beautiful as a noble and generous action; nor any which gives us more
 abhorrence than one that is cruel and treacherous. No enjoyment equals
 the satisfaction we receive from the company of those we love and
 esteem; as the greatest of all punishments is to be obliged to pass our
 lives with those we hate or contemn. A very play or romance may afford
 us instances of this pleasure, which virtue conveys to us; and pain,
 which arises from vice.
 
 Now since the distinguishing impressions, by which moral good or evil is
 known, are nothing but particular pains or pleasures; it follows,
 that in all enquiries concerning these moral distinctions, it will be
 sufficient to shew the principles, which make us feel a satisfaction or
 uneasiness from the survey of any character, in order to satisfy us
 why the character is laudable or blameable. An action, or sentiment,
 or character is virtuous or vicious; why? because its view causes
 a pleasure or uneasiness of a particular kind. In giving a reason,
 therefore, for the pleasure or uneasiness, we sufficiently explain the
 vice or virtue. To have the sense of virtue, is nothing but to feel a
 satisfaction of a particular kind from the contemplation of a character.
 The very feeling constitutes our praise or admiration. We go no farther;
 nor do we enquire into the cause of the satisfaction. We do not infer
 a character to be virtuous, because it pleases: But in feeling that it
 pleases after such a particular manner, we in effect feel that it is
 virtuous. The case is the same as in our judgments concerning all kinds
 of beauty, and tastes, and sensations. Our approbation is implyed in the
 immediate pleasure they convey to us.
 
 I have objected to the system, which establishes eternal rational
 measures of right and wrong, that it is impossible to shew, in the
 actions of reasonable creatures, any relations, which are not found
 in external objects; and therefore, if morality always attended these
 relations, it were possible for inanimate matter to become virtuous or
 vicious. Now it may, in like manner, be objected to the present system,
 that if virtue and vice be determined by pleasure and pain, these
 qualities must, in every case, arise from the sensations; and
 consequently any object, whether animate or inanimate, rational or
 irrational, might become morally good or evil, provided it can excite
 a satisfaction or uneasiness. But though this objection seems to be the
 very same, it has by no means the same force, in the one case as in
 the other. For, first, tis evident, that under the term pleasure, we
 comprehend sensations, which are very different from each other, and
 which have only such a distant resemblance, as is requisite to make them
 be expressed by the same abstract term. A good composition of music and
 a bottle of good wine equally produce pleasure; and what is more, their
 goodness is determined merely by the pleasure. But shall we say upon
 that account, that the wine is harmonious, or the music of a good
 flavour? In like manner an inanimate object, and the character or
 sentiments of any person may, both of them, give satisfaction; but as
 the satisfaction is different, this keeps our sentiments concerning them
 from being confounded, and makes us ascribe virtue to the one, and not
 to the other. Nor is every sentiment of pleasure or pain, which arises
 from characters and actions, of that peculiar kind, which makes us
 praise or condemn. The good qualities of an enemy are hurtful to us; but
 may still command our esteem and respect. It is only when a character
 is considered in general, without reference to our particular interest,
 that it causes such a feeling or sentiment, as denominates it morally
 good or evil. It is true, those sentiments, from interest and morals,
 are apt to be confounded, and naturally run into one another. It seldom
 happens, that we do not think an enemy vicious, and can distinguish
 betwixt his opposition to our interest and real villainy or baseness.
 But this hinders not, but that the sentiments are, in themselves,
 distinct; and a man of temper and judgment may preserve himself from
 these illusions. In like manner, though it is certain a musical voice is
 nothing but one that naturally gives a particular kind of pleasure; yet
 it is difficult for a man to be sensible, that the voice of an enemy is
 agreeable, or to allow it to be musical. But a person of a fine ear, who
 has the command of himself, can separate these feelings, and give praise
 to what deserves it.
 
 SECONDLY, We may call to remembrance the preceding system of the
 passions, in order to remark a still more considerable difference
 among our pains and pleasures. Pride and humility, love and hatred are
 excited, when there is any thing presented to us, that both bears a
 relation to the object of the passion, and produces a separate sensation
 related to the sensation of the passion. Now virtue and vice are
 attended with these circumstances. They must necessarily be placed
 either in ourselves or others, and excite either pleasure or uneasiness;
 and therefore must give rise to one of these four passions; which
 clearly distinguishes them from the pleasure and pain arising from
 inanimate objects, that often bear no relation to us: And this is,
 perhaps, the most considerable effect that virtue and vice have upon the
 human mind.
 
 It may now be asked in general, concerning this pain or pleasure, that
 distinguishes moral good and evil, FROM WHAT PRINCIPLES IS IT DERIVED,
 AND WHENCE DOES IT ARISE IN THE HUMAN MIND? To this I reply, first,
 that it is absurd to imagine, that in every particular instance, these
 sentiments are produced by an original quality and primary constitution.
 For as the number of our duties is, in a manner, infinite, it is
 impossible that our original instincts should extend to each of them,
 and from our very first infancy impress on the human mind all that
 multitude of precepts, which are contained in the compleatest system
 of ethics. Such a method of proceeding is not conformable to the usual
 maxims, by which nature is conducted, where a few principles produce all
 that variety we observe in the universe, and every thing is carryed on
 in the easiest and most simple manner. It is necessary, therefore, to
 abridge these primary impulses, and find some more general principles,
 upon which all our notions of morals are founded.
 
 But in the second place, should it be asked, Whether we ought to search
 for these principles in nature, or whether we must look for them in some
 other origin? I would reply, that our answer to this question depends
 upon the definition of the word, Nature, than which there is none more
 ambiguous and equivocal. If nature be opposed to miracles, not only the
 distinction betwixt vice and virtue is natural, but also every event,
 which has ever happened in the world, EXCEPTING THOSE MIRACLES, ON WHICH
 OUR RELIGION IS FOUNDED. In saying, then, that the sentiments of vice
 and virtue are natural in this sense, we make no very extraordinary
 discovery.
 
 But nature may also be opposed to rare and unusual; and in this sense
 of the word, which is the common one, there may often arise disputes
 concerning what is natural or unnatural; and one may in general affirm,
 that we are not possessed of any very precise standard, by which these
 disputes can be decided. Frequent and rare depend upon the number of
 examples we have observed; and as this number may gradually encrease
 or diminish, it will be impossible to fix any exact boundaries betwixt
 them. We may only affirm on this head, that if ever there was any thing,
 which coued be called natural in this sense, the sentiments of morality
 certainly may; since there never was any nation of the world, nor any
 single person in any nation, who was utterly deprived of them, and
 who never, in any instance, shewed the least approbation or dislike of
 manners. These sentiments are so rooted in our constitution and temper,
 that without entirely confounding the human mind by disease or madness,
 it is impossible to extirpate and destroy them.
 
 But nature may also be opposed to artifice, as well as to what is rare
 and unusual; and in this sense it may be disputed, whether the notions
 of virtue be natural or not. We readily forget, that the designs,
 and projects, and views of men are principles as necessary in their
 operation as heat and cold, moist and dry: But taking them to be free
 and entirely our own, it is usual for us to set them in opposition
 to the other principles of nature should it, therefore, be demanded,
 whether the sense of virtue be natural or artificial, I am of opinion,
 that it is impossible for me at present to give any precise answer to
 this question. Perhaps it will appear afterwards, that our sense of some
 virtues is artificial, and that of others natural. The discussion of
 this question will be more proper, when we enter upon an exact detail of
 each particular vice and virtue.
 
 
      [Footnote 14.  In the following discourse natural is also
      opposed sometimes to civil, sometimes to moral. The
      opposition will always discover the sense, in which it is
      taken.]
 
 Mean while it may not be amiss to observe from these definitions of
 natural and unnatural, that nothing can be more unphilosophical than
 those systems, which assert, that virtue is the same with what is
 natural, and vice with what is unnatural. For in the first sense of the
 word, Nature, as opposed to miracles, both vice and virtue are equally
 natural; and in the second sense, as opposed to what is unusual, perhaps
 virtue will be found to be the most unnatural. At least it must be
 owned, that heroic virtue, being as unusual, is as little natural as the
 most brutal barbarity. As to the third sense of the word, it is certain,
 that both vice and virtue are equally artificial, and out of nature. For
 however it may be disputed, whether the notion of a merit or demerit
 in certain actions be natural or artificial, it is evident, that the
 actions themselves are artificial, and are performed with a certain
 design and intention; otherwise they coued never be ranked under any of
 these denominations. It is impossible, therefore, that the character
 of natural and unnatural can ever, in any sense, mark the boundaries of
 vice and virtue.
 
 Thus we are still brought back to our first position, that virtue is
 distinguished by the pleasure, and vice by the pain, that any action,
 sentiment or character gives us by the mere view and contemplation.
 This decision is very commodious; because it reduces us to this simple
 question, Why any action or sentiment upon the general view or survey,
 gives a certain satisfaction or uneasiness, in order to shew the
 origin of its moral rectitude or depravity, without looking for any
 incomprehensible relations and qualities, which never did exist
 in nature, nor even in our imagination, by any clear and distinct
 conception. I flatter myself I have executed a great part of my present
 design by a state of the question, which appears to me so free from
 ambiguity and obscurity.
 
 
 
 
 
 PART II OF JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE
 
 
 
 
 SECT. I JUSTICE, WHETHER A NATURAL OR ARTIFICIAL VIRTUE?
 
 
 I have already hinted, that our sense of every kind of virtue is not
 natural; but that there are some virtues, that produce pleasure and
 approbation by means of an artifice or contrivance, which arises from
 the circumstances and necessity of mankind. Of this kind I assert
 justice to be; and shall endeavour to defend this opinion by a short,
 and, I hope, convincing argument, before I examine the nature of the
 artifice, from which the sense of that virtue is derived.
 
 It is evident, that when we praise any actions, we regard only the
 motives that produced them, and consider the actions as signs or
 indications of certain principles in the mind and temper. The external
 performance has no merit. We must look within to find the moral quality.
 This we cannot do directly; and therefore fix our attention on actions,
 as on external signs. But these actions are still considered as signs;
 and the ultimate object of our praise and approbation is the motive,
 that produced them.
 
 After the same manner, when we require any action, or blame a person for
 not performing it, we always suppose, that one in that situation should
 be influenced by the proper motive of that action, and we esteem it
 vicious in him to be regardless of it. If we find, upon enquiry, that
 the virtuous motive was still powerful over his breast, though checked
 in its operation by some circumstances unknown to us, we retract our
 blame, and have the same esteem for him, as if he had actually performed
 the action, which we require of him.
 
 It appears, therefore, that all virtuous actions derive their merit
 only from virtuous motives, and are considered merely as signs of those
 motives. From this principle I conclude, that the first virtuous motive,
 which bestows a merit on any action, can never be a regard to the virtue
 of that action, but must be some other natural motive or principle. To
 suppose, that the mere regard to the virtue of the action may be the
 first motive, which produced the action, and rendered it virtuous, is to
 reason in a circle. Before we can have such a regard, the action must
 be really virtuous; and this virtue must be derived from some virtuous
 motive: And consequently the virtuous motive must be different from the
 regard to the virtue of the action. A virtuous motive is requisite to
 render an action virtuous. An action must be virtuous, before we can
 have a regard to its virtue. Some virtuous motive, therefore, must be
 antecedent to that regard.
 
 Nor is this merely a metaphysical subtilty; but enters into all our
 reasonings in common life, though perhaps we may not be able to place it
 in such distinct philosophical terms. We blame a father for neglecting
 his child. Why? because it shews a want of natural affection, which is
 the duty of every parent. Were not natural affection a duty, the care of
 children coued not be a duty; and it were impossible we coued have the
 duty in our eye in the attention we give to our offspring. In this case,
 therefore, all men suppose a motive to the action distinct from a sense
 of duty.
 
 Here is a man, that does many benevolent actions; relieves the
 distressed, comforts the afflicted, and extends his bounty even to the
 greatest strangers. No character can be more amiable and virtuous. We
 regard these actions as proofs of the greatest humanity. This humanity
 bestows a merit on the actions. A regard to this merit is, therefore,
 a secondary consideration, and derived from the antecedent principle of
 humanity, which is meritorious and laudable.
 
 In short, it may be established as an undoubted maxim, THAT NO ACTION
 CAN BE VIRTUOUS, OR MORALLY GOOD, UNLESS THERE BE IN HUMAN NATURE SOME
 MOTIVE TO PRODUCE IT, DISTINCT FROM THE SENSE OF ITS MORALITY.
 
 But may not the sense of morality or duty produce an action, without any
 other motive? I answer, It may: But this is no objection to the present
 doctrine. When any virtuous motive or principle is common in human
 nature, a person, who feels his heart devoid of that motive, may hate
 himself upon that account, and may perform the action without the
 motive, from a certain sense of duty, in order to acquire by practice,
 that virtuous principle, or at least, to disguise to himself, as much
 as possible, his want of it. A man that really feels no gratitude in his
 temper, is still pleased to perform grateful actions, and thinks he has,
 by that means, fulfilled his duty. Actions are at first only considered
 as signs of motives: But it is usual, in this case, as in all others, to
 fix our attention on the signs, and neglect, in some measure, the thing
 signifyed. But though, on some occasions, a person may perform an action
 merely out of regard to its moral obligation, yet still this supposes
 in human nature some distinct principles, which are capable of producing
 the action, and whose moral beauty renders the action meritorious.
 
 Now to apply all this to the present case; I suppose a person to have
 lent me a sum of money, on condition that it be restored in a few days;
 and also suppose, that after the expiration of the term agreed on, he
 demands the sum: I ask, What reason or motive have I to restore the
 money? It will, perhaps, be said, that my regard to justice, and
 abhorrence of villainy and knavery, are sufficient reasons for me, if
 I have the least grain of honesty, or sense of duty and obligation. And
 this answer, no doubt, is just and satisfactory to man in his civilized
 state, and when trained up according to a certain discipline and
 education. But in his rude and more natural condition, if you are
 pleased to call such a condition natural, this answer would be rejected
 as perfectly unintelligible and sophistical. For one in that situation
 would immediately ask you, WHEREIN CONSISTS THIS HONESTY AND JUSTICE,
 WHICH YOU FIND IN RESTORING A LOAN, AND ABSTAINING FROM THE PROPERTY
 OF OTHERS? It does not surely lie in the external action. It must,
 therefore be placed in the motive, from which the external action is
 derived. This motive can never be a regard to the honesty of the action.
 For it is a plain fallacy to say, that a virtuous motive is requisite
 to render an action honest, and at the same time that a regard to the
 honesty is the motive of the action. We can never have a regard to the
 virtue of an action, unless the action be antecedently virtuous. No
 action can be virtuous, but so far as it proceeds from a virtuous
 motive. A virtuous motive, therefore, must precede the regard to the
 virtue, and it is impossible, that the virtuous motive and the regard to
 the virtue can be the same.
 
 It is requisite, then, to find some motive to acts of justice and
 honesty, distinct from our regard to the honesty; and in this lies the
 great difficulty. For should we say, that a concern for our private
 interest or reputation is the legitimate motive to all honest actions;
 it would follow, that wherever that concern ceases, honesty can no
 longer have place. But it is certain, that self-love, when it acts at
 its liberty, instead of engaging us to honest actions, is the source
 of all injustice and violence; nor can a man ever correct those vices,
 without correcting and restraining the natural movements of that
 appetite.
 
 But should it be affirmed, that the reason or motive of such actions is
 the regard to publick interest, to which nothing is more contrary than
 examples of injustice and dishonesty; should this be said, I would
 propose the three following considerations, as worthy of our attention.
 First, public interest is not naturally attached to the observation of
 the rules of justice; but is only connected with it, after an artificial
 convention for the establishment of these rules, as shall be shewn more
 at large hereafter. Secondly, if we suppose, that the loan was secret,
 and that it is necessary for the interest of the person, that the money
 be restored in the same manner (as when the lender would conceal his
 riches) in that case the example ceases, and the public is no longer
 interested in the actions of the borrower; though I suppose there is no
 moralist, who will affirm, that the duty and obligation ceases. Thirdly,
 experience sufficiently proves, that men, in the ordinary conduct
 of life, look not so far as the public interest, when they pay their
 creditors, perform their promises, and abstain from theft, and robbery,
 and injustice of every kind. That is a motive too remote and too sublime
 to affect the generality of mankind, and operate with any force in
 actions so contrary to private interest as are frequently those of
 justice and common honesty.
 
 In general, it may be affirmed, that there is no such passion in human
 minds, as the love of mankind, merely as such, independent of personal
 qualities, of services, or of relation to ourseit It is true, there is
 no human, and indeed no sensible, creature, whose happiness or misery
 does not, in some measure, affect us when brought near to us, and
 represented in lively colours: But this proceeds merely from sympathy,
 and is no proof of such an universal affection to mankind, since this
 concern extends itself beyond our own species. An affection betwixt the
 sexes is a passion evidently implanted in human nature; and this passion
 not only appears in its peculiar symptoms, but also in inflaming every
 other principle of affection, and raising a stronger love from beauty,
 wit, kindness, than what would otherwise flow from them. Were there an
 universal love among all human creatures, it would appear after the same
 manner. Any degree of a good quality would cause a stronger affection
 than the same degree of a bad quality would cause hatred; contrary to
 what we find by experience. Men's tempers are different, and some have a
 propensity to the tender, and others to the rougher, affections: But
 in the main, we may affirm, that man in general, or human nature, is
 nothing but the object both of love and hatred, and requires some other
 cause, which by a double relation of impressions and ideas, may excite
 these passions. In vain would we endeavour to elude this hypothesis.
 There are no phaenomena that point out any such kind affection to
 men, independent of their merit, and every other circumstance. We
 love company in general; but it is as we love any other amusement. An
 Englishman in Italy is a friend: A Euro paean in China; and perhaps a
 man would be beloved as such, were we to meet him in the moon. But
 this proceeds only from the relation to ourselves; which in these cases
 gathers force by being confined to a few persons.
 
 If public benevolence, therefore, or a regard to the interests of
 mankind, cannot be the original motive to justice, much less can private
 benevolence, or a regard to the interests of the party concerned, be
 this motive. For what if he be my enemy, and has given me just cause to
 hate him? What if he be a vicious man, and deserves the hatred of all
 mankind? What if he be a miser, and can make no use of what I would
 deprive him of? What if he be a profligate debauchee, and would rather
 receive harm than benefit from large possessions? What if I be in
 necessity, and have urgent motives to acquire something to my family?
 In all these cases, the original motive to justice would fail; and
 consequently the justice itself, and along with it all property, tight,
 and obligation.
 
 A rich man lies under a moral obligation to communicate to those in
 necessity a share of his superfluities. Were private benevolence the
 original motive to justice, a man would not be obliged to leave others
 in the possession of more than he is obliged to give them. At least
 the difference would be very inconsiderable. Men generally fix their
 affections more on what they are possessed of, than on what they never
 enjoyed: For this reason, it would be greater cruelty to dispossess a
 man of any thing, than not to give it him. But who will assert, that
 this is the only foundation of justice?
 
 Besides, we must consider, that the chief reason, why men attach
 themselves so much to their possessions is, that they consider them
 as their property, and as secured to them inviolably by the laws of
 society. But this is a secondary consideration, and dependent on the
 preceding notions of justice and property.
 
 A man's property is supposed to be fenced against every mortal, in every
 possible case. But private benevolence is, and ought to be, weaker in
 some persons, than in others: And in many, or indeed in most persons,
 must absolutely fail. Private benevolence, therefore, is not the
 original motive of justice.
 
 From all this it follows, that we have no real or universal motive for
 observing the laws of equity, but the very equity and merit of that
 observance; and as no action can be equitable or meritorious, where
 it cannot arise from some separate motive, there is here an evident
 sophistry and reasoning in a circle. Unless, therefore, we will allow,
 that nature has established a sophistry, and rendered it necessary and
 unavoidable, we must allow, that the sense of justice and injustice is
 not derived from nature, but arises artificially, though necessarily
 from education, and human conventions.
 
 I shall add, as a corollary to this reasoning, that since no action can
 be laudable or blameable, without some motives or impelling passions,
 distinct from the sense of morals, these distinct passions must have a
 great influence on that sense. It is according to their general force
 in human nature, that we blame or praise. In judging of the beauty of
 animal bodies, we always carry in our eye the oeconomy of a certain
 species; and where the limbs and features observe that proportion, which
 is common to the species, we pronounce them handsome and beautiful.
 In like manner we always consider the natural and usual force of the
 passions, when we determine concerning vice and virtue; and if the
 passions depart very much from the common measures on either side, they
 are always disapproved as vicious. A man naturally loves his children
 better than his nephews, his nephews better than his cousins, his
 cousins better than strangers, where every thing else is equal. Hence
 arise our common measures of duty, in preferring the one to the other.
 Our sense of duty always follows the common and natural course of our
 passions.
 
 To avoid giving offence, I must here observe, that when I deny justice
 to be a natural virtue, I make use of the word, natural, only as opposed
 to artificial. In another sense of the word; as no principle of the
 human mind is more natural than a sense of virtue; so no virtue is more
 natural than justice. Mankind is an inventive species; and where an
 invention is obvious and absolutely necessary, it may as properly be
 said to be natural as any thing that proceeds immediately from original
 principles, without the intervention of thought or reflection. Though
 the rules of justice be artificial, they are not arbitrary. Nor is
 the expression improper to call them Laws of Nature; if by natural we
 understand what is common to any species, or even if we confine it to
 mean what is inseparable from the species.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. II OF THE ORIGIN OF JUSTICE AND PROPERTY
 
 
 We now proceed to examine two questions, viz, CONCERNING THE MANNER, IN
 WHICH THE RULES OF JUSTICE ARE ESTABLISHed BY THE ARTIFICE OF MEN;
 and CONCERNING THE REASONS, WHICH DETERMINE US TO ATTRIBUTE TO THE
 OBSERVANCE OR NEGLECT OF THESE RULES A MORAL BEAUTY AND DEFORMITY. These
 questions will appear afterwards to be distinct. We shall begin with the
 former.
 
 Of all the animals, with which this globe is peopled, there is none
 towards whom nature seems, at first sight, to have exercised more
 cruelty than towards man, in the numberless wants and necessities, with
 which she has loaded him, and in the slender means, which she affords
 to the relieving these necessities. In other creatures these two
 particulars generally compensate each other. If we consider the lion as
 a voracious and carnivorous animal, we shall easily discover him to be
 very necessitous; but if we turn our eye to his make and temper, his
 agility, his courage, his arms, and his force, we shall find, that his
 advantages hold proportion with his wants. The sheep and ox are deprived
 of all these advantages; but their appetites are moderate, and their
 food is of easy purchase. In man alone, this unnatural conjunction of
 infirmity, and of necessity, may be observed in its greatest perfection.
 Not only the food, which is required for his sustenance, flies his
 search and approach, or at least requires his labour to be produced, but
 he must be possessed of cloaths and lodging, to defend him against the
 injuries of the weather; though to consider him only in himself, he
 is provided neither with arms, nor force, nor other natural abilities,
 which are in any degree answerable to so many necessities.
 
 It is by society alone he is able to supply his defects, and raise
 himself up to an equality with his fellow-creatures, and even acquire a
 superiority above them. By society all his infirmities are compensated;
 and though in that situation his wants multiply every moment upon him,
 yet his abilities are still more augmented, and leave him in every
 respect more satisfied and happy, than it is possible for him, in his
 savage and solitary condition, ever to become. When every individual
 person labours a-part, and only for himself, his force is too small to
 execute any considerable work; his labour being employed in supplying
 all his different necessities, he never attains a perfection in any
 particular art; and as his force and success are not at all times equal,
 the least failure in either of these particulars must be attended with
 inevitable ruin and misery. Society provides a remedy for these three
 inconveniences. By the conjunction of forces, our power is augmented:
 By the partition of employments, our ability encreases: And by mutual
 succour we are less exposed to fortune and accidents. It is by
 this additional force, ability, and security, that society becomes
 advantageous.
 
 But in order to form society, it is requisite not only that it be
 advantageous, but also that men be sensible of these advantages; and
 it is impossible, in their wild uncultivated state, that by study and
 reflection alone, they should ever be able to attain this knowledge.
 Most fortunately, therefore, there is conjoined to those necessities,
 whose remedies are remote and obscure, another necessity, which having a
 present and more obvious remedy, may justly be regarded as the first
 and original principle of human society. This necessity is no other than
 that natural appetite betwixt the sexes, which unites them together, and
 preserves their union, till a new tye takes place in their concern for
 their common offspring. This new concern becomes also a principle of
 union betwixt the parents and offspring, and forms a more numerous
 society; where the parents govern by the advantage of their superior
 strength and wisdom, and at the same time are restrained in the exercise
 of their authority by that natural affection, which they bear their
 children. In a little time, custom and habit operating on the tender
 minds of the children, makes them sensible of the advantages, which they
 may reap from society, as well as fashions them by degrees for it, by
 rubbing off those rough corners and untoward affections, which prevent
 their coalition.
 
 For it must be confest, that however the circumstances of human nature
 may render an union necessary, and however those passions of lust and
 natural affection may seem to render it unavoidable; yet there are other
 particulars in our natural temper, and in our outward circumstances,
 which are very incommodious, and are even contrary to the requisite
 conjunction. Among the former, we may justly esteem our selfishness to
 be the most considerable. I am sensible, that generally speaking, the
 representations of this quality have been carried much too far; and that
 the descriptions, which certain philosophers delight so much to form
 of mankind in this particular, are as wide of nature as any accounts
 of monsters, which we meet with in fables and romances. So far from
 thinking, that men have no affection for any thing beyond themselves,
 I am of opinion, that though it be rare to meet with one, who loves any
 single person better than himself; yet it is as rare to meet with one,
 in whom all the kind affections, taken together, do not overbalance all
 the selfish. Consult common experience: Do you not see, that though
 the whole expence of the family be generally under the direction of the
 master of it, yet there are few that do not bestow the largest part of
 their fortunes on the pleasures of their wives, and the education of
 their children, reserving the smallest portion for their own proper use
 and entertainment. This is what we may observe concerning such as have
 those endearing ties; and may presume, that the case would be the same
 with others, were they placed in a like situation.
 
 But though this generosity must be acknowledged to the honour of human
 nature, we may at the same time remark, that so noble an affection,
 instead of fitting men for large societies, is almost as contrary
 to them, as the most narrow selfishness. For while each person loves
 himself better than any other single person, and in his love to others
 bears the greatest affection to his relations and acquaintance, this
 must necessarily produce an oppositon of passions, and a consequent
 opposition of actions; which cannot but be dangerous to the
 new-established union.
 
 It is however worth while to remark, that this contrariety of passions
 would be attended with but small danger, did it not concur with
 a peculiarity in our outward circumstances, which affords it an
 opportunity of exerting itself. There are different species of goods,
 which we are possessed of; the internal satisfaction of our minds, the
 external advantages of our body, and the enjoyment of such possessions
 as we have acquired by our industry and good fortune. We are perfectly
 secure in the enjoyment of the first. The second may be ravished from
 us, but can be of no advantage to him who deprives us of them. The last
 only are both exposed to the violence of others, and may be transferred
 without suffering any loss or alteration; while at the same time, there
 is not a sufficient quantity of them to supply every one's desires and
 necessities. As the improvement, therefore, of these goods is the chief
 advantage of society, so the instability of their possession, along with
 their scarcity, is the chief impediment.
 
 In vain should we expect to find, in uncultivated nature, a remedy to
 this inconvenience; or hope for any inartificial principle of the
 human mind, which might controul those partial affections, and make us
 overcome the temptations arising from our circumstances. The idea of
 justice can never serve to this purpose, or be taken for a natural
 principle, capable of inspiring men with an equitable conduct towards
 each other. That virtue, as it is now understood, would never have
 been dreamed of among rude and savage men. For the notion of injury or
 injustice implies an immorality or vice committed against some
 other person: And as every immorality is derived from some defect or
 unsoundness of the passions, and as this defect must be judged of, in a
 great measure, from the ordinary course of nature in the constitution
 of the mind; it will be easy to know, whether we be guilty of any
 immorality, with regard to others, by considering the natural, and usual
 force of those several affections, which are directed towards them.
 Now it appears, that in the original frame of our mind, our strongest
 attention is confined to ourselves; our next is extended to our
 relations and acquaintance; and it is only the weakest which reaches to
 strangers and indifferent persons. This partiality, then, and unequal
 affection, must not only have an influence on our behaviour and conduct
 in society, but even on our ideas of vice and virtue; so as to make
 us regard any remarkable transgression of such a degree of partiality,
 either by too great an enlargement, or contraction of the affections,
 as vicious and immoral. This we may observe in our common judgments
 concerning actions, where we blame a person, who either centers all
 his affections in his family, or is so regardless of them, as, in any
 opposition of interest, to give the preference to a stranger, or
 mere chance acquaintance. From all which it follows, that our natural
 uncultivated ideas of morality, instead of providing a remedy for the
 partiality of our affections, do rather conform themselves to that
 partiality, and give it an additional force and influence.
 
 The remedy, then, is not derived from nature, but from artifice; or
 more e properly speaking, nature provides a remedy in the judgment and
 understanding, for what is irregular and incommodious in the affections.
 For when men, from their early education in society, have become
 sensible of the infinite advantages that result from it, and have
 besides acquired a new affection to company and conversation; and when
 they have observed, that the principal disturbance in society arises
 from those goods, which we call external, and from their looseness and
 easy transition from one person to another; they must seek for a remedy
 by putting these goods, as far as possible, on the same footing with
 the fixed and constant advantages of the mind and body. This can be
 done after no other manner, than by a convention entered into by all the
 members of the society to bestow stability on the possession of those
 external goods, and leave every one in the peaceable enjoyment of what
 he may acquire by his fortune and industry. By this means, every one
 knows what he may safely possess; and the passions ale restrained
 in their partial and contradictory motions. Nor is such a restraint
 contrary to these passions; for if so, it coued never be entered into,
 nor maintained; but it is only contrary to their heedless and impetuous
 movement. Instead of departing from our own interest, or from that of
 our nearest friends, by abstaining from the possessions of others, we
 cannot better consult both these interests, than by such a convention;
 because it is by that means we maintain society, which is so necessary
 to their well-being and subsistence, as well as to our own.
 
 This convention is not of the nature of a promise: For even promises
 themselves, as we shall see afterwards, arise from human conventions. It
 is only a general sense of common interest; which sense all the members
 of the society express to one another, and which induces them to
 regulate their conduct by certain rules. I observe, that it will be for
 my interest to leave another in the possession of his goods, provided he
 will act in the same manner with regard to me. He is sensible of a like
 interest in the regulation of his conduct. When this common sense of
 interest is mutually expressed, and is known to both, it produces a
 suitable resolution and behaviour. And this may properly enough
 be called a convention or agreement betwixt us, though without the
 interposition of a promise; since the actions of each of us have a
 reference to those of the other, and are performed upon the supposition,
 that something is to be performed on the other part. Two men, who pull
 the oars of a boat, do it by an agreement or convention, though they
 have never given promises to each other. Nor is the rule concerning the
 stability of possession the less derived from human conventions, that it
 arises gradually, and acquires force by a slow progression, and by our
 repeated experience of the inconveniences of transgressing it. On the
 contrary, this experience assures us still more, that the sense of
 interest has become common to all our fellows, and gives us a confidence
 of the future regularity of their conduct: And it is only on the
 expectation of this, that our moderation and abstinence are founded.
 In like manner are languages gradually established by human conventions
 without any promise. In like manner do gold and silver become the common
 measures of exchange, and are esteemed sufficient payment for what is of
 a hundred times their value.
 
 After this convention, concerning abstinence from the possessions of
 others, is entered into, and every one has acquired a stability in his
 possessions, there immediately arise the ideas of justice and injustice;
 as also those of property, right, and obligation. The latter are
 altogether unintelligible without first understanding the former.
 Our property is nothing but those goods, whose constant possession is
 established by the laws of society; that is, by the laws of justice.
 Those, therefore, who make use of the words property, or right, or
 obligation, before they have explained the origin of justice, or
 even make use of them in that explication, are guilty of a very gross
 fallacy, and can never reason upon any solid foundation. A man's
 property is some object related to him. This relation is not natural,
 but moral, and founded on justice. It is very preposterous, therefore,
 to imagine, that we can have any idea of property, without fully
 comprehending the nature of justice, and shewing its origin in the
 artifice and contrivance of man. The origin of justice explains that of
 property. The same artifice gives rise to both. As our first and most
 natural sentiment of morals is founded on the nature of our passions,
 and gives the preference to ourselves and friends, above strangers; it
 is impossible there can be naturally any such thing as a fixed right
 or property, while the opposite passions of men impel them in contrary
 directions, and are not restrained by any convention or agreement.
 
 No one can doubt, that the convention for the distinction of property,
 and for the stability of possession, is of all circumstances the most
 necessary to the establishment of human society, and that after the
 agreement for the fixing and observing of this rule, there remains
 little or nothing to be done towards settling a perfect harmony and
 concord. All the other passions, besides this of interest, are either
 easily restrained, or are not of such pernicious consequence, when
 indulged. Vanity is rather to be esteemed a social passion, and a bond
 of union among men. Pity and love are to be considered in the same
 light. And as to envy and revenge, though pernicious, they operate
 only by intervals, and are directed against particular persons, whom we
 consider as our superiors or enemies. This avidity alone, of acquiring
 goods and possessions for ourselves and our nearest friends, is
 insatiable, perpetual, universal, and directly destructive of society.
 There scarce is any one, who is not actuated by it; and there is no one,
 who has not reason to fear from it, when it acts without any restraint,
 and gives way to its first and most natural movements. So that upon
 the whole, we are to esteem the difficulties in the establishment of
 society, to be greater or less, according to those we encounter in
 regulating and restraining this passion.
 
 It is certain, that no affection of the human mind has both a
 sufficient force, and a proper direction to counterbalance the love of
 gain, and render men fit members of society, by making them abstain from
 the possessions of others. Benevolence to strangers is too weak for this
 purpose; and as to the other passions, they rather inflame this avidity,
 when we observe, that the larger our possessions are, the more ability
 we have of gratifying all our appetites. There is no passion, therefore,
 capable of controlling the interested affection, but the very affection
 itself, by an alteration of its direction. Now this alteration must
 necessarily take place upon the least reflection; since it is evident,
 that the passion is much better satisfyed by its restraint, than by its
 liberty, and that in preserving society, we make much greater advances
 in the acquiring possessions, than in the solitary and forlorn
 condition, which must follow upon violence and an universal licence.
 The question, therefore, concerning the wickedness or goodness of human
 nature, enters not in the least into that other question concerning
 the origin of society; nor is there any thing to be considered but
 the degrees of men's sagacity or folly. For whether the passion of
 self-interest be esteemed vicious or virtuous, it is all a case; since
 itself alone restrains it: So that if it be virtuous, men become social
 by their virtue; if vicious, their vice has the same effect.
 
 Now as it is by establishing the rule for the stability of possession,
 that this passion restrains itself; if that rule be very abstruse,
 and of difficult invention; society must be esteemed, in a manner,
 accidental, and the effect of many ages. But if it be found, that
 nothing can be more simple and obvious than that rule; that every
 parent, in order to preserve peace among his children, must establish
 it; and that these first rudiments of justice must every day be
 improved, as the society enlarges: If all this appear evident, as it
 certainly must, we may conclude, that it is utterly impossible for men
 to remain any considerable time in that savage condition, which precedes
 society; but that his very first state and situation may justly be
 esteemed social. This, however, hinders not, but that philosophers may,
 if they please, extend their reasoning to the supposed state of nature;
 provided they allow it to be a mere philosophical fiction, which never
 had, and never coued have any reality. Human nature being composed
 of two principal parts, which are requisite in all its actions, the
 affections and understanding; it is certain, that the blind motions of
 the former, without the direction of the latter, incapacitate men for
 society: And it may be allowed us to consider separately the effects,
 that result from the separate operations of these two component parts of
 the mind. The same liberty may be permitted to moral, which is allowed
 to natural philosophers; and it is very usual with the latter to
 consider any motion as compounded and consisting of two parts separate
 from each other, though at the same time they acknowledge it to be in
 itself uncompounded and inseparable.
 
 This state of nature, therefore, is to be regarded as a mere fiction,
 not unlike that of the golden age, which poets have invented; only with
 this difference, that the former is described as full of war, violence
 and injustice; whereas the latter is pointed out to us, as the most
 charming and most peaceable condition, that can possibly be imagined.
 The seasons, in that first age of nature, were so temperate, if we
 may believe the poets, that there was no necessity for men to provide
 themselves with cloaths and houses as a security against the violence
 of heat and cold. The rivers flowed with wine and milk: The oaks yielded
 honey; and nature spontaneously produced her greatest delicacies.
 Nor were these the chief advantages of that happy age. The storms and
 tempests were not alone removed from nature; but those more furious
 tempests were unknown to human breasts, which now cause such uproar, and
 engender such confusion. Avarice, ambition, cruelty, selfishness, were
 never heard of: Cordial affection, compassion, sympathy, were the
 only movements, with which the human mind was yet acquainted. Even
 the distinction of mine and thine was banished from that happy race
 of mortals, and carryed with them the very notions of property and
 obligation, justice and injustice.
 
 This, no doubt, is to be regarded as an idle fiction; but yet deserves
 our attention, because nothing can more evidently shew the origin of
 those virtues, which are the subjects of our present enquiry. I have
 already observed, that justice takes its rise from human conventions;
 and that these are intended as a remedy to some inconveniences, which
 proceed from the concurrence of certain qualities of the human mind
 with the situation of external objects. The qualities of the mind
 are selfishness and limited generosity: And the situation of external
 objects is their easy change, joined to their scarcity in comparison
 of the wants and desires of men. But however philosophers may have
 been bewildered in those speculations, poets have been guided more
 infallibly, by a certain taste or common instinct, which in most kinds
 of reasoning goes farther than any of that art and philosophy, with
 which we have been yet acquainted. They easily perceived, if every man
 had a tender regard for another, or if nature supplied abundantly all
 our wants and desires, that the jealousy of interest, which justice
 supposes, could no longer have place; nor would there be any occasion
 for those distinctions and limits of property and possession, which at
 present are in use among mankind. Encrease to a sufficient degree the
 benevolence of men, or the bounty of nature, and you render justice
 useless, by supplying its place with much nobler virtues, and more
 valuable blessings. The selfishness of men is animated by the few
 possessions we have, in proportion to our wants; and it is to restrain
 this selfishness, that men have been obliged to separate themselves from
 the community, and to distinguish betwixt their own goods and those of
 others.
 
 Nor need we have recourse to the fictions of poets to learn this; but
 beside the reason of the thing, may discover the same truth by common
 experience and observation. It is easy to remark, that a cordial
 affection renders all things common among friends; and that married
 people in particular mutually lose their property, and are unacquainted
 with the mine and thine, which are so necessary, and yet cause such
 disturbance in human society. The same effect arises from any alteration
 in the circumstances of mankind; as when there is such a plenty of any
 thing as satisfies all the desires of men: In which case the distinction
 of property is entirely lost, and every thing remains in common. This
 we may observe with regard to air and water, though the most valuable of
 all external objects; and may easily conclude, that if men were supplied
 with every thing in the same abundance, or if every one had the same
 affection and tender regard for every one as for himself; justice and
 injustice would be equally unknown among mankind.
 
 Here then is a proposition, which, I think, may be regarded as certain,
 that it is only from the selfishness and confined generosity of men,
 along with the scanty provision nature has made for his wants, that
 justice derives its origin. If we look backward we shall find, that this
 proposition bestows an additional force on some of those observations,
 which we have already made on this subject.
 
 First, we may conclude from it, that a regard to public interest, or a
 strong extensive benevolence, is not our first and original motive for
 the observation of the rules of justice; since it is allowed, that if
 men were endowed with such a benevolence, these rules would never have
 been dreamt of.
 
 Secondly, we may conclude from the same principle, that the sense
 of justice is not founded on reason, or on the discovery of certain
 connexions and relations of ideas, which are eternal, immutable, and
 universally obligatory. For since it is confest, that such an alteration
 as that above-mentioned, in the temper and circumstances of mankind,
 would entirely alter our duties and obligations, it is necessary upon
 the common system, that the sense of virtue is derived from reason, to
 shew the change which this must produce in the relations and ideas. But
 it is evident, that the only cause, why the extensive generosity of man,
 and the perfect abundance of every thing, would destroy the very idea of
 justice, is because they render it useless; and that, on the other hand,
 his confined benevolence, and his necessitous condition, give rise to
 that virtue, only by making it requisite to the publick interest, and to
 that of every individual. Twas therefore a concern for our own, and
 the publick interest, which made us establish the laws of justice; and
 nothing can be more certain, than that it is not any relation of ideas,
 which gives us this concern, but our impressions and sentiments, without
 which every thing in nature is perfectly indifferent to us, and can
 never in the least affect us. The sense of justice, therefore, is not
 founded on our ideas, but on our impressions.
 
 Thirdly, we may farther confirm the foregoing proposition, THAT THOSE
 IMPRESSIONS, WHICH GIVE RISE TO THIS SENSE OF JUSTICE, ARE NOT NATURAL
 TO THE MIND OF MAN, BUT ARISE FROM ARTIFICE AND HUMAN CONVENTIONS. For
 since any considerable alteration of temper and circumstances destroys
 equally justice and injustice; and since such an alteration has an
 effect only by changing our own and the publick interest; it follows,
 that the first establishment of the rules of justice depends on these
 different interests. But if men pursued the publick interest naturally,
 and with a hearty affection, they would never have dreamed of
 restraining each other by these rules; and if they pursued their own
 interest, without any precaution, they would run head-long into every
 kind of injustice and violence. These rules, therefore, are artificial,
 and seek their end in an oblique and indirect manner; nor is the
 interest, which gives rise to them, of a kind that coued be pursued by
 the natural and inartificial passions of men.
 
 To make this more evident, consider, that though the rules of justice
 are established merely by interest, their connexion with interest is
 somewhat singular, and is different from what may be observed on other
 occasions. A single act of justice is frequently contrary to public
 interest; and were it to stand alone, without being followed by other
 acts, may, in itself, be very prejudicial to society. When a man of
 merit, of a beneficent disposition, restores a great fortune to a miser,
 or a seditious bigot, he has acted justly and laudably, but the public
 is a real sufferer. Nor is every single act of justice, considered
 apart, more conducive to private interest, than to public; and it is
 easily conceived how a man may impoverish himself by a signal instance
 of integrity, and have reason to wish, that with regard to that single
 act, the laws of justice were for a moment suspended in the universe.
 But however single acts of justice may be contrary, either to public or
 private interest, it is certain, that the whole plan or scheme is
 highly conducive, or indeed absolutely requisite, both to the support
 of society, and the well-being of every individual. It is impossible
 to separate the good from the ill. Property must be stable, and must be
 fixed by general rules. Though in one instance the public be a sufferer,
 this momentary ill is amply compensated by the steady prosecution of the
 rule, and by the peace and order, which it establishes in society. And
 even every individual person must find himself a gainer, on ballancing
 the account; since, without justice society must immediately dissolve,
 and every one must fall into that savage and solitary condition, which
 is infinitely worse than the worst situation that can possibly be
 supposed in society. When therefore men have had experience enough
 to observe, that whatever may be the consequence of any single act of
 justice, performed by a single person, yet the whole system of actions,
 concurred in by the whole society, is infinitely advantageous to the
 whole, and to every part; it is not long before justice and property
 take place. Every member of society is sen sible of this interest: Every
 one expresses this sense to his fellows, along with the resolution he
 has taken of squaring his actions by it, on condition that others will
 do the same. No more is requisite to induce any one of them to perform
 an act of justice, who has the first opportunity. This becomes an
 example to others. And thus justice establishes itself by a kind of
 convention or agreement; that is, by a sense of interest, supposed to
 be common to all, and where every single act is performed in expectation
 that others are to perform the like. Without such a convention, no one
 would ever have dreamed, that there was such a virtue as justice, or
 have been induced to conform his actions to it. Taking any single act,
 my justice may be pernicious in every respect; and it is only upon
 the supposition that others are to imitate my example, that I can be
 induced to embrace that virtue; since nothing but this combination can
 render justice advantageous, or afford me any motives to conform my self
 to its rules.
 
 We come now to the second question we proposed, viz. Why we annex the
 idea of virtue to justice, and of vice to injustice. This question
 will not detain us long after the principles, which we have already
 established, All we can say of it at present will be dispatched in a few
 words: And for farther satisfaction, the reader must wait till we come
 to the third part of this book. The natural obligation to justice, viz,
 interest, has been fully explained; but as to the moral obligation, or
 the sentiment of right and wrong, it will first be requisite to examine
 the natural virtues, before we can give a full and satisfactory account
 of it. After men have found by experience, that their selfishness and
 confined generosity, acting at their liberty, totally incapacitate
 them for society; and at the same time have observed, that society is
 necessary to the satisfaction of those very passions, they are naturally
 induced to lay themselves under the restraint of such rules, as may
 render their commerce more safe and commodious. To the imposition then,
 and observance of these rules, both in general, and in every particular
 instance, they are at first induced only by a regard to interest; and
 this motive, on the first formation of society, is sufficiently strong
 and forcible. But when society has become numerous, and has encreased to
 a tribe or nation, this interest is more remote; nor do men so readily
 perceive, that disorder and confusion follow upon every breach of these
 rules, as in a more narrow and contracted society. But though in our own
 actions we may frequently lose sight of that interest, which we have in
 maintaining order, and may follow a lesser and more present interest,
 we never fail to observe the prejudice we receive, either mediately or
 immediately, from the injustice of others; as not being in that case
 either blinded by passion, or byassed by any contrary temptation.
 Nay when the injustice is so distant from us, as no way to affect our
 interest, it still displeases us; because we consider it as prejudicial
 to human society, and pernicious to every one that approaches the person
 guilty of it. We partake of their uneasiness by sympathy; and as every
 thing, which gives uneasiness in human actions, upon the general survey,
 is called Vice, and whatever produces satisfaction, in the same manner,
 is denominated Virtue; this is the reason why the sense of moral good
 and evil follows upon justice and injustice. And though this sense,
 in the present case, be derived only from contemplating the actions
 of others, yet we fail not to extend it even to our own actions. The
 general rule reaches beyond those instances, from which it arose; while
 at the same time we naturally sympathize with others in the sentiments
 they entertain of us. Thus self-interest is the original motive to the
 establishment of justice: but a sympathy with public interest is the
 source of the moral approbation, which attends that virtue.
 
 Though this progress of the sentiments be natural, and even necessary,
 it is certain, that it is here forwarded by the artifice of politicians,
 who, in order to govern men more easily, and preserve peace in human
 society, have endeavoured to produce an esteem for justice, and an
 abhorrence of injustice. This, no doubt, must have its effect; but
 nothing can be more evident, than that the matter has been carryed too
 far by certain writers on morals, who seem to have employed their
 utmost efforts to extirpate all sense of virtue from among mankind.
 Any artifice of politicians may assist nature in the producing of those
 sentiments, which she suggests to us, and may even on some occasions,
 produce alone an approbation or esteem for any particular action; but
 it is impossible it should be the sole cause of the distinction we
 make betwixt vice and virtue. For if nature did not aid us in this
 particular, it would be in vain for politicians to talk of honourable or
 dishonourable, praiseworthy or blameable. These words would be perfectly
 unintelligible, and would no more have any idea annexed to them, than
 if they were of a tongue perfectly unknown to us. The utmost politicians
 can perform, is, to extend the natural sentiments beyond their original
 bounds; but still nature must furnish the materials, and give us some
 notion of moral distinctions.
 
 As publick praise and blame encrease our esteem for justice; so private
 education and instruction contribute to the same effect. For as parents
 easily observe, that a man is the more useful, both to himself and
 others, the greater degree of probity and honour he is endowed with;
 and that those principles have greater force, when custom and education
 assist interest and reflection: For these reasons they are induced to
 inculcate on their children, from their earliest infancy, the principles
 of probity, and teach them to regard the observance of those rules,
 by which society is maintained, as worthy and honourable, and their
 violation as base and infamous. By this means the sentiments of honour
 may take root in their tender minds, and acquire such firmness and
 solidity, that they may fall little short of those principles, which are
 the most essential to our natures, and the most deeply radicated in our
 internal constitution.
 
 What farther contributes to encrease their solidity, is the interest
 of our reputation, after the opinion, that a merit or demerit attends
 justice or injustice, is once firmly established among mankind. There is
 nothing, which touches us more nearly than our reputation, and nothing
 on which our reputation more depends than our conduct, with relation to
 the property of others. For this reason, every one, who has any regard
 to his character, or who intends to live on good terms with mankind,
 must fix an inviolable law to himself, never, by any temptation, to be
 induced to violate those principles, which are essential to a man of
 probity and honour.
 
 I shall make only one observation before I leave this subject, viz, that
 though I assert, that in the state of nature, or that imaginary state,
 which preceded society, there be neither justice nor injustice, yet
 I assert not, that it was allowable, in such a state, to violate the
 property of others. I only maintain, that there was no such thing
 as property; and consequently coued be no such thing as justice or
 injustice. I shall have occasion to make a similar reflection with
 regard to promises, when I come to treat of them; and I hope this
 reflection, when duly weighed, will suffice to remove all odium from the
 foregoing opinions, with regard to justice and injustice.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. III OF THE RULES WHICH DETERMINE PROPERTY
 
 
 Though the establishment of the rule, concerning the stability of
 possession, be not only useful, but even absolutely necessary to human
 society, it can never serve to any purpose, while it remains in such
 general terms. Some method must be shewn, by which we may distinguish
 what particular goods are to be assigned to each particular person,
 while the rest of mankind are excluded from their possession and
 enjoyment. Our next business, then, must be to discover the reasons
 which modify this general rule, and fit it to the common use and
 practice of the world.
 
 It is obvious, that those reasons are not derived from any utility or
 advantage, which either the particular person or the public may reap
 from his enjoyment of any particular goods, beyond what would result
 from the possession of them by any other person. Twere better, no doubt,
 that every one were possessed of what is most suitable to him, and
 proper for his use: But besides, that this relation of fitness may be
 common to several at once, it is liable to so many controversies, and
 men are so partial and passionate in judging of these controversies,
 that such a loose and uncertain rule would be absolutely incompatible
 with the peace of human society. The convention concerning the stability
 of possession is entered into, in order to cut off all occasions of
 discord and contention; and this end would never be attained, were
 we allowed to apply this rule differently in every particular case,
 according to every particular utility, which might be discovered in such
 an application. Justice, in her decisions, never regards the fitness or
 unfitness of objects to particular persons, but conducts herself by more
 extensive views. Whether a man be generous, or a miser, he is equally
 well received by her, and obtains with the same facility a decision in
 his favours, even for what is entirely useless to him.
 
 It follows therefore, that the general rule, that possession must be
 stable, is not applied by particular judgments, but by other general
 rules, which must extend to the whole society, and be inflexible
 either by spite or favour. To illustrate this, I propose the following
 instance. I first consider men in their savage and solitary condition;
 and suppose, that being sensible of the misery of that state, and
 foreseeing the advantages that would result from society, they seek each
 other's company, and make an offer of mutual protection and assistance.
 I also suppose, that they are endowed with such sagacity as immediately
 to perceive, that the chief impediment to this project of society and
 partnership lies in the avidity and selfishness of their natural temper;
 to remedy which, they enter into a convention for the stability of
 possession, and for mutual restraint and forbearance. I am sensible,
 that this method of proceeding is not altogether natural; but besides
 that I here only suppose those reflections to be formed at once, which
 in fact arise insensibly and by degrees; besides this, I say, it is very
 possible, that several persons, being by different accidents separated
 from the societies, to which they formerly belonged, may be obliged to
 form a new society among themselves; in which case they are entirely in
 the situation above-mentioned.
 
 It is evident, then, that their first difficulty, in this situation,
 after the general convention for the establishment of society, and for
 the constancy of possession, is, how to separate their possessions,
 and assign to each his particular portion, which he must for the future
 inalterably enjoy. This difficulty will not detain them long; but it
 must immediately occur to them, as the most natural expedient, that
 every one continue to enjoy what he is at present master of, and
 that property or constant possession be conjoined to the immediate
 possession. Such is the effect of custom, that it not only reconciles
 us to any thing we have long enjoyed, but even gives us an affection for
 it, and makes us prefer it to other objects, which may be more valuable,
 but are less known to us. What has long lain under our eye, and has
 often been employed to our advantage, that we are always the most
 unwilling to part with; but can easily live without possessions,
 which we never have enjoyed, and are not accustomed to. It is evident,
 therefore, that men would easily acquiesce in this expedient, that every
 one continue to enjoy what he is at present possessed of; and this is
 the reason, why they would so naturally agree in preferring it.
 
 
 
      [Footnote 15.  No questions in philosophy are more
      difficult, than when a number of causes present themselves
      for the same phaenomenon, to determine which is the
      principal and predominant. There seldom is any very precise
      argument to fix our choice, and men must be contented to be
      guided by a kind of taste or fancy, arising from analogy,
      and a comparison of familiar instances. Thus, in the present
      case, there are, no doubt, motives of public interest for
      most of the rules, which determine property; but still I
      suspect, that these rules are principally fixed by the
      imagination, or the more frivolous properties of our thought
      and conception. I shall continue to explain these causes,
      leaving it to the reader's choice, whether he will prefer
      those derived from publick utility, or those derived from
      the imagination. We shall begin with the right of the
      present possessor.
 
      It is a quality, which I have already observed in human
      nature, that when two objects appear in a close relation to
      each other, the mind is apt to ascribe to them any
      additional relation, in order to compleat the union; and
      this inclination is so strong, as often to make us run into
      errors (such as that of the conjunction of thought and
      matter) if we find that they can serve to that purpose. Many
      of our impressions are incapable of place or local position;
      and yet those very impressions we suppose to have a local
      conjunction with the impressions of sight and touch, merely
      because they are conjoined by causation, and are already
      united in the imagination. Since, therefore, we can feign a
      new relation, and even an absurd one, in order to compleat
      any union, it will easily be imagined, that if there be any
      relations, which depend on the mind, it will readily conjoin
      them to any preceding relation, and unite, by a new bond,
      such objects as have already an union in the fancy. Thus for
      instance, we never fail, in our arrangement of bodies, to
      place those which are resembling in contiguity to each
      other, or at least in correspondent points of view; because
      we feel a satisfaction in joining the relation of contiguity
      to that of resemblance, or the resemblance of situation to
      that of qualities. And this is easily accounted for from the
      known properties of human nature. When the mind is
      determined to join certain objects, but undetermined in its
      choice of the particular objects, It naturally turns its eye
      to such as are related together. They are already united in
      the mind: They present themselves at the same time to the
      conception; and instead of requiring any new reason for
      their conjunction, it would require a very powerful reason
      to make us over-look this natural affinity. This we shall
      have occasion to explain more fully afterwards, when we come
      to treat of beauty. In the mean time, we may content
      ourselves with observing, that the same love of order and
      uniformity, which arranges the books in a library, and the
      chairs in a parlour, contribute to the formation of society,
      and to the well-being of mankind, by modifying the general
      rule concerning the stability of possession. And as property
      forms a relation betwixt a person and an object, it is
      natural to found it on some preceding relation; and as
      property Is nothing but a constant possession, secured by
      the laws of society, it is natural to add it to the present
      possession, which is a relation that resembles it. For this
      also has its influence. If it be natural to conjoin all
      sorts of relations, it is more so, to conjoin such relations
      as are resembling, and are related together.]
 
 
 But we may observe, that though the rule of the assignment of property
 to the present possessor be natural, and by that means useful, yet its
 utility extends not beyond the first formation of society; nor would any
 thing be more pernicious, than the constant observance of it; by which
 restitution would be excluded, and every injustice would be authorized
 and rewarded. We must, therefore, seek for some other circumstance, that
 may give rise to property after society is once established; and of
 this kind, I find four most considerable, viz. Occupation, Prescription,
 Accession, and Succession. We shall briefly examine each of these,
 beginning with Occupation.
 
 The possession of all external goods is changeable and uncertain; which
 is one of the most considerable impediments to the establishment of
 society, and is the reason why, by universal agreement, express or
 tacite, men restrain themselves by what we now call the rules of justice
 and equity. The misery of the condition, which precedes this restraint,
 is the cause why we submit to that remedy as quickly as possible; and
 this affords us an easy reason, why we annex the idea of property to the
 first possession, or to occupation. Men are unwilling to leave property
 in suspense, even for the shortest time, or open the least door to
 violence and disorder. To which we may add, that the first possession
 always engages the attention most; and did we neglect it, there would be
 no colour of reason for assigning property to any succeeding possession.
 
 
      [Footnote 16.  Some philosophers account for the right of
      occupation, by saying, that every one has a property in his
      own labour; and when he joins that labour to any thing, it
      gives him the property of the whole: But, 1. There are
      several kinds of occupation, where we cannot be said to join
      our labour to the object we acquire: As when we possess a
      meadow by grazing our cattle upon it. 2. This accounts for
      the matter by means of accession; which is taking a needless
      circuit. 3. We cannot be said to join our labour to any
      thing but in a figurative sense. Properly speaking, we only
      make an alteration on it by our labour. This forms a
      relation betwixt us and the object; and thence arises the
      property, according to the preceding principles.]
 
 There remains nothing, but to determine exactly, what is meant by
 possession; and this is not so easy as may at first sight be imagined.
 We are said to be in possession of any thing, not only when we
 immediately touch it, but also when we are so situated with respect
 to it, as to have it in our power to use it; and may move, alter,
 or destroy it, according to our present pleasure or advantage. This
 relation, then, is a species of cause and effect; and as property is
 nothing but a stable possession, derived from the rules of justice, or
 the conventions of men, it is to be considered as the same species of
 relation. But here we may observe, that as the power of using any object
 becomes more or less certain, according as the interruptions we may meet
 with are more or less probable; and as this probability may increase
 by insensible degrees; it is in many cases impossible to determine when
 possession begins or ends; nor is there any certain standard, by which
 we can decide such controversies. A wild boar, that falls into our
 snares, is deemed to be in our possession, if it be impossible for him
 to escape. But what do we mean by impossible? How do we separate this
 impossibility from an improbability? And how distinguish that exactly
 from a probability? Mark the precise limits of the one and the other,
 and shew the standard, by which we may decide all disputes that may
 arise, and, as we find by experience, frequently do arise upon this
 subject.
 
 
      [Footnote 17. If we seek a solution of these difficulties in
      reason and public interest, we never shall find
      satisfaction; and If we look for it in the imagination, it
      is evident, that the qualities, which operate upon that
      faculty, run so insensibly and gradually into each other,
      that it is impossible to give them any precise bounds or
      termination. The difficulties on this head must encrease,
      when we consider, that our judgment alters very sensibly,
      according to the subject, and that the same power and
      proximity will be deemed possession in one case, which is
      not esteemed such in another. A person, who has hunted a
      hare to the last degree of weariness, would look upon it as
      an injustice for another to rush in before him, and seize
      his prey. But the same person advancing to pluck an apple,
      that hangs within his reach, has no reason to complain, if
      another, more alert, passes him, and takes possession. What
      is the reason of this difference, but that immobility, not
      being natural to the hare, but the effect of industry, forms
      in that case a strong relation with the hunter, which is
      wanting in the other?
 
      Here then it appears, that a certain and infallible power of
      enjoyment, without touch or some other sensible relation,
      often produces not property: And I farther observe, that a
      sensible relation, without any present power, is sometimes
      sufficient to give a title to any object. The sight of a
      thing is seldom a considerable relation, and is only
      regarded as such, when the object is hidden, or very
      obscure; in which case we find, that the view alone conveys
      a property; according to that maxim, THAT EVEN A WHOLE
      CONTINENT BELONGS TO THE NATION, WHICH FIRST DISCOVERED IT.
      It is however remarkable that both in the case of discovery
      and that of possession, the first discoverer and possessor
      must join to the relation an intention of rendering himself
      proprietor, otherwise the relation will not have Its effect;
      and that because the connexion in our fancy betwixt the
      property and the relation is not so great, but that it
      requires to be helped by such an intention.
 
      From all these circumstances, it is easy to see how
      perplexed many questions may become concerning the
      acquisition of property by occupation; and the least effort
      of thought may present us with instances, which are not
      susceptible of any reasonable decision. If we prefer
      examples, which are real, to such as are feigned, we may
      consider the following one, which is to be met with In
      almost every writer, that has treated of the laws of nature.
      Two Grecian colonies, leaving their native country, in
      search of new feats, were informed that a city near them was
      deserted by its inhabitants. To know the truth of this
      report, they dispatched at once two messengers, one from
      each colony; who finding on their approach, that their
      information was true, begun a race together with an
      intention to take possession of the city, each of them for
      his countrymen. One of these messengers, finding that he was
      not an equal match for the other, launched his spear at the
      gates of the city, and was so fortunate as to fix it there
      before the arrival of his companion. This produced a dispute
      betwixt the two colonies, which of them was the proprietor
      of the empty city and this dispute still subsists among
      philosophers. For my part I find the dispute impossible to
      be decided, and that because the whole question hangs upon
      the fancy, which in this case is not possessed of any
      precise or determinate standard, upon which it can give
      sentence. To make this evident, let us consider, that if
      these two persons had been simply members of the colonies,
      and not messengers or deputies, their actions would not have
      been of any consequence; since in that case their relation
      to the colonies would have been but feeble and imperfect.
      Add to this, that nothing determined them to run to the
      gates rather than the walls, or any other part of the city,
      but that the gates, being the most obvious and remarkable
      part, satisfy the fancy best in taking them for the whole;
      as we find by the poets, who frequently draw their images
      and metaphors from them. Besides we may consider, that the
      touch or contact of the one messenger is not properly
      possession, no more than the piercing the gates with a
      spear; but only forms a relation; and there is a relation,
      in the other case, equally obvious, tho' not, perhaps, of
      equal force. Which of these relations, then, conveys a right
      and property, or whether any of them be sufficient for that
      effect, I leave to the decision of such as are wiser than
      myself.]
 
 
 But such disputes may not only arise concerning the real existence of
 property and possession, but also concerning their extent; and these
 disputes are often susceptible of no decision, or can be decided by no
 other faculty than the imagination. A person who lands on the shore of
 a small island, that is desart and uncultivated, is deemed its possessor
 from the very first moment, and acquires the property of the whole;
 because the object is there bounded and circumscribed in the fancy, and
 at the same time is proportioned to the new possessor. The same person
 landing on a desart island, as large as Great Britain, extends his
 property no farther than his immediate possession; though a numerous
 colony are esteemed the proprietors of the whole from the instant of
 their debarkment.
 
 But it often happens, that the title of first possession becomes obscure
 through time; and that it is impossible to determine many controversies,
 which may arise concerning it. In that case long possession or
 prescription naturally takes place, and gives a person a sufficient
 property in any thing he enjoys. The nature of human society admits not
 of any great accuracy; nor can we always remount to the first origin of
 things, in order to determine their present condition. Any considerable
 space of time sets objects at such a distance, that they seem, in a
 manner, to lose their reality, and have as little influence on the mind,
 as if they never had been in being. A man's title, that is clear and
 certain at present, will seem obscure and doubtful fifty years hence,
 even though the facts, on which it is founded, should be proved with
 the greatest evidence and certainty. The same facts have not the same
 influence after so long an interval of time. And this may be received as
 a convincing argument for our preceding doctrine with regard to property
 and justice. Possession during a long tract of time conveys a title to
 any object. But as it is certain, that, however every thing be produced
 in time, there is nothing real that is produced by time; it follows,
 that property being produced by time, is not any thing real in the
 objects, but is the off-spring of the sentiments, on which alone time is
 found to have any influence.
 
 
      [Footnote 18.  Present possession is plainly a relation
      betwixt a person and an object; but is not sufficient to
      counter-ballance the relation of first possession, unless
      the former be long and uninterrupted: In which case the
      relation is encreased on the side of the present possession,
      by the extent of time, and dlminished on that of first
      possession, by the distance, This change in the relation
      produces a consequent change in the property.]
 
      We acquire the property of objects by accession, when they
      are connected in an intimate manner with objects that are
      already our property, and at the same time are inferior to
      them. Thus the fruits of our garden, the offspring of our
      cattle, and the work of our slaves, are all of them esteemed
      our property, even before possession. Where objects are
      connected together in the imagination, they are apt to be
      put on the same footing, and are commonly supposed to be
      endowed with the same qualities. We readily pass from one to
      the other, and make no difference in our judgments
      concerning them; especially if the latter be inferior to the
      former.
 
 
      [Footnote 19.  This source of property can never be
      explained but from the imaginations; and one may affirm,
      that the causes are here unmixed. We shall proceed to
      explain them more particularly, and illustrate them by
      examples from common life and experience.
 
      It has been observed above, that the mind has a natural
      propensity to join relations, especially resembling ones,
      and finds a hind of fitness and uniformity in such an union.
      From this propensity are derived these laws of nature, that
      upon the first formation of society, property always follows
      the present possession; and afterwards, that it arises from
      first or from long possession. Now we may easily observe,
      that relation is not confined merely to one degree; but that
      from an object, that is related to us, we acquire a relation
      to every other object, which is related to it, and so on,
      till the thought loses the chain by too long a progress,
      However the relation may weaken by each remove, it is not
      immediately destroyed; but frequently connects two objects
      by means of an intermediate one, which is related to both.
      And this principle is of such force as to give rise to the
      right of accession, and causes us to acquire the property
      not only of such objects as we are immediately possessed of;
      but also of such as are closely connected with them.
 
      Suppose a German, a Frenchman, and a Spaniard to come into a
      room, where there are placed upon the table three bottles of
      wine, Rhenish, Burgundy and Port; and suppose they shoued
      fall a quarrelling about the division of them; a person, who
      was chosen for umpire would naturally, to shew his
      impartiality, give every one the product of his own country:
      And this from a principle, which, in some measure, is the
      source of those laws of nature, that ascribe property to
      occupation, prescription and accession.
 
      In all these Cases, and particularly that of accession,
      there is first a natural union betwixt the Idea of the
      person and that of the object, and afterwards a new and
      moral union produced by that right or property, which we
      ascribe to the person. But here there occurs a difficulty,
      which merits our attention, and may afford us an opportunity
      of putting to tryal that singular method of reasoning, which
      has been employed on the present subject. I have already
      observed that the imagination passes with greater facility
      from little to great, than from great to littie, and that
      the transition of ideas is always easier and smoother in the
      former case than in the latter. Now as the right of
      accession arises from the easy transition of ideas, by which
      related objects are connected together, it shoued naturally
      be imagined, that the right of accession must encrease in
      strength, in proportion as the transition of ideas is
      performed with greater facility. It may, therefore, be
      thought, that when we have acquired the property of any
      small object, we shall readily consider any great object
      related to it as an accession, and as belonging to the
      proprietor of the small one; since the transition is in that
      case very easy from the small object to the great one, and
      shoued connect them together in the closest manner. But In
      fact the case is always found to be otherwise, The empire of
      Great Britain seems to draw along with it the dominion of
      the Orkneys, the Hebrides, the isle of Man, and the Isle of
      Wight; but the authority over those lesser islands does not
      naturally imply any title to Great Britain. In short, a
      small object naturally follows a great one as its accession;
      but a great one Is never supposed to belong to the
      proprietor of a small one related to it, merely on account
      of that property and relation. Yet in this latter case the
      transition of ideas is smoother from the proprietor to the
      small object, which is his property, and from the small
      object to the great one, than in the former case from the
      proprietor to the great object, and from the great one to
      the small. It may therefore be thought, that these
      phaenomena are objections to the foregoing hypothesis, THAT
      THE ASCRIBING OF PROPERTY TO ACCESSION IS NOTHING BUT AN
      AFFECT OF THE RELATIONS OF IDEAS, AND OF THE SMOOTH
      TRANSITION OF THE IMAGINATION.
 
      It will be easy to solve this objection, if we consider the
      agility and unsteadiness of the imagination, with the
      different views, in which it is continually placing its
      objects. When we attribute to a person a property in two
      objects, we do not always pass from the person to one
      object, and from that to the other related to it. The
      objects being here to be considered as the property of the
      person, we are apt to join them together, and place them in
      the same light. Suppose, therefore, a great and a small
      object to be related together; if a person be strongly
      related to the great object, he will likewise be strongly
      related to both the objects, considered together, because he
      Is related to the most considerable part. On the contrary,
      if he be only related to the small object, he will not be
      strongly related to both, considered together, since his
      relation lies only with the most trivial part, which is not
      apt to strike us in any great degree, when we consider the
      whole. And this Is the reason, why small objects become
      accessions to great ones, and not great to small.
 
      It is the general opinion of philosophers and civilians,
      that the sea is incapable of becoming the property of any
      nation; and that because it is impossible to take possession
      of it, or form any such distinct relation with it, as may be
      the foundation of property. Where this reason ceases,
      property immediately takes place. Thus the most strenuous
      advocates for the liberty of the seas universally allow,
      that friths and hays naturally belong as an accession to the
      proprietors of the surrounding continent. These have
      properly no more bond or union with the land, than the
      pacific ocean would have; but having an union in the fancy,
      and being at the same time inferior, they are of course
      regarded as an accession.
 
      The property of rivers, by the laws of most nations, and by
      the natural turn of our thought, Is attributed to the
      proprietors of their banks, excepting such vast rivers as
      the Rhine or the Danube, which seem too large to the
      imagination to follow as an accession the property of the
      neighbouring fields. Yet even these rivers are considered as
      the property of that nation, thro' whose dominions they run;
      the idea of a nation being of a suitable bulk to correspond
      with them, and bear them such a relation in the fancy.
 
      The accessions, which are made to lands bordering upon
      rivers, follow the land, say the civilians, provided it be
      made by what they call alluvion, that is, Insensibly and
      Imperceptibly; which are circumstances that mightily assist
      the imagination in the conjunction. Where there Is any
      considerable portion torn at once from one bank, and joined
      to another, it becomes not his property, whose land it falls
      on, till it unite with the land, and till the trees or
      plants have spread their roots into both. Before that, the
      imagination does not sufficiently join them.
 
      There are other cases, which somewhat resemble this of
      accession, but which, at the bottom, are considerably
      different, and merit our attention. Of this kind Is the
      conjunction of the properties of different persons, after
      such a manner as not to admit of separation. The question
      is, to whom the united mass must belong.
 
      Where this conjunction is of such a nature as to admit of
      division, but not of separation, the decision is natural and
      easy. The whole mass must be supposed to be common betwixt
      the proprietors of the several parts, and afterwards must be
      divided according to the proportions of these parts. But
      here I cannot forbear taking notice of a remarkable subtilty
      of the Roman law, in distinguishing betwixt confusion and
      commixtion. Confusion is an union of two bodies, such as
      different liquors, where the parts become entirely
      undistinguishable. Commixtion is the blending of two bodies,
      such as two bushels of corn, where the parts remain separate
      in an obvious and visible manner. As in the latter case the
      imagination discovers not so entire an union as in the
      former, but is able to trace and preserve a distinct idea of
      the property of each; this is the reason, why the civil law,
      tho' it established an entire community in the case of
      confusion, and after that a proportional division, yet in
      the case of commixtion, supposes each of the proprietors to
      maintain a distinct right; however necessity may at last
      force them to submit to the same division.

      (In the case that your grain was mixed with that of Titius,
      if it was done voluntarily on the part of both of you, it is
      common property, inasmuch as the individual items, i.e., the
      single grains, which were the peculiar property of either of
      you, were combined with your joint consent. If, however, the
      mixture was accidental, or if Titius mixed it without your
      consent, it does not appear that it is common property,
      Inasmuch as the several components retain their original
      identity. Rather, in circumstances of this sort the grain
      does not become common property, any more than a herd of
      cattle is regarded as common property, If Titius beasts
      should have become mixed up with yours.
 
      However, if all of the aforesaid corn is kept by either of
      you, this gives rise to a suit to determine the ownership of
      property, in respect of the amount of corn belonging to
      each. It is in the discretion of the judge to determine
      which is the corn belonging to either party.]
 
 
      Where the properties of two persons are united after such a
      manner as neither to admit of division nor separation, as
      when one builds a house on another's ground, in that case,
      the whole must belong to one of the proprietors: And here I
      assert, that it naturally is conceived to belong to the
      proprietor of the most considerable part. For however the
      compound object may have a relation to two different
      persons, and carry our view at once to both of them, yet as
      the most considerable part principally engages our
      attention, and by the strict union draws the inferior along
      it; for this reason, the whole bears a relation to the
      proprietor of that part, and is regarded as his property.
      The only difficulty is, what we shall be pleased to call the
      most considerable part, and most attractive to the
      imagination.
 
      This quality depends on several different circumstances,
      which have little connexion with each other. One part of a
      compound object may become more considerable than another,
      either because it is more constant and durable; because it
      is of greater value; because it is more obvious and
      remarkable; because it is of greater extent; or because its
      existence is more separate and independent. It will be easy
      to conceive, that, as these circumstances may be conjoined
      and opposed in all the different ways, and according to all
      the different degrees, which can be imagined, there will
      result many cases, where the reasons on both sides are so
      equally balanced, that it is impossible for us to give any
      satisfactory decision. Here then is the proper business of
      municipal laws, to fix what the principles of human nature
      have left undetermined.
 
      The superficies yields to the soil, says the civil law: The
      writing to the paper: The canvas to the picture. These
      decisions do not well agree together, and are a proof of the
      contrariety of those principles, from which they are
      derived.
 
      But of all the questions of this kind the most curious is
      that, which for so many ages divided the disciples of
      Proculus and Sabinus. Suppose a person shoued make a cup
      from the metal of another, or a ship from his wood, and
      suppose the proprietor of the metal or wood shoued demand
      his goods, the question is, whether he acquires a title to
      the cup or ship. Sabinus maintained the affirmative, and
      asserted that the substance or matter is the foundation of
      all the qualities; that it is incorruptible and immortal,
      and therefore superior to the form, which is casual and
      dependent. On the other hand, Proculus observed, that the
      form is the most obvious and remarkable part, and that from
      it bodies are denominated of this or that particular
      species. To which he might have added, that the matter or
      substance is in most bodies so fluctuating and uncertain,
      that it is utterly impossible to trace it in all its
      changes. For my part, I know not from what principles such a
      controversy can be certainly determined. I shall therefore
      content my self with observing, that the decision of
      Trebonian seems to me pretty ingenious; that the cup belongs
      to the proprietor of the metal, because it can be brought
      back to its first form: But that the ship belongs to the
      author of its form for a contrary reason. But however
      ingenious this reason may seem, it plainly depends upon the
      fancy, which by the possibility of such a reduction, finds a
      closer connexion and relation betwixt a cup and the
      proprietor of its metal, than betwixt a ship and the
      proprietor of its wood, where the substance is more fixed
      and unalterable.]
 
 
 The right of succession is a very natural one, from the presumed
 consent of the parent or near relation, and from the general interest
 of mankind, which requires, that men's possessions should pass to those,
 who are dearest to them, in order to render them more industrious and
 frugal. Perhaps these causes are seconded by the influence of relation,
 or the association of ideas, by which we are naturally directed to
 consider the son after the parent's decease, and ascribe to him a title
 to his father's possessions. Those goods must become the property of
 some body: But of whom is the question. Here it is evident the persons
 children naturally present themselves to the mind; and being already.
 connected to those possessions by means of their deceased parent, we are
 apt to connect them still farther by the relation of property. Of this
 there are many parallel instances.
 
 
      [Footnote 20  In examining the different titles to authority
      in government, we shall meet with many reasons to convince
      us, that the right of succession depends, in a great measure
      on the imagination. Mean while I shall rest contented with
      observing one example, which belongs to the present subject.
      Suppose that a person die without children, and that a
      dispute arises among his relations concerning his
      inheritance; it is evident, that if his riches be deriv'd
      partly from his father, partly from his mother, the most
      natural way of determining such a dispute, is, to divide his
      possessions, and assign each part to the family, from whence
      it is deriv'd. Now as the person is suppos'd to have been
      once the full and entire proprietor of those goods; I ask,
      what is it makes us find a certain equity and natural reason
      in this partition, except it be the imagination? His
      affection to these families does not depend upon his
      possessions; for which reason his consent can never be
      presum'd precisely for such a partition. And as to the
      public interest, it seems not to be in the least concern'd
      on the one side or the other.]
 
 
 
 
 SECT. IV OF THE TRANSFERENCE OF PROPERTY BY CONSENT
 
 
 However useful, or even necessary, the stability of possession may be to
 human society, it is attended with very considerable inconveniences.
 The relation of fitness or suitableness ought never to enter into
 consideration, in distributing the properties of mankind; but we must
 govern ourselves by rules, which are more general in their application,
 and more free from doubt and uncertainty. Of this kind is present
 possession upon the first establishment of society; and afterwards
 occupation, prescription, accession, and succession. As these depend
 very much on chance, they must frequently prove contradictory both to
 men's wants and desires; and persons and possessions must often be very
 ill adjusted. This is a grand inconvenience, which calls for a remedy.
 To apply one directly, and allow every man to seize by violence what he
 judges to be fit for him, would destroy society; and therefore the
 rules of justice seek some medium betwixt a rigid stability, and this
 changeable and uncertain adjustment. But there is no medium better than
 that obvious one, that possession and property should always be stable,
 except when the proprietor consents to bestow them on some other
 person. This rule can have no ill consequence, in occasioning wars and
 dissentions; since the proprietor's consent, who alone is concerned, is
 taken along in the alienation: And it may serve to many good purposes
 in adjusting property to persons. Different parts of the earth produce
 different commodities; and not only so, but different men both are
 by nature fitted for different employments, and attain to greater
 perfection in any one, when they confine themselves to it alone. All
 this requires a mutual exchange and commerce; for which reason the
 translation of property by consent is founded on a law of nature, as
 well as its stability without such a consent.
 
 So far is determined by a plain utility and interest. But perhaps it is
 from more trivial reasons, that delivery, or a sensible transference of
 the object is commonly required by civil laws, and also by the laws of
 nature, according to most authors, as a requisite circumstance in the
 translation of property. The property of an object, when taken for
 something real, without any reference to morality, or the sentiments of
 the mind, is a quality perfectly insensible, and even inconceivable; nor
 can we form any distinct notion, either of its stability or translation.
 This imperfection of our ideas is less sensibly felt with regard to its
 stability, as it engages less our attention, and is easily past over by
 the mind, without any scrupulous examination. But as the translation
 of property from one person to another is a more remarkable event, the
 defect of our ideas becomes more sensible on that occasion, and obliges
 us to turn ourselves on every side in search of some remedy. Now as
 nothing more enlivens any idea than a present impression, and a relation
 betwixt that impression and the idea; it is natural for us to seek
 some false light from this quarter. In order to aid the imagination in
 conceiving the transference of property, we take the sensible object,
 and actually transfer its possession to the person, on whom we would
 bestow the property. The supposed resemblance of the actions, and the
 presence of this sensible delivery, deceive the mind, and make it fancy,
 that it conceives the mysterious transition of the property. And that
 this explication of the matter is just, appears hence, that men have
 invented a symbolical delivery, to satisfy the fancy, where the real one
 is impracticable. Thus the giving the keys of a granary is understood
 to be the delivery of the corn contained in it: The giving of stone
 and earth represents the delivery of a mannor. This is a kind of
 superstitious practice in civil laws, and in the laws of nature,
 resembling the Roman catholic superstitions in religion. As the Roman
 catholics represent the inconceivable mysteries of the Christian
 religion, and render them more present to the mind, by a taper, or
 habit, or grimace, which is supposed to resemble them; so lawyers and
 moralists have run into like inventions for the same reason, and
 have endeavoured by those means to satisfy themselves concerning the
 transference of property by consent.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. V OF THE OBLIGATION OF PROMISES
 
 
 That the rule of morality, which enjoins the performance of promises, is
 not natural, will sufficiently appear from these two propositions,
 which I proceed to prove, viz, that a promise would not be intelligible,
 before human conventions had established it; and that even if it were
 intelligible, it would not be attended with any moral obligation.
 
 I say, first, that a promise is not intelligible naturally, nor
 antecedent to human conventions; and that a man, unacquainted with
 society, could never enter into any engagements with another, even
 though they could perceive each other's thoughts by intuition. If
 promises be natural and intelligible, there must be some act of the mind
 attending these words, I promise; and on this act of the mind must the
 obligation depend. Let us, therefore, run over all the faculties of the
 soul, and see which of them is exerted in our promises.
 
 The act of the mind, exprest by a promise, is not a resolution to
 perform any thing: For that alone never imposes any obligation. Nor is
 it a desire of such a performance: For we may bind ourselves without
 such a desire, or even with an aversion, declared and avowed. Neither
 is it the willing of that action, which we promise to perform: For a
 promise always regards some future time, and the will has an influence
 only on present actions. It follows, therefore, that since the act of
 the mind, which enters into a promise, and produces its obligation, is
 neither the resolving, desiring, nor willing any particular performance,
 it must necessarily be the willing of that obligation, which arises
 from the promise. Nor is this only a conclusion of philosophy; but is
 entirely conformable to our common ways of thinking and of expressing
 ourselves, when we say that we are bound by our own consent, and that
 the obligation arises from our mere will and pleasure. The only question
 then is, whether there be not a manifest absurdity in supposing this
 act of the mind, and such an absurdity as no man coued fall into,
 whose ideas are not confounded with prejudice and the fallacious use of
 language.
 
 All morality depends upon our sentiments; and when any action, or
 quality of the mind, pleases us after a certain manner, we say it is
 virtuous; and when the neglect, or nonperformance of it, displeases us
 after a like manner, we say that we lie under an obligation to perform
 it. A change of the obligation supposes a change of the sentiment; and
 a creation of a new obligation supposes some new sentiment to arise. But
 it is certain we can naturally no more change our own sentiments, than
 the motions of the heavens; nor by a single act of our will, that is,
 by a promise, render any action agreeable or disagreeable, moral
 or immoral; which, without that act, would have produced contrary
 impressions, or have been endowed with different qualities. It would
 be absurd, therefore, to will any new obligation, that is, any new
 sentiment of pain or pleasure; nor is it possible, that men coued
 naturally fall into so gross an absurdity. A promise, therefore, is
 naturally something altogether unintelligible, nor is there any act of
 the mind belonging to it.
 
 
      [Footnote 21  Were morality discoverable by reason, and not
      by sentiment, it would be still more evident, that promises
      cou'd make no alteration upon it. Morality is suppos'd to
      consist in relation. Every new imposition of morality,
      therefore, must arise from some new relation of objects; and
      consequently the will coud not produce immediately any
      change in morals, but cou'd have that effect only by
      producing a change upon the objects. But as the moral
      obligation of a promise is the pure effect of the will,
      without the least change in any part of the universe; it
      follows, that promises have no natural obligation.
 
      Shou'd it be said, that this act of the will being in effect
      a new object, produces new relations and new duties; I wou'd
      answer, that this is a pure sophism, which may be detected
      by a very moderate share of accuracy and exactness. To will
      a new obligation, is to will a new relation of objects; and
      therefore, if this new relation of objects were form'd by
      the volition itself, we should in effect will the volition;
      which is plainly absurd and impossible. The will has here no
      object to which it cou'd tend; but must return upon itself
      in infinitum. The new obligation depends upon new relations.
      The new relations depend upon a new volition. The new
      volition has for object a new obligation, and consequently
      new relations, and consequently a new volition; which
      volition again has in view a new obligation, relation and
      volition, without any termination. It is impossible,
      therefore, we cou'd ever will a new obligation; and
      consequently it is impossible the will cou'd ever accompany
      a promise, or produce a new obligation of morality.]
 
 But, secondly, if there was any act of the mind belonging to it, it
 could not naturally produce any obligation. This appears evidently
 from the foregoing reasoning. A promise creates a new obligation. A new
 obligation supposes new sentiments to arise. The will never creates new
 sentiments. There could not naturally, therefore, arise any obligation
 from a promise, even supposing the mind could fall into the absurdity of
 willing that obligation.
 
 The same truth may be proved still more evidently by that reasoning,
 which proved justice in general to be an artificial virtue. No action
 can be required of us as our duty, unless there be implanted in human
 nature some actuating passion or motive, capable of producing the
 action. This motive cannot be the sense of duty. A sense of duty
 supposes an antecedent obligation: And where an action is not required
 by any natural passion, it cannot be required by any natural obligation;
 since it may be omitted without proving any defect or imperfection
 in the mind and temper, and consequently without any vice. Now it is
 evident we have no motive leading us to the performance of promises,
 distinct from a sense of duty. If we thought, that promises had no moral
 obligation, we never should feel any inclination to observe them. This
 is not the case with the natural virtues. Though there was no obligation
 to relieve the miserable, our humanity would lead us to it; and when we
 omit that duty, the immorality of the omission arises from its being a
 proof, that we want the natural sentiments of humanity. A father knows
 it to be his duty to take care of his children: But he has also a
 natural inclination to it. And if no human creature had that indination,
 no one coued lie under any such obligation. But as there is naturally
 no inclination to observe promises, distinct from a sense of their
 obligation; it follows, that fidelity is no natural virtue, and that
 promises have no force, antecedent to human conventions.
 
 If any one dissent from this, he must give a regular proof of these two
 propositions, viz. THAT THERE IS A PECULIAR ACT OF THE MIND, ANNEXT TO
 PROMISES; AND THAT CONSEQUENT TO THIS ACT OF THE MIND, THERE ARISES AN
 INCLINATION TO PERFORM, DISTINCT FROM A SENSE OF DUTY. I presume, that
 it is impossible to prove either of these two points; and therefore I
 venture to conclude that promises are human inventions, founded on the
 necessities and interests of society.
 
 In order to discover these necessities and interests, we must consider
 the same qualities of human nature, which we have already found to give
 rise to the preceding laws of society. Men being naturally selfish, or
 endowed only with a confined generosity, they are not easily induced to
 perform any action for the interest of strangers, except with a view to
 some reciprocal advantage, which they had no hope of obtaining but by
 such a performance. Now as it frequently happens, that these mutual
 performances cannot be finished at the same instant, it is necessary,
 that one party be contented to remain in uncertainty, and depend
 upon the gratitude of the other for a return of kindness. But so much
 corruption is there among men, that, generally speaking, this becomes
 but a slender security; and as the benefactor is here supposed to bestow
 his favours with a view to self-interest, this both takes off from the
 obligation, and sets an example to selfishness, which is the true mother
 of ingratitude. Were we, therefore, to follow the natural course of our
 passions and inclinations, we should perform but few actions for the
 advantage of others, from distinterested views; because we are naturally
 very limited in our kindness and affection: And we should perform as few
 of that kind, out of a regard to interest; because we cannot depend upon
 their gratitude. Here then is the mutual commerce of good offices in a
 manner lost among mankind, and every one reduced to his own skill and
 industry for his well-being and subsistence. The invention of the law of
 nature, concerning the stability of possession, has already rendered
 men tolerable to each other; that of the transference of property and
 possession by consent has begun to render them mutually advantageous:
 But still these laws of nature, however strictly observed, are not
 sufficient to render them so serviceable to each other, as by nature
 they are fitted to become. Though possession be stable, men may often
 reap but small advantage from it, while they are possessed of a greater
 quantity of any species of goods than they have occasion for, and at the
 same time suffer by the want of others. The transference of property,
 which is the proper remedy for this inconvenience, cannot remedy it
 entirely; because it can only take place with regard to such objects as
 are present and individual, but not to such as are absent or general.
 One cannot transfer the property of a particular house, twenty leagues
 distant; because the consent cannot be attended with delivery, which is
 a requisite circumstance. Neither can one transfer the property of ten
 bushels of corn, or five hogsheads of wine, by the mere expression
 and consent; because these are only general terms, and have no direct
 relation to any particular heap of corn, or barrels of wine. Besides,
 the commerce of mankind is not confined to the barter of commodities,
 but may extend to services and actions, which we may exchange to our
 mutual interest and advantage. Your corn is ripe to-day; mine will be
 so tomorrow. It is profitable for us both, that I should labour with
 you to-day, and that you should aid me to-morrow. I have no kindness for
 you, and know you have as little for me. I will not, therefore, take
 any pains upon your account; and should I labour with you upon my own
 account, in expectation of a return, I know I should be disappointed,
 and that I should in vain depend upon your gratitude. Here then I
 leave you to labour alone: You treat me in the same manner. The seasons
 change; and both of us lose our harvests for want of mutual confidence
 and security.
 
 All this is the effect of the natural and inherent principles and
 passions of human nature; and as these passions and principles are
 inalterable, it may be thought, that our conduct, which depends on them,
 must be so too, and that it would be in vain, either for moralists or
 politicians, to tamper with us, or attempt to change the usual course of
 our actions, with a view to public interest. And indeed, did the success
 of their designs depend upon their success in correcting the selfishness
 and ingratitude of men, they would never make any progress, unless aided
 by omnipotence, which is alone able to new-mould the human mind, and
 change its character in such fundamental articles. All they can pretend
 to, is, to give a new direction to those natural passions, and teach us
 that we can better satisfy our appetites in an oblique and artificial
 manner, than by their headlong and impetuous motion. Hence I learn to do
 a service to another, without bearing him any real kindness; because I
 forsee, that he will return my service, in expectation of another of
 the same kind, and in order to maintain the same correspondence of good
 offices with me or with others. And accordingly, after I have served
 him, and he is in possession of the advantage arising from my action,
 he is induced to perform his part, as foreseeing the consequences of his
 refusal.
 
 But though this self-interested commerce of man begins to take place,
 and to predominate in society, it does not entirely abolish the more
 generous and noble intercourse of friendship and good offices. I may
 still do services to such persons as I love, and am more particularly
 acquainted with, without any prospect of advantage; and they may make me
 a return in the same manner, without any view but that of recompensing
 my past services. In order, therefore, to distinguish those two
 different sorts of commerce, the interested and the disinterested, there
 is a certain form of words invented for the former, by which we
 bind ourselves to the performance of any action. This form of words
 constitutes what we call a promise, which is the sanction of the
 interested commerce of mankind. When a man says he promises any thing,
 he in effect expresses a resolution of performing it; and along with
 that, by making use of this form of words, subjects himself to the
 penalty of never being trusted again in case of failure. A resolution is
 the natural act of the mind, which promises express: But were there
 no more than a resolution in the case, promises would only declare our
 former motives, and would not create any new motive or obligation. They
 are the conventions of men, which create a new motive, when experience
 has taught us, that human affairs would be conducted much more for
 mutual advantage, were there certain symbols or signs instituted,
 by which we might give each, other security of our conduct in any
 particular incident, After these signs are instituted, whoever uses them
 is immediately bound by his interest to execute his engagements, and
 must never expect to be trusted any more, if he refuse to perform what
 he promised.
 
 Nor is that knowledge, which is requisite to make mankind sensible
 of this interest in the institution and observance of promises, to be
 esteemed superior to the capacity of human nature, however savage and
 uncultivated. There needs but a very little practice of the world, to
 make us perceive all these consequences and advantages. The shortest
 experience of society discovers them to every mortal; and when each
 individual perceives the same sense of interest in all his fellows, he
 immediately performs his part of any contract, as being assured, that
 they will not be wanting in theirs. All of them, by concert, enter into
 a scheme of actions, calculated for common benefit, and agree to be true
 to their word; nor is there any thing requisite to form this concert or
 convention, but that every one have a sense of interest in the faithful
 fulfilling of engagements, and express that sense to other members of
 the society. This immediately causes that interest to operate upon them;
 and interest is the first obligation to the performance of promises.
 
 Afterwards a sentiment of morals concurs with interest, and becomes
 a new obligation upon mankind. This sentiment of morality, in the
 performance of promises, arises from the same principles as that in the
 abstinence from the property of others. Public interest, education, and
 the artifices of politicians, have the same effect in both cases. The
 difficulties, that occur to us, in supposing a moral obligation
 to attend promises, we either surmount or elude. For instance; the
 expression of a resolution is not commonly supposed to be obligatory;
 and we cannot readily conceive how the making use of a certain form of
 words should be able to cause any material difference. Here, therefore,
 we feign a new act of the mind, which we call the willing an obligation;
 and on this we suppose the morality to depend. But we have proved
 already, that there is no such act of the mind, and consequently that
 promises impose no natural obligation.
 
 To confirm this, we may subjoin some other reflections concerning
 that will, which is supposed to enter into a promise, and to cause its
 obligation. It is evident, that the will alone is never supposed to
 cause the obligation, but must be expressed by words or signs, in order
 to impose a tye upon any man. The expression being once brought in as
 subservient to the will, soon becomes the principal part of the promise;
 nor will a man be less bound by his word, though he secretly give a
 different direction to his intention, and with-hold himself both from
 a resolution, and from willing an obligation. But though the expression
 makes on most occasions the whole of the promise, yet it does not always
 so; and one, who should make use of any expression, of which he knows
 not the meaning, and which he uses without any intention of binding
 himself, would not certainly be bound by it. Nay, though he knows its
 meaning, yet if he uses it in jest only, and with such signs as shew
 evidently he has no serious intention of binding himself, he would not
 lie under any obligation of performance; but it is necessary, that the
 words be a perfect expression of the will, without any contrary signs.
 Nay, even this we must not carry so far as to imagine, that one, whom,
 by our quickness of understanding, we conjecture, from certain signs,
 to have an intention of deceiving us, is not bound by his expression or
 verbal promise, if we accept of it; but must limit this conclusion
 to those cases, where the signs are of a different kind from those
 of deceit. All these contradictions are easily accounted for, if the
 obligation of promises be merely a human invention for the convenience
 of society; but will never be explained, if it be something real and
 natural, arising from any action of the mind or body.
 
 I shall farther observe, that since every new promise imposes a new
 obligation of morality on the person who promises, and since this new
 obligation arises from his will; it is one of the most mysterious and
 incomprehensible operations that can possibly be imagined, and may even
 be compared to TRANSUBSTANTIATION, or HOLY ORDERS [I mean so far, as
 holy orders are suppos'd to produce the indelible character. In other
 respects they are only a legal qualification.], where a certain form of
 words, along with a certain intention, changes entirely the nature of an
 external object, and even of a human nature. But though these mysteries
 be so far alike, it is very remarkable, that they differ widely in other
 particulars, and that this difference may be regarded as a strong proof
 of the difference of their origins. As the obligation of promises is
 an invention for the interest of society, it is warped into as many
 different forms as that interest requires, and even runs into direct
 contradictions, rather than lose sight of its object. But as those other
 monstrous doctines are mere priestly inventions, and have no public
 interest in view, they are less disturbed in their progress by new
 obstacles; and it must be owned, that, after the first absurdity, they
 follow more directly the current of reason and good sense. Theologians
 clearly perceived, that the external form of words, being mere sound,
 require an intention to make them have any efficacy; and that this
 intention being once considered as a requisite circumstance, its absence
 must equally prevent the effect, whether avowed or concealed, whether
 sincere or deceitful. Accordingly they have commonly determined, that
 the intention of the priest makes the sacrament, and that when he
 secretly withdraws his intention, he is highly criminal in himself; but
 still destroys the baptism, or communion, or holy orders. The terrible
 consequences of this doctrine were not able to hinder its taking place;
 as the inconvenience of a similar doctrine, with regard to promises,
 have prevented that doctrine from establishing itself. Men are always
 more concerned about the present life than the future; and are apt to
 think the smallest evil, which regards the former, more important than
 the greatest, which regards the latter.
 
 We may draw the same conclusion, concerning the origin of promises, from
 the force, which is supposed to invalidate all contracts, and to free us
 from their obligation. Such a principle is a proof, that promises have
 no natural obligation, and are mere artificial contrivances for the
 convenience and advantage of society. If we consider aright of the
 matter, force is not essentially different from any other motive of hope
 or fear, which may induce us to engage our word, and lay ourselves under
 any obligation. A man, dangerously wounded, who promises a competent
 sum to a surgeon to cure him, would certainly be bound to performance;
 though the case be not so much different from that of one, who promises
 a sum to a robber, as to produce so great a difference in our sentiments
 of morality, if these sentiments were not built entirely on public
 interest and convenience.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VI SOME FARTHER REFLECTIONS CONCERNING JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE
 
 
 We have now run over the three fundamental laws of nature, that of the
 stability of possession, of its transference by consent, and of the
 performance of promises. It is on the strict t observance of those three
 laws, that the peace and security of human society entirely depend; nor
 is there any possibility of establishing a good correspondence among
 men, where these are neglected. Society is absolutely necessary for the
 well-being of men; and these are as necessary to the support of society.
 Whatever restraint they may impose on the passions of men, they are the
 real offspring of those passions, and are only a more artful and more
 refined way of satisfying them. Nothing is more vigilant and inventive
 than our passions; and nothing is more obvious, than the convention
 for the observance of these rules. Nature has, therefore, trusted this
 affair entirely to the conduct of men, and has not placed in the mind
 any peculiar original principles, to determine us to a set of actions,
 into which the other principles of our frame and constitution were
 sufficient to lead us. And to convince us the more fully of this truth,
 we may here stop a moment, and from a review of the preceding reasonings
 may draw some new arguments, to prove that those laws, however
 necessary, are entirely artificial, and of human invention; and
 consequently that justice is an artificial, and not a natural virtue.
 
 (1) The first argument I shall make use of is derived from the vulgar
 definition of justice. Justice is commonly defined to be a constant and
 perpetual will of giving every one his due. In this definition it is
 supposed, that there are such things as right and property, independent
 of justice, and antecedent to it; and that they would have subsisted,
 though men had never dreamt of practising such a virtue. I have already
 observed, in a cursory manner, the fallacy of this opinion, and shall
 here continue to open up a little more distinctly my sentiments on that
 subject.
 
 I shall begin with observing, that this quality, which we shall call
 property, is like many of the imaginary qualities of the peripatetic
 philosophy, and vanishes upon a more accurate inspection into the
 subject, when considered a-part from our moral sentiments. It is evident
 property does not consist in any of the sensible qualities of the
 object. For these may continue invariably the same, while the property
 changes. Property, therefore, must consist in some relation of the
 object. But it is not in its relation with regard to other external
 and inanimate objects. For these may also continue invariably the same,
 while the property changes. This quality, therefore, consists in the
 relations of objects to intelligent and rational beings. But it is
 not the external and corporeal relation, which forms the essence of
 property. For that relation may be the same betwixt inanimate objects,
 or with regard to brute creatures; though in those cases it forms no
 property. It is, therefore, in some internal relation, that the property
 consists; that is, in some influence, which the external relations of
 the object have on the mind and actions. Thus the external relation,
 which we call occupation or first possession, is not of itself imagined
 to be the property of the object, but only to cause its property. Now it
 is evident, this external relation causes nothing in external objects,
 and has only an influence on the mind, by giving us a sense of duty in
 abstaining from that object, and in restoring it to the first possessor.
 These actions are properly what we call justice; and consequently it is
 on that virtue that the nature of property depends, and not the virtue
 on the property.
 
 If any one, therefore, would assert, that justice is a natural virtue,
 and injustice a natural vice, he must assert, that abstracting from the
 nations of property, and right and obligation, a certain conduct
 and train of actions, in certain external relations of objects, has
 naturally a moral beauty or deformity, and causes an original pleasure
 or uneasiness. Thus the restoring a man's goods to him is considered as
 virtuous, not because nature has annexed a certain sentiment of pleasure
 to such a conduct, with regard to the property of others, but because
 she has annexed that sentiment to such a conduct, with regard to those
 external objects, of which others have had the first or long possession,
 or which they have received by the consent of those, who have had first
 or long possession. If nature has given us no such sentiment, there is
 not, naturally, nor antecedent to human conventions, any such thing as
 property. Now, though it seems sufficiently evident, in this dry and
 accurate consideration of the present subject, that nature has annexed
 no pleasure or sentiment of approbation to such a conduct; yet that I
 may leave as little room for doubt as possible, I shall subjoin a few
 more arguments to confirm my opinion.
 
 First, If nature had given us a pleasure of this kind, it would have
 been as evident and discernible as on every other occasion; nor should
 we have found any difficulty to perceive, that the consideration of such
 actions, in such a situation, gives a certain pleasure and sentiment of
 approbation. We should not have been obliged to have recourse to notions
 of property in the definition of justice, and at the same time make use
 of the notions of justice in the definition of property. This deceitful
 method of reasoning is a plain proof, that there are contained in the
 subject some obscurities and difficulties, which we are not able to
 surmount, and which we desire to evade by this artifice.
 
 Secondly, Those rules, by which properties, rights, and obligations
 are determined, have in them no marks of a natural origin but many of
 artifice and contrivance. They are too numerous to have proceeded from
 nature: They are changeable by human laws: And have all of them a direct
 and evident tendency to public good, and the support, of civil society.
 This last circumstance is remarkable upon two accounts. First, because,
 though the cause of the establishment of these laws had been a regard
 for the public good, as much as the public good is their natural
 tendency, they would still have been artificial, as being purposely
 contrived and directed to a certain end. Secondly, because, if men had
 been endowed with such a strong regard for public good, they would never
 have restrained themselves by these rules; so that the laws of justice
 arise from natural principles in a manner still more oblique and
 artificial. It is self-love which is their real origin; and as the
 self-love of one person is naturally contrary to that of another, these
 several interested passions are obliged to adjust themselves after such
 a manner as to concur in some system of conduct and behaviour. This
 system, therefore, comprehending the interest of each individual, is of
 course advantageous to the public; though it be not intended for that
 purpose by die inventors.
 
 (2) In the second place we may observe, that all kinds of vice and
 virtue run insensibly into each other, and may approach by such
 imperceptible degrees as will make it very difficult, if not absolutely
 impossible, to determine when the one ends, and the other begins; and
 from this observation we may derive a new argument for the foregoing
 principle. For whatever may be the case, with regard to all kinds
 of vice and virtue, it is certain, that rights, and obligations, and
 property, admit of no such insensible gradation, but that a man either
 has a full and perfect property, or none at all; and is either entirely
 obliged to perform any action, or lies under no manner of obligation.
 However civil laws may talk of a perfect dominion, and of an imperfect,
 it is easy to observe, that this arises from a fiction, which has no
 foundation in reason, and can never enter into our notions of natural
 justice and equity. A man that hires a horse, though but for a day, has
 as full a right to make use of it for that time, as he whom we call its
 proprietor has to make use of it any other day; and it was evident, that
 however the use may be bounded in time or degree, the right itself is
 not susceptible of any such gradation, but is absolute and entire, so
 far as it extends. Accordingly we may observe, that this right both
 arises and perishes in an instant; and that a man entirely acquires the
 property of any object by occupation, or the consent of the proprietor;
 and loses it by his own consent; without any of that insensible
 gradation, which is remarkable in other qualities and relations, Since,
 therefore, this is die case with regard to property, and rights, and
 obligations, I ask, how it stands with regard to justice and
 injustice? After whatever manner you answer this question, you run into
 inextricable difficulties. If you reply, that justice and injustice
 admit of degree, and run insensibly into each other, you expressly
 contradict the foregoing position, that obligation and property are not
 susceptible of such a gradation. These depend entirely upon justice and
 injustice, and follow them in all their variations. Where the justice is
 entire, the property is also entire: Where the justice is imperfect, the
 property must also be imperfect And vice versa, if the property admit of
 no such variations, they must also be incompatible with justice. If you
 assent, therefore, to this last proposition, and assert, that justice
 and injustice are not susceptible of degrees, you in effect assert,
 that they are not naturally either vicious or virtuous; since vice
 and virtue, moral good and evil, and indeed all natural qualities,
 run insensibly into each other, and are, on many occasions,
 undistinguishable.
 
 And here it may be worth while to observe, that though abstract
 reasoning, and the general maxims of philosophy and law establish this
 position, that property, and right, and obligation admit not of
 degrees, yet in our common and negligent way of thinking, we find great
 difficulty to entertain that opinion, and do even secretly embrace the
 contrary principle. An object must either be in the possession of
 one person or another. An action must either be performed or not The
 necessity there is of choosing one side in these dilemmas, and the
 impossibility there often is of finding any just medium, oblige us,
 when we reflect on the matter, to acknowledge, that all property and
 obligations are entire. But on the other hand, when we consider the
 origin of property and obligation, and find that they depend on public
 utility, and sometimes on the propensities of the imagination, which are
 seldom entire on any side; we are naturally inclined to imagine, that
 these moral relations admit of an insensible gradation. Hence it is,
 that in references, where the consent of the parties leave the referees
 entire masters of the subject, they commonly discover so much equity and
 justice on both sides, as induces them to strike a medium, and divide
 the difference betwixt the parties. Civil judges, who have not this
 liberty, but are obliged to give a decisive sentence on some one side,
 are often at a loss how to determine, and are necessitated to proceed
 on the most frivolous reasons in the world. Half rights and obligations,
 which seem so natural in common life, are perfect absurdities in their
 tribunal; for which reason they are often obliged to take half arguments
 for whole ones, in order to terminate the affair one way or other.
 
 (3) The third argument of this kind I shall make use of may be explained
 thus. If we consider the ordinary course of human actions, we shall
 find, that the mind restrains not itself by any general and universal
 rules; but acts on most occasions as it is determined by its present
 motives and inclination. As each action is a particular individual
 event, it must proceed from particular principles, and from our
 immediate situation within ourselves, and with respect to the rest of
 the universe. If on some occasions we extend our motives beyond those
 very circumstances, which gave rise to them, and form something like
 general rules for our conduct, it is easy to observe, that these rules
 are not perfectly inflexible, but allow of many exceptions. Since,
 therefore, this is the ordinary course of human actions, we may
 conclude, that the laws of justice, being universal and perfectly
 inflexible, can never be derived from nature, nor be the immediate
 offspring of any natural motive or inclination. No action can be either
 morally good or evil, unless there be some natural passion or motive
 to impel us to it, or deter us from it; and it is evident, that die
 morality must be susceptible of all the same variations, which are
 natural to the passion. Here are two persons, who dispute for an estate;
 of whom one is rich, a fool, and a batchelor; the other poor, a man of
 sense, and has a numerous family: The first is my enemy; the second
 my friend. Whether I be actuated in this affair by a view to public or
 private interest, by friendship or enmity, I must be induced to do my
 utmost to procure the estate to the latter. Nor would any consideration
 of the right and property of the persons be able to restrain me, were I
 actuated only by natural motives, without any combination or convention
 with others. For as all property depends on morality; and as all
 morality depends on the ordinary course of our passions and actions; and
 as these again are only directed by particular motives; it is evident,
 such a partial conduct must be suitable to the strictest morality, and
 coued never be a violation of property. Were men, therefore, to take
 the liberty of acting with regard to the laws of society, as they do in
 every other affair, they would conduct themselves, on most occasions, by
 particular judgments, and would take into consideration the characters
 and circumstances of the persons, as well as the general nature of the
 question. But it is easy to observe, that this would produce an infinite
 confusion in human society, and that the avidity and partiality of men
 would quickly bring disorder into the world, if not restrained by some
 general and inflexible principles. Twas, therefore, with a view to this
 inconvenience, that men have established those principles, and have
 agreed to restrain themselves by general rules, which are unchangeable
 by spite and favour, and by particular views of private or public
 interest. These rules, then, are artificially invented for a certain
 purpose, and are contrary to the common principles of human nature,
 which accommodate themselves to circumstances, and have no stated
 invariable method of operation.
 
 Nor do I perceive how I can easily be mistaken in this matter. I see
 evidently, that when any man imposes on himself general inflexible
 rules in his conduct with others, he considers certain objects as
 their property, which he supposes to be sacred and inviolable. But
 no proposition can be more evident, than that property is perfectly
 unintelligible without first supposing justice and injustice; and that
 these virtues and vices are as unintelligible, unless we have motives,
 independent of the morality, to impel us to just actions, and deter us
 from unjust ones. Let those motives, therefore, be what they will, they
 must accommodate themselves to circumstances, and must admit of all the
 variations, which human affairs, in their incessant revolutions, are
 susceptible of. They are consequently a very improper foundation for
 such rigid inflexible rules as the laws of nature; and it is evident
 these laws can only be derived from human conventions, when men have
 perceived the disorders that result from following their natural and
 variable principles.
 
 Upon the whole, then, we are to consider this distinction betwixt
 justice and injustice, as having two different foundations, viz, that
 of interest, when men observe, that it is impossible to live in society
 without restraining themselves by certain rules; and that of morality,
 when this interest is once observed and men receive a pleasure from the
 view of such actions as tend to the peace of society, and an uneasiness
 from such as are contrary to it. It is the voluntary convention
 and artifice of men, which makes the first interest take place;
 and therefore those laws of justice are so far to be considered as
 artifrial. After that interest is once established and acknowledged, the
 sense of morality in the observance of these rules follows naturally,
 and of itself; though it is certain, that it is also augmented by a
 new artifice, and that the public instructions of politicians, and the
 private education of parents, contribute to the giving us a sense of
 honour and duty in the strict regulation of our actions with regard to
 the properties of others.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VII OF THE ORIGIN OF GOVERNMENT
 
 
 Nothing is more certain, than that men are, in a great measure, governed
 by interest, and that even when they extend their concern beyond
 themselves, it is not to any great distance; nor is it usual for
 them, in common life, to look farther than their nearest friends and
 acquaintance. It is no less certain, that it is impossible for men to
 consult, their interest in so effectual a manner, as by an universal and
 inflexible observance of the rules of justice, by which alone they can
 preserve society, and keep themselves from falling into that wretched
 and savage condition, which is commonly represented as the state of
 nature. And as this interest, which all men have in the upholding of
 society, and the observation of the rules of justice, is great, so is
 it palpable and evident, even to the most rude and uncultivated of human
 race; and it is almost impossible for any one, who has had experience of
 society, to be mistaken in this particular. Since, therefore, men are
 so sincerely attached to their interest, and their interest is so much
 concerned in the observance of justice, and this interest is so certain
 and avowed; it may be asked, how any disorder can ever arise in
 society, and what principle there is in human nature so powerful as to
 overcome so strong a passion, or so violent as to obscure so clear a
 knowledge?
 
 It has been observed, in treating of the passions, that men are mightily
 governed by the imagination, and proportion their affections more to
 the light, under which any object appears to them, than to its real and
 intrinsic value. What strikes upon them with a strong and lively idea
 commonly prevails above what lies in a more obscure light; and it
 must be a great superiority of value, that is able to compensate this
 advantage. Now as every thing, that is contiguous to us, either in space
 or time, strikes upon us with such an idea, it has a proportional effect
 on the will and passions, and commonly operates with more force than any
 object, that lies in a more distant and obscure light. Though we may be
 fully convinced, that the latter object excels the former, we are
 not able to regulate our actions by this judgment; but yield to the
 sollicitations of our passions, which always plead in favour of whatever
 is near and contiguous.
 
 This is the reason why men so often act in contradiction to their known
 interest; and in particular why they prefer any trivial advantage,
 that is present, to the maintenance of order in society, which so much
 depends on the observance of justice. The consequences of every breach
 of equity seem to lie very remote, and are not able to counter-ballance
 any immediate advantage, that may be reaped from it. They are, however,
 never the less real for being remote; and as all men are, in some
 degree, subject to the same weakness, it necessarily happens, that
 the violations of equity must become very frequent in society, and
 the commerce of men, by that means, be rendered very dangerous and
 uncertain. You have the same propension, that I have, in favour of
 what is contiguous above what is remote. You are, therefore, naturally
 carried to commit acts of injustice as well as me. Your example both
 pushes me forward in this way by imitation, and also affords me a new
 reason for any breach of equity, by shewing me, that I should be the
 cully of my integrity, if I alone should impose on myself a severe
 restraint amidst the licentiousness of others.
 
 This quality, therefore, of human nature, not only is very dangerous
 to society, but also seems, on a cursory view, to be incapable of any
 remedy. The remedy can only come from the consent of men; and if men be
 incapable of themselves to prefer remote to contiguous, they will never
 consent to any thing, which would oblige them to such a choice, and
 contradict, in so sensible a manner, their natural principles and
 propensities. Whoever chuses the means, chuses also the end; and if it
 be impossible for us to prefer what is remote, it is equally impossible
 for us to submit to any necessity, which would oblige us to such a
 method of acting.
 
 But here it is observable, that this infirmity of human nature becomes
 a remedy to itself, and that we provide against our negligence about
 remote objects, merely because we are naturally inclined to that
 negligence. When we consider any objects at a distance, all their minute
 distinctions vanish, and we always give the preference to whatever is in
 itself preferable, without considering its situation and circumstances.
 This gives rise to what in an improper sense we call reason, which is
 a principle, that is often contradictory to those propensities that
 display themselves upon the approach of the object. In reflecting on any
 action, which I am to perform a twelve-month hence, I always resolve to
 prefer the greater good, whether at that time it will be more contiguous
 or remote; nor does any difference in that particular make a difference
 in my present intentions and resolutions. My distance from the final
 determination makes all those minute differences vanish, nor am I
 affected by any thing, but the general and more discernible qualities of
 good and evil. But on my nearer approach, those circumstances, which
 I at first over-looked, begin to appear, and have an influence on my
 conduct and affections. A new inclination to the present good springs
 up, and makes it difficult for me to adhere inflexibly to my first
 purpose and resolution. This natural infirmity I may very much regret,
 and I may endeavour, by all possible means, to free my self from it. I
 may have recourse to study and reflection within myself; to the advice
 of friends; to frequent meditation, and repeated resolution: And having
 experienced how ineffectual all these are, I may embrace with pleasure
 any other expedient, by which I may impose a restraint upon myself, and
 guard against this weakness.
 
 The only difficulty, therefore, is to find out this expedient, by which
 men cure their natural weakness, and lay themselves under the necessity
 of observing the laws of justice and equity, notwithstanding their
 violent propension to prefer contiguous to remote. It is evident such a
 remedy can never be effectual without correcting this propensity; and as
 it is impossible to change or correct any thing material in our nature,
 the utmost we can do is to change our circumstances and situation, and
 render the observance of the laws of justice our nearest interest,
 and their violation our most remote. But this being impracticable with
 respect to all mankind, it can only take place with respect to a few,
 whom we thus immediately interest in the execution of justice. There are
 the persons, whom we call civil magistrates, kings and their ministers,
 our governors and rulers, who being indifferent persons to the greatest
 part of the state, have no interest, or but a remote one, in any act of
 injustice; and being satisfied with their present condition, and with
 their part in society, have an immediate interest in every execution of
 justice, which is so necessary to the upholding of society. Here then is
 the origin of civil government and society. Men are not able radically
 to cure, either in themselves or others, that narrowness of soul, which
 makes them prefer the present to the remote. They cannot change their
 natures. All they can do is to change their situation, and render the
 observance of justice the immediate interest of some particular persons,
 and its violation their more remote. These persons, then, are not
 only induced to observe those rules in their own conduct, but also
 to constrain others to a like regularity, and inforce the dictates of
 equity through the whole society. And if it be necessary, they may also
 interest others more immediately in the execution of justice, and
 create a number of officers, civil and military, to assist them in their
 government.
 
 But this execution of justice, though the principal, is not the only
 advantage of government. As violent passion hinder men from seeing
 distinctly the interest they have in an equitable behaviour towards
 others; so it hinders them from seeing that equity itself, and gives
 them a remarkable partiality in their own favours. This inconvenience is
 corrected in the same manner as that above-mentioned. The same persons,
 who execute the laws of justice, will also decide all controversies
 concerning them; and being indifferent to the greatest part of the
 society, will decide them more equitably than every one would in his own
 case.
 
 By means of these two advantages, in the execution and decision of
 justice, men acquire a security against each others weakness and
 passion, as well as against their own, and under the shelter of their
 governors, begin to taste at ease the sweets of society and mutual
 assistance. But government extends farther its beneficial influence; and
 not contented to protect men in those conventions they make for their
 mutual interest, it often obliges them to make such conventions, and
 forces them to seek their own advantage, by a concurrence in some common
 end or purpose. There is no quality in human nature, which causes more
 fatal errors in our conduct, than that which leads us to prefer whatever
 is present to the distant and remote, and makes us desire objects more
 according to their situation than their intrinsic value. Two neighbours
 may agree to drain a meadow, which they possess in common; because it is
 easy for them to know each others mind; and each must perceive, that the
 immediate consequence of his failing in his part, is, the abandoning the
 whole project. But it is very difficult, and indeed impossible, that a
 thousand persons should agree in any such action; it being difficult for
 them to concert so complicated a design, and still more difficult for
 them to execute it; while each seeks a pretext to free himself of the
 trouble and expence, and would lay the whole burden on others. Political
 society easily remedies both these inconveniences. Magistrates find an
 immediate interest in the interest of any considerable part of their
 subjects. They need consult no body but themselves to form any scheme
 for the promoting of that interest. And as the failure of any one piece
 in the execution is connected, though not immediately, with the failure
 of the whole, they prevent that failure, because they find no interest
 in it, either immediate or remote. Thus bridges are built; harbours
 opened; ramparts raised; canals formed; fleets equiped; and armies
 disciplined every where, by the care of government, which, though
 composed of men subject to all human infirmities, becomes, by one of the
 finest and most subtle inventions imaginable, a composition, which is,
 in some measure, exempted from all these infirmities.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VIII OF THE SOURCE OF ALLEGIANCE
 
 
 Though government be an invention very advantageous, and even in some
 circumstances absolutely necessary to mankind; it is not necessary in
 all circumstances, nor is it impossible for men to preserve society
 for some time, without having recourse to such an invention. Men, it is
 true, are always much inclined to prefer present interest to distant
 and remote; nor is it easy for them to resist the temptation of any
 advantage, that they may immediately enjoy, in apprehension of an evil
 that lies at a distance from them: But still this weakness is less
 conspicuous where the possessions, and the pleasures of life are few,
 and of little value, as they always are in the infancy of society. An
 Indian is but little tempted to dispossess another of his hut, or to
 steal his bow, as being already provided of the same advantages; and as
 to any superior fortune, which may attend one above another in hunting
 and fishing, it is only casual and temporary, and will have but small
 tendency to disturb society. And so far am I from thinking with
 some philosophers, that men are utterly incapable of society without
 government, that I assert the first rudiments of government to arise
 from quarrels, not among men of the same society, but among those of
 different societies. A less degree of riches will suffice to this latter
 effect, than is requisite for the former. Men fear nothing from public
 war and violence but the resistance they meet with, which, because
 they share it in common, seems less terrible; and because it comes from
 strangers, seems less pernicious in its consequences, than when they are
 exposed singly against one whose commerce is advantageous to them, and
 without whose society it is impossible they can subsist. Now foreign war
 to a society without government necessarily produces civil war. Throw
 any considerable goods among men, they instantly fall a quarrelling,
 while each strives to get possession of what pleases him, without regard
 to the consequences. In a foreign war the most considerable of all
 goods, life and limbs, are at stake; and as every one shuns dangerous
 ports, seizes the best arms, seeks excuse for the slightest wounds, the
 laws, which may be well enough observed while men were calm, can now no
 longer take place, when they are in such commotion.
 
 This we find verified in the American tribes, where men live in concord
 and amity among themselves without any established government and never
 pay submission to any of their fellows, except in time of war, when
 their captain enjoys a shadow of authority, which he loses after
 their return from the field, and the establishment of peace with the
 neighbouring tribes. This authority, however, instructs them in the
 advantages of government, and teaches them to have recourse to it,
 when either by the pillage of war, by commerce, or by any fortuitous
 inventions, their riches and possessions have become so considerable as
 to make them forget, on every emergence, the interest they have in the
 preservation of peace and justice. Hence we may give a plausible reason,
 among others, why all governments are at first monarchical, without any
 mixture and variety; and why republics arise only from the abuses of
 monarchy and despotic power. Camps are the true mothers of cities; and
 as war cannot be administered, by reason of the suddenness of every
 exigency, without some authority in a single person, the same kind of
 authority naturally takes place in that civil government, which succeeds
 the military. And this reason I take to be more natural, than the common
 one derived from patriarchal government, or the authority of a father,
 which is said first to take place in one family, and to accustom the
 members of it to the government of a single person. The state of society
 without government is one of the most natural states of men, and must
 submit with the conjunction of many families, and long after the first
 generation. Nothing but an encrease of riches and possessions coued
 oblige men to quit it; and so barbarous and uninstructed are all
 societies on their first formation, that many years must elapse before
 these can encrease to such a degree, as to disturb men in the enjoyment
 of peace and concord. But though it be possible for men to maintain a
 small uncultivated society without government, it is impossible
 they should maintain a society of any kind without justice, and the
 observance of those three fundamental laws concerning the stability of
 possession, its translation by consent, and the performance of promises.
 These are, therefore, antecedent to government, and are supposed to
 impose an obligation before the duty of allegiance to civil magistrates
 has once been thought of. Nay, I shall go farther, and assert, that
 government, upon its first establishment, would naturally be supposed.
 to derive its obligation from those laws of nature, and, in particular,
 from that concerning the performance of promises. When men have once
 perceived the necessity of government to maintain peace, and
 execute justice, they would naturally assemble together, would chuse
 magistrates, determine power, and promise them obedience. As a promise
 is supposed to be a bond or security already in use, and attended with
 a moral obligation, it is to be considered as the original sanction of
 government, and as the source of the first obligation to obedience. This
 reasoning appears so natural, that it has become the foundation of our
 fashionable system of politics, and is in a manner the creed of a party
 amongst us, who pride themselves, with reason, on the soundness of their
 philosophy, and their liberty of thought. All men, say they, are born
 free and equal: Government and superiority can only be established by
 consent: The consent of men, in establishing government, imposes on them
 a new obligation, unknown to the laws of nature. Men, therefore, are
 bound to obey their magistrates, only because they promise it; and if
 they had not given their word, either expressly or tacitly, to preserve
 allegiance, it would never have become a part of their moral duty. This
 conclusion, however, when carried so far as to comprehend government in
 all its ages and situations, is entirely erroneous; and I maintain, that
 though the duty of allegiance be at first grafted on the obligation
 of promises, and be for some time supported by that obligation, yet
 it quickly takes root of itself, and has an original obligation and
 authority, independent of all contracts. This is a principle of moment,
 which we must examine with care and attention, before we proceed any
 farther.
 
 It is reasonable for those philosophers, who assert justice to be a
 natural virtue, and antecedent to human conventions, to resolve all
 civil allegiance into the obligation of a promise, and assert that it is
 our own consent alone, which binds us to any submission to magistracy.
 For as all government is plainly an invention of men, and the origin of
 most governments is known in history, it is necessary to mount higher,
 in order to find the source of our political duties, if we would assert
 them to have any natural obligation of morality. These philosophers,
 therefore, quickly observe, that society is as antient as the human
 species, and those three fundamental laws of nature as antient as
 society: So that taking advantage of the antiquity, and obscure origin
 of these laws, they first deny them to be artificial and voluntary
 inventions of men, and then seek to ingraft on them those other duties,
 which are more plainly artificial. But being once undeceived in this
 particular, and having found that natural, as well as civil justice,
 derives its origin from human conventions, we shall quickly perceive,
 how fruitless it is to resolve the one into the other, and seek, in
 the laws of nature, a stronger foundation for our political duties than
 interest, and human conventions; while these laws themselves are built
 on the very same foundation. On which ever side we turn this subject,
 we shall find, that these two kinds of duty are exactly on the same
 footing, and have the same source both of their first invention and
 moral obligation. They are contrived to remedy like inconveniences, and
 acquire their moral sanction in the same manner, from their remedying
 those inconveniences. These are two points, which we shall endeavour to
 prove as distinctly as possible.
 
 We have already shewn, that men invented the three fundamental laws
 of nature, when they observed the necessity of society to their
 mutual subsistance, and found, that it was impossible to maintain
 any correspondence together, without some restraint on their natural
 appetites. The same self-love, therefore, which renders men so
 incommodious to each other, taking a new and more convenient direction,
 produces the rules of justice, and is the first motive of their
 observance. But when men have observed, that though the rules of justice
 be sufficient to maintain any society, yet it is impossible for them,
 of themselves, to observe those rules, in large and polished societies;
 they establish government, as a new invention to attain their ends, and
 preserve the old, or procure new advantages, by a more strict execution
 of justice. So far, therefore, our civil duties are connected with
 our natural, that the former are invented chiefly for the sake of the
 latter; and that the principal object of government is to constrain men
 to observe the laws of nature. In this respect, however, that law of
 nature, concerning the performance of promises, is only comprized along
 with the rest; and its exact observance is to be considered as an effect
 of the institution of government, and not the obedience to government as
 an effect of the obligation of a promise. Though the object of our civil
 duties be the enforcing of our natural, yet the first [First in
 time, not in dignity or force.] motive of the invention, as well as
 performance of both, is nothing but self-interest: and since there is
 a separate interest in the obedience to government, from that in the
 performance of promises, we must also allow of a separate obligation. To
 obey the civil magistrate is requisite to preserve order and concord
 in society. To perform promises is requisite to beget mutual trust
 and confidence in the common offices of life. The ends, as well as the
 means, are perfectly distinct; nor is the one subordinate to the other.
 
 To make this more evident, let us consider, that men will often bind
 themselves by promises to the performance of what it would have been
 their interest to perform, independent of these promises; as when they
 would give others a fuller security, by super-adding a new obligation
 of interest to that which they formerly lay under. The interest in
 the performance of promises, besides its moral obligation, is general,
 avowed, and of the last consequence in life. Other interests may be
 more particular and doubtful; and we are apt to entertain a greater
 suspicion, that men may indulge their humour, or passion, in acting
 contrary to them. Here, therefore, promises come naturally in play, and
 are often required for fuller satisfaction and security. But supposing
 those other interests to be as general and avowed as the interest in the
 performance of a promise, they will be regarded as on the same footing,
 and men will begin to repose the same confidence in them. Now this is
 exactly the case with regard to our civil duties, or obedience to the
 magistrate; without which no government coued subsist, nor any peace
 or order be maintained in large societies, where there are so many
 possessions on the one hand, and so many wants, real or imaginary, on
 the other. Our civil duties, therefore, must soon detach themselves from
 our promises, and acquire a separate force and influence. The interest
 in both is of the very same kind: It is general, avowed, and prevails in
 all times and places. There is, then, no pretext of reason for founding
 the one upon the other; while each of them has a foundation peculiar
 to itself. We might as well resolve the obligation to abstain from the
 possessions of others, into the obligation of a promise, as that of
 allegiance. The interests are not more distinct in the one case than the
 other. A regard to property is not more necessary to natural society,
 than obedience is to civil society or government; nor is the former
 society more necessary to the being of mankind, than the latter to their
 well-being and happiness. In short, if the performance of promises be
 advantageous, so is obedience to government: If the former interest be
 general, so is the latter: If the one interest be obvious and avowed, so
 is the other. And as these two rules are founded on like obligations of
 interest, each of them must have a peculiar authority, independent of
 the other.
 
 But it is not only the natural obligations of interest, which are
 distinct in promises and allegiance; but also the moral obligations of
 honour and conscience: Nor does the merit or demerit of the one depend
 in the least upon that of the other. And indeed, if we consider the
 close connexion there is betwixt the natural and moral obligations, we
 shall find this conclusion to be entirely unavoidable. Our interest
 is always engaged on the side of obedience to magistracy; and there is
 nothing but a great present advantage, that can lead us to rebellion, by
 making us over-look the remote interest, which we have in the preserving
 of peace and order in society. But though a present interest may thus
 blind us with regard to our own actions, it takes not place with regard
 to those of others; nor hinders them from appearing in their true
 colours, as highly prejudicial to public interest, and to our own in
 particular. This naturally gives us an uneasiness, in considering such
 seditious and disloyal actions, and makes us attach to them the idea of
 vice and moral deformity. It is the same principle, which causes us to
 disapprove of all kinds of private injustice, and in particular of the
 breach of promises. We blame all treachery and breach of faith; because
 we consider, that the freedom and extent of human commerce depend
 entirely on a fidelity with regard to promises. We blame all disloyalty
 to magistrates; because we perceive, that the execution of justice,
 in the stability of possession, its translation by consent, and
 the performance of promises, is impossible, without submission to
 government. As there are here two interests entirely distinct from each
 other, they must give rise to two moral obligations, equally separate
 and independent. Though there was no such thing as a promise in the
 world, government would still be necessary in all large and civilized
 societies; and if promises had only their own proper obligation, without
 the separate sanction of government, they would have but little efficacy
 in such societies. This separates the boundaries of our public and
 private duties, and shews that the latter are more dependant on the
 former, than the former on the latter. Education, and the artifice of
 politicians, concur to bestow a farther morality on loyalty, and to
 brand all rebellion with a greater degree of guilt and infamy. Nor is
 it a wonder, that politicians should be very industrious in inculcating
 such notions, where their interest is so particularly concerned.
 
 Lest those arguments should not appear entirely conclusive (as I think
 they are) I shall have recourse to authority, and shall prove, from
 the universal consent of mankind, that the obligation of submission to
 government is not derived from any promise of the subjects. Nor need
 any one wonder, that though I have all along endeavoured to establish my
 system on pure reason, and have scarce ever cited the judgment even
 of philosophers or historians on any article, I should now appeal
 to popular authority, and oppose the sentiments of the rabble to any
 philosophical reasoning. For it must be observed, that the opinions of
 men, in this case, carry with them a peculiar authority, and are, in
 a great measure, infallible. The distinction of moral good and evil
 is founded on the pleasure or pain, which results from the view of any
 sentiment, or character; and as that pleasure or pain cannot be unknown
 to the person who feels it, it follows [Footnote 22], that there is just
 so much vice or virtue in any character, as every one places in it, and
 that it is impossible in this particular we can ever be mistaken. And
 though our judgments concerning the origin of any vice or virtue, be not
 so certain as those concerning their degrees; yet, since the question in
 this case regards not any philosophical origin of an obligation, but a
 plain matter of fact, it is not easily conceived how we can fall into
 an error. A man, who acknowledges himself to be bound to another, for a
 certain sum, must certainly know whether it be by his own bond, or that
 of his father; whether it be of his mere good-will, or for money lent
 him; and under what conditions, and for what purposes he has bound
 himself. In like manner, it being certain, that there is a moral
 obligation to submit to government, because every one thinks so; it must
 be as certain, that this obligation arises not from a promise; since no
 one, whose judgment has not been led astray by too strict adherence to
 a system of philosophy, has ever yet dreamt of ascribing it to that
 origin. Neither magistrates nor subjects have formed this idea of our
 civil duties.
 
 
      [Footnote 22  This proposition must hold strictly true, with
      regard to every quality, that is determin'd merely by
      sentiment. In what sense we can talk either of a right or a
      wrong taste in morals, eloquence, or beauty, shall be
      considerd afterwards. In the mean time, it may be observ'd,
      that there is such an uniformity in the GENERAL sentiments
      of mankind, as to render such questions of but small
      importance.]
 
 We find, that magistrates are so far from deriving their authority, and
 the obligation to obedience in their subjects, from the foundation of
 a promise or original contract, that they conceal, as far as possible,
 from their people, especially from the vulgar, that they have their
 origin from thence. Were this the sanction of government, our rulers
 would never receive it tacitly, which is the utmost that can be
 pretended; since what is given tacitly and insensibly can never have
 such influence on mankind, as what is performed expressly and openly.
 A tacit promise is, where the will is signified by other more diffuse
 signs than those of speech; but a will there must certainly be in the
 case, and that can never escape the person's notice, who exerted it,
 however silent or tacit. But were you to ask the far greatest part of
 the nation, whether they had ever consented to the authority of their
 rulers, or promised to obey them, they would be inclined to think very
 strangely of you; and would certainly reply, that the affair depended
 not on their consent, but that they were born to such an obedience. In
 consequence of this opinion, we frequently see them imagine such persons
 to be their natural rulers, as are at that time deprived of all power
 and authority, and whom no man, however foolish, would voluntarily
 chuse; and this merely because they are in that line, which ruled
 before, and in that degree of it, which used to succeed; though perhaps
 in so distant a period, that scarce any man alive coued ever have given
 any promise of obedience. Has a government, then, no authority over such
 as these, because they never consented to it, and would esteem the very
 attempt of such a free choice a piece of arrogance and impiety? We
 find by experience, that it punishes them very freely for what it
 calls treason and rebellion, which, it seems, according to this system,
 reduces itself to common injustice. If you say, that by dwelling in its
 dominions, they in effect consented to the established government; I
 answer, that this can only be, where they think the affair depends on
 their choice, which few or none, beside those philosophers, have ever
 yet imagined. It never was pleaded as an excuse for a rebel, that the
 first act he perform d, after he came to years of discretion, was to
 levy war against the sovereign of the state; and that while he was a
 child he coued not bind himself by his own consent, and having become
 a man, showed plainly, by the first act he performed, that he had no
 design to impose on himself any obligation to obedience. We find, on
 the contrary, that civil laws punish this crime at the same age as any
 other, which is criminal, of itself, without our consent; that is, when
 the person is come to the full use of reason: Whereas to this crime
 they ought in justice to allow some intermediate time, in which a tacit
 consent at least might be supposed. To which we may add, that a man
 living under an absolute government, would owe it no allegiance; since,
 by its very nature, it depends not on consent. But as that is as
 natural and common a government as any, it must certainly occasion some
 obligation; and it is plain from experience, that men, who are subjected
 to it, do always think so. This is a clear proof, that we do not
 commonly esteem our allegiance to be derived from our consent or
 promise; and a farther proof is, that when our promise is upon any
 account expressly engaged, we always distinguish exactly betwixt the two
 obligations, and believe the one to add more force to the other, than in
 a repetition of the same promise. Where no promise is given, a man
 looks not on his faith as broken in private matters, upon account of
 rebellion; but keeps those two duties of honour and allegiance perfectly
 distinct and separate. As the uniting of them was thought by these
 philosophers a very subtile invention, this is a convincing proof, that
 it is not a true one; since no man can either give a promise, or be
 restrained by its sanction and obligation unknown to himself.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. IX OF THE MEASURES OF ALLEGIANCE
 
 
 Those political writers, who have had recourse to a promise, or original
 contract, as the source of our allegiance to government, intended to
 establish a principle, which is perfectly just and reasonable; though
 the reasoning, upon which they endeavoured to establish it, was
 fallacious and sophistical. They would prove, that our submission to
 government admits of exceptions, and that an egregious tyranny in the
 rulers is sufficient to free the subjects from all ties of allegiance.
 Since men enter into society, say they, and submit themselves to
 government, by their free and voluntary consent, they must have in view
 certain advantages, which they propose to reap from it, and for which
 they are contented to resign their native liberty. There is, therefore,
 something mutual engaged on the part of the magistrate, viz, protection
 and security; and it is only by the hopes he affords of these
 advantages, that he can ever persuade men to submit to him. But
 when instead of protection and security, they meet with tyranny and
 oppression, they are freeed from their promises, (as happens in all
 conditional contracts) and return to that state of liberty, which
 preceded the institution of government. Men would never be so foolish as
 to enter into such engagements as should turn entirely to the advantage
 of others, without any view of bettering their own condition. Whoever
 proposes to draw any profit from our submission, must engage himself,
 either expressly or tacitly, to make us reap some advantage from his
 authority; nor ought he to expect, that without the performance of his
 part we will ever continue in obedience.
 
 I repeat it: This conclusion is just, though the principles be
 erroneous; and I flatter myself, that I can establish the same
 conclusion on more reasonable principles. I shall not take such a
 compass, in establishing our political duties, as to assert, that men
 perceive the advantages of government; that they institute government
 with a view to those advantages; that this institution requires a
 promise of obedience; which imposes a moral obligation to a certain
 degree, but being conditional, ceases to be binding, whenever the other
 contracting party performs not his part of the engagement. I perceive,
 that a promise itself arises entirely from human conventions, and is
 invented with a view to a certain interest. I seek, therefore, some such
 interest more immediately connected with government, and which may be
 at once the original motive to its institution, and the source of our
 obedience to it. This interest I find to consist in the security and
 protection, which we enjoy in political society, and which we can never
 attain, when perfectly free and independent. As interest, therefore, is
 the immediate sanction of government, the one can have no longer being
 than the other; and whenever the civil magistrate carries his oppression
 so far as to render his authority perfectly intolerable, we are no
 longer bound to submit to it. The cause ceases; the effect must cease
 also.
 
 So far the conclusion is immediate and direct, concerning the natural
 obligation which we have to allegiance. As to the moral obligation, we
 may observe, that the maxim would here be false, that when the cause
 ceases, the effect must cease also. For there is a principle of human
 nature, which we have frequently taken notice of, that men are mightily
 addicted to general rules, and that we often carry our maxims beyond
 those reasons, which first induced us to establish them. Where cases
 are similar in many circumstances, we are apt to put them on the same
 footing, without considering, that they differ in the most material
 circumstances, and that the resemblance is more apparent than real. It
 may, therefore, be thought, that in the case of allegiance our moral
 obligation of duty will not cease, even though the natural obligation of
 interest, which is its cause, has ceased; and that men may be bound by
 conscience to submit to a tyrannical government against their own and
 the public interest. And indeed, to the force of this argument I so far
 submit, as to acknowledge, that general rules commonly extend beyond
 the principles, on which they are founded; and that we seldom make any
 exception to them, unless that exception have the qualities of a general
 rule, and be founded on very numerous and common instances. Now this I
 assert to be entirely the present case. When men submit to the authority
 of others, it is to procure themselves some security against the
 wickedness and injustice of men, who are perpetually carried, by their
 unruly passions, and by their present and immediate interest, to the
 violation of all the laws of society. But as this imperfection is
 inherent in human nature, we know that it must attend men in all their
 states and conditions; and that these, whom we chuse for rulers, do not
 immediately become of a superior nature to the rest of mankind, upon
 account of their superior power and authority. What we expect from them
 depends not on a change of their nature but of their situation, when
 they acquire a more immediate interest in the preservation of order and
 the execution of justice. But besides that this interest is only more
 immediate in the execution of justice among their subjects; besides
 this, I say, we may often expect, from the irregularity of human nature,
 that they will neglect even this immediate interest, and be transported
 by their passions into all the excesses of cruelty and ambition.. Our
 general knowledge of human nature, our observation of the past history
 of mankind, our experience of present times; all these causes must
 induce us to open the door to exceptions, and must make us conclude,
 that we may resist the more violent effects of supreme power, without
 any crime or injustice.
 
 Accordingly we may observe, that this is both the general practice and
 principle of mankind, and that no nation, that coued find any remedy,
 ever yet suffered the cruel ravages of a tyrant, or were blamed for
 their resistance. Those who took up arms against Dionysius or Nero, or
 Philip the second, have the favour of every reader in the perusal of
 their history: and nothing but the most violent perversion of common
 sense can ever lead us to condemn them. It is certain, therefore, that
 in all our notions of morals we never entertain such an absurdity as
 that of passive obedience, but make allowances for resistance in the
 more flagrant instances of tyranny and oppression. The general opinion
 of mankind has some authority in all cases; but in this of morals it
 is perfectly infallible. Nor is it less infallible, because men cannot
 distinctly explain the principles, on which it is founded. Few persons
 can carry on this train of reasoning:
 
 Government is a mere human invention for the interest of society. Where
 the tyranny of the governor removes this interest, it also removes the
 natural obligation to obedience. The moral obligation is founded on the
 natural, and therefore must cease where that ceases; especially where
 the subject is such as makes us foresee very many occasions wherein the
 natural obligation may cease, and causes us to form a kind of general
 rule for the regulation of our conduct in such occurrences.
 
 But though this train of reasoning be too subtile for the vulgar, it is
 certain, that all men have an implicit notion of it, and are sensible,
 that they owe obedience to government merely on account of the public
 interest; and at the same time, that human nature is so subject to
 frailties and passions, as may easily pervert this institution, and
 change their governors into tyrants and public enemies. If the sense of
 common interest were not our original motive to obedience, I would fain
 ask, what other principle is there in human nature capable of subduing
 the natural ambition of men, and forcing them to such a submission?
 Imitation and custom are not sufficient. For the question still recurs,
 what motive first produces those instances of submission, which we
 imitate, and that train of actions, which produces the custom? There
 evidently is no other principle than public interest; and if interest
 first produces obedience to government, the obligation to obedience
 must cease, whenever the interest ceases, in any great degree, and in a
 considerable number of instances.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. X OF THE OBJECTS OF ALLEGIANCE
 
 
 But though, on some occasions, it may be justifiable, both in sound
 politics and morality, to resist supreme power, it is certain, that in
 the ordinary course of human affairs nothing can be more pernicious
 and criminal; and that besides the convulsions, which always attend
 revolutions, such a practice tends directly to the subversion of all
 government, and the causing an universal anarchy and confusion among
 mankind. As numerous and civilized societies cannot subsist without
 government, so government is entirely useless without an exact
 obedience. We ought always to weigh the advantages, which we reap from
 authority, against the disadvantages; and by this means we shall become
 more scrupulous of putting in practice the doctrine of resistance. The
 common rule requires submission; and it is only in cases of grievous
 tyranny and oppression, that the exception can take place.
 
 Since then such a blind submission is commonly due to magistracy, the
 next question is, to whom it is due, and whom we are to regard as our
 lawful magistrates? In order to answer this question, let us recollect
 what we have already established concerning the origin of government and
 political society. When men have once experienced the impossibility
 of preserving any steady order in society, while every one is his own
 master, and violates or observes the laws of society, according to his
 present interest or pleasure, they naturally run into the invention of
 government, and put it out of their own power, as far as possible, to
 transgress the laws of society. Government, therefore, arises from the
 same voluntary conversation of men; and it is evident, that the same
 convention, which establishes government, will also determine the
 persons who are to govern, and will remove all doubt and ambiguity in
 this particular. And the voluntary consent of men must here have the
 greater efficacy, that the authority of the magistrate does at first
 stand upon the foundation of a promise of the subjects, by which they
 bind themselves to obedience; as in every other contract or engagement.
 The same promise, then, which binds them to obedience, ties them down to
 a particular person, and makes him the object of their allegiance.
 
 But when government has been established on this footing for some
 considerable time, and the separate interest, which we have in
 submission, has produced a separate sentiment of morality, the case
 is entirely altered, and a promise is no longer able to determine the
 particular magistrate since it is no longer considered as the foundation
 of government. We naturally suppose ourselves born to submission; and
 imagine, that such particular persons have a right to command, as we on
 our part are bound to obey. These notions of right and obligation are
 derived from nothing but the advantage we reap from government, which
 gives us a repugnance to practise resistance ourselves, and makes us
 displeased with any instance of it in others. But here it is remarkable,
 that in this new state of affairs, the original sanction of government,
 which is interest, is not admitted to determine the persons, whom we are
 to obey, as the original sanction did at first, when affairs were on
 the footing of a promise. A promise fixes and determines the persons,
 without any uncertainty: But it is evident, that if men were to regulate
 their conduct in this particular, by the view of a peculiar interest,
 either public or private, they would involve themselves in endless
 confusion, and would render all government, in a great measure,
 ineffectual. The private interest of every one is different; and though
 the public interest in itself be always one and the same, yet it becomes
 the source of as great dissentions, by reason of the different opinions
 of particular persons concerning it. The same interest, therefore,
 which causes us to submit to magistracy, makes us renounce itself in
 the choice of our magistrates, and binds us down to a certain form of
 government, and to particular persons, without allowing us to aspire to
 the utmost perfection in either. The case is here the same as in that
 law of nature concerning the stability of possession. It is highly
 advantageous, and even absolutely necessary to society, that possession
 should be stable; and this leads us to the establishment of such a rule:
 But we find, that were we to follow the same advantage, in assigning
 particular possessions to particular persons, we should disappoint
 our end, and perpetuate the confusion, which that rule is intended to
 prevent. We must, therefore, proceed by general rules, and regulate
 ourselves by general interests, in modifying the law of nature
 concerning the stability of possession. Nor need we fear, that our
 attachment to this law will diminish upon account of the seeming
 frivolousness of those interests, by which it is determined. The impulse
 of the mind is derived from a very strong interest; and those other more
 minute interests serve only to direct the motion, without adding
 any thing to it, or diminishing from it. It is the same case with
 government. Nothing is more advantageous to society than such an
 invention; and this interest is sufficient to make us embrace it with
 ardour and alacrity; though we are obliged afterwards to regulate and
 direct our devotion to government by several considerations, which are
 not of the same importance, and to chuse our magistrates without having
 in view any particular advantage from the choice.
 
 The first of those principles I shall take notice of, as a foundation of
 the right of magistracy, is that which gives authority to all the most
 established governments of the world without exception: I mean, long
 possession in any one form of government, or succession of princes. It
 is certain, that if we remount to the first origin of every nation,
 we shall find, that there scarce is any race of kings, or form of a
 commonwealth, that is not primarily founded on usurpation and rebellion,
 and whose title is not at first worse than doubtful and uncertain. Time
 alone gives solidity to their right; and operating gradually on the
 minds of men, reconciles them to any authority, and makes it seem just
 and reasonable. Nothing causes any sentiment to have a greater influence
 upon us than custom, or turns our imagination more strongly to any
 object. When we have been long accustomed to obey any set of men,
 that general instinct or tendency, which we have to suppose a moral
 obligation attending loyalty, takes easily this direction, and chuses
 that set of men for its objects. It is interest which gives the general
 instinct; but it is custom which gives the particular direction.
 
 And here it is observable, that the same length of time has a different
 influence on our sentiments of morality, according to its different
 influence on the mind. We naturally judge of every thing by comparison;
 and since in considering the fate of kingdoms and republics, we embrace
 a long extent of time, a small duration has not in this case a like
 influence on our sentiments, as when we consider any other object. One
 thinks he acquires a right to a horse, or a suit of cloaths, in a very
 short time; but a century is scarce sufficient to establish any
 new government, or remove all scruples in the minds of the subjects
 concerning it. Add to this, that a shorter period of time will suffice
 to give a prince a title to any additional power he may usurp, than will
 serve to fix his right, where the whole is an usurpation. The kings of
 France have not been possessed of absolute power for above two reigns;
 and yet nothing will appear more extravagant to Frenchmen than to
 talk of their liberties. If we consider what has been said concerning
 accession, we shall easily account for this phaenomenon.
 
 When there is no form of government established by long possession,
 the present possession is sufficient to supply its place, and may
 be regarded as the second source of all public authority. Right
 to authority is nothing but the constant possession of authority,
 maintained by the laws of society and the interests of mankind; and
 nothing can be more natural than to join this constant possession to the
 present one, according to the principles above-mentioned. If the same
 principles did not take place with regard to the property of private
 persons, it was because these principles were counter-ballanced by
 very strong considerations of interest; when we observed, that all
 restitution would by that means be prevented, and every violence be
 authorized and protected. And though the same motives may seem to
 have force, with regard to public authority, yet they are opposed by a
 contrary interest; which consists in the preservation of peace, and the
 avoiding of all changes, which, however they may be easily produced in
 private affairs, are unavoidably attended with bloodshed and confusion,
 where the public is interested.
 
 Any one, who finding the impossibility of accounting for the right of
 the present possessor, by any received system of ethics, should resolve
 to deny absolutely that right, and assert, that it is not authorized
 by morality, would be justly thought to maintain a very extravagant
 paradox, and to shock the common sense and judgment of mankind. No maxim
 is more conformable, both to prudence and morals, than to submit quietly
 to the government, which we find established in the country where we
 happen to live, without enquiring too curiously into its origin and
 first establishment. Few governments will bear being examined so
 rigorously. How many kingdoms are there at present in the world, and
 how many more do we find in history, whose governors have no better
 foundation for their authority than that of present possession? To
 confine ourselves to the Roman and Grecian empire; is it not evident,
 that the long succession of emperors, from the dissolution of the Roman
 liberty, to the final extinction of that empire by the Turks, coued not
 so much as pretend to any other title to the empire? The election of the
 senate was a mere form, which always followed the choice of the legions;
 and these were almost always divided in the different provinces, and
 nothing but the sword was able to terminate the difference. It was by
 the sword, therefore, that every emperor acquired, as well as defended
 his right; and we must either say, that all the known world, for so
 many ages, had no government, and owed no allegiance to any one, or
 must allow, that the right of the stronger, in public affairs, is to be
 received as legitimate, and authorized by morality, when not opposed by
 any other title.
 
 The right of conquest may be considered as a third source of the
 title of sovereigns. This right resembles very much that of present
 possession; but has rather a superior force, being seconded by the
 notions of glory and honour, which we ascribe to conquerors, instead
 of the sentiments of hatred and detestation, which attend usurpers. Men
 naturally favour those they love; and therefore are more apt to ascribe
 a right to successful violence, betwixt one sovereign and another, than
 to the successful rebellion of a subject against his sovereign.
 
 
      [Footnote 23  It is not here asserted, that present
      possession or conquest are sufficient to give a title
      against long possession and positive laws but only that they
      have some force, and will be able to call the ballance where
      the titles are otherwise equal, and will even be sufficient
      sometimes to sanctify the weaker title. What degree of force
      they have is difficult to determine. I believe all moderate
      men will allow, that they have great force in all disputes
      concerning the rights of princes.]
 
 When neither long possession, nor present possession, nor conquest take
 place, as when the first sovereign, who founded any monarchy, dies; in
 that case, the right of succession naturally prevails in their stead,
 and men are commonly induced to place the son of their late monarch
 on the throne, and suppose him to inherit his father's authority. The
 presumed consent of the father, the imitation of the succession to
 private families, the interest, which the state has in chusing the
 person, who is most powerful, and has the most numerous followers; all
 these reasons lead men to prefer the son of their late monarch to any
 other person.
 
 
      [Footnote 24  To prevent mistakes I must observe, that this
      case of succession is not the same with that of hereditary
      monarchies, where custom has fix'd the right of succession.
      These depend upon the principle of long possession above
      explain'd.]
 
 These reasons have some weight; but I am persuaded, that to one, who
 considers impartially of the matter, it will appear, that there concur
 some principles of the imagination, along with those views of interest.
 The royal authority seems to be connected with the young prince even in
 his father's life-time, by the natural transition of the thought; and
 still more after his death: So that nothing is more natural than to
 compleat this union by a new relation, and by putting him actually in
 possession of what seems so naturally to belong to him.
 
 To confirm this we may weigh the following phaenomena, which are pretty
 curious in their kind. In elective monarchies the right of succession
 has no place by the laws and settled custom; and yet its influence is
 so natural, that it is impossible entirely to exclude it from the
 imagination, and render the subjects indifferent to the son of their
 deceased monarch. Hence in some governments of this kind, the choice
 commonly falls on one or other of the royal family; and in some
 governments they are all excluded. Those contrary phaenomena proceed
 from the same principle. Where the royal family is excluded, it is
 from a refinement in politics, which makes people sensible of their
 propensity to chuse a sovereign in that family, and gives them a
 jealousy of their liberty, lest their new monarch, aided by this
 propensity, should establish his family, and destroy the freedom of
 elections for the future.
 
 The history of Artaxerxes, and the younger Cyrus, may furnish us with
 some reflections to the same purpose. Cyrus pretended a right to the
 throne above his elder brother, because he was born after his father's
 accession. I do not pretend, that this reason was valid. I would only
 infer from it, that he would never have made use of such a pretext, were
 it not for the qualities of the imagination above-mentioned, by which
 we are naturally inclined to unite by a new relation whatever objects we
 find already united. Artaxerxes had an advantage above his brother, as
 being the eldest son, and the first in succession: But Cyrus was more
 closely related to the royal authority, as being begot after his father
 was invested with it.
 
 Should it here be pretended, that the view of convenience may be
 the source of all the right of succession, and that men gladly take
 advantage of any rule, by which they can fix the successor of their late
 sovereign, and prevent that anarchy and confusion, which attends all
 new elections? To this I would answer, that I readily allow, that this
 motive may contribute something to the effect; but at the same time I
 assert, that without another principle, it is impossible such a
 motive should take place. The interest of a nation requires, that the
 succession to the crown should be fixed one way or other; but it is
 the same thing to its interest in what way it be fixed: So that if the
 relation of blood had not an effect independent of public interest, it
 would never have been regarded, without a positive law; and it would
 have been impossible, that so many positive laws of different nations
 coued ever have concured precisely in the same views and intentions.
 
 This leads us to consider the fifth source of authority, viz. positive
 laws; when the legislature establishes a certain form of government and
 succession of princes. At first sight it may be thought, that this must
 resolve into some of the preceding titles of authority. The legislative
 power, whence the positive law is derived, must either be established
 by original contract, long possession, present possession, conquest, or
 succession; and consequently the positive law must derive its force
 from some of those principles. But here it is remarkable, that though
 a positive law can only derive its force from these principles, yet it
 acquires not all the force of the principle from whence it is derived,
 but loses considerably in the transition; as it is natural to imagine.
 For instance; a government is established for many centuries on
 a certain system of laws, forms, and methods of succession. The
 legislative power, established by this long succession, changes all on a
 sudden the whole system of government, and introduces a new constitution
 in its stead. I believe few of the subjects will think themselves bound
 to comply with this alteration, unless it have an evident tendency to
 the public good: But men think themselves still at liberty to return to
 the antient government. Hence the notion of fundamental laws; which are
 supposed to be inalterable by the will of the sovereign: And of this
 nature the Salic law is understood to be in France. How far these
 fundamental laws extend is not determined in any government; nor is it
 possible it ever should. There is such an indefensible gradation from
 the most material laws to the most trivial, and from the most antient
 laws to the most modem, that it will be impossible to set bounds to
 the legislative power, and determine how far it may innovate in the
 principles of government. That is the work more of imagination and
 passion than of reason.
 
 Whoever considers the history of the several nations of the world; their
 revolutions, conquests, increase, and diminution; the manner in which
 their particular governments are established, and the successive right
 transmitted from one person to another, will soon learn to treat very
 lightly all disputes concerning the rights of princes, and will be
 convinced, that a strict adherence to any general rules, and the rigid
 loyalty to particular persons and families, on which some people set so
 high a value, are virtues that hold less of reason, than of bigotry
 and superstition. In this particular, the study of history confirms the
 reasonings of true philosophy; which, shewing us the original qualities
 of human nature, teaches us to regard the controversies in politics as
 incapable of any decision in most cases, and as entirely subordinate
 to the interests of peace and liberty. Where the public good does not
 evidently demand a change; it is certain, that the concurrence of all
 those titles, original contract, long possession, present possession,
 succession, and positive laws, forms the strongest title to sovereignty,
 and is justly regarded as sacred and inviolable. But when these titles
 are mingled and opposed in different degrees, they often occasion
 perplexity; and are less capable of solution from the arguments of
 lawyers and philosophers, than from the swords of the soldiery. Who
 shall tell me, for instance, whether Germanicus, or Drufus, ought to
 have succeeded Tiberius, had he died while they were both alive, without
 naming any of them for his successor? Ought the right of adoption to be
 received as equivalent to that of blood in a nation, where it had the
 same effect in private families, and had already, in two instances,
 taken place in the public? Ought Germanicus to be esteemed the eldest
 son, because he was born before Drufus; or the younger, because he was
 adopted after the birth of his brother? Ought the right of the elder to
 be regarded in a nation, where the eldest brother had no advantage in
 the succession to private families? Ought the Roman empire at that time
 to be esteemed hereditary, because of two examples; or ought it, even
 so early, to be regarded as belonging to the stronger, or the present
 possessor, as being founded on so recent an usurpation? Upon whatever
 principles we may pretend to answer these and such like questions, I
 am afraid we shall never be able to satisfy an impartial enquirer, who
 adopts no party in political controversies, and will be satisfied with
 nothing but sound reason and philosophy.
 
 But here an English reader will be apt to enquire concerning that famous
 revolution, which has had such a happy influence on our constitution,
 and has been attended with such mighty consequences. We have already
 remarked, that in the case of enormous tyranny and oppression, it is
 lawful to take arms even against supreme power; and that as government
 is a mere human invention for mutual advantage and security, it no
 longer imposes any obligation, either natural or moral, when once it
 ceases to have that tendency. But though this general principle
 be authorized by common sense, and the practice of all ages, it is
 certainly impossible for the laws, or even for philosophy, to establish
 any particular rules, by which we may know when resistance is lawful;
 and decide all controversies, which may arise on that subject. This may
 not only happen with regard to supreme power; but it is possible, even
 in some constitutions, where the legislative authority is not lodged in
 one person, that there may be a magistrate so eminent and powerful, as
 to oblige the laws to keep silence in this particular. Nor would this
 silence be an effect only of their respect, but also of their prudence;
 since it is certain, that in the vast variety of circumstances,
 which occur in all governments, an exercise of power, in so great
 a magistrate, may at one time be beneficial to the public, which at
 another time would be pernicious and tyrannical. But notwithstanding
 this silence of the laws in limited monarchies, it is certain, that the
 people still retain the right of resistance; since it is impossible,
 even in the most despotic governments, to deprive them of it. The same
 necessity of self-preservation, and the same motive of public good,
 give them the same liberty in the one case as in the other. And we may
 farther observe, that in such mixed governments, the cases, wherein
 resistance is lawful, must occur much oftener, and greater indulgence
 be given to the subjects to defend themselves by force of arms, than in
 arbitrary governments. Not only where the chief magistrate enters into
 measures, in themselves, extremely pernicious to the public, but even
 when he would encroach on the other parts of the constitution, and
 extend his power beyond the legal bounds, it is allowable to resist and
 dethrone him; though such resistance and violence may, in the general
 tenor of the laws, be deemed unlawful and rebellious. For besides that
 nothing is more essential to public interest, than the preservation of
 public liberty; it is evident, that if such a mixed government be once
 supposed to be established, every part or member of the constitution
 must have a right of self-defence, and of maintaining its antient bounds
 against the enaoachment of every other authority. As matter would have
 been created in vain, were it deprived of a power of resistance, without
 which no part of it coued preserve a distinct existence, and the whole
 might be crowded up into a single point: So it is a gross absurdity to
 suppose, in any government, a right without a remedy, or allow, that the
 supreme power is shared with the people, without allowing, that it is
 lawful for them to defend their share against every invader. Those,
 therefore, who would seem to respect our free government, and yet deny
 the right of resistance, have renounced all pretensions to common sense,
 and do not merit a serious answer.
 
 It does not belong to my present purpose to shew, that these general
 principles are applicable to the late revolution; and that all the
 rights and privileges, which ought to be sacred to a free nation, were
 at that time threatened with the utmost danger. I am better pleased to
 leave this controverted subject, if it really admits of controversy;
 and to indulge myself in some philosophical reflections, which naturally
 arise from that important event.
 
 First, We may observe, that should the lords and commons in our
 constitution, without any reason from public interest, either depose the
 king in being, or after his death exclude the prince, who, by laws and
 settled custom, ought to succeed, no one would esteem their proceedings
 legal, or think themselves bound to comply with them. But should the
 king, by his unjust practices, or his attempts for a tyrannical and
 despotic power, justly forfeit his legal, it then not only becomes
 morally lawful and suitable to the nature of political society to
 dethrone him; but what is more, we are apt likewise to think, that the
 remaining members of the constitution acquire a right of excluding his
 next heir, and of chusing whom they please for his successor. This is
 founded on a very singular quality of our thought and imagination. When
 a king forfeits his authority, his heir ought naturally to remain in the
 same situation, as if the king were removed by death; unless by mixing
 himself in the tyranny, he forfeit it for himself. But though this
 may seem reasonable, we easily comply with the contrary opinion. The
 deposition of a king, in such a government as ours, is certainly an act
 beyond all common authority, and an illegal assuming a power for public
 good, which, in the ordinary course of government, can belong to no
 member of the constitution. When the public good is so great and so
 evident as to justify the action, the commendable use of this licence
 causes us naturally to attribute to the parliament a right of using
 farther licences; and the antient bounds of the laws being once
 transgressed with approbation, we are not apt to be so strict in
 confining ourselves precisely within their limits. The mind naturally
 runs on with any train of action, which it has begun; nor do we commonly
 make any scruple concerning our duty, after the first action of any
 kind, which we perform. Thus at the revolution, no one who thought the
 deposition of the father justifiable, esteemed themselves to be confined
 to his infant son; though had that unhappy monarch died innocent at that
 time, and had his son, by any accident, been conveyed beyond seas, there
 is no doubt but a regency would have been appointed till he should
 come to age, and coued be restored to his dominions. As the slightest
 properties of the imagination have an effect on the judgments of the
 people, it shews the wisdom of the laws and of the parliament to take
 advantage of such properties, and to chuse the magistrates either in
 or out of a line, according as the vulgar will most naturally attribute
 authority and right to them.
 
 Secondly, Though the accession of the Prince of Orange to the throne
 might at first give occasion to many disputes, and his title be
 contested, it ought not now to appear doubtful, but must have acquired
 a sufficient authority from those three princes, who have succeeded him
 upon the same title. Nothing is more usual, though nothing may, at first
 sight, appear more unreasonable, than this way of thinking. Princes
 often seem to acquire a right from their successors, as well as from
 their ancestors; and a king, who during his life-time might justly be
 deemed an usurper, will be regarded by posterity as a lawful prince,
 because he has had the good fortune to settle his family on the throne,
 and entirely change the antient form of government. Julius Caesar is
 regarded as the first Roman emperor; while Sylla and Marius, whose
 titles were really the same as his, are treated as tyrants and usurpers.
 Time and custom give authority to all forms of government, and all
 successions of princes; and that power, which at first was founded only
 on injustice and violence, becomes in time legal and obligatory.
 Nor does the mind rest there; but returning back upon its footsteps,
 transfers to their predecessors and ancestors that right, which it
 naturally ascribes to the posterity, as being related together, and
 united in the imagination. The present king of France makes Hugh Capet
 a more lawful prince than Cromwell; as the established liberty of the
 Dutch is no inconsiderable apology for their obstinate resistance to
 Philip the second.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. XI OF THE LAWS OF NATIONS
 
 
 When civil government has been established over the greatest part of
 mankind, and different societies have been formed contiguous to each
 other, there arises a new set of duties among the neighbouring states,
 suitable to the nature of that commerce, which they carry on with each
 other. Political writers tell us, that in every kind of intercourse,
 a body politic is to be considered as one person; and indeed this
 assertion is so far just, that different nations, as well as private
 persons, require mutual assistance; at the same time that their
 selfishness and ambition are perpetual sources of war and discord. But
 though nations in this particular resemble individuals, yet as they are
 very different in other respects, no wonder they regulate themselves by
 different maxims, and give rise to a new set of rules, which we call the
 laws of nations. Under this head we may comprize the sacredness of the
 persons of ambassadors, the declaration of war, the abstaining from
 poisoned arms, with other duties of that kind, which are evidently
 calculated for the commerce, that is peculiar to different societies.
 
 But though these rules be super-added to the laws of nature, the former
 do not entirely abolish the latter; and one may safely affirm, that the
 three fundamental rules of justice, the stability of possession, its
 transference by consent, and the performance of promises, are duties
 of princes, as well as of subjects. The same interest produces the same
 effect in both cases. Where possession has no stability, there must be
 perpetual war. Where property is not transferred by consent, there can
 be no commerce. Where promises are not observed, there can be no leagues
 nor alliances. The advantages, therefore, of peace, commerce, and
 mutual succour, make us extend to different kingdoms the same notions of
 justice, which take place among individuals.
 
 There is a maxim very current in the world, which few politicians are
 willing to avow, but which has been authorized by the practice of all
 ages, that there is a system of morals cakulated for princes, much more
 free than that which ought to govern private parsons. It is evident
 this is not to be understood of the lesser extent of public duties and
 obligations; nor will any one be so extravagant as to assert, that
 the most solemn treaties ought to have no force among princes. For as
 princes do actually form treaties among themselves, they must propose
 some advantage from the execution of them; and the prospect of such
 advantage for the future must engage them to perform their part, and
 must establish that law of nature. The meaning, therefore, of this
 political maxim is, that though the morality of princes has the same
 extent, yet it has not the same force as that of private persons, and
 may lawfully be trangressed from a more trivial motive. However shocking
 such a proposition may appear to certain philosophers, it will be easy
 to defend it upon those principles, by which we have accounted for the
 origin of justice and equity.
 
 When men have found by experience, that it is impossible to subsist
 without society, and that it is impossible to maintain society, while
 they give free course to their appetites; so urgent an interest quickly
 restrains their actions, and imposes an obligation to observe those
 rules, which we call the laws of justice. This obligation of interest
 rests nor here; but by the necessary course of the passions and
 sentiments, gives rise to the moral obligation of duty; while we approve
 of such actions as tend to the peace of society, and disapprove of such
 as tend to its disturbance. The same natural obligation of interest
 takes place among independent kingdoms, and gives rise to the same
 morality; so that no one of ever so corrupt morals will approve of a
 prince, who voluntarily, and of his own accord, breaks his word,
 or violates any treaty. But here we may observe, that though the
 intercourse of different states be advantageous, and even sometimes
 necessary, yet it is nor so necessary nor advantageous as that among
 individuals, without which it is utterly impossible for human nature
 ever to subsist. Since, therefore, the natural obligation to justice,
 among different states, is not so strong as among individuals, the moral
 obligation, which arises from it, must partake of its weakness; and we
 must necessarily give a greater indulgence to a prince or minister, who
 deceives another; than to a private gentleman, who breaks his word of
 honour.
 
 Should it be asked, what proportion these two species of morality bear
 to each other? I would answer, that this is a question, to which we can
 never give any precise answer; nor is it possible to reduce to numbers
 the proportion, which we ought to fix betwixt them. One may safely
 affirm, that this proportion finds itself, without any art or study
 of men; as we may observe on many other occasions. The practice of the
 world goes farther in teaching us the degrees of our duty, than the most
 subtile philosophy, which was ever yet invented. And this may serve as a
 convincing proof, that all men have an implicit notion of the foundation
 of those moral rules concerning natural and civil justice, and are
 sensible, that they arise merely from human conventions, and from the
 interest, which we have in the preservation of peace and order.
 For otherwise the diminution of the interest would never produce
 a relaxation of the morality, and reconcile us more easily to any
 transgression of justice among princes and republics, than in the
 private commerce of one subject with another.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. XII OF CHASTITY AND MODESTY
 
 
 If any difficulty attend this system concerning the laws of nature and
 nations, it will be with regard to the universal approbation or blame,
 which follows their observance or transgression, and which some may not
 think sufficiently explained from the general interests of society.
 To remove, as far as possible, all scruples of this kind, I shall here
 consider another set of duties, viz, the modesty and chastity which
 belong to the fair sex: And I doubt not but these virtues will be
 found to be still more conspicuous instances of the operation of those
 principles, which I have insisted on.
 
 There are some philosophers, who attack the female virtues with great
 vehemence, and fancy they have gone very far in detecting popular
 errors, when they can show, that there is no foundation in nature for
 all that exterior modesty, which we require in the expressions, and
 dress, and behaviour of the fair sex. I believe I may spare myself the
 trouble of insisting on so obvious a subject, and may proceed, without
 farther preparation, to examine after what manner such notions arise
 from education, from the voluntary conventions of men, and from the
 interest of society.
 
 Whoever considers the length and feebleness of human infancy, with the
 concern which both sexes naturally have for their offspring, will
 easily perceive, that there must be an union of male and female for
 the education of the young, and that this union must be of considerable
 duration. But in order to induce the men to impose on themselves this
 restraint, and undergo chearfully all the fatigues and expences, to
 which it subjects them, they must believe, that the children are their
 own, and that their natural instinct is not directed to a wrong object,
 when they give a loose to love and tenderness. Now if we examine the
 structure of the human body, we shall find, that this security is very
 difficult to be attained on our part; and that since, in the copulation
 of the sexes, the principle of generation goes from the man to the
 woman, an error may easily take place on the side of the former, though
 it be utterly impossible with regard to the latter. From this trivial
 and anatomical observation is derived that vast difference betwixt the
 education and duties of the two sexes.
 
 Were a philosopher to examine the matter a priori, he would reason after
 the following manner. Men are induced to labour for the maintenance
 and education of their children, by the persuasion that they are really
 their own; and therefore it is reasonable, and even necessary, to give
 them some security in this particular. This security cannot consist
 entirely in the imposing of severe punishments on any transgressions
 of conjugal fidelity on the part of the wife; since these public
 punishments cannot be inflicted without legal proof, which it is
 difficult to meet with in this subject. What restraint, therefore, shall
 we impose on women, in order to counter-balance so strong a temptation
 as they have to infidelity? There seems to be no restraint possible, but
 in the punishment of bad fame or reputation; a punishment, which has a
 mighty influence on the human mind, and at the same time is inflicted by
 the world upon surmizes, and conjectures, and proofs, that would never
 be received in any court of judicature. In order, therefore, to impose
 a due restraint on the female sex, we must attach a peculiar degree of
 shame to their infidelity, above what arises merely from its injustice,
 and must bestow proportionable praises on their chastity.
 
 But though this be a very strong motive to fidelity, our philosopher
 would quickly discover, that it would not alone be sufficient to that
 purpose. All human creatures, especially of the female sex, are apt
 to over-look remote motives in favour of any present temptation:
 The temptation is here the strongest imaginable: Its approaches are
 insensible and seducing: And a woman easily finds, or flatters herself
 she shall find, certain means of securing her reputation, and preventing
 all the pernicious consequences of her pleasures. It is necessary,
 therefore, that, beside the infamy attending such licences, there should
 be some preceding backwardness or dread, which may prevent their first
 approaches, and may give the female sex a repugnance to all expressions,
 and postures, and liberties, that have an immediate relation to that
 enjoyment.
 
 Such would be the reasonings of our speculative philosopher: But I am
 persuaded, that if he had not a perfect knowledge of human nature, he
 would be apt to regard them as mere chimerical speculations, and would
 consider the infamy attending infidelity, and backwardness to all its
 approaches, as principles that were rather to be wished than hoped for
 in the world. For what means, would he say, of persuading mankind, that
 the transgressions of conjugal duty are more infamous than any other
 kind of injustice, when it is evident they are more excusable, upon
 account of the greatness of the temptation? And what possibility of
 giving a backwardness to the approaches of a pleasure, to which nature
 has inspired so strong a propensity; and a propensity that it is
 absolutely necessary in the end to comply with, for the support of the
 species?
 
 But speculative reasonings, which cost so much pains to philosophers,
 are often formed by the world naturally, and without reflection: As
 difficulties, which seem unsurmountable in theory, are easily got over
 in practice. Those, who have an interest in the fidelity of women,
 naturally disapprove of their infidelity, and all the approaches to
 it. Those, who have no interest, are carried along with the stream.
 Education takes possession of the ductile minds of the fair sex in their
 infancy. And when a general rule of this kind is once established, men
 are apt to extend it beyond those principles, from which it first arose.
 Thus batchelors, however debauched, cannot chuse but be shocked with any
 instance of lewdness or impudence in women. And though all these maxims
 have a plain reference to generation, yet women past child-bearing have
 no more privilege in this respect, than those who are in the flower of
 their youth and beauty. Men have undoubtedly an implicit notion, that
 all those ideas of modesty and decency have a regard to generation;
 since they impose not the same laws, with the same force, on the male
 sex, where that reason takes nor place. The exception is there obvious
 and extensive, and founded on a remarkable difference, which produces
 a clear separation and disjunction of ideas. But as the case is not the
 same with regard to the different ages of women, for this reason, though
 men know, that these notions are founded on the public interest, yet
 the general rule carries us beyond the original principle, and makes us
 extend the notions of modesty over the whole sex, from their earliest
 infancy to their extremest old-age and infirmity.
 
 Courage, which is the point of honour among men, derives its merit, in
 a great measure, from artifice, as well as the chastity of women; though
 it has also some foundation in nature, as we shall see afterwards.
 
 As to the obligations which the male sex lie under, with regard to
 chastity, we may observe, that according to the general notions of the
 world, they bear nearly the same proportion to the obligations of women,
 as the obligations of the law of nations do to those of the law of
 nature. It is contrary to the interest of civil society, that men
 should have an entire liberty of indulging their appetites in venereal
 enjoyment: But as this interest is weaker than in the case of the female
 sex, the moral obligation, arising from it, must be proportionably
 weaker. And to prove this we need only appeal to the practice and
 sentiments of all nations and ages.
 
 
 
 
 
 PART III OF THE OTHER VIRTUES AND VICES
 
 
 
 
 SECT. I OF THE ORIGIN OF THE NATURAL VIRTUES AND VICES
 
 
 We come now to the examination of such virtues and vices as are entirely
 natural, and have no dependance on the artifice and contrivance of men.
 The examination of these will conclude this system of morals.
 
 The chief spring or actuating principle of the human mind is pleasure or
 pain; and when these sensations are removed, both from our thought and
 feeling, we are, in a great measure, incapable of passion or action, of
 desire or volition. The most immediate effects of pleasure and pain are
 the propense and averse motions of the mind; which are diversified
 into volition, into desire and aversion, grief and joy, hope and fear,
 according as the pleasure or pain changes its situation, and becomes
 probable or improbable, certain or uncertain, or is considered as out of
 our power for the present moment. But when along with this, the objects,
 that cause pleasure or pain, acquire a relation to ourselves or others;
 they still continue to excite desire and aversion, grief and joy: But
 cause, at the same time, the indirect passions of pride or humility,
 love or hatred, which in this case have a double relation of impressions
 and ideas to the pain or pleasure.
 
 We have already observed, that moral distinctions depend entirely on
 certain peculiar sentiments of pain and pleasure, and that whatever
 mental quality in ourselves or others gives us a satisfaction, by the
 survey or reflection, is of course virtuous; as every thing of this
 nature, that gives uneasiness, is vicious. Now since every quality in
 ourselves or others, which gives pleasure, always causes pride or love;
 as every one, that produces uneasiness, excites humility or hatred: It
 follows, that these two particulars are to be considered as equivalent,
 with regard to our mental qualities, virtue and the power of producing
 love or pride, vice and the power of producing humility or hatred. In
 every case, therefore, we must judge of the one by the other; and may
 pronounce any quality of the mind virtuous, which causes love or pride;
 and any one vicious, which causes hatred or humility.
 
 If any action be either virtuous or vicious, it is only as a sign of
 some quality or character. It must depend upon durable principles of the
 mind, which extend over the whole conduct, and enter into the personal
 character. Actions themselves, not proceeding from any constant
 principle, have no influence on love or hatred, pride or humility; and
 consequently are never considered in morality.
 
 This reflection is self-evident, and deserves to be attended to, as
 being of the utmost importance in the present subject. We are never to
 consider any single action in our enquiries concerning the origin
 of morals; but only the quality or character from which the action
 proceeded. These alone are durable enough to affect our sentiments
 concerning the person. Actions are, indeed, better indications of a
 character than words, or even wishes and sentiments; but it is only so
 far as they are such indications, that they are attended with love or
 hatred, praise or blame.
 
 To discover the true origin of morals, and of that love or hatred, which
 arises from mental qualities, we must take the matter pretty deep, and
 compare some principles, which have been already examined and explained.
 
 We may begin with considering a-new the nature and force of sympathy.
 The minds of all men are similar in their feelings and operations; nor
 can any one be actuated by any affection, of which all others are not,
 in some degree, susceptible. As in strings equally wound up, the motion
 of one communicates itself to the rest; so all the affections readily
 pass from one person to another, and beget correspondent movements in
 every human creature. When I see the effects of passion in the voice and
 gesture of any person, my mind immediately passes from these effects
 to their causes, and forms such a lively idea of the passion, as is
 presently converted into the passion itself. In like manner, when I
 perceive the causes of any emotion, my mind is conveyed to the effects,
 and is actuated with a like emotion. Were I present at any of the more
 terrible operations of surgery, it is certain, that even before it
 begun, the preparation of the instruments, the laying of the bandages
 in order, the heating of the irons, with all the signs of anxiety and
 concern in the patient and assistants, would have a great effect upon my
 mind, and excite the strongest sentiments of pity and terror. No
 passion of another discovers itself immediately to the mind. We are only
 sensible of its causes or effects. From these we infer the passion: And
 consequently these give rise to our sympathy.
 
 Our sense of beauty depends very much on this principle; and where any
 object has atendency to produce pleasure in its possessor, it is always
 regarded as beautiful; as every object, that has a tendency to produce
 pain, is disagreeable and deformed. Thus the conveniency of a house, the
 fertility of a field, the strength of a horse, the capacity, security,
 and swift-sailing of a vessel, form the principal beauty of these
 several objects. Here the object, which is denominated beautiful,
 pleases only by its tendency to produce a certain effect. That effect
 is the pleasure or advantage of some other person. Now the pleasure of
 a stranger, for whom we have no friendship, pleases us only by sympathy.
 To this principle, therefore, is owing the beauty, which we find in
 every thing that is useful. How considerable a part this is of beauty
 can easily appear upon reflection. Wherever an object has a tendency
 to produce pleasure in the possessor, or in other words, is the proper
 cause of pleasure, it is sure to please the spectator, by a delicate
 sympathy with the possessor. Most of the works of art are esteemed
 beautiful, in proportion to their fitness for the use of man, and even
 many of the productions of nature derive their beauty from that source.
 Handsome and beautiful, on most occasions, is nor an absolute but a
 relative quality, and pleases us by nothing but its tendency to produce
 an end that is agreeable.
 
 
      [Footnote 25  Decentior equus cujus astricta sunt ilia; sed
      idem velocior. Pulcher aspectu sit athieta, cujus lacertos
      exercitatio expressit; idem certamini paratior. Nunquam vero
      species ab utilitate dividitur. Sed hoc quidem discernere,
      modici judicii est. Quinct. lib. 8. (A horse with narrow
      flanks looks more comely; It also moves faster. An athlete
      whose muscles have been developed by training presents a
      handsome appearance; he is also better prepared for the
      contest. Attractive appearance is invariably associated with
      efficient functioning. Yet it takes no outstanding powers of
      judgement to wake this distinction.)]
 
 The same principle produces, in many instances, our sentiments of
 morals, as well as those of beauty. No virtue is more esteemed than
 justice, and no vice more detested than injustice; nor are there any
 qualities, which go farther to the fixing the character, either as
 amiable or odious. Now justice is a moral virtue, merely because it has
 that tendency to the good of mankind; and, indeed, is nothing but
 an artificial invention to that purpose. The same may be said of
 allegiance, of the laws of nations, of modesty, and of good-manners. All
 these are mere human contrivances for the interest of society. And since
 there is a very strong sentiment of morals, which in all nations, and
 all ages, has attended them, we must allow, that the reflecting on the
 tendency of characters and mental qualities, is sufficient to give us
 the sentiments of approbation and blame. Now as the means to an end
 can only be agreeable, where the end is agreeable; and as the good
 of society, where our own interest is not concerned, or that of our
 friends, pleases only by sympathy: It follows, that sympathy is the
 source of the esteem, which we pay to all the artificial virtues.
 
 Thus it appears, that sympathy is a very powerful principle in human
 nature, that it has a great influence on our taste of beauty, and that
 it produces our sentiment of morals in all the artificial virtues. From
 thence we may presume, that it also gives rise to many of the other
 virtues; and that qualities acquire our approbation, because of
 their tendency to the good of mankind. This presumption must become a
 certainty, when we find that most of those qualities, which we naturally
 approve of, have actually that tendency, and render a man a proper
 member of society: While the qualities, which we naturally disapprove
 of, have a contrary tendency, and render any intercourse with the person
 dangerous or disagreeable. For having found, that such tendencies have
 force enough to produce the strongest sentiment of morals, we can never
 reasonably, in these cases, look for any other cause of approbation
 or blame; it being an inviolable maxim in philosophy, that where any
 particular cause is sufficient for an effect, we ought to rest satisfied
 with it, and ought not to multiply causes without necessity. We have
 happily attained experiments in the artificial virtues, where the
 tendency of qualities to the good of society, is the sole cause of
 our approbation, without any suspicion of the concurrence of another
 principle. From thence we learn the force of that principle. And where
 that principle may take place, and the quality approved of is really
 beneficial to society, a true philosopher will never require any other
 principle to account for the strongest approbation and esteem.
 
 That many of the natural virtues have this tendency to the good
 of society, no one can doubt of. Meekness, beneficence, charity,
 generosity, clemency, moderation, equity bear the greatest figure among
 the moral qualities, and are commonly denominated the social virtues, to
 mark their tendency to the good of society. This goes so far, that some
 philosophers have represented all moral distinctions as the effect of
 artifice and education, when skilful politicians endeavoured to restrain
 the turbulent passions of men, and make them operate to the public
 good, by the notions of honour and shame. This system, however, is nor
 consistent with experience. For, first, there are other virtues and
 vices beside those which have this tendency to the public advantage
 and loss. Secondly, had not men a natural sentiment of approbation and
 blame, it coued never be excited by politicians; nor would the
 words laudable and praise-worthy, blameable and odious be any more
 intelligible, than if they were a language perfectly known to us, as we
 have already observed. But though this system be erroneous, it may teach
 us, that moral distinctions arise, in a great measure, from the tendency
 of qualities and characters to the interests of society, and that it is
 our concern for that interest, which makes us approve or disapprove
 of them. Now we have no such extensive concern for society but from
 sympathy; and consequently it is that principle, which takes us so far
 out of ourselves, as to give us the same pleasure or uneasiness in the
 characters of others, as if they had a tendency to our own advantage or
 loss.
 
 The only difference betwixt the natural virtues and justice lies in
 this, that the good, which results from the former, arises from every
 single act, and is the object of some natural passion: Whereas a single
 act of justice, considered in itself, may often be contrary to the
 public good; and it is only the concurrence of mankind, in a general
 scheme or system of action, which is advantageous. When I relieve
 persons in distress, my natural humanity is my motive; and so far as
 my succour extends, so far have I promoted the happiness of my
 fellow-creatures. But if we examine all the questions, that come before
 any tribunal of justice, we shall find, that, considering each case
 apart, it would as often be an instance of humanity to decide contrary
 to the laws of justice as conformable them. Judges take from a poor
 man to give to a rich; they bestow on the dissolute the labour of the
 industrious; and put into the hands of the vicious the means of harming
 both themselves and others. The whole scheme, however, of law and
 justice is advantageous to the society; and it was with a view to this
 advantage, that men, by their voluntary conventions, established it.
 After it is once established by these conventions, it is naturally
 attended with a strong sentiment of morals; which can proceed from
 nothing but our sympathy with the interests of society. We need no other
 explication of that esteem, which attends such of the natural virtues,
 as have a tendency to the public good. I must farther add, that there
 are several circumstances, which render this hypothesis much more
 probable with regard to the natural than the artificial virtues. It is
 certain that the imagination is more affected by what is particular,
 than by what is general; and that the sentiments are always moved
 with difficulty, where their objects are, in any degree, loose and
 undetermined: Now every particular act of justice is not beneficial to
 society, but the whole scheme or system: And it may not, perhaps, be any
 individual person for whom we are concerned, who receives benefit from
 justice, but the whole society alike. On the contrary, every particular
 act of generosity, or relief of the industrious and indigent, is
 beneficial; and is beneficial to a particular person, who is not
 undeserving of it. It is more natural, therefore, to think, that the
 tendencies of the latter virtue will affect our sentiments, and command
 our approbation, than those of the former; and therefore, since we find,
 that the approbation of the former arises from their tendencies, we may
 ascribe, with better reason, the same cause to the approbation of the
 latter. In any number of similar effects, if a cause can be discovered
 for one, we ought to extend that cause to all the other effects, which
 can be accounted for by it: But much more, if these other effects be
 attended with peculiar circumstances, which facilitate the operation of
 that cause.
 
 Before I proceed farther, I must observe two remarkable circumstances in
 this affair, which may seem objections to the present system. The first
 may be thus explained. When any quality, or character, has a tendency to
 the good of mankind, we are pleased with it, and approve of it; because
 it presents the lively idea of pleasure; which idea affects us by
 sympathy, and is itself a kind of pleasure. But as this sympathy is very
 variable, it may be thought that our sentiments of morals must admit of
 all the same variations. We sympathize more with persons contiguous to
 us, than with persons remote from us: With our acquaintance, than
 with strangers: With our countrymen, than with foreigners. But
 notwithstanding this variation of our sympathy, we give the same
 approbation to the same moral qualities in China as in England. They
 appear equally virtuous, and recommend themselves equally to the esteem
 of a judicious spectator. The sympathy varies without a variation in our
 esteem. Our esteem, therefore, proceeds not from sympathy.
 
 To this I answer: The approbation of moral qualities most certainly
 is not derived from reason, or any comparison of ideas; but proceeds
 entirely from a moral taste, and from certain sentiments of pleasure
 or disgust, which arise upon the contemplation and view of particular
 qualities or characters. Now it is evident, that those sentiments,
 whence-ever they are derived, must vary according to the distance or
 contiguity of the objects; nor can I feel the same lively pleasure from
 the virtues of a person, who lived in Greece two thousand years ago,
 that I feel from the virtues of a familiar friend and acquaintance. Yet
 I do not say, that I esteem the one more than the other: And therefore,
 if the variation of the sentiment, without a variation of the esteem,
 be an objection, it must have equal force against every other system, as
 against that of sympathy. But to consider the matter a-right, it has no
 force at all; and it is the easiest matter in the world to account
 for it. Our situation, with regard both to persons and things, is in
 continual fluctuation; and a man, that lies at a distance from us,
 may, in a little time, become a familiar acquaintance. Besides, every
 particular man has a peculiar position with regard to others; and it is
 impossible we coued ever converse together on any reasonable terms, were
 each of us to consider characters and persons, only as they appear
 from his peculiar point of view. In order, therefore, to prevent those
 continual contradictions, and arrive at a more stable judgment of
 things, we fix on some steady and general points of view; and always,
 in our thoughts, place ourselves in them, whatever may be our present
 situation. In like manner, external beauty is determined merely by
 pleasure; and it is evident, a beautiful countenance cannot give so
 much pleasure, when seen at the distance of twenty paces, as when it
 is brought nearer us. We say not, however, that it appears to us less
 beautiful: Because we know what effect it will have in such a position,
 and by that reflection we correct its momentary appearance.
 
 In general, all sentiments of blame or praise are variable, according
 to our situation of nearness or remoteness, with regard to the person
 blamed or praised, and according to the present disposition of our mind.
 But these variations we regard not in our general decision, but still
 apply the terms expressive of our liking or dislike, in the same manner,
 as if we remained in one point of view. Experience soon teaches us this
 method of correcting our sentiments, or at least, of correcting our
 language, where the sentiments are more stubborn and inalterable. Our
 servant, if diligent and faithful, may excite stronger sentiments of
 love and kindness than Marcus Brutus, as represented in history; but we
 say not upon that account, that the former character is more laudable
 than the latter. We know, that were we to approach equally near to that
 renowned patriot, he would command a much higher degree of affection and
 admiration. Such corrections are common with regard to all the senses;
 and indeed it were impossible we could ever make use of language,
 or communicate our sentiments to one another, did we not correct the
 momentary appearances of things, and overlook our present situation.
 
 It is therefore from the influence of characters and qualities, upon
 those who have an intercourse with any person, that we blame or praise
 him. We consider not whether the persons, affected by the qualities,
 be our acquaintance or strangers, countrymen or foreigners. Nay, we
 over-look our own interest in those general judgments; and blame not a
 man for opposing us in any of our pretensions, when his own interest
 is particularly concerned. We make allowance for a certain degree of
 selfishness in men; because we know it to be inseparable from human
 nature, and inherent in our frame and constitution. By this reflection
 we correct those sentiments of blame, which so naturally arise upon any
 opposition.
 
 But however the general principle of our blame or praise may be
 corrected by those other principles, it is certain, they are not
 altogether efficacious, nor do our passions often correspond entirely
 to the present theory. It is seldom men heartily love what lies at
 a distance from them, and what no way redounds to their particular
 benefit; as it is no less rare to meet with persons, who can pardon
 another any opposition he makes to their interest, however justifiable
 that opposition may be by the general rules of morality. Here we are
 contented with saying, that reason requires such an Impartial conduct,
 but that it is seldom we can bring ourselves to it, and that our
 passions do not readily follow the determination of our judgment. This
 language will be easily understood, if we consider what we formerly said
 concerning that reason, which is able to oppose our passion; and which
 we have found to be nothing but a general calm determination of the
 passions, founded on some distant view or reflection. When we form our
 judgments of persons, merely from the tendency of their characters
 to our own benefit, or to that of our friends, we find so many
 contradictions to our sentiments in society and conversation, and such
 an uncertainty from the incessant changes of our situation, that we
 seek some other standard of merit and demerit, which may not admit of so
 great variation. Being thus loosened from our first station, we cannot
 afterwards fix ourselves so commodiously by any means as by a sympathy
 with those, who have any commerce with the person we consider. This is
 far from being as lively as when our own interest is concerned, or that
 of our particular friends; nor has it such an influence on our love
 and hatred: But being equally conformable to our calm and general
 principles, it is said to have an equal authority over our reason, and
 to command our judgment and opinion. We blame equally a bad action,
 which we read of in history, with one performed in our neighbourhood the
 other day: The meaning of which is, that we know from reflection, that
 the former action would excite as strong sentiments of disapprobation as
 the latter, were it placed in the same position.
 
 I now proceed to the second remarkable circumstance, which I proposed to
 take notice of. Where a person is possessed of a character, that in its
 natural tendency is beneficial to society, we esteem him virtuous, and
 are delighted with the view of his character, even though particular
 accidents prevent its operation, and incapacitate him from being
 serviceable to his friends and country. Virtue in rags is still virtue;
 and the love, which it procures, attends a man into a dungeon or desart,
 where the virtue can no longer be exerted in action, and is lost to all
 the world. Now this may be esteemed an objection to the present system.
 Sympathy interests us in the good of mankind; and if sympathy were the
 source of our esteem for virtue, that sentiment of approbation coued
 only take place, where the virtue actually attained its end, and
 was beneficial to mankind. Where it fails of its end, it is only an
 imperfect means; and therefore can never acquire any merit from that
 end. The goodness of an end can bestow a merit on such means alone as
 are compleat, and actually produce the end.
 
 To this we may reply, that where any object, in all its parts, is fitted
 to attain any agreeable end, it naturally gives us pleasure, and is
 esteemed beautiful, even though some external circumstances be wanting
 to render it altogether effectual. It is sufficient if every thing be
 compleat in the object itself. A house, that is contrived with great
 judgment for all the commodities of life, pleases us upon that account;
 though perhaps we are sensible, that noone will ever dwell in it. A
 fertile soil, and a happy climate, delight us by a reflection on the
 happiness which they would afford the inhabitants, though at present the
 country be desart and uninhabited. A man, whose limbs and shape promise
 strength and activity, is esteemed handsome, though condemned to
 perpetual imprisonment. The imagination has a set of passions belonging
 to it, upon which our sentiments of beauty much depend. These passions
 are moved by degrees of liveliness and strength, which are inferior to
 belief, and independent of the real existence of their objects. Where a
 character is, in every respect, fitted to be beneficial to society,
 the imagination passes easily from the cause to the effect, without
 considering that there are some circumstances wanting to render the
 cause a complete one. General rules create a species of probability,
 which sometimes influences the judgment, and always the imagination.
 
 It is true, when the cause is compleat, and a good disposition is
 attended with good fortune, which renders it really beneficial to
 society, it gives a stronger pleasure to the spectator, and is attended
 with a more lively sympathy. We are more affected by it; and yet we do
 not say that it is more virtuous, or that we esteem it more. We know,
 that an alteration of fortune may render the benevolent disposition
 entirely impotent; and therefore we separate, as much as possible, the
 fortune from the disposition. The case is the same, as when we correct
 the different sentiments of virtue, which proceed from its different
 distances from ourselves. The passions do not always follow our
 corrections; but these corrections serve sufficiently to regulate our
 abstract notions, and are alone regarded, when we pronounce in general
 concerning the degrees of vice and virtue.
 
 It is observed by critics, that all words or sentences, which are
 difficult to the pronunciation, are disagreeable to the ear. There is no
 difference, whether a man hear them pronounced, or read them silently
 to himself. When I run over a book with my eye, I Imagine I hear it all;
 and also, by the force of imagination, enter into the uneasiness, which
 the delivery of it would give the speaker. The uneasiness is not real;
 but as such a composition of words has a natural tendency to produce
 it, this is sufficient to affect the mind with a painful sentiment, and
 render the discourse harsh and disagreeable. It is a similar case, where
 any real quality is, by accidental circumstances, rendered impotent, and
 is deprived of its natural influence on society.
 
 Upon these principles we may easily remove any contradiction, which may
 appear to be betwixt the extensive sympathy, on which our sentiments
 of virtue depend, and that limited generosity which I have frequently
 observed to be natural to men, and which justice and property suppose,
 according to the precedent reasoning. My sympathy with another may
 give me the sentiment of pain and disapprobation, when any object is
 presented, that has a tendency to give him uneasiness; though I may not
 be willing to sacrifice any thing of my own interest, or cross any of
 my passions, for his satisfaction. A house may displease me by being
 ill-contrived for the convenience of the owner; and yet I may refuse to
 give a shilling towards the rebuilding of it. Sentiments must touch
 the heart, to make them controul our passions: But they need not
 extend beyond the imagination, to make them influence our taste. When
 a building seems clumsy and tottering to the eye, it is ugly and
 disagreeable; though we be fully assured of the solidity of the
 workmanship. It is a kind of fear, which causes this sentiment of
 disapprobation; but the passion is not the same with that which we feel,
 when obliged to stand under a wall, that we really think tottering and
 insecure. The seeming tendencies of objects affect the mind: And the
 emotions they excite are of a like species with those, which proceed
 from the real consequences of objects, but their feeling is different.
 Nay, these emotions are so different in their feeling, that they
 may often be contrary, without destroying each other; as when the
 fortifications of a city belonging to an enemy are esteemed beautiful
 upon account of their strength, though we coued wish that they were
 entirely destroyed. The imagination adheres to the general views of
 things, and distinguishes the feelings they produce, from those which
 arise from our particular and momentary situation.
 
 If we examine the panegyrics that are commonly made of great men, we
 shall find, that most of the qualities, which are attributed to them,
 may be divided into two kinds, viz. such as make them perform their
 part in society; and such as render them serviceable to themselves, and
 enable them to promote their own interest. Their prudence, temperance,
 frugality, industry, assiduity, enterprize, dexterity, are celebrated,
 as well as their generosity and humanity. If we ever give an indulgence
 to any quality, that disables a man from making a figure in life, it is
 to that of indolence, which is not supposed to deprive one of his parts
 and capacity, but only suspends their exercise; and that without any
 inconvenience to the person himself, since it is, in some measure, from
 his own choice. Yet indolence is always allowed to be a fault, and a
 very great one, if extreme: Nor do a man's friends ever acknowledge him
 to be subject to it, but in order to save his character in more material
 articles. He coued make a figure, say they, if he pleased to give
 application: His understanding is sound, his conception quick, and his
 memory tenacious; but he hates business, and is indifferent about his
 fortune. And this a man sometimes may make even a subject of vanity;
 though with the air of confessing a fault: Because he may think, that
 his incapacity for business implies much more noble qualities; such as
 a philosophical spirit, a fine taste, a delicate wit, or a relish for
 pleasure and society. But take any other case: Suppose a quality, that
 without being an indication of any other good qualities, incapacitates
 a man always for business, and is destructive to his interest; such as
 a blundering understanding, and a wrong judgment of every thing in life;
 inconstancy and irresolution; or a want of address in the management
 of men and business: These are all allowed to be imperfections in a
 character; and many men would rather acknowledge the greatest crimes,
 than have it suspected, that they are, in any degree, subject to them.
 
 It is very happy, in our philosophical researches, when we find the
 same phaenomenon diversified by a variety of circumstances; and by
 discovering what is common among them, can the better assure ourselves
 of the truth of any hypothesis we may make use of to explain it. Were
 nothing esteemed virtue but what were beneficial to society, I am
 persuaded, that the foregoing explication of the moral sense ought still
 to be received, and that upon sufficient evidence: But this evidence
 must grow upon us, when we find other kinds of virtue, which will not
 admit of any explication except from that hypothesis. Here is a man,
 who is not remarkably defective in his social qualities; but what
 principally recommends him is his dexterity in business, by which he
 has extricated himself from the greatest difficulties, and conducted the
 most delicate affairs with a singular address and prudence. I find an
 esteem for him immediately to arise in me: His company is a satisfaction
 to me; and before I have any farther acquaintance with him, I would
 rather do him a service than another, whose character is in every other
 respect equal, but is deficient in that particular. In this case, the
 qualities that please me are all considered as useful to the person, and
 as having a tendency to promote his interest and satisfaction. They are
 only regarded as means to an end, and please me in proportion to their
 fitness for that end. The end, therefore, must be agreeable to me. But
 what makes the end agreeable? The person is a stranger: I am no way
 interested in him, nor lie under any obligation to him: His happiness
 concerns not me, farther than the happiness of every human, and indeed
 of every sensible creature: That is, it affects me only by sympathy.
 From that principle, whenever I discover his happiness and good, whether
 in its causes or effects, I enter so deeply into it, that it gives me a
 sensible emotion. The appearance of qualities, that have a tendency to
 promote it, have an agreeable effect upon my imagination, and command my
 love and esteem.
 
 This theory may serve to explain, why the same qualities, in all cases,
 produce both pride and love, humility and hatred; and the same man is
 always virtuous or vicious, accomplished or despicable to others, who is
 so to himself. A person, in whom we discover any passion or habit, which
 originally is only incommodious to himself, becomes always disagreeable
 to us, merely on its account; as on the other hand, one whose character
 is only dangerous and disagreeable to others, can never be satisfied
 with himself, as long as he is sensible of that disadvantage. Nor is
 this observable only with regard to characters and manners, but may
 be remarked even in the most minute circumstances. A violent cough in
 another gives us uneasiness; though in itself it does not in the least
 affect us. A man will be mortified, if you tell him he has a stinking
 breath; though it is evidently no annoyance to himself. Our fancy easily
 changes its situation; and either surveying ourselves as we appear to
 others, or considering others as they feel themselves, we enter, by that
 means, into sentiments, which no way belong to us, and in which nothing
 but sympathy is able to interest us. And this sympathy we sometimes
 carry so far, as even to be displeased with a quality commodious to us,
 merely because it displeases others, and makes us disagreeable in
 their eyes; though perhaps we never can have any interest in rendering
 ourselves agreeable to them.
 
 There have been many systems of morality advanced by philosophers in
 all ages; but if they are strictly examined, they may be reduced to
 two, which alone merit our attention. Moral good and evil are certainly
 distinguished by our sentiments, not by reason: But these sentiments
 may arise either from the mere species or appearance of characters and
 passions, or from reflections on their tendency to the happiness of
 mankind, and of particular persons. My opinion is, that both these
 causes are intermixed in our judgments of morals; after the same manner
 as they are in our decisions concerning most kinds of external beauty:
 Though I am also of opinion, that reflections on the tendencies of
 actions have by far the greatest influence, and determine all the great
 lines of our duty. There are, however, instances, in cases of less
 moment, wherein this immediate taste or sentiment produces our
 approbation. Wit, and a certain easy and disengaged behaviour, are
 qualities immediately agreeable to others, and command their love
 and esteem. Some of these qualities produce satisfaction in others
 by particular original principles of human nature, which cannot be
 accounted for: Others may be resolved into principles, which are more
 general. This will best appear upon a particular enquiry.
 
 As some qualities acquire their merit from their being immediately
 agreeable to others, without any tendency to public interest; so some
 are denominated virtuous from their being immediately agreeable to the
 person himself, who possesses them. Each of the passions and operations
 of the mind has a particular feeling, which must be either agreeable or
 disagreeable. The first is virtuous, the second vicious. This particular
 feeling constitutes the very nature of the passion; and therefore needs
 not be accounted for.
 
 But however directly the distinction of vice and virtue may seem to flow
 from the immediate pleasure or uneasiness, which particular qualities
 cause to ourselves or others; it is easy to observe, that it has also a
 considerable dependence on the principle of sympathy so often insisted
 on. We approve of a person, who is possessed of qualities immediately
 agreeable to those, with whom he has any commerce; though perhaps we
 ourselves never reaped any pleasure from them. We also approve of
 one, who is possessed of qualities, that are immediately agreeable to
 himself; though they be of no service to any mortal. To account for this
 we must have recourse to the foregoing principles.
 
 Thus, to take a general review of the present hypothesis: Every quality
 of the mind is denominated virtuous, which gives pleasure by the mere
 survey; as every quality, which produces pain, is called vicious. This
 pleasure and this pain may arise from four different sources. For we
 reap a pleasure from the view of a character, which is naturally fitted
 to be useful to others, or to the person himself, or which is agreeable
 to others, or to the person himself. One may, perhaps, be surprized.
 that amidst all these interests and pleasures, we should forget our own,
 which touch us so nearly on every other occasion. But we shall easily
 satisfy ourselves on this head, when we consider, that every particular
 person s pleasure and interest being different, it is impossible men
 coued ever agree in their sentiments and judgments, unless they chose
 some common point of view, from which they might survey their object,
 and which might cause it to appear the same to all of them. Now in
 judging of characters, the only interest or pleasure, which appears the
 same to every spectator, is that of the person himself, whose character
 is examined; or that of persons, who have a connexion with him. And
 though such interests and pleasures touch us more faintly than our own,
 yet being more constant and universal, they counter-ballance the latter
 even in practice, and are alone admitted in speculation as the standard
 of virtue and morality. They alone produce that particular feeling or
 sentiment, on which moral distinctions depend.
 
 As to the good or ill desert of virtue or vice, it is an evident
 consequence of the sentiments of pleasure or uneasiness. These
 sentiments produce love or hatred; and love or hatred, by the original
 constitution of human passion, is attended with benevolence or anger;
 that is, with a desire of making happy the person we love, and miserable
 the person we hate. We have treated of this more fully on another
 occasion.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. II OF GREATNESS OF MIND
 
 
 It may now be proper to illustrate this general system of morals, by
 applying it to particular instances of virtue and vice, and shewing how
 their merit or demerit arises from the four sources here explained. We
 shall begin with examining the passions of pride and humility, and
 shall consider the vice or virtue that lies in their excesses or just
 proportion. An excessive pride or overweaning conceit of ourselves is
 always esteemed vicious, and is universally hated; as modesty, or a just
 sense of our weakness, is esteemed virtuous, and procures the good-will
 of every-one. Of the four sources of moral distinctions, this is to
 be ascribed to the third; viz, the immediate agreeableness and
 disagreeableness of a quality to others, without any reflections on the
 tendency of that quality.
 
 In order to prove this, we must have recourse to two principles,
 which are very conspicuous in human nature. The first of these is the
 sympathy, and communication of sentiments and passions above-mentioned.
 So close and intimate is the correspondence of human souls, that
 no sooner any person approaches me, than he diffuses on me all his
 opinions, and draws along my judgment in a greater or lesser degree.
 And though, on many occasions, my sympathy with him goes not so far as
 entirely to change my sentiments, and way of thinking; yet it seldom
 is so weak as not to disturb the easy course of my thought, and give an
 authority to that opinion, which is recommended to me by his assent
 and approbation. Nor is it any way material upon what subject he and I
 employ our thoughts. Whether we judge of an indifferent person, or of my
 own character, my sympathy gives equal force to his decision: And even
 his sentiments of his own merit make me consider him in the same light,
 in which he regards himself.
 
 This principle of sympathy is of so powerful and insinuating a nature,
 that it enters into most of our sentiments and passions, and often takes
 place under the appearance of its contrary. For it is remarkable, that
 when a person opposes me in any thing, which I am strongly bent upon,
 and rouzes up my passion by contradiction, I have always a degree of
 sympathy with him, nor does my commotion proceed from any other origin.
 We may here observe an evident conflict or rencounter of opposite
 principles and passions. On the one side there is that passion or
 sentiment, which is natural to me; and it is observable, that the
 stronger this passion is, the greater is the commotion. There must also
 be some passion or sentiment on the other side; and this passion can
 proceed from nothing but sympathy. The sentiments of others can never
 affect us, but by becoming, in some measure, our own; in which case they
 operate upon us, by opposing and encreasing our passions, in the very
 same manner, as if they had been originally derived from our own temper
 and disposition. While they remain concealed in the minds of others,
 they can never have an influence upon us: And even when they are known,
 if they went no farther than the imagination, or conception; that
 faculty is so accustomed to objects of every different kind, that a mere
 idea, though contrary to our sentiments and inclinations, would never
 alone be able to affect us.
 
 The second principle I shall take notice of is that of comparison, or
 the variation of our judgments concerning ob jects, according to the
 proportion they bear to those with which we compare them. We judge more,
 of objects by comparison, than by their intrinsic worth and value; and
 regard every thing as mean, when set in opposition to what is superior
 of the same kind. But no comparison is more obvious than that with
 ourselves; and hence it is that on all occasions it takes place, and
 mixes with most of our passions. This kind of comparison is directly
 contrary to sympathy in its operation, as we have observed in treating
 of com passion and malice. [Book II. Part II. Sect. VIII.] IN ALL KINDS
 OF COMPARISON AN OBJECT MAKES US ALWAYS RECEIVE FROM ANOTHER, TO WHICH
 IT IS COMPARED, A SENSATION CONTRARY TO WHAT ARISES FROM ITSELF IN ITS
 DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE SURVEY. THE DIRECT SURVEY OF ANOTHER'S PLEASURE
 NATURALLY GIVES US PLEASURE; AND THEREFORE PRODUCES PAIN, WHEN COMPARed
 WITH OUR OWN. HIS PAIN, CONSIDERED IN ITSELF, IS PAIN FUL; BUT AUGMENTS
 THE IDEA OF OUR OWN HAPPINESS, AND GIVES US PLEASURE.
 
 Since then those principles of sympathy, and a comparison with
 ourselves, are directly contrary, it may be worth while to consider,
 what general rules can be formed, beside the particular temper of the
 person, for the prevalence of the one or the other. Suppose I am now
 in safety at land, and would willingly reap some pleasure from this
 consideration: I must think on the miserable condition of those who are
 at sea in a storm, and must endeavour to render this idea as strong
 and lively as possible, in order to make me more sensible of my own
 happiness. But whatever pains I may take, the comparison will never have
 an equal efficacy, as if I were really on the shore [Footnote 26], and
 saw a ship at a distance tossed by a tempest, and in danger every moment
 of perishing on a rock or sand-bank. But suppose this idea to become
 still more lively. Suppose the ship to be driven so near me, that I can
 perceive distinctly the horror, painted on the countenance of the seamen
 and passengers, hear their lamentable cries, see the dearest friends
 give their last adieu, or embrace with a resolution to perish in each
 others arms: No man has so savage a heart as to reap any pleasure from
 such a spectacle, or withstand the motions of the tenderest compassion
 and sympathy. It is evident, therefore, there is a medium in this case;
 and that if the idea be too feint, it has no influence by comparison;
 and on the other hand, if it be too strong, it operates on us entirely
 by sympathy, which is the contrary to comparison. Sympathy being the
 conversion of an idea into an impression, demands a greater force and
 vivacity in the idea than is requisite to comparison.
 
 
      [Footnote 26.  Suave mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis E
      terra magnum alterius spectare laborem; Non quia vexari
      quenquam eat jucunda voluptas, Sed quibus ipse malls caress
      qula cernere sauv' est. LUCRET.
 
      (There is something pleasant in watching, from dry land, the
      great difficulties another man is undergoing out on the high
      sea, with the winds lashing the waters. This is not because
      one derives delight from any man's distress, but because it
      is pleasurable to perceive from what troubles one is oneself
      free.)]
 
 All this is easily applied to the present subject. We sink very much in
 our own eyes, when in the presence of a great man, or one of a superior
 genius; and this humility makes a considerable ingredient in that
 respect, which we pay our superiors, according to our foregoing
 reasonings on that passion [Book II. Part II. Sect. X.]. Sometimes even
 envy and hatred arise from the comparison; but in the greatest part of
 men, it rests at respect and esteem. As sympathy has such a powerful
 influence on the human mind, it causes pride to have, in some measure,
 the same effect as merit; and by making us enter into those elevated
 sentiments, which the proud man entertains of himself, presents that
 comparison, which is so mortifying and disagreeable. Our judgment
 does not entirely accompany him in the flattering conceit, in which
 he pleases himself; but still is so shaken as to receive the idea it
 presents, and to give it an influence above the loose conceptions of
 the imagination. A man, who, in an idle humour, would form a notion of a
 person of a merit very much superior to his own, would not be mortified
 by that fiction: But when a man, whom we are really persuaded to be
 of inferior merit, is presented to us; if we observe in him any
 extraordinary degree of pride and self-conceit; the firm persuasion he
 has of his own merit, takes hold of the imagination, and diminishes us
 in our own eyes, in the same manner, as if he were really possessed of
 all the good qualities which he so liberally attributes to himself. Our
 idea is here precisely in that medium, which is requisite to make it
 operate on us by comparison. Were it accompanied with belief, and did
 the person appear to have the same merit, which he assumes to himself,
 it would have a contrary effect, and would operate on us by sympathy.
 The influence of that principle would then be superior to that of
 comparison, contrary to what happens where the person's merit seems
 below his pretensions.
 
 The necessary consequence of these principles is, that pride, or an
 over-weaning conceit of ourselves, must be vicious; since it
 causes uneasiness in all men, and presents them every moment with a
 disagreeable comparison. It is a trite observation in philosophy, and
 even in common life and conversation, that it is our own pride, which
 makes us so much displeased with the pride of other people; and that
 vanity becomes insupportable to us merely because we are vain. The gay
 naturally associate themselves with the gay, and the amorous with the
 amorous: But the proud never can endure the proud, and rather seek the
 company of those who are of an opposite disposition. As we are, all of
 us, proud in some degree, pride is universally blamed and condemned by
 all mankind; as having a natural tendency to cause uneasiness in others
 by means of comparison. And this effect must follow the more naturally,
 that those, who have an ill-grounded conceit of themselves, are for ever
 making those comparisons, nor have they any other method of supporting
 their vanity. A man of sense and merit is pleased with himself,
 independent of all foreign considerations: But a fool must always find
 some person, that is more foolish, in order to keep himself in good
 humour with his own parts and understanding.
 
 But though an over-weaning conceit of our own merit be vicious and
 disagreeable, nothing can be more laudable, than to have a value for
 ourselves, where we really have qualities that are valuable. The utility
 and advantage of any quality to ourselves is a source of virtue, as well
 as its agreeableness to others; and it is certain, that nothing is more
 useful to us in the conduct of life, than a due degree of pride, which
 makes us sensible of our own merit, and gives us a confidence and
 assurance in all our projects and enterprizes. Whatever capacity any
 one may be endowed with, it is entirely useless to him, if he be not
 acquainted with it, and form not designs suitable to it. It is requisite
 on all occasions to know our own force; and were it allowable to err on
 either side, it would be more advantageous to over-rate our merit, than
 to form ideas of it, below its just standard. Fortune commonly favours
 the bold and enterprizing; and nothing inspires us with more boldness
 than a good opinion of ourselves.
 
 Add to this, that though pride, or self-applause, be sometimes
 disagreeable to others, it is always agreeable to ourselves; as on the
 other hand, modesty, though it gives pleasure to every one, who observes
 it, produces often uneasiness in the person endowed with it. Now it has
 been observed, that our own sensations determine the vice and virtue of
 any quality, as well as those sensations, which it may excite in others.
 
 Thus self-satisfaction and vanity may not only be allowable, but
 requisite in a character. It is, however, certain, that good-breeding
 and decency require that we should avoid all signs and expressions,
 which tend directly to show that passion. We have, all of us, a
 wonderful partiality for ourselves, and were we always to give vent to
 our sentiments in this particular, we should mutually cause the greatest
 indignation in each other, not only by the immediate presence of so
 disagreeable a subject of comparison, but also by the contrariety of
 our judgments. In like manner, therefore, as we establish the laws
 of nature, in order to secure property in society, and prevent the
 opposition of self-interest; we establish the rules of good-breeding, in
 order to prevent the opposition of men's pride, and render conversation
 agreeable and inoffensive. Nothing is more disagreeable than a
 man's over-weaning conceit of himself: Every one almost has a strong
 propensity to this vice: No one can well distinguish in himself betwixt
 the vice and virtue, or be certain, that his esteem of his own merit is
 well-founded: For these reasons, all direct expressions of this passion
 are condemned; nor do we make any exception to this rule in favour of
 men of sense and merit. They are not allowed to do themselves justice
 openly, in words, no more than other people; and even if they show
 a reserve and secret doubt in doing themselves justice in their own
 thoughts, they will be more applauded. That impertinent, and almost
 universal propensity of men, to over-value themselves, has given us such
 a prejudice against self-applause, that we are apt to condemn it, by a
 general rule, wherever we meet with it; and it is with some difficulty
 we give a privilege to men of sense, even in their most secret thoughts.
 At least, it must be owned, that some disguise in this particular is
 absolutely requisite; and that if we harbour pride in our breasts, we
 must carry a fair outside, and have the appearance of modesty and mutual
 deference in all our conduct and behaviour. We must, on every occasion,
 be ready to prefer others to ourselves; to treat them with a kind of
 deference, even though they be our equals; to seem always the lowest
 and least in the company, where we are not very much distinguished above
 them: And if we observe these rules in our conduct, men will have
 more indulgence for our secret sentiments, when we discover them in an
 oblique manner.
 
 I believe no one, who has any practice of the world, and can penetrate
 into the inward sentiments of men, will assert, that the humility, which
 good-breeding and decency require of us, goes beyond the outside, or
 that a thorough sincerity in this particular is esteemed a real part
 of our duty. On the contrary, we may observe, that a genuine and hearty
 pride, or self-esteem, if well concealed and well founded, is essential
 to the character of a man of honour, and that there is no quality of the
 mind, which is more indispensibly requisite to procure the esteem
 and approbation of mankind. There are certain deferences and mutual
 submissions, which custom requires of the different ranks of men towards
 each other; and whoever exceeds in this particular, if through interest,
 is accused of meanness; if through ignorance, of simplicity. It is
 necessary, therefore, to know our rank and station in the world, whether
 it be fixed by our birth, fortune, employments, talents or reputation.
 It is necessary to feel the sentiment and passion of pride in conformity
 to it, and to regulate our actions accordingly. And should it be said,
 that prudence may suffice to regulate our actions in this particular,
 without any real pride, I would observe, that here the object of
 prudence is to conform our actions to the general usage and custom; and,
 that it is impossible those tacit airs of superiority should ever have
 been established and authorized by custom, unless men were generally
 proud, and unless that passion were generally approved, when
 well-grounded.
 
 If we pass from common life and conversation to history, this reasoning
 acquires new force, when we observe, that all those great actions and
 sentiments, which have become the admiration of mankind, are founded on
 nothing but pride and self-esteem. Go, says Alexander the Great to his
 soldiers, when they refused to follow him to the Indies, go tell your
 countrymen, that you left Alexander corn pleating the conquest of the
 world. This passage was always particularly admired by the prince of
 Conde, as we learn from St Evremond.
 
 "ALEXANDER," said that prince, "abandoned by his soldiers, among
 barbarians, not yet fully subdued, felt in himself such a dignity of
 right and of empire, that he coued not believe it possible any one
 coued refuse to obey him. Whether in Europe or in Asia, among Greeks or
 Persians, all was indifferent to him: Wherever he found men, he fancied
 he found subjects."
 
 In general we may observe, that whatever we call heroic virtue, and
 admire under the character of greatness and elevation of mind, is either
 nothing but a steady and wellestablished pride and self-esteem, or
 partakes largely of that passion. Courage, intrepidity, ambition, love
 of glory, magnanimity, and all the other shining virtues of that kind,
 have plainly a strong mixture of self-esteem in them, and derive a great
 part of their merit from that origin. Accordingly we find, that many
 religious declaimers decry those virtues as purely pagan and natural,
 and represent to us the excellency of the Christian religion, which
 places humility in the rank of virtues, and corrects the judgment of the
 world, and even of philosophers, who so generally admire all the efforts
 of pride and ambition. Whether this virtue of humility has been rightly
 understood, I shall not pretend to determine. I am content with the
 concession, that the world naturally esteems a well-regulated pride,
 which secretly animates our conduct, without breaking out into such
 indecent expressions of vanity, as many offend the vanity of others.
 
 The merit of pride or self-esteem is derived from two circumstances,
 viz, its utility and its agreeableness to ourselves; by which it
 capacitates us for business, and, at the same time, gives us an
 immediate satisfaction. When it goes beyond its just bounds, it loses
 the first advantage, and even becomes prejudicial; which is the reason
 why we condemn an extravagant pride and ambition, however regulated by
 the decorums of good-breeding and politeness. But as such a passion is
 still agreeable, and conveys an elevated and sublime sensation to the
 person, who is actuated by it, the sympathy with that satisfaction
 diminishes considerably the blame, which naturally attends its dangerous
 influence on his conduct and behaviour. Accordingly we may observe, that
 an excessive courage and magnanimity, especially when it displays itself
 under the frowns of fortune, contributes in a great measure, to
 the character of a hero, and will render a person the admiration of
 posterity; at the same time, that it ruins his affairs, and leads him
 into dangers and difficulties, with which otherwise he would never have
 been acquainted.
 
 Heroism, or military glory, is much admired by the generality of
 mankind. They consider it as the most sublime kind of merit. Men of
 cool reflection are not so sanguine in their praises of it. The infinite
 confusions and disorder, which it has caused in the world, diminish much
 of its merit in their eyes. When they would oppose the popular notions
 on this head, they always paint out the evils, which this supposed
 virtue has produced in human society; the subversion of empires, the
 devastation of provinces, the sack of cities. As long as these are
 present to us, we are more inclined to hate than admire the ambition
 of heroes. But when we fix our view on the person himself, who is the
 author of all this mischief, there is something so dazzling in his
 character, the mere contemplation of it so elevates the mind, that we
 cannot refuse it our admiration. The pain, which we receive from its
 tendency to the prejudice of society, is over-powered by a stronger and
 more immediate sympathy.
 
 Thus our explication of the merit or demerit, which attends the
 degrees of pride or self-esteem, may serve as a strong argument for the
 preceding hypothesis, by shewing the effects of those principles
 above explained in all the variations of our judgments concerning that
 passion. Nor will this reasoning be advantageous to us only by shewing,
 that the distinction of vice and virtue arises from the four principles
 of the advantage and of the pleasure of the person himself, and of
 others: But may also afford us a strong proof of some under-parts of
 that hypothesis.
 
 No one, who duly considers of this matter, will make any scruple of
 allowing, that any piece of in-breeding, or any expression of pride
 and haughtiness, is displeasing to us, merely because it shocks our
 own pride, and leads us by sympathy into a comparison, which causes the
 disagreeable passion of humility. Now as an insolence of this kind
 is blamed even in a person who has always been civil to ourselves in
 particular; nay, in one, whose name is only known to us in history; it
 follows, that our disapprobation proceeds from a sympathy with others,
 and from the reflection, that such a character is highly displeasing
 and odious to every one, who converses or has any intercourse with
 the person possest of it. We sympathize with those people in their
 uneasiness; and as their uneasiness proceeds in part from a sympathy
 with the person who insults them, we may here observe a double rebound
 of the sympathy; which is a principle very similar to what we have
 observed. [Book II. Part II. Sect. V.]
 
 
 
 
 SECT. III OF GOODNESS AND BENEVOLENCE
 
 
 Having thus explained the origin of that praise and approbation, which
 attends every thing we call great in human affections; we now proceed to
 give an account of their goodness, and shew whence its merit is derived.
 
 When experience has once given us a competent knowledge of human
 affairs, and has taught us the proportion they bear to human passion, we
 perceive, that the generosity of men is very limited, and that it seldom
 extends beyond their friends and family, or, at most, beyond their
 native country. Being thus acquainted with the nature of man, we expect
 not any impossibilities from him; but confine our view to that narrow
 circle, in which any person moves, in order to form a judgment of his
 moral character. When the natural tendency of his passions leads him
 to be serviceable and useful within his sphere, we approve of his
 character, and love his person, by a sympathy with the sentiments of
 those, who have a more particular connexion with him. We are quickly
 obliged to forget our own interest in our judgments of this kind, by
 reason of the perpetual contradictions, we meet with in society and
 conversation, from persons that are not placed in the same situation,
 and have not the same interest with ourselves. The only point of
 view, in which our sentiments concur with those of others, is, when we
 consider the tendency of any passion to the advantage or harm of
 those, who have any immediate connexion or intercourse with the person
 possessed of it. And though this advantage or harm be often very remote
 from ourselves, yet sometimes it is very near us, and interests us
 strongly by sympathy. This concern we readily extend to other cases,
 that are resembling; and when these are very remote, our sympathy
 is proportionably weaker, and our praise or blame fainter and more
 doubtful. The case is here the same as in our judgments concerning
 external bodies. All objects seem to diminish by their distance: But
 though the appearance of objects to our senses be the original standard,
 by which we judge of them, yet we do not say, that they actually
 diminish by the distance; but correcting the appearance by reflection,
 arrive at a more constant and established judgment concerning them.
 In like manner, though sympathy be much fainter than our concern for
 ourselves, and a sympathy with persons remote from us much fainter
 than that with persons near and contiguous; yet we neglect all these
 differences in our calm judgments concerning the characters of
 men. Besides, that we ourselves often change our situation in this
 particular, we every day meet with persons, who are in a different
 situation from ourselves, and who coued never converse with us on any
 reasonable terms, were we to remain constantly in that situation and
 point of view, which is peculiar to us. The intercourse of sentiments,
 therefore, in society and conversation, makes us form some general
 inalterable standard, by which we may approve or disapprove of
 characters and manners. And though the heart does not always take part
 with those general notions, or regulate its love and hatred by them, yet
 are they sufficient for discourse, and serve all our purposes m company,
 in the pulpit, on the theatre, and in the schools.
 
 From these principles we may easily account for that merit, which
 is commonly ascribed to generosity, humanity, compassion, gratitude,
 friendship, fidelity, zeal, disinterestedness, liberality, and all those
 other qualities, which form the character of good and benevolent. A
 propensity to the tender passions makes a man agreeable and useful
 in all the parts of life; and gives a just direction to all his other
 quailties, which otherwise may become prejudicial to society. Courage
 and ambition, when not regulated by benevolence, are fit only to make
 a tyrant and public robber. It is the same case with judgment and
 capacity, and all the qualities of that kind. They are indifferent in
 themselves to the interests of society, and have a tendency to the
 good or ill of mankind, according as they are directed by these other
 passions.
 
 As Love is immediately agreeable to the person, who is actuated by it,
 and hatred immediately disagreeable; this may also be a considerable
 reason, why we praise all the passions that partake of the former, and
 blame all those that have any considerable share of the latter. It is
 certain we are infinitely touched with a tender sentiment, as well
 as with a great one. The tears naturally start in our eyes at the
 conception of it; nor can we forbear giving a loose to the same
 tenderness towards the person who exerts it. All this seems to me a
 proof, that our approbation has, in those cases, an origin different
 from the prospect of utility and advantage, either to ourselves or
 others. To which we may add, that men naturally, without reflection,
 approve of that character, which is most like their own. The man of a
 mild disposition and tender affections, in forming a notion of the most
 perfect virtue, mixes in it more of benevolence and humanity, than
 the man of courage and enterprize, who naturally looks upon a certain
 elevation of mind as the most accomplished character. This must
 evidently proceed from an immediate sympathy, which men have with
 characters similar to their own. They enter with more warmth into such
 sentiments, and feel more sensibly the pleasure, which arises from them.
 
 It is remarkable, that nothing touches a man of humanity more than any
 instance of extraordinary delicacy in love or friendship, where a person
 is attentive to the smallest concerns of his friend, and is willing
 to sacrifice to them the most considerable interest of his own. Such
 delicacies have little influence on society; because they make us regard
 the greatest trifles: But they are the more engaging, the more minute
 the concern is, and are a proof of the highest merit in any one, who is
 capable of them. The passions are so contagious, that they pass with the
 greatest facility from one person to another, and produce correspondent
 movements in all human breasts. Where friendship appears in very signal
 instances, my heart catches the same passion, and is warmed by those
 warm sentiments, that display themselves before me. Such agreeable
 movements must give me an affection to every one that excites them.
 This is the case with every thing that is agreeable in any person. The
 transition from pleasure to love is easy: But the transition must here
 be still more easy; since the agreeable sentiment, which is excited by
 sympathy, is love itself; and there is nothing required but to change
 the object.
 
 Hence the peculiar merit of benevolence in all its shapes and
 appearances. Hence even its weaknesses are virtuous and amiable; and a
 person, whose grief upon the loss of a friend were excessive, would be
 esteemed upon that account. His tenderness bestows a merit, as it does a
 pleasure, on his melancholy.
 
 We are not, however, to imagine, that all the angry passions are
 vicious, though they are disagreeable. There is a certain indulgence due
 to human nature in this respect. Anger and hatred are passions
 inherent in Our very frame and constitutions. The want of them, on some
 occasions, may even be a proof of weakness and imbecillity. And where
 they appear only in a low degree, we not only excuse them because they
 are natural; but even bestow our applauses on them, because they are
 inferior to what appears in the greatest part of mankind.
 
 Where these angry passions rise up to cruelty, they form the most
 detested of all vices. All the pity and concern which we have for the
 miserable sufferers by this vice, turns against the person guilty of
 it, and produces a stronger hatred than we are sensible of on any other
 occasion. Even when the vice of inhumanity rises not to this extreme
 degree, our sentiments concerning it are very much influenced by
 reflections on the harm that results from it. And we may observe in
 general, that if we can find any quality in a person, which renders him
 incommodious to those, who live and converse with him, we always allow
 it to be a fault or blemish, without any farther examination. On the
 other hand, when we enumerate the good qualities of any person, we
 always mention those parts of his character, which render him a safe
 companion, an easy friend, a gentle master, an agreeable husband, or an
 indulgent father. We consider him with all his relations in society; and
 love or hate him, according as he affects those, who have any immediate
 intercourse with him. And it is a most certain rule, that if there be
 no relation of life, in which I coued not wish to stand to a particular
 person, his character must so far be allowed to be perfect. If he be
 as little wanting to himself as to others, his character is entirely
 perfect. This is the ultimate test of merit and virtue.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. IV OF NATURAL ABILITIES
 
 
 No distinction is more usual in all systems of ethics, than that betwixt
 natural abilities and moral virtues; where the former are placed on the
 same footing with bodily endowments, and are supposed to have no merit
 or moral worth annexed to them. Whoever considers the matter accurately,
 will find, that a dispute upon this head would be merely a dispute of
 words, and that though these qualities are not altogether of the same
 kind, yet they agree in the most material circumstances. They are both
 of them equally mental qualities: And both of them equally produce
 pleasure; and have of course an equal tendency to procure the love
 and esteem of mankind. There are few, who are not as jealous of their
 character, with regard to sense and knowledge, as to honour and courage;
 and much more than with regard to temperance and sobriety. Men are even
 afraid of passing for goodnatured; lest that should be taken for want
 of understanding: And often boast of more debauches than they have been
 really engaged in, to give themselves airs of fire and spirit. In short,
 the figure a man makes in the world, the reception he meets with in
 company, the esteem paid him by his acquaintance; all these advantages
 depend almost as much upon his good sense and judgment, as upon any
 other part of his character. Let a man have the best intentions in the
 world, and be the farthest from all injustice and violence, he will
 never be able to make himself be much regarded without a moderate
 share, at least, of parts and understanding. Since then natural
 abilities, though, perhaps, inferior, yet are on the same footing, both
 as to their causes and effects, with those qualities which we call moral
 virtues, why should we make any distinction betwixt them?
 
 Though we refuse to natural abilities the title of virtues, we must
 allow, that they procure the love and esteem of mankind; that they give
 a new lustre to the other virtues; and that a man possessed of them is
 much more intitled to our good-will and services, than one entirely
 void of them. It may, indeed, be pretended that the sentiment of
 approbation, which those qualities produce, besides its being inferior,
 is also somewhat different from that, which attends the other virtues.
 But this, in my opinion, is not a sufficient reason for excluding them
 from the catalogue of virtues. Each of the virtues, even benevolence,
 justice, gratitude, integrity, excites a different sentiment or feeling
 in the spectator. The characters of Caesar and Cato, as drawn by
 Sallust, are both of them virtuous, in the strictest sense of the word;
 but in a different way: Nor are the sentiments entirely the same, which
 arise from them. The one produces love; the other esteem: The one is
 amiable; the other awful: We could wish to meet with the one character
 in a friend; the other character we would be ambitious of in ourselves.
 In like manner, the approbation which attends natural abilities, may be
 somewhat different to the feeling from that, which arises from the other
 virtues, without making them entirely of a different species. And indeed
 we may observe, that the natural abilities, no more than the other
 virtues, produce not, all of them, the same kind of approbation. Good
 sense and genius beget esteem: Wit and humour excite love.
 
 
      [Footnote 27  Love and esteem are at the bottom the same
      passions, and arise from like causes. The qualities, that
      produce both, are agreeable, and give pleasure. But where
      this pleasure is severe and serious; or where its object is
      great, and makes a strong impression; or where it produces
      any degree of humility and awe: In all these cases, the
      passion, which arises from the pleasure, is more properly
      denominated esteem than love. Benevolence attends both: But
      is connected with love in a more eminent degree.]
 
 Those, who represent the distinction betwixt natural abilities and
 moral virtues as very material, may say, that the former are entirely
 involuntary, and have therefore no merit attending them, as having no
 dependance on liberty and free-will. But to this I answer, first, that
 many of those qualities, which all moralists, especially the antients,
 comprehend under the title of moral virtues, are equally involuntary and
 necessary, with the qualities of the judgment and imagination. Of this
 nature are constancy, fortitude, magnanimity; and, in short, all the
 qualities which form the great man. I might say the same, in some
 degree, of the others; it being almost impossible for the mind to
 change its character in any considerable article, or cure itself of a
 passionate or splenetic temper, when they are natural to it. The greater
 degree there is of these blameable qualities, the more vicious they
 become, and yet they are the less voluntary. Secondly, I would have
 anyone give me a reason, why virtue and vice may not be involuntary, as
 well as beauty and deformity. These moral distinctions arise from the
 natural distinctions of pain and pleasure; and when we receive those
 feelings from the general consideration of any quality or character,
 we denominate it vicious or virtuous. Now I believe no one will assert,
 that a quality can never produce pleasure or pain to the person who
 considers it, unless it be perfectly voluntary in the person who
 possesses it. Thirdly, As to free-will, we have shewn that it has no
 place with regard to the actions, no more than the qualities of men. It
 is not a just consequence, that what is voluntary is free. Our actions
 are more voluntary than our judgments; but we have not more liberty in
 the one than in the other.
 
 But though this distinction betwixt voluntary and involuntary be not
 sufficient to justify the distinction betwixt natural abilities and
 moral virtues, yet the former distinction will afford us a plausible
 reason, why moralists have invented the latter. Men have observed, that
 though natural abilities and moral qualities be in the main on the
 same footing, there is, however, this difference betwixt them, that the
 former are almost invariable by any art or industry; while the latter,
 or at least, the actions, that proceed from them, may be changed by the
 motives of rewards and punishments, praise and blame. Hence legislators,
 and divines, and moralists, have principally applied themselves to the
 regulating these voluntary actions, and have endeavoured to produce
 additional motives, for being virtuous in that particular. They
 knew, that to punish a man for folly, or exhort him to be prudent and
 sagacious, would have but little effect; though the same punishments
 and exhortations, with regard to justice and injustice, might have a
 considerable influence. But as men, in common life and conversation,
 do not carry those ends in view, but naturally praise or blame whatever
 pleases or displeases them, they do not seem much to regard this
 distinction, but consider prudence under the character of virtue as well
 as benevolence, and penetration as well as justice. Nay, we find, that
 all moralists, whose judgment is not perverted by a strict adherence
 to a system, enter into the same way of thinking; and that the antient
 moralists in particular made no scruple of placing prudence at the head
 of the cardinal virtues. There is a sentiment of esteem and approbation,
 which may be excited, in some degree, by any faculty of the mind, in its
 perfect state and condition; and to account for this sentiment is the
 business of Philosophers. It belongs to Grammarians to examine what
 qualities are entitled to the denomination of virtue; nor will they
 find, upon trial, that this is so easy a task, as at first sight they
 may be apt to imagine.
 
 The principal reason why natural abilities are esteemed, is because of
 their tendency to be useful to the person, who is possessed of them.
 It is impossible to execute any design with success, where it is not
 conducted with prudence and discretion; nor will the goodness of our
 intentions alone suffice to procure us a happy issue to our enterprizes.
 Men are superior to beasts principally by the superiority of their
 reason; and they are the degrees of the same faculty, which set such an
 infinite difference betwixt one man and another. All the advantages of
 art are owing to human reason; and where fortune is not very capricious,
 the most considerable part of these advantages must fall to the share of
 the prudent and sagacious.
 
 When it is asked, whether a quick or a slow apprehension be most
 valuable? whether one, that at first view penetrates into a subject, but
 can perform nothing upon study; or a contrary character, which must
 work out every thing by dint of application? whether a clear head, or
 a copious invention? whether a profound genius, or a sure judgment? in
 short, what character, or peculiar understanding, is more excellent than
 another? It is evident we can answer none of these questions, without
 considering which of those qualities capacitates a man best for the
 world, and carries him farthest in any of his undertakings.
 
 There are many other qualities of the mind, whose merit is derived from
 the same origin, industry, perseverance, patience, activity, vigilance,
 application, constancy, with other virtues of that kind, which it will
 be easy to recollect, are esteemed valuable upon no other account,
 than their advantage in the conduct of life. It is the same case with
 temperance, frugality, economy, resolution: As on the other hand,
 prodigality, luxury, irresolution, uncertainty, are vicious, merely
 because they draw ruin upon us, and incapacitate us for business and
 action.
 
 As wisdom and good-sense are valued, because they are useful to the
 person possessed of them; so wit and eloquence are valued, because they
 are immediately agreeable to others. On the other hand, good humour is
 loved and esteemed, because it is immediately agreeable to the person
 himself. It is evident, that the conversation of a man of wit is very
 satisfactory; as a chearful good-humoured companion diffuses a joy over
 the whole company, from a sympathy with his gaiety. These qualities,
 therefore, being agreeable, they naturally beget love and esteem, and
 answer to all the characters of virtue.
 
 It is difficult to tell, on many occasions, what it is that renders
 one man's conversation so agreeable and entertaining, and another's so
 insipid and distasteful. As conversation is a transcript of the mind as
 well as books, the same qualities, which render the one valuable, must
 give us an esteem for the other. This we shall consider afterwards. In
 the mean time it may be affirmed in general, that all the merit a
 man may derive from his conversation (which, no doubt, may be very
 considerable) arises from nothing but the pleasure it conveys to those
 who are present.
 
 In this view, cleanliness is also to be regarded as a virtue; since it
 naturally renders us agreeable to others, and is a very considerable
 source of love and affection. No one will deny, that a negligence in
 this particular is a fault; and as faults are nothing but smaller vices,
 and this fault can have no other origin than the uneasy sensation, which
 it excites in others, we may in this instance, seemingly so trivial,
 dearly discover the origin of the moral distinction of vice and virtue
 in other instances.
 
 Besides all those qualities, which render a person lovely or valuable,
 there is also a certain JE-NE-SCAI-QUOI of agreeable and handsome, that
 concurs to the same effect. In this case, as well as in that of wit and
 eloquence, we must have recourse to a certain sense, which acts without
 reflection, and regards not the tendencies of qualities and characters.
 Some moralists account for all the sentiments of virtue by this sense.
 Their hypothesis is very plausible. Nothing but a particular enquiry can
 give the preference to any other hypothesis. When we find, that almost
 all the virtues have such particular tendencies; and also find, that
 these tendencies are sufficient alone to give a strong sentiment of
 approbation: We cannot doubt, after this, that qualities are approved
 of, in proportion to the advantage, which results from them.
 
 The decorum or indecorum of a quality, with regard to the age, or
 character, or station, contributes also to its praise or blame. This
 decorum depends, in a great measure, upon experience. It is usual to
 see men lose their levity, as they advance in years. Such a degree
 of gravity, therefore, and such years, are connected together in our
 thoughts. When we observe them separated in any person's character, this
 imposes a kind of violence on our imagination, and is disagreeable.
 
 That faculty of the soul, which, of all others, is of the least
 consequence to the character, and has the least virtue or vice in its
 several degrees, at the same time, that it admits of a great variety of
 degrees, is the memory. Unless it rise up to that stupendous height
 as to surprize us, or sink so low as, in some measure, to affect the
 judgment, we commonly take no notice of its variations, nor ever mention
 them to the praise or dispraise of any person. It is so far from being a
 virtue to have a good memory, that men generally affect to complain of
 a bad one; and endeavouring to persuade the world, that what they say
 is entirely of their own invention, sacrifice it to the praise of genius
 and judgment. Yet to consider the matter abstractedly, it would be
 difficult to give a reason, why the faculty of recalling past ideas with
 truth and clearness, should not have as much merit in it, as the
 faculty of placing our present ideas, in such an order, as to form true
 propositions and opinions. The reason of the difference certainly must
 be, that the memory is exerted without any sensation of pleasure or
 pain; and in all its middling degrees serves almost equally well in
 business and affairs. But the least variations in the judgment are
 sensibly felt in their consequences; while at the same time that faculty
 is never exerted in any eminent degree, without an extraordinary delight
 and satisfaction. The sympathy with this utility and pleasure bestows a
 merit on the understanding; and the absence of it makes us consider the
 memory as a faculty very indifferent to blame or praise.
 
 Before I leave this subject of natural abilities, I must observe, that,
 perhaps, one source of the esteem and affection, which attends them, is
 derived from the importance and weight, which they bestow on the person
 possessed of them. He becomes of greater consequence in life. His
 resolutions and actions affect a greater number of his fellow-creatures.
 Both his friendship and enmity are of moment. And it is easy to observe,
 that whoever is elevated, after this manner, above the rest of mankind,
 must excite in us the sentiments of esteem and approbation. Whatever is
 important engages our attention, fixes our thought, and is contemplated
 with satisfaction. The histories of kingdoms are more interesting than
 domestic stories: The histories of great empires more than those
 of small cities and principalities: And the histories of wars and
 revolutions more than those of peace and order. We sympathize with the
 persons that suffer, in all the various sentiments which belong to their
 fortunes. The mind is occupied by the multitude of the objects, and by
 the strong passions, that display themselves. And this occupation or
 agitation of the mind is commonly agreeable and amusing. The same theory
 accounts for the esteem and regard we pay to men of extraordinary parts
 and abilities. The good and ill of multitudes are connected with their
 actions. Whatever they undertake is important, and challenges our
 attention. Nothing is to be over-looked and despised, that regards them.
 And where any person can excite these sentiments, he soon acquires our
 esteem; unless other circumstances of his character render him odious
 and disagreeable.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. V SOME FARTHER REFLECTIONS CONCERNING THE NATURAL VIRTUES
 
 
 It has been observed, in treating of the passions, that pride
 and humility, love and hatred, are excited by any advantages or
 disadvantages of the mind, body, or fortune; and that these advantages
 or disadvantages have that effect by producing a separate impression of
 pain or pleasure. The pain or pleasure, which arises from the general
 survey or view of any action or quality of the mind, constitutes its
 vice or virtue, and gives rise to our approbation or blame, which is
 nothing but a fainter and more imperceptible love or hatred. We have
 assigned four different sources of this pain and pleasure; and in order
 to justify more fully that hypothesis, it may here be proper to observe,
 that the advantages or disadvantages of the body and of fortune, produce
 a pain or pleasure from the very same principles. The tendency of any
 object to be useful to the person possess d of it, or to others; to
 convey pleasure to him or to others; all these circumstances convey an
 immediate pleasure to the person, who considers the object, and command
 his love and approbation.
 
 To begin with the advantages of the body; we may observe a phaenomenon,
 which might appear somewhat trivial and ludicrous, if any thing coued be
 trivial, which fortified a conclusion of such importance, or ludicrous,
 which was employed in a philosophical reasoning. It is a general
 remark, that those we call good women's men, who have either signalized
 themselves by their amorous exploits, or whose make of body promises any
 extraordinary vigour of that kind, are well received by the fair sex,
 and naturally engage the affections even of those, whose virtue prevents
 any design of ever giving employment to those talents. Here it is
 evident, that the ability of such a person to give enjoyment, is the
 real source of that love and esteem he meets with among the females; at
 the same time that the women, who love and esteem him, have no prospect
 of receiving that enjoyment themselves, and can only be affected by
 means of their sympathy with one, that has a commerce of love with him.
 This instance is singular, and merits our attention.
 
 Another source of the pleasure we receive from considering bodily
 advantages, is their utility to the person himself, who is possessed of
 them. It is certain, that a considerable part of the beauty of men, as
 well as of other animals, consists in such a conformation of members, as
 we find by experience to be attended with strength and agility, and to
 capacitate the creature for any action or exercise. Broad shoulders,
 a lank belly, firm joints, taper legs; all these are beautiful in
 our species because they are signs of force and vigour, which being
 advantages we naturally sympathize with, they convey to the beholder a
 share of that satisfaction they produce in the possessor.
 
 So far as to the utility, which may attend any quality of the body. As
 to the immediate pleasure, it is certain, that an air of health, as well
 as of strength and agility, makes a considerable part of beauty; and
 that a sickly air in another is always disagreeable, upon account of
 that idea of pain and uneasiness, which it conveys to us. On the other
 hand, we are pleased with the regularity of our own features, though
 it be neither useful to ourselves nor others; and it is necessary at a
 distance, to make it convey to us any satisfaction. We commonly consider
 ourselves as we appear in the eyes of others, and sympathize with the
 advantageous sentiments they entertain with regard to us.
 
 How far the advantages of fortune produce esteem and approbation from
 the same principles, we may satisfy ourselves by reflecting on our
 precedent reasoning on that subject. We have observed, that our
 approbation of those, who are possess d of the advantages of fortune,
 may be ascribed to three different causes. First, To that immediate
 pleasure, which a rich man gives us, by the view of the beautiful
 cloaths, equipage, gardens, or houses, which he possesses. Secondly,
 To the advantage, which we hope to reap from him by his generosity and
 liberality. Thirdly, To the pleasure and advantage, which he himself
 reaps from his possessions, and which produce an agreeable sympathy in
 us. Whether we ascribe our esteem of the rich and great to one or all of
 these causes, we may clearly see the traces of those principles, which
 give rise to the sense of vice and virtue. I believe most people, at
 first sight, will be inclined to ascribe our esteem of the rich to
 self-interest, and the prospect of advantage. But as it is certain,
 that our esteem or deference extends beyond any prospect of advantage
 to ourselves, it is evident, that that sentiment must proceed from
 a sympathy with those, who are dependent on the person we esteem and
 respect, and who have an immediate connexion with him. We consider him
 as a person capable of contributing to the happiness or enjoyment of
 his fellow-creatures, whose sentiments, with regard to him, we naturally
 embrace. And this consideration will serve to justify my hypothesis
 in preferring the third principle to the other two, and ascribing our
 esteem of the rich to a sympathy with the pleasure and advantage, which
 they themselves receive from their possessions. For as even the other
 two principles cannot operate to a due extent, or account for all the
 phaenomena, without having recourse to a sympathy of one kind or other;
 it is much more natural to chuse that sympathy, which is immediate and
 direct, than that which is remote and indirect. To which we may add,
 that where the riches or power are very great, and render the person
 considerable and important in the world, the esteem attending them, may,
 in part, be ascribed to another source, distinct from these three,
 viz. their interesting the mind by a prospect of the multitude, and
 importance of their consequences: Though, in order to account for the
 operation of this principle, we must also have recourse to sympathy; as
 we have observed in the preceding section.
 
 It may not be amiss, on this occasion, to remark the flexibility of our
 sentiments, and the several changes they so readily receive from
 the objects, with which they are conjoined. All the sentiments of
 approbation, which attend any particular species of objects, have a
 great resemblance to each other, though derived from different sources;
 and, on the other hand, those sentiments, when directed to different
 objects, are different to the feeling, though derived from the same
 source. Thus the beauty of all visible objects causes a pleasure pretty
 much the same, though it be sometimes derived from the mere species and
 appearance of the objects; sometimes from sympathy, and an idea of their
 utility. In like manner, whenever we survey the actions and characters
 of men, without any particular interest in them, the pleasure, or pain,
 which arises from the survey (with some minute differences) is, in the
 main, of the same kind, though perhaps there be a great diversity in the
 causes, from which it is derived. On the other hand, a convenient house,
 and a virtuous character, cause not the same feeling of approbation;
 even though the source of our approbation be the same, and flow
 from sympathy and an idea of their utility. There is something very
 inexplicable in this variation of our feelings; but it is what we have
 experience of with regard to all our passions and sentiments.
 
 
 
 
 SECT. VI CONCLUSION OF THIS BOOK
 
 
 Thus upon the whole I am hopeful, that nothing is wanting to an accurate
 proof of this system of ethics. We are certain, that sympathy is a very
 powerful principle in human nature. We are also certain, that it has a
 great influence on our sense of beauty, when we regard external
 objects, as well as when we judge of morals. We find, that it has force
 sufficient to give us the strongest sentiments of approbation, when it
 operates alone, without the concurrence of any other principle; as in
 the cases of justice, allegiance, chastity, and good-manners. We may
 observe, that all the circumstances requisite for its operation are
 found in most of the virtues; which have, for the most part, a tendency
 to the good of society, or to that of the person possessed of them. If
 we compare all these circumstances, we shall not doubt, that sympathy is
 the chief source of moral distinctions; especially when we reflect, that
 no objection can be raised against this hypothesis in one case, which
 will not extend to all cases. Justice is certainly approved of for no
 other reason, than because it has a tendency to the public good: And the
 public good is indifferent to us, except so far as sympathy interests
 us in it. We may presume the like with regard to all the other virtues,
 which have a like tendency to the public good. They must derive all
 their merit from our sympathy with those, who reap any advantage from
 them: As the virtues, which have a tendency to the good of the person
 possessed of them, derive their merit from our sympathy with him.
 
 Most people will readily allow, that the useful qualities of the mind
 are virtuous, because of their utility. This way of thinking is so
 natural, and occurs on so many occasions, that few will make any scruple
 of admitting it. Now this being once admitted, the force of sympathy
 must necessarily be acknowledged. Virtue is considered as means to an
 end. Means to an end are only valued so far as the end is valued.
 But the happiness of strangers affects us by sympathy alone. To that
 principle, therefore, we are to ascribe the sentiment of approbation,
 which arises from the survey of all those virtues, that are useful
 to society, or to the person possessed of them. These form the most
 considerable part of morality.
 
 Were it proper in such a subject to bribe the reader's assent, or employ
 any thing but solid argument, we are here abundantly supplied with
 topics to engage the affections. All lovers of virtue (and such we
 all are in speculation, however we may degenerate in practice) must
 certainly be pleased to see moral distinctions derived from so noble a
 source, which gives us a just notion both of the generosity and capacity
 of human nature. It requires but very little knowledge of human affairs
 to perceive, that a sense of morals is a principle inherent in the soul,
 and one of the most powerful that enters into the composition. But this
 sense must certainly acquire new force, when reflecting on itself,
 it approves of those principles, from whence it is derived, and finds
 nothing but what is great and good in its rise and origin. Those who
 resolve the sense of morals into original instincts of the human mind,
 may defend the cause of virtue with sufficient authority; but want
 the advantage, which those possess, who account for that sense by an
 extensive sympathy with mankind. According to their system, not only
 virtue must be approved of, but also the sense of virtue: And not only
 that sense, but also the principles, from whence it is derived. So that
 nothing is presented on any side, but what is laudable and good.
 
 This observation may be extended to justice, and the other virtues of
 that kind. Though justice be artificial, the sense of its morality is
 natural. It is the combination of men, in a system of conduct, which
 renders any act of justice beneficial to society. But when once it has
 that tendency, we naturally approve of it; and if we did not so, it
 is impossible any combination or convention coued ever produce that
 sentiment.
 
 Most of the inventions of men are subject to change. They depend upon
 humour and caprice. They have a vogue for a time, and then sink into
 oblivion. It may, perhaps, be apprehended, that if justice were allowed
 to be a human invention, it must be placed on the same footing. But the
 cases are widely different. The interest, on which justice is founded,
 is the greatest imaginable, and extends to all times and places. It
 cannot possibly be served by any other invention. It is obvious, and
 discovers itself on the very first formation of society. All these
 causes render the rules of justice stedfast and immutable; at least,
 as immutable as human nature. And if they were founded on original
 instincts, coued they have any greater stability?
 
 The same system may help us to form a just notion of the happiness, as
 well as of the dignity of virtue, and may interest every principle
 of our nature in the embracing and cherishing that noble quality.
 Who indeed does not feel an accession of alacrity in his pursuits of
 knowledge and ability of every kind, when he considers, that besides the
 advantage, which immediately result from these acquisitions, they
 also give him a new lustre in the eyes of mankind, and are universally
 attended with esteem and approbation? And who can think any advantages
 of fortune a sufficient compensation for the least breach of the social
 virtues, when he considers, that not only his character with regard to
 others, but also his peace and inward satisfaction entirely depend upon
 his strict observance of them; and that a mind will never be able to
 bear its own survey, that has been wanting in its part to mankind and
 society? But I forbear insisting on this subject. Such reflections
 require a work a-part, very different from the genius of the present.
 The anatomist ought never to emulate the painter; nor in his accurate
 dissections and portraitures of the smaller parts of the human body,
 pretend to give his figures any graceful and engaging attitude or
 expression. There is even something hideous, or at least minute in the
 views of things, which he presents; and it is necessary the objects
 should be set more at a distance, and be more covered up from sight, to
 make them engaging to the eye and imagination. An anatomist, however,
 is admirably fitted to give advice to a painter; and it is even
 impracticable to excel in the latter art, without the assistance of the
 former. We must have an exact knowledge of the parts, their situation
 and connexion, before we can design with any elegance or correctness.
 And thus the most abstract speculations concerning human nature, however
 cold and unentertaining, become subservient to practical morality; and
 may render this latter science more correct in its precepts, and more
 persuasive in its exhortations.
 
 
 
 
 APPENDIX
 
 
 There is nothing I would more willingly lay hold of, than an opportunity
 of confessing my errors; and should esteem such a return to truth and
 reason to be more honourable than the most unerring judgment. A man,
 who is free from mistakes, can pretend to no praises, except from the
 justness of his understanding: But a man, who corrects his mistakes,
 shews at once the justness of his understanding, and the candour and
 ingenuity of his temper. I have not yet been so fortunate as to discover
 any very considerable mistakes in the reasonings delivered in
 the preceding volumes, except on one article: But I have found by
 experience, that some of my expressions have not been so well chosen,
 as to guard against all mistakes in the readers; and it is chiefly to
 remedy this defect, I have subjoined the following appendix.
 
 We can never be induced to believe any matter of fact, except where its
 cause, or its effect, is present to us; but what the nature is of that
 belief, which arises from the relation of cause and effect, few have
 had the curiosity to ask themselves. In my opinion, this dilemma is
 inevitable. Either the belief is some new idea, such as that of reality
 or existence, which we join to the simple conception of an object, or
 it is merely a peculiar feeling or sentiment. That it is not a new
 idea, annexed to the simple conception, may be evinced from these two
 arguments. First, We have no abstract idea of existence, distinguishable
 and separable from the idea of particular objects. It is impossible,
 therefore, that this idea of existence can be annexed to the idea of any
 object, or form the difference betwixt a simple conception and belief.
 Secondly, The mind has the command over all its ideas, and can separate,
 unite, mix, and vary them, as it pleases; so that if belief consisted
 merely in a new idea, annexed to the conception, it would be in a man's
 power to believe what he pleased. We may, therefore, conclude, that
 belief consists merely in a certain feeling or sentiment; in something,
 that depends not on the will, but must arise from certain determinate
 causes and principles, of which we are not masters. When we are
 convinced of any matter of fact, we do nothing but conceive it, along
 with a certain feeling, different from what attends the mere reveries
 of the imagination. And when we express our incredulity concerning any
 fact, we mean, that the arguments for the fact produce not that feeling.
 Did not the belief consist in a sentiment different from our mere
 conception, whatever objects were presented by the wildest imagination,
 would be on an equal footing with the most established truths founded on
 history and experience. There is nothing but the feeling, or sentiment,
 to distinguish the one from the other.
 
 This, therefore, being regarded as an undoubted truth, that belief is
 nothing but a peculiar feeling, different from the simple conception,
 the next question, that naturally occurs, is, what is the nature of
 this feeling, or sentiment, and whether it be analogous to any other
 sentiment of the human mind? This question is important. For if it be
 not analogous to any other sentiment, we must despair of explaining its
 causes, and must consider it as an original principle of the human mind.
 If it be analogous, we may hope to explain its causes from analogy,
 and trace it up to more general principles. Now that there is a greater
 firmness and solidity in the conceptions, which are the objects of
 conviction and assurance, than in the loose and indolent reveries of
 a castle-builder, every one will readily own. They strike upon us with
 more force; they are more present to us; the mind has a firmer hold of
 them, and is more actuated and moved by them. It acquiesces in them;
 and, in a manner, fixes and reposes itself on them. In short, they
 approach nearer to the impressions, which are immediately present to us;
 and are therefore analogous to many other operations of the mind.
 
 There is not, in my opinion, any possibility of evading this conclusion,
 but by asserting, that belief, beside the simple conception, consists in
 some impression or feeling, distinguishable from the conception. It does
 not modify the conception, and render it more present and intense: It
 is only annexed to it, after the same manner that will and desire
 are annexed to particular conceptions of good and pleasure. But the
 following considerations will, I hope, be sufficient to remove this
 hypothesis. First, It is directly contrary to experience, and our
 immediate consciousness. All men have ever allowed reasoning to be
 merely an operation of our thoughts or ideas; and however those ideas
 may be varied to the feeling, there is nothing ever enters into our
 conclusions but ideas, or our fainter conceptions. For instance; I hear
 at present a person's voice, whom I am acquainted with; and this sound
 comes from the next room. This impression of my senses immediately
 conveys my thoughts to the person, along with all the surrounding
 objects. I paint them out to myself as existent at present, with the
 same qualities and relations, that I formerly knew them possessed of.
 These ideas take faster hold of my mind, than the ideas of an inchanted
 castle. They are different to the feeling; but there is no distinct or
 separate impression attending them. It is the same case when I recollect
 the several incidents of a journey, or the events of any history. Every
 particular fact is there the object of belief. Its idea is modified
 differently from the loose reveries of a castle-builder: But no distinct
 impression attends every distinct idea, or conception of matter of fact.
 This is the subject of plain experience. If ever this experience can
 be disputed on any occasion, it is when the mind has been agitated with
 doubts and difficulties; and afterwards, upon taking the object in a new
 point of view, or being presented with a new argument, fixes and reposes
 itself in one settled conclusion and belief. In this case there is a
 feeling distinct and separate from the conception. The passage from
 doubt and agitation to tranquility and repose, conveys a satisfaction
 and pleasure to the mind. But take any other case. Suppose I see the
 legs and thighs of a person in motion, while some interposed object
 conceals the rest of his body. Here it is certain, the imagination
 spreads out the whole figure. I give him a head and shoulders, and
 breast and neck. These members I conceive and believe him to be
 possessed of. Nothing can be more evident, than that this whole
 operation is performed by the thought or imagination alone. The
 transition is immediate. The ideas presently strike us. Their customary
 connexion with the present impression, varies them and modifies them in
 a certain manner, but produces no act of the mind, distinct from this
 peculiarity of conception. Let any one examine his own mind, and he will
 evidently find this to be the truth.
 
 Secondly, Whatever may be the case, with regard to this distinct
 impression, it must be allowed, that the mind has a firmer hold, or
 more steady conception of what it takes to be matter of fact, than of
 fictions. Why then look any farther, or multiply suppositions without
 necessity?
 
 Thirdly, We can explain the causes of the firm conception, but not those
 of any separate impression. And not only so, but the causes of the firm
 conception exhaust the whole subject, and nothing is left to produce any
 other effect. An inference concerning a matter of fact is nothing but
 the idea of an object, that is frequently conjoined, or is associated
 with a present impression. This is the whole of it. Every part is
 requisite to explain, from analogy, the more steady conception; and
 nothing remains capable of producing any distinct impression.
 
 Fourthly, The effects of belief, in influencing the passions and
 imagination, can all be explained from the firm conception; and there
 is no occasion to have recourse to any other principle. These arguments,
 with many others, enumerated in the foregoing volumes, sufficiently
 prove, that belief only modifies the idea or conception; and renders
 it different to the feeling, without producing any distinct impression.
 Thus upon a general view of the subject, there appear to be two
 questions of importance, which we may venture to recommend to the
 consideration of philosophers, Whether there be any thing to distinguish
 belief from the simple conception beside the feeling of sentiment? And,
 Whether this feeling be any thing but a firmer conception, or a faster
 hold, that we take of the object?
 
 If, upon impartial enquiry, the same conclusion, that I have formed,
 be assented to by philosophers, the next business is to examine the
 analogy, which there is betwixt belief, and other acts of the mind, and
 find the cause of the firmness and strength of conception: And this I do
 not esteem a difficult task. The transition from a present impression,
 always enlivens and strengthens any idea. When any object is presented,
 the idea of its usual attendant immediately strikes us, as something
 real and solid. It is felt, rather than conceived, and approaches the
 impression, from which it is derived, in its force and influence. This I
 have proved at large. I cannot add any new arguments.
 
 I had entertained some hopes, that however deficient our theory of the
 intellectual world might be, it would be free from those contradictions,
 and absurdities, which seem to attend every explication, that human
 reason can give of the material world. But upon a more strict review of
 the section concerning personal identity, I find myself involved in
 such a labyrinth, that, I must confess, I neither know how to correct
 my former opinions, nor how to render them consistent. If this be not a
 good general reason for scepticism, it is at least a sufficient one (if
 I were not already abundantly supplied) for me to entertain a diffidence
 and modesty in all my decisions. I shall propose the arguments on both
 sides, beginning with those that induced me to deny the strict and
 proper identity and simplicity of a self or thinking being.
 
 When we talk of self or substance, we must have an idea annexed to
 these terms, otherwise they are altogether unintelligible. Every idea is
 derived from preceding impressions; and we have no impression of self
 or substance, as something simple and individual. We have, therefore, no
 idea of them in that sense.
 
 Whatever is distinct, is distinguishable; and whatever is
 distinguishable, is separable by the thought or imagination. All
 perceptions are distinct. They are, therefore, distinguishable, and
 separable, and may be conceived as separately existent, and may exist
 separately, without any contradiction or absurdity.
 
 When I view this table and that chimney, nothing is present to me but
 particular perceptions, which are of a like nature with all the other
 perceptions. This is the doctrine of philosophers. But this table, which
 is present to me, and the chimney, may and do exist separately. This is
 the doctrine of the vulgar, and implies no contradiction. There is no
 contradiction, therefore, in extending the same doctrine to all the
 perceptions.
 
 In general, the following reasoning seems satisfactory. All ideas are
 borrowed from preceding perceptions. Our ideas of objects, therefore,
 are derived from that source. Consequently no proposition can be
 intelligible or consistent with regard to objects, which is not so with
 regard to perceptions. But it is intelligible and consistent to say,
 that objects exist distinct and independent, without any common simple
 substance or subject of inhesion. This proposition, therefore, can never
 be absurd with regard to perceptions.
 
 When I turn my reflection on myself, I never can perceive this self
 without some one or more perceptions; nor can I ever perceive any thing
 but the perceptions. It is the composition of these, therefore, which
 forms the self. We can conceive a thinking being to have either many or
 few perceptions. Suppose the mind to be reduced even below the life
 of an oyster. Suppose it to have only one perception, as of thirst or
 hunger. Consider it in that situation. Do you conceive any thing but
 merely that perception? Have you any notion of self or substance? If
 not, the addition of other perceptions can never give you that notion.
 
 The annihilation, which some people suppose to follow upon death, and
 which entirely destroys this self, is nothing but an extinction of all
 particular perceptions; love and hatred, pain and pleasure, thought and
 sensation. These therefore must be the same with self; since the one
 cannot survive the other.
 
 Is self the same with substance? If it be, how can that question have
 place, concerning the subsistence of self, under a change of substance?
 If they be distinct, what is the difference betwixt them? For my part,
 I have a notion of neither, when conceived distinct from particular
 perceptions.
 
 Philosophers begin to be reconciled to the principle, that we have
 no idea of external substance, distinct from the ideas of particular
 qualities. This must pave the way for a like principle with regard to
 the mind, that we have no notion of it, distinct from the particular
 perceptions.
 
 So far I seem to be attended with sufficient evidence. But having thus
 loosened all our particular perceptions, when I proceed to explain
 the principle of connexion, which binds them together, and makes us
 attribute to them a real simplicity and identity; I am sensible, that my
 account is very defective, and that nothing but the seeming evidence
 of the precedent reasonings coued have induced me to receive it. If
 perceptions are distinct existences, they form a whole only by being
 connected together. But no connexions among distinct existences are
 ever discoverable by human understanding. We only feel a connexion or
 determination of the thought, to pass from one object to another. It
 follows, therefore, that the thought alone finds personal identity, when
 reflecting on the train of past perceptions, that compose a mind, the
 ideas of them are felt to be connected together, and naturally introduce
 each other. However extraordinary this conclusion may seem, it need not
 surprize us. Most philosophers seem inclined to think, that personal
 identity arises from consciousness; and consciousness is nothing but a
 reflected thought or perception. The present philosophy, therefore,
 has so far a promising aspect. But all my hopes vanish, when I come to
 explain the principles, that unite our successive perceptions in our
 thought or consciousness. I cannot discover any theory, which gives me
 satisfaction on this head.
 
 In short there are two principles, which I cannot render consistent; nor
 is it in my power to renounce either of them, viz, that all our distinct
 perceptions are distinct existences, and that the mind never perceives
 any real connexion among distinct existences. Did our perceptions either
 inhere in something simple and individual, or did the mind perceive some
 real connexion among them, there would be no difficulty in the case. For
 my part, I must plead the privilege of a sceptic, and confess, that this
 difficulty is too hard for my understanding. I pretend not, however, to
 pronounce it absolutely insuperable. Others, perhaps, or myself,
 upon more mature reflections, may discover some hypothesis, that will
 reconcile those contradictions.
 
 I shall also take this opportunity of confessing two other errors of
 less importance, which more mature reflection has discovered to me in my
 reasoning. The first may be found in Vol. I. page 106. where I say, that
 the distance betwixt two bodies is known, among other things, by the
 angles, which the rays of light flowing from the bodies make with each
 other. It is certain, that these angles are not known to the mind, and
 consequently can never discover the distance. The second error may be
 found in Vol. I. page 144 where I say, that two ideas of the same object
 can only be different by their different degrees of force and vivacity.
 I believe there are other differences among ideas, which cannot properly
 be comprehended under these terms. Had I said, that two ideas of the
 same object can only be different by their different feeling, I should
 have been nearer the truth.

 SECTION I.
 
 OF THE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF PHILOSOPHY.
 
 
 1. Moral philosophy, or the science of human nature, may be treated
 after two different manners; each of which has its peculiar merit, and
 may contribute to the entertainment, instruction, and reformation of
 mankind. The one considers man chiefly as born for action; and as
 influenced in his measures by taste and sentiment; pursuing one object,
 and avoiding another, according to the value which these objects seem to
 possess, and according to the light in which they present themselves. As
 virtue, of all objects, is allowed to be the most valuable, this species
 of philosophers paint her in the most amiable colours; borrowing all
 helps from poetry and eloquence, and treating their subject in an easy
 and obvious manner, and such as is best fitted to please the
 imagination, and engage the affections. They select the most striking
 observations and instances from common life; place opposite characters
 in a proper contrast; and alluring us into the paths of virtue by the
 views of glory and happiness, direct our steps in these paths by the
 soundest precepts and most illustrious examples. They make us _feel_ the
 difference between vice and virtue; they excite and regulate our
 sentiments; and so they can but bend our hearts to the love of probity
 and true honour, they think, that they have fully attained the end of
 all their labours.
 
 2. The other species of philosophers consider man in the light of a
 reasonable rather than an active being, and endeavour to form his
 understanding more than cultivate his manners. They regard human nature
 as a subject of speculation; and with a narrow scrutiny examine it, in
 order to find those principles, which regulate our understanding, excite
 our sentiments, and make us approve or blame any particular object,
 action, or behaviour. They think it a reproach to all literature, that
 philosophy should not yet have fixed, beyond controversy, the foundation
 of morals, reasoning, and criticism; and should for ever talk of truth
 and falsehood, vice and virtue, beauty and deformity, without being able
 to determine the source of these distinctions. While they attempt this
 arduous task, they are deterred by no difficulties; but proceeding from
 particular instances to general principles, they still push on their
 enquiries to principles more general, and rest not satisfied till they
 arrive at those original principles, by which, in every science, all
 human curiosity must be bounded. Though their speculations seem
 abstract, and even unintelligible to common readers, they aim at the
 approbation of the learned and the wise; and think themselves
 sufficiently compensated for the labour of their whole lives, if they
 can discover some hidden truths, which may contribute to the instruction
 of posterity.
 
 3. It is certain that the easy and obvious philosophy will always, with
 the generality of mankind, have the preference above the accurate and
 abstruse; and by many will be recommended, not only as more agreeable,
 but more useful than the other. It enters more into common life; moulds
 the heart and affections; and, by touching those principles which
 actuate men, reforms their conduct, and brings them nearer to that model
 of perfection which it describes. On the contrary, the abstruse
 philosophy, being founded on a turn of mind, which cannot enter into
 business and action, vanishes when the philosopher leaves the shade, and
 comes into open day; nor can its principles easily retain any influence
 over our conduct and behaviour. The feelings of our heart, the agitation
 of our passions, the vehemence of our affections, dissipate all its
 conclusions, and reduce the profound philosopher to a mere plebeian.
 
 4. This also must be confessed, that the most durable, as well as
 justest fame, has been acquired by the easy philosophy, and that
 abstract reasoners seem hitherto to have enjoyed only a momentary
 reputation, from the caprice or ignorance of their own age, but have not
 been able to support their renown with more equitable posterity. It is
 easy for a profound philosopher to commit a mistake in his subtile
 reasonings; and one mistake is the necessary parent of another, while he
 pushes on his consequences, and is not deterred from embracing any
 conclusion, by its unusual appearance, or its contradiction to popular
 opinion. But a philosopher, who purposes only to represent the common
 sense of mankind in more beautiful and more engaging colours, if by
 accident he falls into error, goes no farther; but renewing his appeal
 to common sense, and the natural sentiments of the mind, returns into
 the right path, and secures himself from any dangerous illusions. The
 fame of Cicero flourishes at present; but that of Aristotle is utterly
 decayed. La Bruyere passes the seas, and still maintains his reputation:
 But the glory of Malebranche is confined to his own nation, and to his
 own age. And Addison, perhaps, will be read with pleasure, when Locke
 shall be entirely forgotten.
 
 The mere philosopher is a character, which is commonly but little
 acceptable in the world, as being supposed to contribute nothing either
 to the advantage or pleasure of society; while he lives remote from
 communication with mankind, and is wrapped up in principles and notions
 equally remote from their comprehension. On the other hand, the mere
 ignorant is still more despised; nor is any thing deemed a surer sign of
 an illiberal genius in an age and nation where the sciences flourish,
 than to be entirely destitute of all relish for those noble
 entertainments. The most perfect character is supposed to lie between
 those extremes; retaining an equal ability and taste for books, company,
 and business; preserving in conversation that discernment and delicacy
 which arise from polite letters; and in business, that probity and
 accuracy which are the natural result of a just philosophy. In order to
 diffuse and cultivate so accomplished a character, nothing can be more
 useful than compositions of the easy style and manner, which draw not
 too much from life, require no deep application or retreat to be
 comprehended, and send back the student among mankind full of noble
 sentiments and wise precepts, applicable to every exigence of human
 life. By means of such compositions, virtue becomes amiable, science
 agreeable, company instructive, and retirement entertaining.
 
 Man is a reasonable being; and as such, receives from science his proper
 food and nourishment: But so narrow are the bounds of human
 understanding, that little satisfaction can be hoped for in this
 particular, either from the extent of security or his acquisitions. Man
 is a sociable, no less than a reasonable being: But neither can he
 always enjoy company agreeable and amusing, or preserve the proper
 relish for them. Man is also an active being; and from that disposition,
 as well as from the various necessities of human life, must submit to
 business and occupation: But the mind requires some relaxation, and
 cannot always support its bent to care and industry. It seems, then,
 that nature has pointed out a mixed kind of life as most suitable to the
 human race, and secretly admonished them to allow none of these biasses
 to _draw_ too much, so as to incapacitate them for other occupations and
 entertainments. Indulge your passion for science, says she, but let your
 science be human, and such as may have a direct reference to action and
 society. Abstruse thought and profound researches I prohibit, and will
 severely punish, by the pensive melancholy which they introduce, by the
 endless uncertainty in which they involve you, and by the cold reception
 which your pretended discoveries shall meet with, when communicated. Be
 a philosopher; but, amidst all your philosophy, be still a man.
 
 5. Were the generality of mankind contented to prefer the easy
 philosophy to the abstract and profound, without throwing any blame or
 contempt on the latter, it might not be improper, perhaps, to comply
 with this general opinion, and allow every man to enjoy, without
 opposition, his own taste and sentiment. But as the matter is often
 carried farther, even to the absolute rejecting of all profound
 reasonings, or what is commonly called _metaphysics_, we shall now
 proceed to consider what can reasonably be pleaded in their behalf.
 
 We may begin with observing, that one considerable advantage, which
 results from the accurate and abstract philosophy, is, its subserviency
 to the easy and humane; which, without the former, can never attain a
 sufficient degree of exactness in its sentiments, precepts, or
 reasonings. All polite letters are nothing but pictures of human life in
 various attitudes and situations; and inspire us with different
 sentiments, of praise or blame, admiration or ridicule, according to the
 qualities of the object, which they set before us. An artist must be
 better qualified to succeed in this undertaking, who, besides a delicate
 taste and a quick apprehension, possesses an accurate knowledge of the
 internal fabric, the operations of the understanding, the workings of
 the passions, and the various species of sentiment which discriminate
 vice and virtue. How painful soever this inward search or enquiry may
 appear, it becomes, in some measure, requisite to those, who would
 describe with success the obvious and outward appearances of life and
 manners. The anatomist presents to the eye the most hideous and
 disagreeable objects; but his science is useful to the painter in
 delineating even a Venus or an Helen. While the latter employs all the
 richest colours of his art, and gives his figures the most graceful and
 engaging airs; he must still carry his attention to the inward structure
 of the human body, the position of the muscles, the fabric of the bones,
 and the use and figure of every part or organ. Accuracy is, in every
 case, advantageous to beauty, and just reasoning to delicate sentiment.
 In vain would we exalt the one by depreciating the other.
 
 Besides, we may observe, in every art or profession, even those which
 most concern life or action, that a spirit of accuracy, however
 acquired, carries all of them nearer their perfection, and renders them
 more subservient to the interests of society. And though a philosopher
 may live remote from business, the genius of philosophy, if carefully
 cultivated by several, must gradually diffuse itself throughout the
 whole society, and bestow a similar correctness on every art and
 calling. The politician will acquire greater foresight and subtility, in
 the subdividing and balancing of power; the lawyer more method and finer
 principles in his reasonings; and the general more regularity in his
 discipline, and more caution in his plans and operations. The stability
 of modern governments above the ancient, and the accuracy of modern
 philosophy, have improved, and probably will still improve, by similar
 gradations.
 
 6. Were there no advantage to be reaped from these studies, beyond the
 gratification of an innocent curiosity, yet ought not even this to be
 despised; as being one accession to those few safe and harmless
 pleasures, which are bestowed on human race. The sweetest and most
 inoffensive path of life leads through the avenues of science and
 learning; and whoever can either remove any obstructions in this way, or
 open up any new prospect, ought so far to be esteemed a benefactor to
 mankind. And though these researches may appear painful and fatiguing,
 it is with some minds as with some bodies, which being endowed with
 vigorous and florid health, require severe exercise, and reap a pleasure
 from what, to the generality of mankind, may seem burdensome and
 laborious. Obscurity, indeed, is painful to the mind as well as to the
 eye; but to bring light from obscurity, by whatever labour, must needs
 be delightful and rejoicing.
 
 But this obscurity in the profound and abstract philosophy, is objected
 to, not only as painful and fatiguing, but as the inevitable source of
 uncertainty and error. Here indeed lies the justest and most plausible
 objection against a considerable part of metaphysics, that they are not
 properly a science; but arise either from the fruitless efforts of human
 vanity, which would penetrate into subjects utterly inaccessible to the
 understanding, or from the craft of popular superstitions, which, being
 unable to defend themselves on fair ground, raise these intangling
 brambles to cover and protect their weakness. Chaced from the open
 country, these robbers fly into the forest, and lie in wait to break in
 upon every unguarded avenue of the mind, and overwhelm it with religious
 fears and prejudices. The stoutest antagonist, if he remit his watch a
 moment, is oppressed. And many, through cowardice and folly, open the
 gates to the enemies, and willingly receive them with reverence and
 submission, as their legal sovereigns.
 
 7. But is this a sufficient reason, why philosophers should desist from
 such researches, and leave superstition still in possession of her
 retreat? Is it not proper to draw an opposite conclusion, and perceive
 the necessity of carrying the war into the most secret recesses of the
 enemy? In vain do we hope, that men, from frequent disappointment, will
 at last abandon such airy sciences, and discover the proper province of
 human reason. For, besides, that many persons find too sensible an
 interest in perpetually recalling such topics; besides this, I say, the
 motive of blind despair can never reasonably have place in the sciences;
 since, however unsuccessful former attempts may have proved, there is
 still room to hope, that the industry, good fortune, or improved
 sagacity of succeeding generations may reach discoveries unknown to
 former ages. Each adventurous genius will still leap at the arduous
 prize, and find himself stimulated, rather that discouraged, by the
 failures of his predecessors; while he hopes that the glory of achieving
 so hard an adventure is reserved for him alone. The only method of
 freeing learning, at once, from these abstruse questions, is to enquire
 seriously into the nature of human understanding, and show, from an
 exact analysis of its powers and capacity, that it is by no means fitted
 for such remote and abstruse subjects. We must submit to this fatigue,
 in order to live at ease ever after: And must cultivate true metaphysics
 with some care, in order to destroy the false and adulterate. Indolence,
 which, to some persons, affords a safeguard against this deceitful
 philosophy, is, with others, overbalanced by curiosity; and despair,
 which, at some moments, prevails, may give place afterwards to sanguine
 hopes and expectations. Accurate and just reasoning is the only catholic
 remedy, fitted for all persons and all dispositions; and is alone able
 to subvert that abstruse philosophy and metaphysical jargon, which,
 being mixed up with popular superstition, renders it in a manner
 impenetrable to careless reasoners, and gives it the air of science
 and wisdom.
 
 8. Besides this advantage of rejecting, after deliberate enquiry, the
 most uncertain and disagreeable part of learning, there are many
 positive advantages, which result from an accurate scrutiny into the
 powers and faculties of human nature. It is remarkable concerning the
 operations of the mind, that, though most intimately present to us, yet,
 whenever they become the object of reflexion, they seem involved in
 obscurity; nor can the eye readily find those lines and boundaries,
 which discriminate and distinguish them. The objects are too fine to
 remain long in the same aspect or situation; and must be apprehended in
 an instant, by a superior penetration, derived from nature, and improved
 by habit and reflexion. It becomes, therefore, no inconsiderable part of
 science barely to know the different operations of the mind, to separate
 them from each other, to class them under their proper heads, and to
 correct all that seeming disorder, in which they lie involved, when made
 the object of reflexion and enquiry. This talk of ordering and
 distinguishing, which has no merit, when performed with regard to
 external bodies, the objects of our senses, rises in its value, when
 directed towards the operations of the mind, in proportion to the
 difficulty and labour, which we meet with in performing it. And if we
 can go no farther than this mental geography, or delineation of the
 distinct parts and powers of the mind, it is at least a satisfaction to
 go so far; and the more obvious this science may appear (and it is by no
 means obvious) the more contemptible still must the ignorance of it be
 esteemed, in all pretenders to learning and philosophy.
 
 Nor can there remain any suspicion, that this science is uncertain and
 chimerical; unless we should entertain such a scepticism as is entirely
 subversive of all speculation, and even action. It cannot be doubted,
 that the mind is endowed with several powers and faculties, that these
 powers are distinct from each other, that what is really distinct to the
 immediate perception may be distinguished by reflexion; and
 consequently, that there is a truth and falsehood in all propositions on
 this subject, and a truth and falsehood, which lie not beyond the
 compass of human understanding. There are many obvious distinctions of
 this kind, such as those between the will and understanding, the
 imagination and passions, which fall within the comprehension of every
 human creature; and the finer and more philosophical distinctions are no
 less real and certain, though more difficult to be comprehended. Some
 instances, especially late ones, of success in these enquiries, may give
 us a juster notion of the certainty and solidity of this branch of
 learning. And shall we esteem it worthy the labour of a philosopher to
 give us a true system of the planets, and adjust the position and order
 of those remote bodies; while we affect to overlook those, who, with so
 much success, delineate the parts of the mind, in which we are so
 intimately concerned?
 
 9. But may we not hope, that philosophy, if cultivated with care, and
 encouraged by the attention of the public, may carry its researches
 still farther, and discover, at least in some degree, the secret springs
 and principles, by which the human mind is actuated in its operations?
 Astronomers had long contented themselves with proving, from the
 phaenomena, the true motions, order, and magnitude of the heavenly
 bodies: Till a philosopher, at last, arose, who seems, from the happiest
 reasoning, to have also determined the laws and forces, by which the
 revolutions of the planets are governed and directed. The like has been
 performed with regard to other parts of nature. And there is no reason
 to despair of equal success in our enquiries concerning the mental
 powers and economy, if prosecuted with equal capacity and caution. It is
 probable, that one operation and principle of the mind depends on
 another; which, again, may be resolved into one more general and
 universal: And how far these researches may possibly be carried, it will
 be difficult for us, before, or even after, a careful trial, exactly to
 determine. This is certain, that attempts of this kind are every day
 made even by those who philosophize the most negligently: And nothing
 can be more requisite than to enter upon the enterprize with thorough
 care and attention; that, if it lie within the compass of human
 understanding, it may at last be happily achieved; if not, it may,
 however, be rejected with some confidence and security. This last
 conclusion, surely, is not desirable; nor ought it to be embraced too
 rashly. For how much must we diminish from the beauty and value of this
 species of philosophy, upon such a supposition? Moralists have hitherto
 been accustomed, when they considered the vast multitude and diversity
 of those actions that excite our approbation or dislike, to search for
 some common principle, on which this variety of sentiments might depend.
 And though they have sometimes carried the matter too far, by their
 passion for some one general principle; it must, however, be confessed,
 that they are excusable in expecting to find some general principles,
 into which all the vices and virtues were justly to be resolved. The
 like has been the endeavour of critics, logicians, and even politicians:
 Nor have their attempts been wholly unsuccessful; though perhaps longer
 time, greater accuracy, and more ardent application may bring these
 sciences still nearer their perfection. To throw up at once all
 pretensions of this kind may justly be deemed more rash, precipitate,
 and dogmatical, than even the boldest and most affirmative philosophy,
 that has ever attempted to impose its crude dictates and principles
 on mankind.
 
 10. What though these reasonings concerning human nature seem abstract,
 and of difficult comprehension? This affords no presumption of their
 falsehood. On the contrary, it seems impossible, that what has hitherto
 escaped so many wise and profound philosophers can be very obvious and
 easy. And whatever pains these researches may cost us, we may think
 ourselves sufficiently rewarded, not only in point of profit but of
 pleasure, if, by that means, we can make any addition to our stock of
 knowledge, in subjects of such unspeakable importance.
 
 But as, after all, the abstractedness of these speculations is no
 recommendation, but rather a disadvantage to them, and as this
 difficulty may perhaps be surmounted by care and art, and the avoiding
 of all unnecessary detail, we have, in the following enquiry, attempted
 to throw some light upon subjects, from which uncertainty has hitherto
 deterred the wise, and obscurity the ignorant. Happy, if we can unite
 the boundaries of the different species of philosophy, by reconciling
 profound enquiry with clearness, and truth with novelty! And still more
 happy, if, reasoning in this easy manner, we can undermine the
 foundations of an abstruse philosophy, which seems to have hitherto
 served only as a shelter to superstition, and a cover to absurdity
 and error!
 
 
 
 SECTION II.
 
 OF THE ORIGIN OF IDEAS.
 
 
 11. Every one will readily allow, that there is a considerable
 difference between the perceptions of the mind, when a man feels the
 pain of excessive heat, or the pleasure of moderate warmth, and when he
 afterwards recalls to his memory this sensation, or anticipates it by
 his imagination. These faculties may mimic or copy the perceptions of
 the senses; but they never can entirely reach the force and vivacity of
 the original sentiment. The utmost we say of them, even when they
 operate with greatest vigour, is, that they represent their object in so
 lively a manner, that we could _almost_ say we feel or see it: But,
 except the mind be disordered by disease or madness, they never can
 arrive at such a pitch of vivacity, as to render these perceptions
 altogether undistinguishable. All the colours of poetry, however
 splendid, can never paint natural objects in such a manner as to make
 the description be taken for a real landskip. The most lively thought is
 still inferior to the dullest sensation.
 
 We may observe a like distinction to run through all the other
 perceptions of the mind. A man in a fit of anger, is actuated in a very
 different manner from one who only thinks of that emotion. If you tell
 me, that any person is in love, I easily understand your meaning, and
 form a just conception of his situation; but never can mistake that
 conception for the real disorders and agitations of the passion. When we
 reflect on our past sentiments and affections, our thought is a faithful
 mirror, and copies its objects truly; but the colours which it employs
 are faint and dull, in comparison of those in which our original
 perceptions were clothed. It requires no nice discernment or
 metaphysical head to mark the distinction between them.
 
 12. Here therefore we may divide all the perceptions of the mind into
 two classes or species, which are distinguished by their different
 degrees of force and vivacity. The less forcible and lively are commonly
 denominated _Thoughts_ or _Ideas_. The other species want a name in our
 language, and in most others; I suppose, because it was not requisite
 for any, but philosophical purposes, to rank them under a general term
 or appellation. Let us, therefore, use a little freedom, and call them
 _Impressions_; employing that word in a sense somewhat different from
 the usual. By the term _impression_, then, I mean all our more lively
 perceptions, when we hear, or see, or feel, or love, or hate, or desire,
 or will. And impressions are distinguished from ideas, which are the
 less lively perceptions, of which we are conscious, when we reflect on
 any of those sensations or movements above mentioned.
 
 13. Nothing, at first view, may seem more unbounded than the thought of
 man, which not only escapes all human power and authority, but is not
 even restrained within the limits of nature and reality. To form
 monsters, and join incongruous shapes and appearances, costs the
 imagination no more trouble than to conceive the most natural and
 familiar objects. And while the body is confined to one planet, along
 which it creeps with pain and difficulty; the thought can in an instant
 transport us into the most distant regions of the universe; or even
 beyond the universe, into the unbounded chaos, where nature is supposed
 to lie in total confusion. What never was seen, or heard of, may yet be
 conceived; nor is any thing beyond the power of thought, except what
 implies an absolute contradiction.
 
 But though our thought seems to possess this unbounded liberty, we shall
 find, upon a nearer examination, that it is really confined within very
 narrow limits, and that all this creative power of the mind amounts to
 no more than the faculty of compounding, transposing, augmenting, or
 diminishing the materials afforded us by the senses and experience. When
 we think of a golden mountain, we only join two consistent ideas,
 _gold_, and _mountain_, with which we were formerly acquainted. A
 virtuous horse we can conceive; because, from our own feeling, we can
 conceive virtue; and this we may unite to the figure and shape of a
 horse, which is an animal familiar to us. In short, all the materials of
 thinking are derived either from our outward or inward sentiment: the
 mixture and composition of these belongs alone to the mind and will. Or,
 to express myself in philosophical language, all our ideas or more
 feeble perceptions are copies of our impressions or more lively ones.
 
 14. To prove this, the two following arguments will, I hope, be
 sufficient. First, when we analyze our thoughts or ideas, however
 compounded or sublime, we always find that they resolve themselves into
 such simple ideas as were copied from a precedent feeling or sentiment.
 Even those ideas, which, at first view, seem the most wide of this
 origin, are found, upon a nearer scrutiny, to be derived from it. The
 idea of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wise, and good Being,
 arises from reflecting on the operations of our own mind, and
 augmenting, without limit, those qualities of goodness and wisdom. We
 may prosecute this enquiry to what length we please; where we shall
 always find, that every idea which we examine is copied from a similar
 impression. Those who would assert that this position is not universally
 true nor without exception, have only one, and that an easy method of
 refuting it; by producing that idea, which, in their opinion, is not
 derived from this source. It will then be incumbent on us, if we would
 maintain our doctrine, to produce the impression, or lively perception,
 which corresponds to it.
 
 15. Secondly. If it happen, from a defect of the organ, that a man is
 not susceptible of any species of sensation, we always find that he is
 as little susceptible of the correspondent ideas. A blind man can form
 no notion of colours; a deaf man of sounds. Restore either of them that
 sense in which he is deficient; by opening this new inlet for his
 sensations, you also open an inlet for the ideas; and he finds no
 difficulty in conceiving these objects. The case is the same, if the
 object, proper for exciting any sensation, has never been applied to the
 organ. A Laplander or Negro has no notion of the relish of wine. And
 though there are few or no instances of a like deficiency in the mind,
 where a person has never felt or is wholly incapable of a sentiment or
 passion that belongs to his species; yet we find the same observation to
 take place in a less degree. A man of mild manners can form no idea of
 inveterate revenge or cruelty; nor can a selfish heart easily conceive
 the heights of friendship and generosity. It is readily allowed, that
 other beings may possess many senses of which we can have no conception;
 because the ideas of them have never been introduced to us in the only
 manner by which an idea can have access to the mind, to wit, by the
 actual feeling and sensation.
 
 16. There is, however, one contradictory phenomenon, which may prove
 that it is not absolutely impossible for ideas to arise, independent of
 their correspondent impressions. I believe it will readily be allowed,
 that the several distinct ideas of colour, which enter by the eye, or
 those of sound, which are conveyed by the ear, are really different from
 each other; though, at the same time, resembling. Now if this be true of
 different colours, it must be no less so of the different shades of the
 same colour; and each shade produces a distinct idea, independent of the
 rest. For if this should be denied, it is possible, by the continual
 gradation of shades, to run a colour insensibly into what is most remote
 from it; and if you will not allow any of the means to be different, you
 cannot, without absurdity, deny the extremes to be the same. Suppose,
 therefore, a person to have enjoyed his sight for thirty years, and to
 have become perfectly acquainted with colours of all kinds except one
 particular shade of blue, for instance, which it never has been his
 fortune to meet with. Let all the different shades of that colour,
 except that single one, be placed before him, descending gradually from
 the deepest to the lightest; it is plain that he will perceive a blank,
 where that shade is wanting, and will be sensible that there is a
 greater distance in that place between the contiguous colours than in
 any other. Now I ask, whether it be possible for him, from his own
 imagination, to supply this deficiency, and raise up to himself the idea
 of that particular shade, though it had never been conveyed to him by
 his senses? I believe there are few but will be of opinion that he can:
 and this may serve as a proof that the simple ideas are not always, in
 every instance, derived from the correspondent impressions; though this
 instance is so singular, that it is scarcely worth our observing, and
 does not merit that for it alone we should alter our general maxim.
 
 17. Here, therefore, is a proposition, which not only seems, in itself,
 simple and intelligible; but, if a proper use were made of it, might
 render every dispute equally intelligible, and banish all that jargon,
 which has so long taken possession of metaphysical reasonings, and drawn
 disgrace upon them. All ideas, especially abstract ones, are naturally
 faint and obscure: the mind has but a slender hold of them: they are apt
 to be confounded with other resembling ideas; and when we have often
 employed any term, though without a distinct meaning, we are apt to
 imagine it has a determinate idea annexed to it. On the contrary, all
 impressions, that is, all sensations, either outward or inward, are
 strong and vivid: the limits between them are more exactly determined:
 nor is it easy to fall into any error or mistake with regard to them.
 When we entertain, therefore, any suspicion that a philosophical term is
 employed without any meaning or idea (as is but too frequent), we need
 but enquire, _from what impression is that supposed idea derived_? And
 if it be impossible to assign any, this will serve to confirm our
 suspicion. By bringing ideas into so clear a light we may reasonably
 hope to remove all dispute, which may arise, concerning their nature and
 reality.[1]
 
     [1] It is probable that no more was meant by those, who denied
     innate ideas, than that all ideas were copies of our
     impressions; though it must be confessed, that the terms, which
     they employed, were not chosen with such caution, nor so
     exactly defined, as to prevent all mistakes about their
     doctrine. For what is meant by _innate_? If innate be
     equivalent to natural, then all the perceptions and ideas of
     the mind must be allowed to be innate or natural, in whatever
     sense we take the latter word, whether in opposition to what is
     uncommon, artificial, or miraculous. If by innate be meant,
     contemporary to our birth, the dispute seems to be frivolous;
     nor is it worth while to enquire at what time thinking begins,
     whether before, at, or after our birth. Again, the word _idea_,
     seems to be commonly taken in a very loose sense, by LOCKE and
     others; as standing for any of our perceptions, our sensations
     and passions, as well as thoughts. Now in this sense, I should
     desire to know, what can be meant by asserting, that self-love,
     or resentment of injuries, or the passion between the sexes is
     not innate?
 
     But admitting these terms, _impressions_ and _ideas_, in the
     sense above explained, and understanding by _innate_, what is
     original or copied from no precedent perception, then may we
     assert that all our impressions are innate, and our ideas
     not innate.
 
     To be ingenuous, I must own it to be my opinion, that LOCKE was
     betrayed into this question by the schoolmen, who, making use
     of undefined terms, draw out their disputes to a tedious
     length, without ever touching the point in question. A like
     ambiguity and circumlocution seem to run through that
     philosopher's reasonings on this as well as most other
     subjects.
 
 
 
 SECTION III.
 
 OF THE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS.
 
 
 18. It is evident that there is a principle of connexion between the
 different thoughts or ideas of the mind, and that, in their appearance
 to the memory or imagination, they introduce each other with a certain
 degree of method and regularity. In our more serious thinking or
 discourse this is so observable that any particular thought, which
 breaks in upon the regular tract or chain of ideas, is immediately
 remarked and rejected. And even in our wildest and most wandering
 reveries, nay in our very dreams, we shall find, if we reflect, that the
 imagination ran not altogether at adventures, but that there was still a
 connexion upheld among the different ideas, which succeeded each other.
 Were the loosest and freest conversation to be transcribed, there would
 immediately be observed something which connected it in all its
 transitions. Or where this is wanting, the person who broke the thread
 of discourse might still inform you, that there had secretly revolved in
 his mind a succession of thought, which had gradually led him from the
 subject of conversation. Among different languages, even where we cannot
 suspect the least connexion or communication, it is found, that the
 words, expressive of ideas, the most compounded, do yet nearly
 correspond to each other: a certain proof that the simple ideas,
 comprehended in the compound ones, were bound together by some universal
 principle, which had an equal influence on all mankind.
 
 19. Though it be too obvious to escape observation, that different ideas
 are connected together; I do not find that any philosopher has attempted
 to enumerate or class all the principles of association; a subject,
 however, that seems worthy of curiosity. To me, there appear to be only
 three principles of connexion among ideas, namely, _Resemblance_,
 _Contiguity_ in time or place, and _Cause or Effect_.
 
 That these principles serve to connect ideas will not, I believe, be
 much doubted. A picture naturally leads our thoughts to the original[2]:
 the mention of one apartment in a building naturally introduces an
 enquiry or discourse concerning the others[3]: and if we think of a
 wound, we can scarcely forbear reflecting on the pain which follows
 it[4]. But that this enumeration is complete, and that there are no
 other principles of association except these, may be difficult to prove
 to the satisfaction of the reader, or even to a man's own satisfaction.
 All we can do, in such cases, is to run over several instances, and
 examine carefully the principle which binds the different thoughts to
 each other, never stopping till we render the principle as general as
 possible[5]. The more instances we examine, and the more care we employ,
 the more assurance shall we acquire, that the enumeration, which we form
 from the whole, is complete and entire.
 
     [2] Resemblance.
 
     [3] Contiguity.
 
     [4] Cause and effect.
 
     [5] For instance, Contrast or Contrariety is also a connexion
     among Ideas: but it may, perhaps, be considered as a mixture of
     _Causation_ and _Resemblance_. Where two objects are contrary,
     the one destroys the other; that is, the cause of its
     annihilation, and the idea of the annihilation of an object,
     implies the idea of its former existence.
 
 
 
 SECTION IV.
 
 SCEPTICAL DOUBTS CONCERNING THE OPERATIONS OF THE UNDERSTANDING.
 
 
 PART I.
 
 
 20. All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided
 into two kinds, to wit, _Relations of Ideas_, and _Matters of Fact_. Of
 the first kind are the sciences of Geometry, Algebra, and Arithmetic;
 and in short, every affirmation which is either intuitively or
 demonstratively certain. _That the square of the hypothenuse is equal to
 the square of the two sides_, is a proposition which expresses a
 relation between these figures. _That three times five is equal to the
 half of thirty_, expresses a relation between these numbers.
 Propositions of this kind are discoverable by the mere operation of
 thought, without dependence on what is anywhere existent in the
 universe. Though there never were a circle or triangle in nature, the
 truths demonstrated by Euclid would for ever retain their certainty
 and evidence.
 
 21. Matters of fact, which are the second objects of human reason, are
 not ascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth,
 however great, of a like nature with the foregoing. The contrary of
 every matter of fact is still possible; because it can never imply a
 contradiction, and is conceived by the mind with the same facility and
 distinctness, as if ever so conformable to reality. _That the sun will
 not rise to-morrow_ is no less intelligible a proposition, and implies
 no more contradiction than the affirmation, _that it will rise_. We
 should in vain, therefore, attempt to demonstrate its falsehood. Were it
 demonstratively false, it would imply a contradiction, and could never
 be distinctly conceived by the mind.
 
 It may, therefore, be a subject worthy of curiosity, to enquire what is
 the nature of that evidence which assures us of any real existence and
 matter of fact, beyond the present testimony of our senses, or the
 records of our memory. This part of philosophy, it is observable, has
 been little cultivated, either by the ancients or moderns; and therefore
 our doubts and errors, in the prosecution of so important an enquiry,
 may be the more excusable; while we march through such difficult paths
 without any guide or direction. They may even prove useful, by exciting
 curiosity, and destroying that implicit faith and security, which is the
 bane of all reasoning and free enquiry. The discovery of defects in the
 common philosophy, if any such there be, will not, I presume, be a
 discouragement, but rather an incitement, as is usual, to attempt
 something more full and satisfactory than has yet been proposed to
 the public.
 
 22. All reasonings concerning matter of fact seem to be founded on the
 relation of _Cause and Effect_. By means of that relation alone we can
 go beyond the evidence of our memory and senses. If you were to ask a
 man, why he believes any matter of fact, which is absent; for instance,
 that his friend is in the country, or in France; he would give you a
 reason; and this reason would be some other fact; as a letter received
 from him, or the knowledge of his former resolutions and promises. A man
 finding a watch or any other machine in a desert island, would conclude
 that there had once been men in that island. All our reasonings
 concerning fact are of the same nature. And here it is constantly
 supposed that there is a connexion between the present fact and that
 which is inferred from it. Were there nothing to bind them together, the
 inference would be entirely precarious. The hearing of an articulate
 voice and rational discourse in the dark assures us of the presence of
 some person: Why? because these are the effects of the human make and
 fabric, and closely connected with it. If we anatomize all the other
 reasonings of this nature, we shall find that they are founded on the
 relation of cause and effect, and that this relation is either near or
 remote, direct or collateral. Heat and light are collateral effects of
 fire, and the one effect may justly be inferred from the other.
 
 23. If we would satisfy ourselves, therefore, concerning the nature of
 that evidence, which assures us of matters of fact, we must enquire how
 we arrive at the knowledge of cause and effect.
 
 I shall venture to affirm, as a general proposition, which admits of no
 exception, that the knowledge of this relation is not, in any instance,
 attained by reasonings _a priori_; but arises entirely from experience,
 when we find that any particular objects are constantly conjoined with
 each other. Let an object be presented to a man of ever so strong
 natural reason and abilities; if that object be entirely new to him, he
 will not be able, by the most accurate examination of its sensible
 qualities, to discover any of its causes or effects. Adam, though his
 rational faculties be supposed, at the very first, entirely perfect,
 could not have inferred from the fluidity and transparency of water that
 it would suffocate him, or from the light and warmth of fire that it
 would consume him. No object ever discovers, by the qualities which
 appear to the senses, either the causes which produced it, or the
 effects which will arise from it; nor can our reason, unassisted by
 experience, ever draw any inference concerning real existence and
 matter of fact.
 
 24. This proposition, _that causes and effects are discoverable, not by
 reason but by experience_, will readily be admitted with regard to such
 objects, as we remember to have once been altogether unknown to us;
 since we must be conscious of the utter inability, which we then lay
 under, of foretelling what would arise from them. Present two smooth
 pieces of marble to a man who has no tincture of natural philosophy; he
 will never discover that they will adhere together in such a manner as
 to require great force to separate them in a direct line, while they
 make so small a resistance to a lateral pressure. Such events, as bear
 little analogy to the common course of nature, are also readily
 confessed to be known only by experience; nor does any man imagine that
 the explosion of gunpowder, or the attraction of a loadstone, could ever
 be discovered by arguments _a priori_. In like manner, when an effect is
 supposed to depend upon an intricate machinery or secret structure of
 parts, we make no difficulty in attributing all our knowledge of it to
 experience. Who will assert that he can give the ultimate reason, why
 milk or bread is proper nourishment for a man, not for a lion or
 a tiger?
 
 But the same truth may not appear, at first sight, to have the same
 evidence with regard to events, which have become familiar to us from
 our first appearance in the world, which bear a close analogy to the
 whole course of nature, and which are supposed to depend on the simple
 qualities of objects, without any secret structure of parts. We are apt
 to imagine that we could discover these effects by the mere operation of
 our reason, without experience. We fancy, that were we brought on a
 sudden into this world, we could at first have inferred that one
 Billiard-ball would communicate motion to another upon impulse; and that
 we needed not to have waited for the event, in order to pronounce with
 certainty concerning it. Such is the influence of custom, that, where it
 is strongest, it not only covers our natural ignorance, but even
 conceals itself, and seems not to take place, merely because it is found
 in the highest degree.
 
 25. But to convince us that all the laws of nature, and all the
 operations of bodies without exception, are known only by experience,
 the following reflections may, perhaps, suffice. Were any object
 presented to us, and were we required to pronounce concerning the
 effect, which will result from it, without consulting past observation;
 after what manner, I beseech you, must the mind proceed in this
 operation? It must invent or imagine some event, which it ascribes to
 the object as its effect; and it is plain that this invention must be
 entirely arbitrary. The mind can never possibly find the effect in the
 supposed cause, by the most accurate scrutiny and examination. For the
 effect is totally different from the cause, and consequently can never
 be discovered in it. Motion in the second Billiard-ball is a quite
 distinct event from motion in the first; nor is there anything in the
 one to suggest the smallest hint of the other. A stone or piece of metal
 raised into the air, and left without any support, immediately falls:
 but to consider the matter _a priori_, is there anything we discover in
 this situation which can beget the idea of a downward, rather than an
 upward, or any other motion, in the stone or metal? And as the first
 imagination or invention of a particular effect, in all natural
 operations, is arbitrary, where we consult not experience; so must we
 also esteem the supposed tie or connexion between the cause and effect,
 which binds them together, and renders it impossible that any other
 effect could result from the operation of that cause. When I see, for
 instance, a Billiard-ball moving in a straight line towards another;
 even suppose motion in the second ball should by accident be suggested
 to me, as the result of their contact or impulse; may I not conceive,
 that a hundred different events might as well follow from that cause?
 May not both these balls remain at absolute rest? May not the first ball
 return in a straight line, or leap off from the second in any line or
 direction? All these suppositions are consistent and conceivable. Why
 then should we give the preference to one, which is no more consistent
 or conceivable than the rest? All our reasonings _a priori_ will never
 be able to show us any foundation for this preference.
 
 In a word, then, every effect is a distinct event from its cause. It
 could not, therefore, be discovered in the cause, and the first
 invention or conception of it, _a priori_, must be entirely arbitrary.
 And even after it is suggested, the conjunction of it with the cause
 must appear equally arbitrary; since there are always many other
 effects, which, to reason, must seem fully as consistent and natural. In
 vain, therefore, should we pretend to determine any single event, or
 infer any cause or effect, without the assistance of observation and
 experience.
 
 26. Hence we may discover the reason why no philosopher, who is rational
 and modest, has ever pretended to assign the ultimate cause of any
 natural operation, or to show distinctly the action of that power, which
 produces any single effect in the universe. It is confessed, that the
 utmost effort of human reason is to reduce the principles, productive of
 natural phenomena, to a greater simplicity, and to resolve the many
 particular effects into a few general causes, by means of reasonings
 from analogy, experience, and observation. But as to the causes of these
 general causes, we should in vain attempt their discovery; nor shall we
 ever be able to satisfy ourselves, by any particular explication of
 them. These ultimate springs and principles are totally shut up from
 human curiosity and enquiry. Elasticity, gravity, cohesion of parts,
 communication of motion by impulse; these are probably the ultimate
 causes and principles which we shall ever discover in nature; and we may
 esteem ourselves sufficiently happy, if, by accurate enquiry and
 reasoning, we can trace up the particular phenomena to, or near to,
 these general principles. The most perfect philosophy of the natural
 kind only staves off our ignorance a little longer: as perhaps the most
 perfect philosophy of the moral or metaphysical kind serves only to
 discover larger portions of it. Thus the observation of human blindness
 and weakness is the result of all philosophy, and meets us at every
 turn, in spite of our endeavours to elude or avoid it.
 
 27. Nor is geometry, when taken into the assistance of natural
 philosophy, ever able to remedy this defect, or lead us into the
 knowledge of ultimate causes, by all that accuracy of reasoning for
 which it is so justly celebrated. Every part of mixed mathematics
 proceeds upon the supposition that certain laws are established by
 nature in her operations; and abstract reasonings are employed, either
 to assist experience in the discovery of these laws, or to determine
 their influence in particular instances, where it depends upon any
 precise degree of distance and quantity. Thus, it is a law of motion,
 discovered by experience, that the moment or force of any body in motion
 is in the compound ratio or proportion of its solid contents and its
 velocity; and consequently, that a small force may remove the greatest
 obstacle or raise the greatest weight, if, by any contrivance or
 machinery, we can increase the velocity of that force, so as to make it
 an overmatch for its antagonist. Geometry assists us in the application
 of this law, by giving us the just dimensions of all the parts and
 figures which can enter into any species of machine; but still the
 discovery of the law itself is owing merely to experience, and all the
 abstract reasonings in the world could never lead us one step towards
 the knowledge of it. When we reason _a priori_, and consider merely any
 object or cause, as it appears to the mind, independent of all
 observation, it never could suggest to us the notion of any distinct
 object, such as its effect; much less, show us the inseparable and
 inviolable connexion between them. A man must be very sagacious who
 could discover by reasoning that crystal is the effect of heat, and ice
 of cold, without being previously acquainted with the operation of these
 qualities.
 
 
 PART II.
 
 
 28. But we have not yet attained any tolerable satisfaction with regard
 to the question first proposed. Each solution still gives rise to a new
 question as difficult as the foregoing, and leads us on to farther
 enquiries. When it is asked, _What is the nature of all our reasonings
 concerning matter of fact?_ the proper answer seems to be, that they are
 founded on the relation of cause and effect. When again it is asked,
 _What is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning
 that relation?_ it may be replied in one word, Experience. But if we
 still carry on our sifting humour, and ask, _What is the foundation of
 all conclusions from experience?_ this implies a new question, which may
 be of more difficult solution and explication. Philosophers, that give
 themselves airs of superior wisdom and sufficiency, have a hard task
 when they encounter persons of inquisitive dispositions, who push them
 from every corner to which they retreat, and who are sure at last to
 bring them to some dangerous dilemma. The best expedient to prevent this
 confusion, is to be modest in our pretensions; and even to discover the
 difficulty ourselves before it is objected to us. By this means, we may
 make a kind of merit of our very ignorance.
 
 I shall content myself, in this section, with an easy task, and shall
 pretend only to give a negative answer to the question here proposed. I
 say then, that, even after we have experience of the operations of cause
 and effect, our conclusions from that experience are _not_ founded on
 reasoning, or any process of the understanding. This answer we must
 endeavour both to explain and to defend.
 
 29. It must certainly be allowed, that nature has kept us at a great
 distance from all her secrets, and has afforded us only the knowledge of
 a few superficial qualities of objects; while she conceals from us those
 powers and principles on which the influence of those objects entirely
 depends. Our senses inform us of the colour, weight, and consistence of
 bread; but neither sense nor reason can ever inform us of those
 qualities which fit it for the nourishment and support of a human body.
 Sight or feeling conveys an idea of the actual motion of bodies; but as
 to that wonderful force or power, which would carry on a moving body for
 ever in a continued change of place, and which bodies never lose but by
 communicating it to others; of this we cannot form the most distant
 conception. But notwithstanding this ignorance of natural powers[6] and
 principles, we always presume, when we see like sensible qualities, that
 they have like secret powers, and expect that effects, similar to those
 which we have experienced, will follow from them. If a body of like
 colour and consistence with that bread, which we have formerly eat, be
 presented to us, we make no scruple of repeating the experiment, and
 foresee, with certainty, like nourishment and support. Now this is a
 process of the mind or thought, of which I would willingly know the
 foundation. It is allowed on all hands that there is no known connexion
 between the sensible qualities and the secret powers; and consequently,
 that the mind is not led to form such a conclusion concerning their
 constant and regular conjunction, by anything which it knows of their
 nature. As to past _Experience_, it can be allowed to give _direct_ and
 _certain_ information of those precise objects only, and that precise
 period of time, which fell under its cognizance: but why this experience
 should be extended to future times, and to other objects, which for
 aught we know, may be only in appearance similar; this is the main
 question on which I would insist. The bread, which I formerly eat,
 nourished me; that is, a body of such sensible qualities was, at that
 time, endued with such secret powers: but does it follow, that other
 bread must also nourish me at another time, and that like sensible
 qualities must always be attended with like secret powers? The
 consequence seems nowise necessary. At least, it must be acknowledged
 that there is here a consequence drawn by the mind; that there is a
 certain step taken; a process of thought, and an inference, which wants
 to be explained. These two propositions are far from being the same, _I
 have found that such an object has always been attended with such an
 effect_, and _I foresee, that other objects, which are, in appearance,
 similar, will be attended with similar effects_. I shall allow, if you
 please, that the one proposition may justly be inferred from the other:
 I know, in fact, that it always is inferred. But if you insist that the
 inference is made by a chain of reasoning, I desire you to produce that
 reasoning. The connexion between these propositions is not intuitive.
 There is required a medium, which may enable the mind to draw such an
 inference, if indeed it be drawn by reasoning and argument. What that
 medium is, I must confess, passes my comprehension; and it is incumbent
 on those to produce it, who assert that it really exists, and is the
 origin of all our conclusions concerning matter of fact.
 
     [6] The word, Power, is here used in a loose and popular sense.
     The more accurate explication of it would give additional
     evidence to this argument. See Sect. 7.
 
 30. This negative argument must certainly, in process of time, become
 altogether convincing, if many penetrating and able philosophers shall
 turn their enquiries this way and no one be ever able to discover any
 connecting proposition or intermediate step, which supports the
 understanding in this conclusion. But as the question is yet new, every
 reader may not trust so far to his own penetration, as to conclude,
 because an argument escapes his enquiry, that therefore it does not
 really exist. For this reason it may be requisite to venture upon a more
 difficult task; and enumerating all the branches of human knowledge,
 endeavour to show that none of them can afford such an argument.
 
 All reasonings may be divided into two kinds, namely, demonstrative
 reasoning, or that concerning relations of ideas, and moral reasoning,
 or that concerning matter of fact and existence. That there are no
 demonstrative arguments in the case seems evident; since it implies no
 contradiction that the course of nature may change, and that an object,
 seemingly like those which we have experienced, may be attended with
 different or contrary effects. May I not clearly and distinctly conceive
 that a body, falling from the clouds, and which, in all other respects,
 resembles snow, has yet the taste of salt or feeling of fire? Is there
 any more intelligible proposition than to affirm, that all the trees
 will flourish in December and January, and decay in May and June? Now
 whatever is intelligible, and can be distinctly conceived, implies no
 contradiction, and can never be proved false by any demonstrative
 argument or abstract reasoning _a priori_.
 
 If we be, therefore, engaged by arguments to put trust in past
 experience, and make it the standard of our future judgement, these
 arguments must be probable only, or such as regard matter of fact and
 real existence, according to the division above mentioned. But that
 there is no argument of this kind, must appear, if our explication of
 that species of reasoning be admitted as solid and satisfactory. We have
 said that all arguments concerning existence are founded on the relation
 of cause and effect; that our knowledge of that relation is derived
 entirely from experience; and that all our experimental conclusions
 proceed upon the supposition that the future will be conformable to the
 past. To endeavour, therefore, the proof of this last supposition by
 probable arguments, or arguments regarding existence, must be evidently
 going in a circle, and taking that for granted, which is the very point
 in question.
 
 31. In reality, all arguments from experience are founded on the
 similarity which we discover among natural objects, and by which we are
 induced to expect effects similar to those which we have found to follow
 from such objects. And though none but a fool or madman will ever
 pretend to dispute the authority of experience, or to reject that great
 guide of human life, it may surely be allowed a philosopher to have so
 much curiosity at least as to examine the principle of human nature,
 which gives this mighty authority to experience, and makes us draw
 advantage from that similarity which nature has placed among different
 objects. From causes which appear _similar_ we expect similar effects.
 This is the sum of all our experimental conclusions. Now it seems
 evident that, if this conclusion were formed by reason, it would be as
 perfect at first, and upon one instance, as after ever so long a course
 of experience. But the case is far otherwise. Nothing so like as eggs;
 yet no one, on account of this appearing similarity, expects the same
 taste and relish in all of them. It is only after a long course of
 uniform experiments in any kind, that we attain a firm reliance and
 security with regard to a particular event. Now where is that process of
 reasoning which, from one instance, draws a conclusion, so different
 from that which it infers from a hundred instances that are nowise
 different from that single one? This question I propose as much for the
 sake of information, as with an intention of raising difficulties. I
 cannot find, I cannot imagine any such reasoning. But I keep my mind
 still open to instruction, if any one will vouchsafe to bestow it on me.
 
 32. Should it be said that, from a number of uniform experiments, we
 _infer_ a connexion between the sensible qualities and the secret
 powers; this, I must confess, seems the same difficulty, couched in
 different terms. The question still recurs, on what process of argument
 this _inference_ is founded? Where is the medium, the interposing ideas,
 which join propositions so very wide of each other? It is confessed that
 the colour, consistence, and other sensible qualities of bread appear
 not, of themselves, to have any connexion with the secret powers of
 nourishment and support. For otherwise we could infer these secret
 powers from the first appearance of these sensible qualities, without
 the aid of experience; contrary to the sentiment of all philosophers,
 and contrary to plain matter of fact. Here, then, is our natural state
 of ignorance with regard to the powers and influence of all objects. How
 is this remedied by experience? It only shows us a number of uniform
 effects, resulting from certain objects, and teaches us that those
 particular objects, at that particular time, were endowed with such
 powers and forces. When a new object, endowed with similar sensible
 qualities, is produced, we expect similar powers and forces, and look
 for a like effect. From a body of like colour and consistence with bread
 we expect like nourishment and support. But this surely is a step or
 progress of the mind, which wants to be explained. When a man says, _I
 have found, in all past instances, such sensible qualities conjoined
 with such secret powers_: And when he says, _Similar sensible qualities
 will always be conjoined with similar secret powers_, he is not guilty
 of a tautology, nor are these propositions in any respect the same. You
 say that the one proposition is an inference from the other. But you
 must confess that the inference is not intuitive; neither is it
 demonstrative: Of what nature is it, then? To say it is experimental, is
 begging the question. For all inferences from experience suppose, as
 their foundation, that the future will resemble the past, and that
 similar powers will be conjoined with similar sensible qualities. If
 there be any suspicion that the course of nature may change, and that
 the past may be no rule for the future, all experience becomes useless,
 and can give rise to no inference or conclusion. It is impossible,
 therefore, that any arguments from experience can prove this resemblance
 of the past to the future; since all these arguments are founded on the
 supposition of that resemblance. Let the course of things be allowed
 hitherto ever so regular; that alone, without some new argument or
 inference, proves not that, for the future, it will continue so. In vain
 do you pretend to have learned the nature of bodies from your past
 experience. Their secret nature, and consequently all their effects and
 influence, may change, without any change in their sensible qualities.
 This happens sometimes, and with regard to some objects: Why may it not
 happen always, and with regard to all objects? What logic, what process
 of argument secures you against this supposition? My practice, you say,
 refutes my doubts. But you mistake the purport of my question. As an
 agent, I am quite satisfied in the point; but as a philosopher, who has
 some share of curiosity, I will not say scepticism, I want to learn the
 foundation of this inference. No reading, no enquiry has yet been able
 to remove my difficulty, or give me satisfaction in a matter of such
 importance. Can I do better than propose the difficulty to the public,
 even though, perhaps, I have small hopes of obtaining a solution? We
 shall at least, by this means, be sensible of our ignorance, if we do
 not augment our knowledge.
 
 33. I must confess that a man is guilty of unpardonable arrogance who
 concludes, because an argument has escaped his own investigation, that
 therefore it does not really exist. I must also confess that, though all
 the learned, for several ages, should have employed themselves in
 fruitless search upon any subject, it may still, perhaps, be rash to
 conclude positively that the subject must, therefore, pass all human
 comprehension. Even though we examine all the sources of our knowledge,
 and conclude them unfit for such a subject, there may still remain a
 suspicion, that the enumeration is not complete, or the examination not
 accurate. But with regard to the present subject, there are some
 considerations which seem to remove all this accusation of arrogance or
 suspicion of mistake.
 
 It is certain that the most ignorant and stupid peasants--nay infants,
 nay even brute beasts--improve by experience, and learn the qualities of
 natural objects, by observing the effects which result from them. When a
 child has felt the sensation of pain from touching the flame of a
 candle, he will be careful not to put his hand near any candle; but will
 expect a similar effect from a cause which is similar in its sensible
 qualities and appearance. If you assert, therefore, that the
 understanding of the child is led into this conclusion by any process of
 argument or ratiocination, I may justly require you to produce that
 argument; nor have you any pretence to refuse so equitable a demand. You
 cannot say that the argument is abstruse, and may possibly escape your
 enquiry; since you confess that it is obvious to the capacity of a mere
 infant. If you hesitate, therefore, a moment, or if, after reflection,
 you produce any intricate or profound argument, you, in a manner, give
 up the question, and confess that it is not reasoning which engages us
 to suppose the past resembling the future, and to expect similar effects
 from causes which are, to appearance, similar. This is the proposition
 which I intended to enforce in the present section. If I be right, I
 pretend not to have made any mighty discovery. And if I be wrong, I must
 acknowledge myself to be indeed a very backward scholar; since I cannot
 now discover an argument which, it seems, was perfectly familiar to me
 long before I was out of my cradle.
 
 
 
 SECTION V.
 
 SCEPTICAL SOLUTION OF THESE DOUBTS.
 
 
 PART I.
 
 
 34. The passion for philosophy, like that for religion, seems liable to
 this inconvenience, that, though it aims at the correction of our
 manners, and extirpation of our vices, it may only serve, by imprudent
 management, to foster a predominant inclination, and push the mind, with
 more determined resolution, towards that side which already _draws_ too
 much, by the bias and propensity of the natural temper. It is certain
 that, while we aspire to the magnanimous firmness of the philosophic
 sage, and endeavour to confine our pleasures altogether within our own
 minds, we may, at last, render our philosophy like that of Epictetus,
 and other _Stoics_, only a more refined system of selfishness, and
 reason ourselves out of all virtue as well as social enjoyment. While we
 study with attention the vanity of human life, and turn all our thoughts
 towards the empty and transitory nature of riches and honours, we are,
 perhaps, all the while flattering our natural indolence, which, hating
 the bustle of the world, and drudgery of business, seeks a pretence of
 reason to give itself a full and uncontrolled indulgence. There is,
 however, one species of philosophy which seems little liable to this
 inconvenience, and that because it strikes in with no disorderly passion
 of the human mind, nor can mingle itself with any natural affection or
 propensity; and that is the Academic or Sceptical philosophy. The
 academics always talk of doubt and suspense of judgement, of danger in
 hasty determinations, of confining to very narrow bounds the enquiries
 of the understanding, and of renouncing all speculations which lie not
 within the limits of common life and practice. Nothing, therefore, can
 be more contrary than such a philosophy to the supine indolence of the
 mind, its rash arrogance, its lofty pretensions, and its superstitious
 credulity. Every passion is mortified by it, except the love of truth;
 and that passion never is, nor can be, carried to too high a degree. It
 is surprising, therefore, that this philosophy, which, in almost every
 instance, must be harmless and innocent, should be the subject of so
 much groundless reproach and obloquy. But, perhaps, the very
 circumstance which renders it so innocent is what chiefly exposes it to
 the public hatred and resentment. By flattering no irregular passion, it
 gains few partizans: By opposing so many vices and follies, it raises to
 itself abundance of enemies, who stigmatize it as libertine profane, and
 irreligious.
 
 Nor need we fear that this philosophy, while it endeavours to limit our
 enquiries to common life, should ever undermine the reasonings of common
 life, and carry its doubts so far as to destroy all action, as well as
 speculation. Nature will always maintain her rights, and prevail in the
 end over any abstract reasoning whatsoever. Though we should conclude,
 for instance, as in the foregoing section, that, in all reasonings from
 experience, there is a step taken by the mind which is not supported by
 any argument or process of the understanding; there is no danger that
 these reasonings, on which almost all knowledge depends, will ever be
 affected by such a discovery. If the mind be not engaged by argument to
 make this step, it must be induced by some other principle of equal
 weight and authority; and that principle will preserve its influence as
 long as human nature remains the same. What that principle is may well
 be worth the pains of enquiry.
 
 35. Suppose a person, though endowed with the strongest faculties of
 reason and reflection, to be brought on a sudden into this world; he
 would, indeed, immediately observe a continual succession of objects,
 and one event following another; but he would not be able to discover
 anything farther. He would not, at first, by any reasoning, be able to
 reach the idea of cause and effect; since the particular powers, by
 which all natural operations are performed, never appear to the senses;
 nor is it reasonable to conclude, merely because one event, in one
 instance, precedes another, that therefore the one is the cause, the
 other the effect. Their conjunction may be arbitrary and casual. There
 may be no reason to infer the existence of one from the appearance of
 the other. And in a word, such a person, without more experience, could
 never employ his conjecture or reasoning concerning any matter of fact,
 or be assured of anything beyond what was immediately present to his
 memory and senses.
 
 Suppose, again, that he has acquired more experience, and has lived so
 long in the world as to have observed familiar objects or events to be
 constantly conjoined together; what is the consequence of this
 experience? He immediately infers the existence of one object from the
 appearance of the other. Yet he has not, by all his experience, acquired
 any idea or knowledge of the secret power by which the one object
 produces the other; nor is it, by any process of reasoning, he is
 engaged to draw this inference. But still he finds himself determined to
 draw it: And though he should be convinced that his understanding has no
 part in the operation, he would nevertheless continue in the same course
 of thinking. There is some other principle which determines him to form
 such a conclusion.
 
 36. This principle is Custom or Habit. For wherever the repetition of
 any particular act or operation produces a propensity to renew the same
 act or operation, without being impelled by any reasoning or process of
 the understanding, we always say, that this propensity is the effect of
 _Custom_. By employing that word, we pretend not to have given the
 ultimate reason of such a propensity. We only point out a principle of
 human nature, which is universally acknowledged, and which is well known
 by its effects. Perhaps we can push our enquiries no farther, or pretend
 to give the cause of this cause; but must rest contented with it as the
 ultimate principle, which we can assign, of all our conclusions from
 experience. It is sufficient satisfaction, that we can go so far,
 without repining at the narrowness of our faculties because they will
 carry us no farther. And it is certain we here advance a very
 intelligible proposition at least, if not a true one, when we assert
 that, after the constant conjunction of two objects--heat and flame, for
 instance, weight and solidity--we are determined by custom alone to
 expect the one from the appearance of the other. This hypothesis seems
 even the only one which explains the difficulty, why we draw, from a
 thousand instances, an inference which we are not able to draw from one
 instance, that is, in no respect, different from them. Reason is
 incapable of any such variation. The conclusions which it draws from
 considering one circle are the same which it would form upon surveying
 all the circles in the universe. But no man, having seen only one body
 move after being impelled by another, could infer that every other body
 will move after a like impulse. All inferences from experience,
 therefore, are effects of custom, not of reasoning[7].
 
     [7] Nothing is more useful than for writers, even, on _moral_,
     _political_, or _physical_ subjects, to distinguish between
     _reason_ and _experience_, and to suppose, that these species
     of argumentation are entirely different from each other. The
     former are taken for the mere result of our intellectual
     faculties, which, by considering _a priori_ the nature of
     things, and examining the effects, that must follow from their
     operation, establish particular principles of science and
     philosophy. The latter are supposed to be derived entirely from
     sense and observation, by which we learn what has actually
     resulted from the operation of particular objects, and are
     thence able to infer, what will, for the future, result from
     them. Thus, for instance, the limitations and restraints of
     civil government, and a legal constitution, may be defended,
     either from _reason_, which reflecting on the great frailty and
     corruption of human nature, teaches, that no man can safely be
     trusted with unlimited authority; or from _experience_ and
     history, which inform us of the enormous abuses, that ambition,
     in every age and country, has been found to make of so
     imprudent a confidence.
 
     The same distinction between reason and experience is
     maintained in all our deliberations concerning the conduct of
     life; while the experienced statesman, general, physician, or
     merchant is trusted and followed; and the unpractised novice,
     with whatever natural talents endowed, neglected and despised.
     Though it be allowed, that reason may form very plausible
     conjectures with regard to the consequences of such a
     particular conduct in such particular circumstances; it is
     still supposed imperfect, without the assistance of experience,
     which is alone able to give stability and certainty to the
     maxims, derived from study and reflection.
 
     But notwithstanding that this distinction be thus universally
     received, both in the active speculative scenes of life, I
     shall not scruple to pronounce, that it is, at bottom,
     erroneous, at least, superficial.
 
     If we examine those arguments, which, in any of the sciences
     above mentioned, are supposed to be the mere effects of
     reasoning and reflection, they will be found to terminate, at
     last, in some general principle or conclusion, for which we can
     assign no reason but observation and experience. The only
     difference between them and those maxims, which are vulgarly
     esteemed the result of pure experience, is, that the former
     cannot be established without some process of thought, and some
     reflection on what we have observed, in order to distinguish
     its circumstances, and trace its consequences: Whereas in the
     latter, the experienced event is exactly and fully familiar to
     that which we infer as the result of any particular situation.
     The history of a TIBERIUS or a NERO makes us dread a like
     tyranny, were our monarchs freed from the restraints of laws
     and senates: But the observation of any fraud or cruelty in
     private life is sufficient, with the aid of a little thought,
     to give us the same apprehension; while it serves as an
     instance of the general corruption of human nature, and shows
     us the danger which we must incur by reposing an entire
     confidence in mankind. In both cases, it is experience which is
     ultimately the foundation of our inference and conclusion.
 
     There is no man so young and unexperienced, as not to have
     formed, from observation, many general and just maxims
     concerning human affairs and the conduct of life; but it must
     be confessed, that, when a man comes to put these in practice,
     he will be extremely liable to error, till time and farther
     experience both enlarge these maxims, and teach him their
     proper use and application. In every situation or incident,
     there are many particular and seemingly minute circumstances,
     which the man of greatest talent is, at first, apt to overlook,
     though on them the justness of his conclusions, and
     consequently the prudence of his conduct, entirely depend. Not
     to mention, that, to a young beginner, the general observations
     and maxims occur not always on the proper occasions, nor can be
     immediately applied with due calmness and distinction. The
     truth is, an unexperienced reasoner could be no reasoner at
     all, were he absolutely unexperienced; and when we assign that
     character to any one, we mean it only in a comparative sense,
     and suppose him possessed of experience, in a smaller and more
     imperfect degree.
 
 Custom, then, is the great guide of human life. It is that principle
 alone which renders our experience useful to us, and makes us expect,
 for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared
 in the past.
 
 Without the influence of custom, we should be entirely ignorant of every
 matter of fact beyond what is immediately present to the memory and
 senses. We should never know how to adjust means to ends, or to employ
 our natural powers in the production of any effect. There would be an
 end at once of all action, as well as of the chief part of speculation.
 
 37. But here it may be proper to remark, that though our conclusions
 from experience carry us beyond our memory and senses, and assure us of
 matters of fact which happened in the most distant places and most
 remote ages, yet some fact must always be present to the senses or
 memory, from which we may first proceed in drawing these conclusions. A
 man, who should find in a desert country the remains of pompous
 buildings, would conclude that the country had, in ancient times, been
 cultivated by civilized inhabitants; but did nothing of this nature
 occur to him, he could never form such an inference. We learn the events
 of former ages from history; but then we must peruse the volumes in
 which this instruction is contained, and thence carry up our inferences
 from one testimony to another, till we arrive at the eyewitnesses and
 spectators of these distant events. In a word, if we proceed not upon
 some fact, present to the memory or senses, our reasonings would be
 merely hypothetical; and however the particular links might be connected
 with each other, the whole chain of inferences would have nothing to
 support it, nor could we ever, by its means, arrive at the knowledge of
 any real existence. If I ask why you believe any particular matter of
 fact, which you relate, you must tell me some reason; and this reason
 will be some other fact, connected with it. But as you cannot proceed
 after this manner, _in infinitum_, you must at last terminate in some
 fact, which is present to your memory or senses; or must allow that your
 belief is entirely without foundation.
 
 38. What, then, is the conclusion of the whole matter? A simple one;
 though, it must be confessed, pretty remote from the common theories of
 philosophy. All belief of matter of fact or real existence is derived
 merely from some object, present to the memory or senses, and a
 customary conjunction between that and some other object. Or in other
 words; having found, in many instances, that any two kinds of
 objects--flame and heat, snow and cold--have always been conjoined
 together; if flame or snow be presented anew to the senses, the mind is
 carried by custom to expect heat or cold, and to _believe_ that such a
 quality does exist, and will discover itself upon a nearer approach.
 This belief is the necessary result of placing the mind in such
 circumstances. It is an operation of the soul, when we are so situated,
 as unavoidable as to feel the passion of love, when we receive benefits;
 or hatred, when we meet with injuries. All these operations are a
 species of natural instincts, which no reasoning or process of the
 thought and understanding is able either to produce or to prevent.
 
 At this point, it would be very allowable for us to stop our
 philosophical researches. In most questions we can never make a single
 step farther; and in all questions we must terminate here at last, after
 our most restless and curious enquiries. But still our curiosity will be
 pardonable, perhaps commendable, if it carry us on to still farther
 researches, and make us examine more accurately the nature of this
 _belief_, and of the _customary conjunction_, whence it is derived. By
 this means we may meet with some explications and analogies that will
 give satisfaction; at least to such as love the abstract sciences, and
 can be entertained with speculations, which, however accurate, may still
 retain a degree of doubt and uncertainty. As to readers of a different
 taste; the remaining part of this section is not calculated for them,
 and the following enquiries may well be understood, though it be
 neglected.
 
 
 PART II.
 
 
 39. Nothing is more free than the imagination of man; and though it
 cannot exceed that original stock of ideas furnished by the internal and
 external senses, it has unlimited power of mixing, compounding,
 separating, and dividing these ideas, in all the varieties of fiction
 and vision. It can feign a train of events, with all the appearance of
 reality, ascribe to them a particular time and place, conceive them as
 existent, and paint them out to itself with every circumstance, that
 belongs to any historical fact, which it believes with the greatest
 certainty. Wherein, therefore, consists the difference between such a
 fiction and belief? It lies not merely in any peculiar idea, which is
 annexed to such a conception as commands our assent, and which is
 wanting to every known fiction. For as the mind has authority over all
 its ideas, it could voluntarily annex this particular idea to any
 fiction, and consequently be able to believe whatever it pleases;
 contrary to what we find by daily experience. We can, in our conception,
 join the head of a man to the body of a horse; but it is not in our
 power to believe that such an animal has ever really existed.
 
 It follows, therefore, that the difference between _fiction_ and
 _belief_ lies in some sentiment or feeling, which is annexed to the
 latter, not to the former, and which depends not on the will, nor can be
 commanded at pleasure. It must be excited by nature, like all other
 sentiments; and must arise from the particular situation, in which the
 mind is placed at any particular juncture. Whenever any object is
 presented to the memory or senses, it immediately, by the force of
 custom, carries the imagination to conceive that object, which is
 usually conjoined to it; and this conception is attended with a feeling
 or sentiment, different from the loose reveries of the fancy. In this
 consists the whole nature of belief. For as there is no matter of fact
 which we believe so firmly that we cannot conceive the contrary, there
 would be no difference between the conception assented to and that which
 is rejected, were it not for some sentiment which distinguishes the one
 from the other. If I see a billiard-ball moving towards another, on a
 smooth table, I can easily conceive it to stop upon contact. This
 conception implies no contradiction; but still it feels very differently
 from that conception by which I represent to myself the impulse and the
 communication of motion from one ball to another.
 
 40. Were we to attempt a _definition_ of this sentiment, we should,
 perhaps, find it a very difficult, if not an impossible task; in the
 same manner as if we should endeavour to define the feeling of cold or
 passion of anger, to a creature who never had any experience of these
 sentiments. Belief is the true and proper name of this feeling; and no
 one is ever at a loss to know the meaning of that term; because every
 man is every moment conscious of the sentiment represented by it. It may
 not, however, be improper to attempt a _description_ of this sentiment;
 in hopes we may, by that means, arrive at some analogies, which may
 afford a more perfect explication of it. I say, then, that belief is
 nothing but a more vivid, lively, forcible, firm, steady conception of
 an object, than what the imagination alone is ever able to attain. This
 variety of terms, which may seem so unphilosophical, is intended only to
 express that act of the mind, which renders realities, or what is taken
 for such, more present to us than fictions, causes them to weigh more in
 the thought, and gives them a superior influence on the passions and
 imagination. Provided we agree about the thing, it is needless to
 dispute about the terms. The imagination has the command over all its
 ideas, and can join and mix and vary them, in all the ways possible. It
 may conceive fictitious objects with all the circumstances of place and
 time. It may set them, in a manner, before our eyes, in their true
 colours, just as they might have existed. But as it is impossible that
 this faculty of imagination can ever, of itself, reach belief, it is
 evident that belief consists not in the peculiar nature or order of
 ideas, but in the _manner_ of their conception, and in their _feeling_
 to the mind. I confess, that it is impossible perfectly to explain this
 feeling or manner of conception. We may make use of words which express
 something near it. But its true and proper name, as we observed before,
 is _belief_; which is a term that every one sufficiently understands in
 common life. And in philosophy, we can go no farther than assert, that
 _belief_ is something felt by the mind, which distinguishes the ideas of
 the judgement from the fictions of the imagination. It gives them more
 weight and influence; makes them appear of greater importance; enforces
 them in the mind; and renders them the governing principle of our
 actions. I hear at present, for instance, a person's voice, with whom I
 am acquainted; and the sound comes as from the next room. This
 impression of my senses immediately conveys my thought to the person,
 together with all the surrounding objects. I paint them out to myself as
 existing at present, with the same qualities and relations, of which I
 formerly knew them possessed. These ideas take faster hold of my mind
 than ideas of an enchanted castle. They are very different to the
 feeling, and have a much greater influence of every kind, either to give
 pleasure or pain, joy or sorrow.
 
 Let us, then, take in the whole compass of this doctrine, and allow,
 that the sentiment of belief is nothing but a conception more intense
 and steady than what attends the mere fictions of the imagination, and
 that this _manner_ of conception arises from a customary conjunction of
 the object with something present to the memory or senses: I believe
 that it will not be difficult, upon these suppositions, to find other
 operations of the mind analogous to it, and to trace up these phenomena
 to principles still more general.
 
 41. We have already observed that nature has established connexions
 among particular ideas, and that no sooner one idea occurs to our
 thoughts than it introduces its correlative, and carries our attention
 towards it, by a gentle and insensible movement. These principles of
 connexion or association we have reduced to three, namely,
 _Resemblance_, _Contiguity_ and _Causation_; which are the only bonds
 that unite our thoughts together, and beget that regular train of
 reflection or discourse, which, in a greater or less degree, takes place
 among all mankind. Now here arises a question, on which the solution of
 the present difficulty will depend. Does it happen, in all these
 relations, that, when one of the objects is presented to the senses or
 memory, the mind is not only carried to the conception of the
 correlative, but reaches a steadier and stronger conception of it than
 what otherwise it would have been able to attain? This seems to be the
 case with that belief which arises from the relation of cause and
 effect. And if the case be the same with the other relations or
 principles of associations, this may be established as a general law,
 which takes place in all the operations of the mind.
 
 We may, therefore, observe, as the first experiment to our present
 purpose, that, upon the appearance of the picture of an absent friend,
 our idea of him is evidently enlivened by the _resemblance_, and that
 every passion, which that idea occasions, whether of joy or sorrow,
 acquires new force and vigour. In producing this effect, there concur
 both a relation and a present impression. Where the picture bears him no
 resemblance, at least was not intended for him, it never so much as
 conveys our thought to him: And where it is absent, as well as the
 person, though the mind may pass from the thought of the one to that of
 the other, it feels its idea to be rather weakened than enlivened by
 that transition. We take a pleasure in viewing the picture of a friend,
 when it is set before us; but when it is removed, rather choose to
 consider him directly than by reflection in an image, which is equally
 distant and obscure.
 
 The ceremonies of the Roman Catholic religion may be considered as
 instances of the same nature. The devotees of that superstition usually
 plead in excuse for the mummeries, with which they are upbraided, that
 they feel the good effect of those external motions, and postures, and
 actions, in enlivening their devotion and quickening their fervour,
 which otherwise would decay, if directed entirely to distant and
 immaterial objects. We shadow out the objects of our faith, say they, in
 sensible types and images, and render them more present to us by the
 immediate presence of these types, than it is possible for us to do
 merely by an intellectual view and contemplation. Sensible objects have
 always a greater influence on the fancy than any other; and this
 influence they readily convey to those ideas to which they are related,
 and which they resemble. I shall only infer from these practices, and
 this reasoning, that the effect of resemblance in enlivening the ideas
 is very common; and as in every case a resemblance and a present
 impression must concur, we are abundantly supplied with experiments to
 prove the reality of the foregoing principle.
 
 42. We may add force to these experiments by others of a different kind,
 in considering the effects of _contiguity_ as well as of _resemblance_.
 It is certain that distance diminishes the force of every idea, and
 that, upon our approach to any object; though it does not discover
 itself to our senses; it operates upon the mind with an influence, which
 imitates an immediate impression. The thinking on any object readily
 transports the mind to what is contiguous; but it is only the actual
 presence of an object, that transports it with a superior vivacity. When
 I am a few miles from home, whatever relates to it touches me more
 nearly than when I am two hundred leagues distant; though even at that
 distance the reflecting on any thing in the neighbourhood of my friends
 or family naturally produces an idea of them. But as in this latter
 case, both the objects of the mind are ideas; notwithstanding there is
 an easy transition between them; that transition alone is not able to
 give a superior vivacity to any of the ideas, for want of some immediate
 impression[8].
 
     [8] 'Naturane nobis, inquit, datum dicam, an errore quodam, ut,
     cum ea loca videamus, in quibus memoria dignos viros
     acceperimus multum esse versatos, magis moveamur, quam siquando
     eorum ipsorum aut facta audiamus aut scriptum aliquod legamus?
     Velut ego nunc moveor. Venit enim mihi Plato in mentem, quera
     accepimus primum hic disputare solitum: cuius etiam illi
     hortuli propinqui non memoriam solum mihi afferunt, sed ipsum
     videntur in conspectu meo hic ponere. Hic Speusippus, hic
     Xenocrates, hic eius auditor Polemo; cuius ipsa illa sessio
     fuit, quam videmus. Equidem etiam curiam nostram, Hostiliam
     dico, non hanc novam, quae mihi minor esse videtur postquam est
     maior, solebam intuens, Scipionem, Catonem, Laelium, nostrum
     vero in primis avum cogitare. Tanta vis admonitionis est in
     locis; ut non sine causa ex his memoriae deducta sit
     disciplina.'
 
     _Cicero de Finibus_. Lib. v.
 
 43. No one can doubt but causation has the same influence as the other
 two relations of resemblance and contiguity. Superstitious people are
 fond of the reliques of saints and holy men, for the same reason, that
 they seek after types or images, in order to enliven their devotion, and
 give them a more intimate and strong conception of those exemplary
 lives, which they desire to imitate. Now it is evident, that one of the
 best reliques, which a devotee could procure, would be the handywork of
 a saint; and if his cloaths and furniture are ever to be considered in
 this light, it is because they were once at his disposal, and were moved
 and affected by him; in which respect they are to be considered as
 imperfect effects, and as connected with him by a shorter chain of
 consequences than any of those, by which we learn the reality of his
 existence.
 
 Suppose, that the son of a friend, who had been long dead or absent,
 were presented to us; it is evident, that this object would instantly
 revive its correlative idea, and recal to our thoughts all past
 intimacies and familiarities, in more lively colours than they would
 otherwise have appeared to us. This is another phaenomenon, which seems
 to prove the principle above mentioned.
 
 44. We may observe, that, in these phaenomena, the belief of the
 correlative object is always presupposed; without which the relation
 could have no effect. The influence of the picture supposes, that we
 _believe_ our friend to have once existed. Contiguity to home can never
 excite our ideas of home, unless we _believe_ that it really exists. Now
 I assert, that this belief, where it reaches beyond the memory or
 senses, is of a similar nature, and arises from similar causes, with the
 transition of thought and vivacity of conception here explained. When I
 throw a piece of dry wood into a fire, my mind is immediately carried to
 conceive, that it augments, not extinguishes the flame. This transition
 of thought from the cause to the effect proceeds not from reason. It
 derives its origin altogether from custom and experience. And as it
 first begins from an object, present to the senses, it renders the idea
 or conception of flame more strong and lively than any loose, floating
 reverie of the imagination. That idea arises immediately. The thought
 moves instantly towards it, and conveys to it all that force of
 conception, which is derived from the impression present to the senses.
 When a sword is levelled at my breast, does not the idea of wound and
 pain strike me more strongly, than when a glass of wine is presented to
 me, even though by accident this idea should occur after the appearance
 of the latter object? But what is there in this whole matter to cause
 such a strong conception, except only a present object and a customary
 transition to the idea of another object, which we have been accustomed
 to conjoin with the former? This is the whole operation of the mind, in
 all our conclusions concerning matter of fact and existence; and it is a
 satisfaction to find some analogies, by which it may be explained. The
 transition from a present object does in all cases give strength and
 solidity to the related idea.
 
 Here, then, is a kind of pre-established harmony between the course of
 nature and the succession of our ideas; and though the powers and
 forces, by which the former is governed, be wholly unknown to us; yet
 our thoughts and conceptions have still, we find, gone on in the same
 train with the other works of nature. Custom is that principle, by which
 this correspondence has been effected; so necessary to the subsistence
 of our species, and the regulation of our conduct, in every circumstance
 and occurrence of human life. Had not the presence of an object,
 instantly excited the idea of those objects, commonly conjoined with it,
 all our knowledge must have been limited to the narrow sphere of our
 memory and senses; and we should never have been able to adjust means to
 ends, or employ our natural powers, either to the producing of good, or
 avoiding of evil. Those, who delight in the discovery and contemplation
 of _final causes_, have here ample subject to employ their wonder and
 admiration.
 
 45. I shall add, for a further confirmation of the foregoing theory,
 that, as this operation of the mind, by which we infer like effects from
 like causes, and _vice versa_, is so essential to the subsistence of all
 human creatures, it is not probable, that it could be trusted to the
 fallacious deductions of our reason, which is slow in its operations;
 appears not, in any degree, during the first years of infancy; and at
 best is, in every age and period of human life, extremely liable to
 error and mistake. It is more conformable to the ordinary wisdom of
 nature to secure so necessary an act of the mind, by some instinct or
 mechanical tendency, which may be infallible in its operations, may
 discover itself at the first appearance of life and thought, and may be
 independent of all the laboured deductions of the understanding. As
 nature has taught us the use of our limbs, without giving us the
 knowledge of the muscles and nerves, by which they are actuated; so has
 she implanted in us an instinct, which carries forward the thought in a
 correspondent course to that which she has established among external
 objects; though we are ignorant of those powers and forces, on which
 this regular course and succession of objects totally depends.
 
 
 
 SECTION VI.
 
 OF PROBABILITY[9].
 
     [9] Mr. Locke divides all arguments into demonstrative and
     probable. In this view, we must say, that it is only probable
     all men must die, or that the sun will rise to-morrow. But to
     conform our language more to common use, we ought to divide
     arguments into _demonstrations_, _proofs_, and _probabilities_.
     By proofs meaning such arguments from experience as leave no
     room for doubt or opposition.
 
 
 46. Though there be no such thing as _Chance_ in the world; our
 ignorance of the real cause of any event has the same influence on the
 understanding, and begets a like species of belief or opinion.
 
 There is certainly a probability, which arises from a superiority of
 chances on any side; and according as this superiority encreases, and
 surpasses the opposite chances, the probability receives a
 proportionable encrease, and begets still a higher degree of belief or
 assent to that side, in which we discover the superiority. If a dye were
 marked with one figure or number of spots on four sides, and with
 another figure or number of spots on the two remaining sides, it would
 be more probable, that the former would turn up than the latter; though,
 if it had a thousand sides marked in the same manner, and only one side
 different, the probability would be much higher, and our belief or
 expectation of the event more steady and secure. This process of the
 thought or reasoning may seem trivial and obvious; but to those who
 consider it more narrowly, it may, perhaps, afford matter for curious
 speculation.
 
 It seems evident, that, when the mind looks forward to discover the
 event, which may result from the throw of such a dye, it considers the
 turning up of each particular side as alike probable; and this is the
 very nature of chance, to render all the particular events, comprehended
 in it, entirely equal. But finding a greater number of sides concur in
 the one event than in the other, the mind is carried more frequently to
 that event, and meets it oftener, in revolving the various possibilities
 or chances, on which the ultimate result depends. This concurrence of
 several views in one particular event begets immediately, by an
 inexplicable contrivance of nature, the sentiment of belief, and gives
 that event the advantage over its antagonist, which is supported by a
 smaller number of views, and recurs less frequently to the mind. If we
 allow, that belief is nothing but a firmer and stronger conception of an
 object than what attends the mere fictions of the imagination, this
 operation may, perhaps, in some measure, be accounted for. The
 concurrence of these several views or glimpses imprints the idea more
 strongly on the imagination; gives it superior force and vigour; renders
 its influence on the passions and affections more sensible; and in a
 word, begets that reliance or security, which constitutes the nature of
 belief and opinion.
 
 47. The case is the same with the probability of causes, as with that of
 chance. There are some causes, which are entirely uniform and constant
 in producing a particular effect; and no instance has ever yet been
 found of any failure or irregularity in their operation. Fire has always
 burned, and water suffocated every human creature: The production of
 motion by impulse and gravity is an universal law, which has hitherto
 admitted of no exception. But there are other causes, which have been
 found more irregular and uncertain; nor has rhubarb always proved a
 purge, or opium a soporific to every one, who has taken these medicines.
 It is true, when any cause fails of producing its usual effect,
 philosophers ascribe not this to any irregularity in nature; but
 suppose, that some secret causes, in the particular structure of parts,
 have prevented the operation. Our reasonings, however, and conclusions
 concerning the event are the same as if this principle had no place.
 Being determined by custom to transfer the past to the future, in all
 our inferences; where the past has been entirely regular and uniform, we
 expect the event with the greatest assurance, and leave no room for any
 contrary supposition. But where different effects have been found to
 follow from causes, which are to _appearance_ exactly similar, all these
 various effects must occur to the mind in transferring the past to the
 future, and enter into our consideration, when we determine the
 probability of the event. Though we give the preference to that which
 has been found most usual, and believe that this effect will exist, we
 must not overlook the other effects, but must assign to each of them a
 particular weight and authority, in proportion as we have found it to be
 more or less frequent. It is more probable, in almost every country of
 Europe, that there will be frost sometime in January, than that the
 weather will continue open throughout that whole month; though this
 probability varies according to the different climates, and approaches
 to a certainty in the more northern kingdoms. Here then it seems
 evident, that, when we transfer the past to the future, in order to
 determine the effect, which will result from any cause, we transfer all
 the different events, in the same proportion as they have appeared in
 the past, and conceive one to have existed a hundred times, for
 instance, another ten times, and another once. As a great number of
 views do here concur in one event, they fortify and confirm it to the
 imagination, beget that sentiment which we call _belief,_ and give its
 object the preference above the contrary event, which is not supported
 by an equal number of experiments, and recurs not so frequently to the
 thought in transferring the past to the future. Let any one try to
 account for this operation of the mind upon any of the received systems
 of philosophy, and he will be sensible of the difficulty. For my part, I
 shall think it sufficient, if the present hints excite the curiosity of
 philosophers, and make them sensible how defective all common theories
 are in treating of such curious and such sublime subjects.
 
 
 
 SECTION VII.
 
 OF THE IDEA OF NECESSARY CONNEXION.
 
 PART I.
 
 
 48. The great advantage of the mathematical sciences above the moral
 consists in this, that the ideas of the former, being sensible, are
 always clear and determinate, the smallest distinction between them is
 immediately perceptible, and the same terms are still expressive of the
 same ideas, without ambiguity or variation. An oval is never mistaken
 for a circle, nor an hyperbola for an ellipsis. The isosceles and
 scalenum are distinguished by boundaries more exact than vice and
 virtue, right and wrong. If any term be defined in geometry, the mind
 readily, of itself, substitutes, on all occasions, the definition for
 the term defined: Or even when no definition is employed, the object
 itself may be presented to the senses, and by that means be steadily and
 clearly apprehended. But the finer sentiments of the mind, the
 operations of the understanding, the various agitations of the passions,
 though really in themselves distinct, easily escape us, when surveyed by
 reflection; nor is it in our power to recal the original object, as
 often as we have occasion to contemplate it. Ambiguity, by this means,
 is gradually introduced into our reasonings: Similar objects are readily
 taken to be the same: And the conclusion becomes at last very wide of
 the premises.
 
 One may safely, however, affirm, that, if we consider these sciences in
 a proper light, their advantages and disadvantages nearly compensate
 each other, and reduce both of them to a state of equality. If the mind,
 with greater facility, retains the ideas of geometry clear and
 determinate, it must carry on a much longer and more intricate chain of
 reasoning, and compare ideas much wider of each other, in order to reach
 the abstruser truths of that science. And if moral ideas are apt,
 without extreme care, to fall into obscurity and confusion, the
 inferences are always much shorter in these disquisitions, and the
 intermediate steps, which lead to the conclusion, much fewer than in the
 sciences which treat of quantity and number. In reality, there is
 scarcely a proposition in Euclid so simple, as not to consist of more
 parts, than are to be found in any moral reasoning which runs not into
 chimera and conceit. Where we trace the principles of the human mind
 through a few steps, we may be very well satisfied with our progress;
 considering how soon nature throws a bar to all our enquiries concerning
 causes, and reduces us to an acknowledgment of our ignorance. The chief
 obstacle, therefore, to our improvement in the moral or metaphysical
 sciences is the obscurity of the ideas, and ambiguity of the terms. The
 principal difficulty in the mathematics is the length of inferences and
 compass of thought, requisite to the forming of any conclusion. And,
 perhaps, our progress in natural philosophy is chiefly retarded by the
 want of proper experiments and phaenomena, which are often discovered by
 chance, and cannot always be found, when requisite, even by the most
 diligent and prudent enquiry. As moral philosophy seems hitherto to have
 received less improvement than either geometry or physics, we may
 conclude, that, if there be any difference in this respect among these
 sciences, the difficulties, which obstruct the progress of the former,
 require superior care and capacity to be surmounted.
 
 49. There are no ideas, which occur in metaphysics, more obscure and
 uncertain, than those of _power, force, energy_ or _necessary
 connexion_, of which it is every moment necessary for us to treat in all
 our disquisitions. We shall, therefore, endeavour, in this section, to
 fix, if possible, the precise meaning of these terms, and thereby remove
 some part of that obscurity, which is so much complained of in this
 species of philosophy.
 
 It seems a proposition, which will not admit of much dispute, that all
 our ideas are nothing but copies of our impressions, or, in other words,
 that it is impossible for us to _think_ of any thing, which we have not
 antecedently _felt_, either by our external or internal senses. I have
 endeavoured[10] to explain and prove this proposition, and have expressed
 my hopes, that, by a proper application of it, men may reach a greater
 clearness and precision in philosophical reasonings, than what they have
 hitherto been able to attain. Complex ideas may, perhaps, be well known
 by definition, which is nothing but an enumeration of those parts or
 simple ideas, that compose them. But when we have pushed up definitions
 to the most simple ideas, and find still some ambiguity and obscurity;
 what resource are we then possessed of? By what invention can we throw
 light upon these ideas, and render them altogether precise and
 determinate to our intellectual view? Produce the impressions or
 original sentiments, from which the ideas are copied. These impressions
 are all strong and sensible. They admit not of ambiguity. They are not
 only placed in a full light themselves, but may throw light on their
 correspondent ideas, which lie in obscurity. And by this means, we may,
 perhaps, attain a new microscope or species of optics, by which, in the
 moral sciences, the most minute, and most simple ideas may be so
 enlarged as to fall readily under our apprehension, and be equally known
 with the grossest and most sensible ideas, that can be the object of
 our enquiry.
 
     [10] Section II.
 
 50. To be fully acquainted, therefore, with the idea of power or
 necessary connexion, let us examine its impression; and in order to find
 the impression with greater certainty, let us search for it in all the
 sources, from which it may possibly be derived.
 
 When we look about us towards external objects, and consider the
 operation of causes, we are never able, in a single instance, to
 discover any power or necessary connexion; any quality, which binds the
 effect to the cause, and renders the one an infallible consequence of
 the other. We only find, that the one does actually, in fact, follow the
 other. The impulse of one billiard-ball is attended with motion in the
 second. This is the whole that appears to the _outward_ senses. The mind
 feels no sentiment or _inward_ impression from this succession of
 objects: Consequently, there is not, in any single, particular instance
 of cause and effect, any thing which can suggest the idea of power or
 necessary connexion.
 
 From the first appearance of an object, we never can conjecture what
 effect will result from it. But were the power or energy of any cause
 discoverable by the mind, we could foresee the effect, even without
 experience; and might, at first, pronounce with certainty concerning it,
 by mere dint of thought and reasoning.
 
 In reality, there is no part of matter, that does ever, by its sensible
 qualities, discover any power or energy, or give us ground to imagine,
 that it could produce any thing, or be followed by any other object,
 which we could denominate its effect. Solidity, extension, motion; these
 qualities are all complete in themselves, and never point out any other
 event which may result from them. The scenes of the universe are
 continually shifting, and one object follows another in an uninterrupted
 succession; but the power of force, which actuates the whole machine, is
 entirely concealed from us, and never discovers itself in any of the
 sensible qualities of body. We know, that, in fact, heat is a constant
 attendant of flame; but what is the connexion between them, we have no
 room so much as to conjecture or imagine. It is impossible, therefore,
 that the idea of power can be derived from the contemplation of bodies,
 in single instances of their operation; because no bodies ever discover
 any power, which can be the original of this idea.[11]
 
     [11] Mr. Locke, in his chapter of power, says that, finding
     from experience, that there are several new productions in
     nature, and concluding that there must somewhere be a power
     capable of producing them, we arrive at last by this reasoning
     at the idea of power. But no reasoning can ever give us a new,
     original, simple idea; as this philosopher himself confesses.
     This, therefore, can never be the origin of that idea.
 
 51. Since, therefore, external objects as they appear to the senses,
 give us no idea of power or necessary connexion, by their operation in
 particular instances, let us see, whether this idea be derived from
 reflection on the operations of our own minds, and be copied from any
 internal impression. It may be said, that we are every moment conscious
 of internal power; while we feel, that, by the simple command of our
 will, we can move the organs of our body, or direct the faculties of our
 mind. An act of volition produces motion in our limbs, or raises a new
 idea in our imagination. This influence of the will we know by
 consciousness. Hence we acquire the idea of power or energy; and are
 certain, that we ourselves and all other intelligent beings are
 possessed of power. This idea, then, is an idea of reflection, since it
 arises from reflecting on the operations of our own mind, and on the
 command which is exercised by will, both over the organs of the body and
 faculties of the soul.
 
 52. We shall proceed to examine this pretension; and first with regard
 to the influence of volition over the organs of the body. This
 influence, we may observe, is a fact, which, like all other natural
 events, can be known only by experience, and can never be foreseen from
 any apparent energy or power in the cause, which connects it with the
 effect, and renders the one an infallible consequence of the other. The
 motion of our body follows upon the command of our will. Of this we are
 every moment conscious. But the means, by which this is effected; the
 energy, by which the will performs so extraordinary an operation; of
 this we are so far from being immediately conscious, that it must for
 ever escape our most diligent enquiry.
 
 For _first_; is there any principle in all nature more mysterious than
 the union of soul with body; by which a supposed spiritual substance
 acquires such an influence over a material one, that the most refined
 thought is able to actuate the grossest matter? Were we empowered, by a
 secret wish, to remove mountains, or control the planets in their orbit;
 this extensive authority would not be more extraordinary, nor more
 beyond our comprehension. But if by consciousness we perceived any power
 or energy in the will, we must know this power; we must know its
 connexion with the effect; we must know the secret union of soul and
 body, and the nature of both these substances; by which the one is able
 to operate, in so many instances, upon the other.
 
 _Secondly_, We are not able to move all the organs of the body with a
 like authority; though we cannot assign any reason besides experience,
 for so remarkable a difference between one and the other. Why has the
 will an influence over the tongue and fingers, not over the heart or
 liver? This question would never embarrass us, were we conscious of a
 power in the former case, not in the latter. We should then perceive,
 independent of experience, why the authority of will over the organs of
 the body is circumscribed within such particular limits. Being in that
 case fully acquainted with the power or force, by which it operates, we
 should also know, why its influence reaches precisely to such
 boundaries, and no farther.
 
 A man, suddenly struck with palsy in the leg or arm, or who had newly
 lost those members, frequently endeavours, at first to move them, and
 employ them in their usual offices. Here he is as much conscious of
 power to command such limbs, as a man in perfect health is conscious of
 power to actuate any member which remains in its natural state and
 condition. But consciousness never deceives. Consequently, neither in
 the one case nor in the other, are we ever conscious of any power. We
 learn the influence of our will from experience alone. And experience
 only teaches us, how one event constantly follows another; without
 instructing us in the secret connexion, which binds them together, and
 renders them inseparable.
 
 _Thirdly,_ We learn from anatomy, that the immediate object of power in
 voluntary motion, is not the member itself which is moved, but certain
 muscles, and nerves, and animal spirits, and, perhaps, something still
 more minute and more unknown, through which the motion is successively
 propagated, ere it reach the member itself whose motion is the immediate
 object of volition. Can there be a more certain proof, that the power,
 by which this whole operation is performed, so far from being directly
 and fully known by an inward sentiment or consciousness, is, to the last
 degree mysterious and unintelligible? Here the mind wills a certain
 event: Immediately another event, unknown to ourselves, and totally
 different from the one intended, is produced: This event produces
 another, equally unknown: Till at last, through a long succession, the
 desired event is produced. But if the original power were felt, it must
 be known: Were it known, its effect also must be known; since all power
 is relative to its effect. And _vice versa,_ if the effect be not known,
 the power cannot be known nor felt. How indeed can we be conscious of a
 power to move our limbs, when we have no such power; but only that to
 move certain animal spirits, which, though they produce at last the
 motion of our limbs, yet operate in such a manner as is wholly beyond
 our comprehension?
 
 We may, therefore, conclude from the whole, I hope, without any
 temerity, though with assurance; that our idea of power is not copied
 from any sentiment or consciousness of power within ourselves, when we
 give rise to animal motion, or apply our limbs to their proper use and
 office. That their motion follows the command of the will is a matter of
 common experience, like other natural events: But the power or energy by
 which this is effected, like that in other natural events, is unknown
 and inconceivable.[12]
 
     [12] It may be pretended, that the resistance which we meet
     with in bodies, obliging us frequently to exert our force, and
     call up all our power, this gives us the idea of force and
     power. It is this _nisus_, or strong endeavour, of which we are
     conscious, that is the original impression from which this idea
     is copied. But, first, we attribute power to a vast number of
     objects, where we never can suppose this resistance or exertion
     of force to take place; to the Supreme Being, who never meets
     with any resistance; to the mind in its command over its ideas
     and limbs, in common thinking and motion, where the effect
     follows immediately upon the will, without any exertion or
     summoning up of force; to inanimate matter, which is not
     capable of this sentiment. _Secondly,_ This sentiment of an
     endeavour to overcome resistance has no known connexion with
     any event: What follows it, we know by experience; but could
     not know it _a priori._ It must, however, be confessed, that
     the animal _nisus,_ which we experience, though it can afford
     no accurate precise idea of power, enters very much into that
     vulgar, inaccurate idea, which is formed of it.
 
 53. Shall we then assert, that we are conscious of a power or energy in
 our own minds, when, by an act or command of our will, we raise up a new
 idea, fix the mind to the contemplation of it, turn it on all sides, and
 at last dismiss it for some other idea, when we think that we have
 surveyed it with sufficient accuracy? I believe the same arguments will
 prove, that even this command of the will gives us no real idea of force
 or energy.
 
 _First,_ It must be allowed, that, when we know a power, we know that
 very circumstance in the cause, by which it is enabled to produce the
 effect: For these are supposed to be synonimous. We must, therefore,
 know both the cause and effect, and the relation between them. But do we
 pretend to be acquainted with the nature of the human soul and the
 nature of an idea, or the aptitude of the one to produce the other? This
 is a real creation; a production of something out of nothing: Which
 implies a power so great, that it may seem, at first sight, beyond the
 reach of any being, less than infinite. At least it must be owned, that
 such a power is not felt, nor known, nor even conceivable by the mind.
 We only feel the event, namely, the existence of an idea, consequent to
 a command of the will: But the manner, in which this operation is
 performed, the power by which it is produced, is entirely beyond our
 comprehension.
 
 _Secondly_, The command of the mind over itself is limited, as well as
 its command over the body; and these limits are not known by reason, or
 any acquaintance with the nature of cause and effect, but only by
 experience and observation, as in all other natural events and in the
 operation of external objects. Our authority over our sentiments and
 passions is much weaker than that over our ideas; and even the latter
 authority is circumscribed within very narrow boundaries. Will any one
 pretend to assign the ultimate reason of these boundaries, or show why
 the power is deficient in one case, not in another.
 
 _Thirdly_, This self-command is very different at different times. A man
 in health possesses more of it than one languishing with sickness. We
 are more master of our thoughts in the morning than in the evening:
 Fasting, than after a full meal. Can we give any reason for these
 variations, except experience? Where then is the power, of which we
 pretend to be conscious? Is there not here, either in a spiritual or
 material substance, or both, some secret mechanism or structure of
 parts, upon which the effect depends, and which, being entirely unknown
 to us, renders the power or energy of the will equally unknown and
 incomprehensible?
 
 Volition is surely an act of the mind, with which we are sufficiently
 acquainted. Reflect upon it. Consider it on all sides. Do you find
 anything in it like this creative power, by which it raises from nothing
 a new idea, and with a kind of _Fiat_, imitates the omnipotence of its
 Maker, if I may be allowed so to speak, who called forth into existence
 all the various scenes of nature? So far from being conscious of this
 energy in the will, it requires as certain experience as that of which
 we are possessed, to convince us that such extraordinary effects do ever
 result from a simple act of volition.
 
 54. The generality of mankind never find any difficulty in accounting
 for the more common and familiar operations of nature--such as the
 descent of heavy bodies, the growth of plants, the generation of
 animals, or the nourishment of bodies by food: But suppose that, in all
 these cases, they perceive the very force or energy of the cause, by
 which it is connected with its effect, and is for ever infallible in its
 operation. They acquire, by long habit, such a turn of mind, that, upon
 the appearance of the cause, they immediately expect with assurance its
 usual attendant, and hardly conceive it possible that any other event
 could result from it. It is only on the discovery of extraordinary
 phaenomena, such as earthquakes, pestilence, and prodigies of any kind,
 that they find themselves at a loss to assign a proper cause, and to
 explain the manner in which the effect is produced by it. It is usual
 for men, in such difficulties, to have recourse to some invisible
 intelligent principle[13] as the immediate cause of that event which
 surprises them, and which, they think, cannot be accounted for from the
 common powers of nature. But philosophers, who carry their scrutiny a
 little farther, immediately perceive that, even in the most familiar
 events, the energy of the cause is as unintelligible as in the most
 unusual, and that we only learn by experience the frequent _Conjunction_
 of objects, without being ever able to comprehend anything like
 _Connexion_ between them.
 
     [13] [Greek: theos apo maechanaes.]
 
 55. Here, then, many philosophers think themselves obliged by reason to
 have recourse, on all occasions, to the same principle, which the vulgar
 never appeal to but in cases that appear miraculous and supernatural.
 They acknowledge mind and intelligence to be, not only the ultimate and
 original cause of all things, but the immediate and sole cause of every
 event which appears in nature. They pretend that those objects which are
 commonly denominated _causes,_ are in reality nothing but _occasions;_
 and that the true and direct principle of every effect is not any power
 or force in nature, but a volition of the Supreme Being, who wills that
 such particular objects should for ever be conjoined with each other.
 Instead of saying that one billiard-ball moves another by a force which
 it has derived from the author of nature, it is the Deity himself, they
 say, who, by a particular volition, moves the second ball, being
 determined to this operation by the impulse of the first ball, in
 consequence of those general laws which he has laid down to himself in
 the government of the universe. But philosophers advancing still in
 their inquiries, discover that, as we are totally ignorant of the power
 on which depends the mutual operation of bodies, we are no less ignorant
 of that power on which depends the operation of mind on body, or of body
 on mind; nor are we able, either from our senses or consciousness, to
 assign the ultimate principle in one case more than in the other. The
 same ignorance, therefore, reduces them to the same conclusion. They
 assert that the Deity is the immediate cause of the union between soul
 and body; and that they are not the organs of sense, which, being
 agitated by external objects, produce sensations in the mind; but that
 it is a particular volition of our omnipotent Maker, which excites such
 a sensation, in consequence of such a motion in the organ. In like
 manner, it is not any energy in the will that produces local motion in
 our members: It is God himself, who is pleased to second our will, in
 itself impotent, and to command that motion which we erroneously
 attribute to our own power and efficacy. Nor do philosophers stop at
 this conclusion. They sometimes extend the same inference to the mind
 itself, in its internal operations. Our mental vision or conception of
 ideas is nothing but a revelation made to us by our Maker. When we
 voluntarily turn our thoughts to any object, and raise up its image in
 the fancy, it is not the will which creates that idea: It is the
 universal Creator, who discovers it to the mind, and renders it
 present to us.
 
 56. Thus, according to these philosophers, every thing is full of God.
 Not content with the principle, that nothing exists but by his will,
 that nothing possesses any power but by his concession: They rob nature,
 and all created beings, of every power, in order to render their
 dependence on the Deity still more sensible and immediate. They consider
 not that, by this theory, they diminish, instead of magnifying, the
 grandeur of those attributes, which they affect so much to celebrate. It
 argues surely more power in the Deity to delegate a certain degree of
 power to inferior creatures than to produce every thing by his own
 immediate volition. It argues more wisdom to contrive at first the
 fabric of the world with such perfect foresight that, of itself, and by
 its proper operation, it may serve all the purposes of providence, than
 if the great Creator were obliged every moment to adjust its parts, and
 animate by his breath all the wheels of that stupendous machine.
 
 But if we would have a more philosophical confutation of this theory,
 perhaps the two following reflections may suffice.
 
 57. _First_, it seems to me that this theory of the universal energy and
 operation of the Supreme Being is too bold ever to carry conviction with
 it to a man, sufficiently apprized of the weakness of human reason, and
 the narrow limits to which it is confined in all its operations. Though
 the chain of arguments which conduct to it were ever so logical, there
 must arise a strong suspicion, if not an absolute assurance, that it has
 carried us quite beyond the reach of our faculties, when it leads to
 conclusions so extraordinary, and so remote from common life and
 experience. We are got into fairy land, long ere we have reached the
 last steps of our theory; and _there_ we have no reason to trust our
 common methods of argument, or to think that our usual analogies and
 probabilities have any authority. Our line is too short to fathom such
 immense abysses. And however we may flatter ourselves that we are
 guided, in every step which we take, by a kind of verisimilitude and
 experience, we may be assured that this fancied experience has no
 authority when we thus apply it to subjects that lie entirely out of the
 sphere of experience. But on this we shall have occasion to touch
 afterwards.[14]
 
     [14] Section XII.
 
 _Secondly,_ I cannot perceive any force in the arguments on which this
 theory is founded. We are ignorant, it is true, of the manner in which
 bodies operate on each other: Their force or energy is entirely
 incomprehensible: But are we not equally ignorant of the manner or force
 by which a mind, even the supreme mind, operates either on itself or on
 body? Whence, I beseech you, do we acquire any idea of it? We have no
 sentiment or consciousness of this power in ourselves. We have no idea
 of the Supreme Being but what we learn from reflection on our own
 faculties. Were our ignorance, therefore, a good reason for rejecting
 any thing, we should be led into that principle of denying all energy in
 the Supreme Being as much as in the grossest matter. We surely
 comprehend as little the operations of one as of the other. Is it more
 difficult to conceive that motion may arise from impulse than that it
 may arise from volition? All we know is our profound ignorance in
 both cases[15].
 
     [15] I need not examine at length the _vis inertiae_ which is
     so much talked of in the new philosophy, and which is ascribed
     to matter. We find by experience, that a body at rest or in
     motion continues for ever in its present state, till put from
     it by some new cause; and that a body impelled takes as much
     motion from the impelling body as it acquires itself. These are
     facts. When we call this a _vis inertiae_, we only mark these
     facts, without pretending to have any idea of the inert power;
     in the same manner as, when we talk of gravity, we mean certain
     effects, without comprehending that active power. It was never
     the meaning of Sir ISAAC NEWTON to rob second causes of all
     force or energy; though some of his followers have endeavoured
     to establish that theory upon his authority. On the contrary,
     that great philosopher had recourse to an etherial active fluid
     to explain his universal attraction; though he was so cautious
     and modest as to allow, that it was a mere hypothesis, not to
     be insisted on, without more experiments. I must confess, that
     there is something in the fate of opinions a little
     extraordinary. DES CARTES insinuated that doctrine of the
     universal and sole efficacy of the Deity, without insisting on
     it. MALEBRANCHE and other CARTESIANS made it the foundation of
     all their philosophy. It had, however, no authority in England.
     LOCKE, CLARKE, and CUDWORTH, never so much as take notice of
     it, but suppose all along, that matter has a real, though
     subordinate and derived power. By what means has it become so
     prevalent among our modern metaphysicians?
 
 
 PART II.
 
 
 58. But to hasten to a conclusion of this argument, which is already
 drawn out to too great a length: We have sought in vain for an idea of
 power or necessary connexion in all the sources from which we could
 suppose it to be derived. It appears that, in single instances of the
 operation of bodies, we never can, by our utmost scrutiny, discover any
 thing but one event following another, without being able to comprehend
 any force or power by which the cause operates, or any connexion between
 it and its supposed effect. The same difficulty occurs in contemplating
 the operations of mind on body--where we observe the motion of the
 latter to follow upon the volition of the former, but are not able to
 observe or conceive the tie which binds together the motion and
 volition, or the energy by which the mind produces this effect. The
 authority of the will over its own faculties and ideas is not a whit
 more comprehensible: So that, upon the whole, there appears not,
 throughout all nature, any one instance of connexion which is
 conceivable by us. All events seem entirely loose and separate. One
 event follows another; but we never can observe any tie between them.
 They seem _conjoined_, but never _connected_. And as we can have no idea
 of any thing which never appeared to our outward sense or inward
 sentiment, the necessary conclusion _seems_ to be that we have no idea
 of connexion or power at all, and that these words are absolutely
 without any meaning, when employed either in philosophical reasonings or
 common life.
 
 59. But there still remains one method of avoiding this conclusion, and
 one source which we have not yet examined. When any natural object or
 event is presented, it is impossible for us, by any sagacity or
 penetration, to discover, or even conjecture, without experience, what
 event will result from it, or to carry our foresight beyond that object
 which is immediately present to the memory and senses. Even after one
 instance or experiment where we have observed a particular event to
 follow upon another, we are not entitled to form a general rule, or
 foretell what will happen in like cases; it being justly esteemed an
 unpardonable temerity to judge of the whole course of nature from one
 single experiment, however accurate or certain. But when one particular
 species of event has always, in all instances, been conjoined with
 another, we make no longer any scruple of foretelling one upon the
 appearance of the other, and of employing that reasoning, which can
 alone assure us of any matter of fact or existence. We then call the one
 object, _Cause;_ the other, _Effect._ We suppose that there is some
 connexion between them; some power in the one, by which it infallibly
 produces the other, and operates with the greatest certainty and
 strongest necessity.
 
 It appears, then, that this idea of a necessary connexion among events
 arises from a number of similar instances which occur of the constant
 conjunction of these events; nor can that idea ever be suggested by any
 one of these instances, surveyed in all possible lights and positions.
 But there is nothing in a number of instances, different from every
 single instance, which is supposed to be exactly similar; except only,
 that after a repetition of similar instances, the mind is carried by
 habit, upon the appearance of one event, to expect its usual attendant,
 and to believe that it will exist. This connexion, therefore, which we
 _feel_ in the mind, this customary transition of the imagination from
 one object to its usual attendant, is the sentiment or impression from
 which we form the idea of power or necessary connexion. Nothing farther
 is in the case. Contemplate the subject on all sides; you will never
 find any other origin of that idea. This is the sole difference between
 one instance, from which we can never receive the idea of connexion, and
 a number of similar instances, by which it is suggested. The first time
 a man saw the communication of motion by impulse, as by the shock of two
 billiard balls, he could not pronounce that the one event was
 _connected:_ but only that it was _conjoined_ with the other. After he
 has observed several instances of this nature, he then pronounces them
 to be _connected._ What alteration has happened to give rise to this new
 idea of _connexion?_ Nothing but that he now _feels_ these events to be
 connected in his imagination, and can readily foretell the existence of
 one from the appearance of the other. When we say, therefore, that one
 object is connected with another, we mean only that they have acquired a
 connexion in our thought, and give rise to this inference, by which they
 become proofs of each other's existence: A conclusion which is somewhat
 extraordinary, but which seems founded on sufficient evidence. Nor will
 its evidence be weakened by any general diffidence of the understanding,
 or sceptical suspicion concerning every conclusion which is new and
 extraordinary. No conclusions can be more agreeable to scepticism than
 such as make discoveries concerning the weakness and narrow limits of
 human reason and capacity.
 
 60. And what stronger instance can be produced of the surprising
 ignorance and weakness of the understanding than the present? For
 surely, if there be any relation among objects which it imports to us to
 know perfectly, it is that of cause and effect. On this are founded all
 our reasonings concerning matter of fact or existence. By means of it
 alone we attain any assurance concerning objects which are removed from
 the present testimony of our memory and senses. The only immediate
 utility of all sciences, is to teach us, how to control and regulate
 future events by their causes. Our thoughts and enquiries are,
 therefore, every moment, employed about this relation: Yet so imperfect
 are the ideas which we form concerning it, that it is impossible to give
 any just definition of cause, except what is drawn from something
 extraneous and foreign to it. Similar objects are always conjoined with
 similar. Of this we have experience. Suitably to this experience,
 therefore, we may define a cause to be _an object, followed by another,
 and where all the objects similar to the first are followed by objects
 similar to the second_. Or in other words _where, if the first object
 had not been, the second never had existed_. The appearance of a cause
 always conveys the mind, by a customary transition, to the idea of the
 effect. Of this also we have experience. We may, therefore, suitably to
 this experience, form another definition of cause, and call it, _an
 object followed by another, and whose appearance always conveys the
 thought to that other._ But though both these definitions be drawn from
 circumstances foreign to the cause, we cannot remedy this inconvenience,
 or attain any more perfect definition, which may point out that
 circumstance in the cause, which gives it a connexion with its effect.
 We have no idea of this connexion, nor even any distinct notion what it
 is we desire to know, when we endeavour at a conception of it. We say,
 for instance, that the vibration of this string is the cause of this
 particular sound. But what do we mean by that affirmation? We either
 mean _that this vibration is followed by this sound, and that all
 similar vibrations have been followed by similar sounds:_ Or, _that this
 vibration is followed by this sound, and that upon the appearance of one
 the mind anticipates the senses, and forms immediately an idea of the
 other._ We may consider the relation of cause and effect in either of
 these two lights; but beyond these, we have no idea of it.[16]
 
     [16] According to these explications and definitions, the idea
     of _power_ is relative as much as that of _cause;_ and both
     have a reference to an effect, or some other event constantly
     conjoined with the former. When we consider the _unknown_
     circumstance of an object, by which the degree or quantity of
     its effect is fixed and determined, we call that its power: And
     accordingly, it is allowed by all philosophers, that the effect
     is the measure of the power. But if they had any idea of power,
     as it is in itself, why could not they Measure it in itself?
     The dispute whether the force of a body in motion be as its
     velocity, or the square of its velocity; this dispute, I say,
     need not be decided by comparing its effects in equal or
     unequal times; but by a direct mensuration and comparison.
 
     As to the frequent use of the words, Force, Power, Energy, &c.,
     which every where occur in common conversation, as well as in
     philosophy; that is no proof, that we are acquainted, in any
     instance, with the connecting principle between cause and
     effect, or can account ultimately for the production of one
     thing to another. These words, as commonly used, have very
     loose meanings annexed to them; and their ideas are very
     uncertain and confused. No animal can put external bodies in
     motion without the sentiment of a _nisus_ or endeavour; and
     every animal has a sentiment or feeling from the stroke or blow
     of an external object, that is in motion. These sensations,
     which are merely animal, and from which we can _a priori_ draw
     no inference, we are apt to transfer to inanimate objects, and
     to suppose, that they have some such feelings, whenever they
     transfer or receive motion. With regard to energies, which are
     exerted, without our annexing to them any idea of communicated
     motion, we consider only the constant experienced conjunction
     of the events; and as we _feel_ a customary connexion between
     the ideas, we transfer that feeling to the objects; as nothing
     is more usual than to apply to external bodies every internal
     sensation, which they occasion.
 
 61. To recapitulate, therefore, the reasonings of this section: Every
 idea is copied from some preceding impression or sentiment; and where we
 cannot find any impression, we may be certain that there is no idea. In
 all single instances of the operation of bodies or minds, there is
 nothing that produces any impression, nor consequently can suggest any
 idea of power or necessary connexion. But when many uniform instances
 appear, and the same object is always followed by the same event; we
 then begin to entertain the notion of cause and connexion. We then
 _feel_ a new sentiment or impression, to wit, a customary connexion in
 the thought or imagination between one object and its usual attendant;
 and this sentiment is the original of that idea which we seek for. For
 as this idea arises from a number of similar instances, and not from any
 single instance, it must arise from that circumstance, in which the
 number of instances differ from every individual instance. But this
 customary connexion or transition of the imagination is the only
 circumstance in which they differ. In every other particular they are
 alike. The first instance which we saw of motion communicated by the
 shock of two billiard balls (to return to this obvious illustration) is
 exactly similar to any instance that may, at present, occur to us;
 except only, that we could not, at first, _infer_ one event from the
 other; which we are enabled to do at present, after so long a course of
 uniform experience. I know not whether the reader will readily apprehend
 this reasoning. I am afraid that, should I multiply words about it, or
 throw it into a greater variety of lights, it would only become more
 obscure and intricate. In all abstract reasonings there is one point of
 view which, if we can happily hit, we shall go farther towards
 illustrating the subject than by all the eloquence and copious
 expression in the world. This point of view we should endeavour to
 reach, and reserve the flowers of rhetoric for subjects which are more
 adapted to them.
 
 
 
 SECTION VIII.
 
 OF LIBERTY AND NECESSITY.
 
 
 PART I.
 
 
 62. It might reasonably be expected in questions which have been
 canvassed and disputed with great eagerness, since the first origin of
 science and philosophy, that the meaning of all the terms, at least,
 should have been agreed upon among the disputants; and our enquiries, in
 the course of two thousand years, been able to pass from words to the
 true and real subject of the controversy. For how easy may it seem to
 give exact definitions of the terms employed in reasoning, and make
 these definitions, not the mere sound of words, the object of future
 scrutiny and examination? But if we consider the matter more narrowly,
 we shall be apt to draw a quite opposite conclusion. From this
 circumstance alone, that a controversy has been long kept on foot, and
 remains still undecided, we may presume that there is some ambiguity in
 the expression, and that the disputants affix different ideas to the
 terms employed in the controversy. For as the faculties of the mind are
 supposed to be naturally alike in every individual; otherwise nothing
 could be more fruitless than to reason or dispute together; it were
 impossible, if men affix the same ideas to their terms, that they could
 so long form different opinions of the same subject; especially when
 they communicate their views, and each party turn themselves on all
 sides, in search of arguments which may give them the victory over their
 antagonists. It is true, if men attempt the discussion of questions
 which lie entirely beyond the reach of human capacity, such as those
 concerning the origin of worlds, or the economy of the intellectual
 system or region of spirits, they may long beat the air in their
 fruitless contests, and never arrive at any determinate conclusion. But
 if the question regard any subject of common life and experience,
 nothing, one would think, could preserve the dispute so long undecided
 but some ambiguous expressions, which keep the antagonists still at a
 distance, and hinder them from grappling with each other.
 
 63. This has been the case in the long disputed question concerning
 liberty and necessity; and to so remarkable a degree that, if I be not
 much mistaken, we shall find, that all mankind, both learned and
 ignorant, have always been of the same opinion with regard to this
 subject, and that a few intelligible definitions would immediately have
 put an end to the whole controversy. I own that this dispute has been so
 much canvassed on all hands, and has led philosophers into such a
 labyrinth of obscure sophistry, that it is no wonder, if a sensible
 reader indulge his ease so far as to turn a deaf ear to the proposal of
 such a question, from which he can expect neither instruction or
 entertainment. But the state of the argument here proposed may, perhaps,
 serve to renew his attention; as it has more novelty, promises at least
 some decision of the controversy, and will not much disturb his ease by
 any intricate or obscure reasoning.
 
 I hope, therefore, to make it appear that all men have ever agreed in
 the doctrine both of necessity and of liberty, according to any
 reasonable sense, which can be put on these terms; and that the whole
 controversy has hitherto turned merely upon words. We shall begin with
 examining the doctrine of necessity.
 
 64. It is universally allowed that matter, in all its operations, is
 actuated by a necessary force, and that every natural effect is so
 precisely determined by the energy of its cause that no other effect, in
 such particular circumstances, could possibly have resulted from it. The
 degree and direction of every motion is, by the laws of nature,
 prescribed with such exactness that a living creature may as soon arise
 from the shock of two bodies as motion in any other degree or direction
 than what is actually produced by it. Would we, therefore, form a just
 and precise idea of _necessity_, we must consider whence that idea
 arises when we apply it to the operation of bodies.
 
 It seems evident that, if all the scenes of nature were continually
 shifted in such a manner that no two events bore any resemblance to each
 other, but every object was entirely new, without any similitude to
 whatever had been seen before, we should never, in that case, have
 attained the least idea of necessity, or of a connexion among these
 objects. We might say, upon such a supposition, that one object or event
 has followed another; not that one was produced by the other. The
 relation of cause and effect must be utterly unknown to mankind.
 Inference and reasoning concerning the operations of nature would, from
 that moment, be at an end; and the memory and senses remain the only
 canals, by which the knowledge of any real existence could possibly have
 access to the mind. Our idea, therefore, of necessity and causation
 arises entirely from the uniformity observable in the operations of
 nature, where similar objects are constantly conjoined together, and the
 mind is determined by custom to infer the one from the appearance of the
 other. These two circumstances form the whole of that necessity, which
 we ascribe to matter. Beyond the constant _conjunction_ of similar
 objects, and the consequent _inference_ from one to the other, we have
 no notion of any necessity or connexion.
 
 If it appear, therefore, that all mankind have ever allowed, without any
 doubt or hesitation, that these two circumstances take place in the
 voluntary actions of men, and in the operations of mind; it must follow,
 that all mankind have ever agreed in the doctrine of necessity, and that
 they have hitherto disputed, merely for not understanding each other.
 
 65. As to the first circumstance, the constant and regular conjunction
 of similar events, we may possibly satisfy ourselves by the following
 considerations. It is universally acknowledged that there is a great
 uniformity among the actions of men, in all nations and ages, and that
 human nature remains still the same, in its principles and operations.
 The same motives always produce the same actions. The same events follow
 from the same causes. Ambition, avarice, self-love, vanity, friendship,
 generosity, public spirit: these passions, mixed in various degrees, and
 distributed through society, have been, from the beginning of the world,
 and still are, the source of all the actions and enterprises, which have
 ever been observed among mankind. Would you know the sentiments,
 inclinations, and course of life of the Greeks and Romans? Study well
 the temper and actions of the French and English: You cannot be much
 mistaken in transferring to the former _most_ of the observations which
 you have made with regard to the latter. Mankind are so much the same,
 in all times and places, that history informs us of nothing new or
 strange in this particular. Its chief use is only to discover the
 constant and universal principles of human nature, by showing men in all
 varieties of circumstances and situations, and furnishing us with
 materials from which we may form our observations and become acquainted
 with the regular springs of human action and behaviour. These records of
 wars, intrigues, factions, and revolutions, are so many collections of
 experiments, by which the politician or moral philosopher fixes the
 principles of his science, in the same manner as the physician or
 natural philosopher becomes acquainted with the nature of plants,
 minerals, and other external objects, by the experiments which he forms
 concerning them. Nor are the earth, water, and other elements, examined
 by Aristotle, and Hippocrates, more like to those which at present lie
 under our observation than the men described by Polybius and Tacitus are
 to those who now govern the world.
 
 Should a traveller, returning from a far country, bring us an account of
 men, wholly different from any with whom we were ever acquainted; men,
 who were entirely divested of avarice, ambition, or revenge; who knew no
 pleasure but friendship, generosity, and public spirit; we should
 immediately, from these circumstances, detect the falsehood, and prove
 him a liar, with the same certainty as if he had stuffed his narration
 with stories of centaurs and dragons, miracles and prodigies. And if we
 would explode any forgery in history, we cannot make use of a more
 convincing argument, than to prove, that the actions ascribed to any
 person are directly contrary to the course of nature, and that no human
 motives, in such circumstances, could ever induce him to such a conduct.
 The veracity of Quintus Curtius is as much to be suspected, when he
 describes the supernatural courage of Alexander, by which he was hurried
 on singly to attack multitudes, as when he describes his supernatural
 force and activity, by which he was able to resist them. So readily and
 universally do we acknowledge a uniformity in human motives and actions
 as well as in the operations of body.
 
 Hence likewise the benefit of that experience, acquired by long life and
 a variety of business and company, in order to instruct us in the
 principles of human nature, and regulate our future conduct, as well as
 speculation. By means of this guide, we mount up to the knowledge of
 men's inclinations and motives, from their actions, expressions, and
 even gestures; and again descend to the interpretation of their actions
 from our knowledge of their motives and inclinations. The general
 observations treasured up by a course of experience, give us the clue of
 human nature, and teach us to unravel all its intricacies. Pretexts and
 appearances no longer deceive us. Public declarations pass for the
 specious colouring of a cause. And though virtue and honour be allowed
 their proper weight and authority, that perfect disinterestedness, so
 often pretended to, is never expected in multitudes and parties; seldom
 in their leaders; and scarcely even in individuals of any rank or
 station. But were there no uniformity in human actions, and were every
 experiment which we could form of this kind irregular and anomalous, it
 were impossible to collect any general observations concerning mankind;
 and no experience, however accurately digested by reflection, would ever
 serve to any purpose. Why is the aged husbandman more skilful in his
 calling than the young beginner but because there is a certain
 uniformity in the operation of the sun, rain, and earth towards the
 production of vegetables; and experience teaches the old practitioner
 the rules by which this operation is governed and directed.
 
 66. We must not, however, expect that this uniformity of human actions
 should be carried to such a length as that all men, in the same
 circumstances, will always act precisely in the same manner, without
 making any allowance for the diversity of characters, prejudices, and
 opinions. Such a uniformity in every particular, is found in no part of
 nature. On the contrary, from observing the variety of conduct in
 different men, we are enabled to form a greater variety of maxims, which
 still suppose a degree of uniformity and regularity.
 
 Are the manners of men different in different ages and countries? We
 learn thence the great force of custom and education, which mould the
 human mind from its infancy and form it into a fixed and established
 character. Is the behaviour and conduct of the one sex very unlike that
 of the other? Is it thence we become acquainted with the different
 characters which nature has impressed upon the sexes, and which she
 preserves with constancy and regularity? Are the actions of the same
 person much diversified in the different periods of his life, from
 infancy to old age? This affords room for many general observations
 concerning the gradual change of our sentiments and inclinations, and
 the different maxims which prevail in the different ages of human
 creatures. Even the characters, which are peculiar to each individual,
 have a uniformity in their influence; otherwise our acquaintance with
 the persons and our observation of their conduct could never teach us
 their dispositions, or serve to direct our behaviour with regard
 to them.
 
 67. I grant it possible to find some actions, which seem to have no
 regular connexion with any known motives, and are exceptions to all the
 measures of conduct which have ever been established for the government
 of men. But if we would willingly know what judgement should be formed
 of such irregular and extraordinary actions, we may consider the
 sentiments commonly entertained with regard to those irregular events
 which appear in the course of nature, and the operations of external
 objects. All causes are not conjoined to their usual effects with like
 uniformity. An artificer, who handles only dead matter, may be
 disappointed of his aim, as well as the politician, who directs the
 conduct of sensible and intelligent agents.
 
 The vulgar, who take things according to their first appearance,
 attribute the uncertainty of events to such an uncertainty in the causes
 as makes the latter often fail of their usual influence; though they
 meet with no impediment in their operation. But philosophers, observing
 that, almost in every part of nature, there is contained a vast variety
 of springs and principles, which are hid, by reason of their minuteness
 or remoteness, find, that it is at least possible the contrariety of
 events may not proceed from any contingency in the cause, but from the
 secret operation of contrary causes. This possibility is converted into
 certainty by farther observation, when they remark that, upon an exact
 scrutiny, a contrariety of effects always betrays a contrariety of
 causes, and proceeds from their mutual opposition. A peasant can give no
 better reason for the stopping of any clock or watch than to say that it
 does not commonly go right: But an artist easily perceives that the same
 force in the spring or pendulum has always the same influence on the
 wheels; but fails of its usual effect, perhaps by reason of a grain of
 dust, which puts a stop to the whole movement. From the observation of
 several parallel instances, philosophers form a maxim that the connexion
 between all causes and effects is equally necessary, and that its
 seeming uncertainty in some instances proceeds from the secret
 opposition of contrary causes.
 
 Thus, for instance, in the human body, when the usual symptoms of health
 or sickness disappoint our expectation; when medicines operate not with
 their wonted powers; when irregular events follow from any particular
 cause; the philosopher and physician are not surprised at the matter,
 nor are ever tempted to deny, in general, the necessity and uniformity
 of those principles by which the animal economy is conducted. They know
 that a human body is a mighty complicated machine: That many secret
 powers lurk in it, which are altogether beyond our comprehension: That
 to us it must often appear very uncertain in its operations: And that
 therefore the irregular events, which outwardly discover themselves, can
 be no proof that the laws of nature are not observed with the greatest
 regularity in its internal operations and government.
 
 68. The philosopher, if he be consistent, must apply the same reasoning
 to the actions and volitions of intelligent agents. The most irregular
 and unexpected resolutions of men may frequently be accounted for by
 those who know every particular circumstance of their character and
 situation. A person of an obliging disposition gives a peevish answer:
 But he has the toothache, or has not dined. A stupid fellow discovers an
 uncommon alacrity in his carriage: But he has met with a sudden piece of
 good fortune. Or even when an action, as sometimes happens, cannot be
 particularly accounted for, either by the person himself or by others;
 we know, in general, that the characters of men are, to a certain
 degree, inconstant and irregular. This is, in a manner, the constant
 character of human nature; though it be applicable, in a more particular
 manner, to some persons who have no fixed rule for their conduct, but
 proceed in a continued course of caprice and inconstancy. The internal
 principles and motives may operate in a uniform manner, notwithstanding
 these seeming irregularities; in the same manner as the winds, rain,
 clouds, and other variations of the weather are supposed to be governed
 by steady principles; though not easily discoverable by human sagacity
 and enquiry.
 
 69. Thus it appears, not only that the conjunction between motives and
 voluntary actions is as regular and uniform as that between the cause
 and effect in any part of nature; but also that this regular conjunction
 has been universally acknowledged among mankind, and has never been the
 subject of dispute, either in philosophy or common life. Now, as it is
 from past experience that we draw all inferences concerning the future,
 and as we conclude that objects will always be conjoined together which
 we find to have always been conjoined; it may seem superfluous to prove
 that this experienced uniformity in human actions is a source whence we
 draw _inferences_ concerning them. But in order to throw the argument
 into a greater variety of lights we shall also insist, though briefly,
 on this latter topic.
 
 The mutual dependence of men is so great in all societies that scarce
 any human action is entirely complete in itself, or is performed without
 some reference to the actions of others, which are requisite to make it
 answer fully the intention of the agent. The poorest artificer, who
 labours alone, expects at least the protection of the magistrate, to
 ensure him the enjoyment of the fruits of his labour. He also expects
 that, when he carries his goods to market, and offers them at a
 reasonable price, he shall find purchasers, and shall be able, by the
 money he acquires, to engage others to supply him with those commodities
 which are requisite for his subsistence. In proportion as men extend
 their dealings, and render their intercourse with others more
 complicated, they always comprehend, in their schemes of life, a greater
 variety of voluntary actions, which they expect, from the proper
 motives, to co-operate with their own. In all these conclusions they
 take their measures from past experience, in the same manner as in their
 reasonings concerning external objects; and firmly believe that men, as
 well as all the elements, are to continue, in their operations, the same
 that they have ever found them. A manufacturer reckons upon the labour
 of his servants for the execution of any work as much as upon the tools
 which he employs, and would be equally surprised were his expectations
 disappointed. In short, this experimental inference and reasoning
 concerning the actions of others enters so much into human life that no
 man, while awake, is ever a moment without employing it. Have we not
 reason, therefore, to affirm that all mankind have always agreed in the
 doctrine of necessity according to the foregoing definition and
 explication of it?
 
 70. Nor have philosophers ever entertained a different opinion from the
 people in this particular. For, not to mention that almost every action
 of their life supposes that opinion, there are even few of the
 speculative parts of learning to which it is not essential. What would
 become of _history,_ had we not a dependence on the veracity of the
 historian according to the experience which we have had of mankind? How
 could _politics_ be a science, if laws and forms of goverment had not a
 uniform influence upon society? Where would be the foundation of
 _morals,_ if particular characters had no certain or determinate power
 to produce particular sentiments, and if these sentiments had no
 constant operation on actions? And with what pretence could we employ
 our _criticism_ upon any poet or polite author, if we could not
 pronounce the conduct and sentiments of his actors either natural or
 unnatural to such characters, and in such circumstances? It seems almost
 impossible, therefore, to engage either in science or action of any kind
 without acknowledging the doctrine of necessity, and this _inference_
 from motive to voluntary actions, from characters to conduct.
 
 And indeed, when we consider how aptly _natural_ and _moral_ evidence
 link together, and form only one chain of argument, we shall make no
 scruple to allow that they are of the same nature, and derived from the
 same principles. A prisoner who has neither money nor interest,
 discovers the impossibility of his escape, as well when he considers the
 obstinacy of the gaoler, as the walls and bars with which he is
 surrounded; and, in all attempts for his freedom, chooses rather to work
 upon the stone and iron of the one, than upon the inflexible nature of
 the other. The same prisoner, when conducted to the scaffold, foresees
 his death as certainly from the constancy and fidelity of his guards, as
 from the operation of the axe or wheel. His mind runs along a certain
 train of ideas: The refusal of the soldiers to consent to his escape;
 the action of the executioner; the separation of the head and body;
 bleeding, convulsive motions, and death. Here is a connected chain of
 natural causes and voluntary actions; but the mind feels no difference
 between them in passing from one link to another: Nor is less certain of
 the future event than if it were connected with the objects present to
 the memory or senses, by a train of causes, cemented together by what we
 are pleased to call a _physical_ necessity. The same experienced union
 has the same effect on the mind, whether the united objects be motives,
 volition, and actions; or figure and motion. We may change the name of
 things; but their nature and their operation on the understanding
 never change.
 
 Were a man, whom I know to be honest and opulent, and with whom I live
 in intimate friendship, to come into my house, where I am surrounded
 with my servants, I rest assured that he is not to stab me before he
 leaves it in order to rob me of my silver standish; and I no more
 suspect this event than the falling of the house itself, which is new,
 and solidly built and founded._--But he may have been seized with a
 sudden and unknown frenzy.--_So may a sudden earthquake arise, and shake
 and tumble my house about my ears. I shall therefore change the
 suppositions. I shall say that I know with certainty that he is not to
 put his hand into the fire and hold it there till it be consumed: And
 this event, I think I can foretell with the same assurance, as that, if
 he throw himself out at the window, and meet with no obstruction, he
 will not remain a moment suspended in the air. No suspicion of an
 unknown frenzy can give the least possibility to the former event, which
 is so contrary to all the known principles of human nature. A man who at
 noon leaves his purse full of gold on the pavement at Charing-Cross, may
 as well expect that it will fly away like a feather, as that he will
 find it untouched an hour after. Above one half of human reasonings
 contain inferences of a similar nature, attended with more or less
 degrees of certainty proportioned to our experience of the usual conduct
 of mankind in such particular situations.
 
 71. I have frequently considered, what could possibly be the reason why
 all mankind, though they have ever, without hesitation, acknowledged the
 doctrine of necessity in their whole practice and reasoning, have yet
 discovered such a reluctance to acknowledge it in words, and have rather
 shown a propensity, in all ages, to profess the contrary opinion. The
 matter, I think, may be accounted for after the following manner. If we
 examine the operations of body, and the production of effects from their
 causes, we shall find that all our faculties can never carry us farther
 in our knowledge of this relation than barely to observe that particular
 objects are _constantly conjoined_ together, and that the mind is
 carried, by a _customary transition,_ from the appearance of one to the
 belief of the other. But though this conclusion concerning human
 ignorance be the result of the strictest scrutiny of this subject, men
 still entertain a strong propensity to believe that they penetrate
 farther into the powers of nature, and perceive something like a
 necessary connexion between the cause and the effect. When again they
 turn their reflections towards the operations of their own minds, and
 _feel_ no such connexion of the motive and the action; they are thence
 apt to suppose, that there is a difference between the effects which
 result from material force, and those which arise from thought and
 intelligence. But being once convinced that we know nothing farther of
 causation of any kind than merely the _constant conjunction_ of objects,
 and the consequent _inference_ of the mind from one to another, and
 finding that these two circumstances are universally allowed to have
 place in voluntary actions; we may be more easily led to own the same
 necessity common to all causes. And though this reasoning may contradict
 the systems of many philosophers, in ascribing necessity to the
 determinations of the will, we shall find, upon reflection, that they
 dissent from it in words only, not in their real sentiment. Necessity,
 according to the sense in which it is here taken, has never yet been
 rejected, nor can ever, I think, be rejected by any philosopher. It may
 only, perhaps, be pretended that the mind can perceive, in the
 operations of matter, some farther connexion between the cause and
 effect; and connexion that has not place in voluntary actions of
 intelligent beings. Now whether it be so or not, can only appear upon
 examination; and it is incumbent on these philosophers to make good
 their assertion, by defining or describing that necessity, and pointing
 it out to us in the operations of material causes.
 
 72. It would seem, indeed, that men begin at the wrong end of this
 question concerning liberty and necessity, when they enter upon it by
 examining the faculties of the soul, the influence of the understanding,
 and the operations of the will. Let them first discuss a more simple
 question, namely, the operations of body and of brute unintelligent
 matter; and try whether they can there form any idea of causation and
 necessity, except that of a constant conjunction of objects, and
 subsequent inference of the mind from one to another. If these
 circumstances form, in reality, the whole of that necessity, which we
 conceive in matter, and if these circumstances be also universally
 acknowledged to take place in the operations of the mind, the dispute is
 at an end; at least, must be owned to be thenceforth merely verbal. But
 as long as we will rashly suppose, that we have some farther idea of
 necessity and causation in the operations of external objects; at the
 same time, that we can find nothing farther in the voluntary actions of
 the mind; there is no possibility of bringing the question to any
 determinate issue, while we proceed upon so erroneous a supposition. The
 only method of undeceiving us is to mount up higher; to examine the
 narrow extent of science when applied to material causes; and to
 convince ourselves that all we know of them is the constant conjunction
 and inference above mentioned. We may, perhaps, find that it is with
 difficulty we are induced to fix such narrow limits to human
 understanding: But we can afterwards find no difficulty when we come to
 apply this doctrine to the actions of the will. For as it is evident
 that these have a regular conjunction with motives and circumstances and
 characters, and as we always draw inferences from one to the other, we
 must be obliged to acknowledge in words that necessity, which we have
 already avowed, in every deliberation of our lives, and in every step of
 our conduct and behaviour.[17]
 
     [17] The prevalence of the doctrine of liberty may be accounted
     for, from another cause, viz. a false sensation or seeming
     experience which we have, or may have, of liberty or
     indifference, in many of our actions. The necessity of any
     action, whether of matter or of mind, is not, properly
     speaking, a quality in the agent, but in any thinking or
     intelligent being, who may consider the action; and it consists
     chiefly in the determination of his thoughts to infer the
     existence of that action from some preceding objects; as
     liberty, when opposed to necessity, is nothing but the want of
     that determination, and a certain looseness or indifference,
     which we feel, in passing, or not passing, from the idea of one
     object to that of any succeeding one. Now we may observe,
     that, though, in _reflecting_ on human actions, we seldom feel
     such a looseness, or indifference, but are commonly able to
     infer them with considerable certainty from their motives, and
     from the dispositions of the agent; yet it frequently happens,
     that, in _performing_ the actions themselves, we are sensible
     of something like it: And as all resembling objects are readily
     taken for each other, this has been employed as a demonstrative
     and even intuitive proof of human liberty. We feel, that our
     actions are subject to our will, on most occasions; and imagine
     we feel, that the will itself is subject to nothing, because,
     when by a denial of it we are provoked to try, we feel, that it
     moves easily every way, and produces an image of itself (or a
     _Velleity,_ as it is called in the schools) even on that side,
     on which it did not settle. This image, or faint motion, we
     persuade ourselves, could, at that time, have been compleated
     into the thing itself; because, should that be denied, we find,
     upon a second trial, that, at present, it can. We consider not,
     that the fantastical desire of shewing liberty, is here the
     motive of our actions. And it seems certain, that, however we
     may imagine we feel a liberty within ourselves, a spectator can
     commonly infer our actions from our motives and character; and
     even where he cannot, he concludes in general, that he might,
     were he perfectly acquainted with every circumstance of our
     situation and temper, and the most secret springs of our
     complexion and disposition. Now this is the very essence of
     necessity, according to the foregoing doctrine.
 
 73. But to proceed in this reconciling project with regard to the
 question of liberty and necessity; the most contentious question of
 metaphysics, the most contentious science; it will not require many
 words to prove, that all mankind have ever agreed in the doctrine of
 liberty as well as in that of necessity, and that the whole dispute, in
 this respect also, has been hitherto merely verbal. For what is meant by
 liberty, when applied to voluntary actions? We cannot surely mean that
 actions have so little connexion with motives, inclinations, and
 circumstances, that one does not follow with a certain degree of
 uniformity from the other, and that one affords no inference by which we
 can conclude the existence of the other. For these are plain and
 acknowledged matters of fact. By liberty, then, we can only mean _a
 power of acting or not acting, according to the determinations of the
 will;_ that is, if we choose to remain at rest, we may; if we choose to
 move, we also may. Now this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed
 to belong to every one who is not a prisoner and in chains. Here, then,
 is no subject of dispute.
 
 74. Whatever definition we may give of liberty, we should be careful to
 observe two requisite circumstances; _first,_ that it be consistent with
 plain matter of fact; _secondly,_ that it be consistent with itself. If
 we observe these circumstances, and render our definition intelligible,
 I am persuaded that all mankind will be found of one opinion with
 regard to it.
 
 It is universally allowed that nothing exists without a cause of its
 existence, and that chance, when strictly examined, is a mere negative
 word, and means not any real power which has anywhere a being in nature.
 But it is pretended that some causes are necessary, some not necessary.
 Here then is the advantage of definitions. Let any one _define_ a cause,
 without comprehending, as a part of the definition, a _necessary
 connexion_ with its effect; and let him show distinctly the origin of
 the idea, expressed by the definition; and I shall readily give up the
 whole controversy. But if the foregoing explication of the matter be
 received, this must be absolutely impracticable. Had not objects a
 regular conjunction with each other, we should never have entertained
 any notion of cause and effect; and this regular conjunction produces
 that inference of the understanding, which is the only connexion, that
 we can have any comprehension of. Whoever attempts a definition of
 cause, exclusive of these circumstances, will be obliged either to
 employ unintelligible terms or such as are synonymous to the term which
 he endeavours to define.[18] And if the definition above mentioned be
 admitted; liberty, when opposed to necessity, not to constraint, is the
 same thing with chance; which is universally allowed to have no
 existence.
 
     [18] Thus, if a cause be defined, _that which produces any
     thing;_ it is easy to observe, that _producing_ is synonymous
     to _causing._ In like manner, if a cause be defined, _that by
     which any thing exists;_ this is liable to the same objection.
     For what is meant by these words, _by which?_ Had it been said,
     that a cause is _that_ after which _any thing constantly
     exists;_ we should have understood the terms. For this is,
     indeed, all we know of the matter. And this constancy forms the
     very essence of necessity, nor have we any other idea of it.
 
 
 PART II.
 
 
 75. There is no method of reasoning more common, and yet none more
 blameable, than, in philosophical disputes, to endeavour the refutation
 of any hypothesis, by a pretence of its dangerous consequences to
 religion and morality. When any opinion leads to absurdities, it is
 certainly false; but it is not certain that an opinion is false, because
 it is of dangerous consequence. Such topics, therefore, ought entirely
 to be forborne; as serving nothing to the discovery of truth, but only
 to make the person of an antagonist odious. This I observe in general,
 without pretending to draw any advantage from it. I frankly submit to
 an examination of this kind, and shall venture to affirm that the
 doctrines, both of necessity and of liberty, as above explained, are not
 only consistent with morality, but are absolutely essential to
 its support.
 
 Necessity may be defined two ways, conformably to the two definitions of
 _cause_, of which it makes an essential part. It consists either in the
 constant conjunction of like objects, or in the inference of the
 understanding from one object to another. Now necessity, in both these
 senses, (which, indeed, are at bottom the same) has universally, though
 tacitly, in the schools, in the pulpit, and in common life, been allowed
 to belong to the will of man; and no one has ever pretended to deny that
 we can draw inferences concerning human actions, and that those
 inferences are founded on the experienced union of like actions, with
 like motives, inclinations, and circumstances. The only particular in
 which any one can differ, is, that either, perhaps, he will refuse to
 give the name of necessity to this property of human actions: But as
 long as the meaning is understood, I hope the word can do no harm: Or
 that he will maintain it possible to discover something farther in the
 operations of matter. But this, it must be acknowledged, can be of no
 consequence to morality or religion, whatever it may be to natural
 philosophy or metaphysics. We may here be mistaken in asserting that
 there is no idea of any other necessity or connexion in the actions of
 body: But surely we ascribe nothing to the actions of the mind, but what
 everyone does, and must readily allow of. We change no circumstance in
 the received orthodox system with regard to the will, but only in that
 with regard to material objects and causes. Nothing, therefore, can be
 more innocent, at least, than this doctrine.
 
 76. All laws being founded on rewards and punishments, it is supposed as
 a fundamental principle, that these motives have a regular and uniform
 influence on the mind, and both produce the good and prevent the evil
 actions. We may give to this influence what name we please; but, as it
 is usually conjoined with the action, it must be esteemed a _cause_, and
 be looked upon as an instance of that necessity, which we would here
 establish.
 
 The only proper object of hatred or vengeance is a person or creature,
 endowed with thought and consciousness; and when any criminal or
 injurious actions excite that passion, it is only by their relation to
 the person, or connexion with him. Actions are, by their very nature,
 temporary and perishing; and where they proceed not from some _cause_ in
 the character and disposition of the person who performed them, they can
 neither redound to his honour, if good; nor infamy, if evil. The actions
 themselves may be blameable; they may be contrary to all the rules of
 morality and religion: But the person is not answerable for them; and as
 they proceeded from nothing in him that is durable and constant, and
 leave nothing of that nature behind them, it is impossible he can, upon
 their account, become the object of punishment or vengeance. According
 to the principle, therefore, which denies necessity, and consequently
 causes, a man is as pure and untainted, after having committed the most
 horrid crime, as at the first moment of his birth, nor is his character
 anywise concerned in his actions, since they are not derived from it,
 and the wickedness of the one can never be used as a proof of the
 depravity of the other.
 
 Men are not blamed for such actions as they perform ignorantly and
 casually, whatever may be the consequences. Why? but because the
 principles of these actions are only momentary, and terminate in them
 alone. Men are less blamed for such actions as they perform hastily and
 unpremeditately than for such as proceed from deliberation. For what
 reason? but because a hasty temper, though a constant cause or
 principle in the mind, operates only by intervals, and infects not the
 whole character. Again, repentance wipes off every crime, if attended
 with a reformation of life and manners. How is this to be accounted for?
 but by asserting that actions render a person criminal merely as they
 are proofs of criminal principles in the mind; and when, by an
 alteration of these principles, they cease to be just proofs, they
 likewise cease to be criminal. But, except upon the doctrine of
 necessity, they never were just proofs, and consequently never
 were criminal.
 
 77. It will be equally easy to prove, and from the same arguments, that
 _liberty_, according to that definition above mentioned, in which all
 men agree, is also essential to morality, and that no human actions,
 where it is wanting, are susceptible of any moral qualities, or can be
 the objects either of approbation or dislike. For as actions are objects
 of our moral sentiment, so far only as they are indications of the
 internal character, passions, and affections; it is impossible that they
 can give rise either to praise or blame, where they proceed not from
 these principles, but are derived altogether from external violence.
 
 78. I pretend not to have obviated or removed all objections to this
 theory, with regard to necessity and liberty. I can foresee other
 objections, derived from topics which have not here been treated of. It
 may be said, for instance, that, if voluntary actions be subjected to
 the same laws of necessity with the operations of matter, there is a
 continued chain of necessary causes, pre-ordained and pre-determined,
 reaching from the original cause of all to every single volition of
 every human creature. No contingency anywhere in the universe; no
 indifference; no liberty. While we act, we are, at the same time, acted
 upon. The ultimate Author of all our volitions is the Creator of the
 world, who first bestowed motion on this immense machine, and placed all
 beings in that particular position, whence every subsequent event, by
 an inevitable necessity, must result. Human actions, therefore, either
 can have no moral turpitude at all, as proceeding from so good a cause;
 or if they have any turpitude, they must involve our Creator in the same
 guilt, while he is acknowledged to be their ultimate cause and author.
 For as a man, who fired a mine, is answerable for all the consequences
 whether the train he employed be long or short; so wherever a continued
 chain of necessary causes is fixed, that Being, either finite or
 infinite, who produces the first, is likewise the author of all the
 rest, and must both bear the blame and acquire the praise which belong
 to them. Our clear and unalterable ideas of morality establish this
 rule, upon unquestionable reasons, when we examine the consequences of
 any human action; and these reasons must still have greater force when
 applied to the volitions and intentions of a Being infinitely wise and
 powerful. Ignorance or impotence may be pleaded for so limited a
 creature as man; but those imperfections have no place in our Creator.
 He foresaw, he ordained, he intended all those actions of men, which we
 so rashly pronounce criminal. And we must therefore conclude, either
 that they are not criminal, or that the Deity, not man, is accountable
 for them. But as either of these positions is absurd and impious, it
 follows, that the doctrine from which they are deduced cannot possibly
 be true, as being liable to all the same objections. An absurd
 consequence, if necessary, proves the original doctrine to be absurd; in
 the same manner as criminal actions render criminal the original cause,
 if the connexion between them be necessary and evitable.
 
 This objection consists of two parts, which we shall examine separately;
 _First_, that, if human actions can be traced up, by a necessary chain,
 to the Deity, they can never be criminal; on account of the infinite
 perfection of that Being from whom they are derived, and who can intend
 nothing but what is altogether good and laudable. Or, _Secondly_, if
 they be criminal, we must retract the attribute of perfection, which we
 ascribe to the Deity, and must acknowledge him to be the ultimate author
 of guilt and moral turpitude in all his creatures.
 
 79. The answer to the first objection seems obvious and convincing.
 There are many philosophers who, after an exact scrutiny of all the
 phenomena of nature, conclude, that the WHOLE, considered as one system,
 is, in every period of its existence, ordered with perfect benevolence;
 and that the utmost possible happiness will, in the end, result to all
 created beings, without any mixture of positive or absolute ill or
 misery. Every physical ill, say they, makes an essential part of this
 benevolent system, and could not possibly be removed, even by the Deity
 himself, considered as a wise agent, without giving entrance to greater
 ill, or excluding greater good, which will result from it. From this
 theory, some philosophers, and the ancient _Stoics_ among the rest,
 derived a topic of consolation under all afflictions, while they taught
 their pupils that those ills under which they laboured were, in reality,
 goods to the universe; and that to an enlarged view, which could
 comprehend the whole system of nature, every event became an object of
 joy and exultation. But though this topic be specious and sublime, it
 was soon found in practice weak and ineffectual. You would surely more
 irritate than appease a man lying under the racking pains of the gout by
 preaching up to him the rectitude of those general laws, which produced
 the malignant humours in his body, and led them through the proper
 canals, to the sinews and nerves, where they now excite such acute
 torments. These enlarged views may, for a moment, please the imagination
 of a speculative man, who is placed in ease and security; but neither
 can they dwell with constancy on his mind, even though undisturbed by
 the emotions of pain or passion; much less can they maintain their
 ground when attacked by such powerful antagonists. The affections take a
 narrower and more natural survey of their object; and by an economy,
 more suitable to the infirmity of human minds, regard alone the beings
 around us, and are actuated by such events as appear good or ill to the
 private system.
 
 80. The case is the same with _moral_ as with _physical_ ill. It cannot
 reasonably be supposed, that those remote considerations, which are
 found of so little efficacy with regard to one, will have a more
 powerful influence with regard to the other. The mind of man is so
 formed by nature that, upon the appearance of certain characters,
 dispositions, and actions, it immediately feels the sentiment of
 approbation or blame; nor are there any emotions more essential to its
 frame and constitution. The characters which engage our approbation are
 chiefly such as contribute to the peace and security of human society;
 as the characters which excite blame are chiefly such as tend to public
 detriment and disturbance: Whence it may reasonably be presumed, that
 the moral sentiments arise, either mediately or immediately, from a
 reflection of these opposite interests. What though philosophical
 meditations establish a different opinion or conjecture; that everything
 is right with regard to the WHOLE, and that the qualities, which disturb
 society, are, in the main, as beneficial, and are as suitable to the
 primary intention of nature as those which more directly promote its
 happiness and welfare? Are such remote and uncertain speculations able
 to counterbalance the sentiments which arise from the natural and
 immediate view of the objects? A man who is robbed of a considerable
 sum; does he find his vexation for the loss anywise diminished by these
 sublime reflections? Why then should his moral resentment against the
 crime be supposed incompatible with them? Or why should not the
 acknowledgment of a real distinction between vice and virtue be
 reconcileable to all speculative systems of philosophy, as well as that
 of a real distinction between personal beauty and deformity? Both these
 distinctions are founded in the natural sentiments of the human mind:
 And these sentiments are not to be controuled or altered by any
 philosophical theory or speculation whatsoever.
 
 81. The _second_ objection admits not of so easy and satisfactory an
 answer; nor is it possible to explain distinctly, how the Deity can be
 the mediate cause of all the actions of men, without being the author of
 sin and moral turpitude. These are mysteries, which mere natural and
 unassisted reason is very unfit to handle; and whatever system she
 embraces, she must find herself involved in inextricable difficulties,
 and even contradictions, at every step which she takes with regard to
 such subjects. To reconcile the indifference and contingency of human
 actions with prescience; or to defend absolute decrees, and yet free the
 Deity from being the author of sin, has been found hitherto to exceed
 all the power of philosophy. Happy, if she be thence sensible of her
 temerity, when she pries into these sublime mysteries; and leaving a
 scene so full of obscurities and perplexities, return, with suitable
 modesty, to her true and proper province, the examination of common
 life; where she will find difficulties enough to employ her enquiries,
 without launching into so boundless an ocean of doubt, uncertainty, and
 contradiction!
 
 
 
 SECTION IX.
 
 OF THE REASON OF ANIMALS.
 
 
 82. All our reasonings concerning matter of fact are founded on a
 species of Analogy, which leads us to expect from any cause the same
 events, which we have observed to result from similar causes. Where the
 causes are entirely similar, the analogy is perfect, and the inference,
 drawn from it, is regarded as certain and conclusive: nor does any man
 ever entertain a doubt, where he sees a piece of iron, that it will have
 weight and cohesion of parts; as in all other instances, which have ever
 fallen under his observation. But where the objects have not so exact a
 similarity, the analogy is less perfect, and the inference is less
 conclusive; though still it has some force, in proportion to the degree
 of similarity and resemblance. The anatomical observations, formed upon
 one animal, are, by this species of reasoning, extended to all animals;
 and it is certain, that when the circulation of the blood, for instance,
 is clearly proved to have place in one creature, as a frog, or fish, it
 forms a strong presumption, that the same principle has place in all.
 These analogical observations may be carried farther, even to this
 science, of which we are now treating; and any theory, by which we
 explain the operations of the understanding, or the origin and connexion
 of the passions in man, will acquire additional authority, if we find,
 that the same theory is requisite to explain the same phenomena in all
 other animals. We shall make trial of this, with regard to the
 hypothesis, by which we have, in the foregoing discourse, endeavoured
 to account for all experimental reasonings; and it is hoped, that this
 new point of view will serve to confirm all our former observations.
 
 83. _First_, It seems evident, that animals as well as men learn many
 things from experience, and infer, that the same events will always
 follow from the same causes. By this principle they become acquainted
 with the more obvious properties of external objects, and gradually,
 from their birth, treasure up a knowledge of the nature of fire, water,
 earth, stones, heights, depths, &c., and of the effects which result
 from their operation. The ignorance and inexperience of the young are
 here plainly distinguishable from the cunning and sagacity of the old,
 who have learned, by long observation, to avoid what hurt them, and to
 pursue what gave ease or pleasure. A horse, that has been accustomed to
 the field, becomes acquainted with the proper height which he can leap,
 and will never attempt what exceeds his force and ability. An old
 greyhound will trust the more fatiguing part of the chace to the
 younger, and will place himself so as to meet the hare in her doubles;
 nor are the conjectures, which he forms on this occasion, founded in any
 thing but his observation and experience.
 
 This is still more evident from the effects of discipline and education
 on animals, who, by the proper application of rewards and punishments,
 may be taught any course of action, and most contrary to their natural
 instincts and propensities. Is it not experience, which renders a dog
 apprehensive of pain, when you menace him, or lift up the whip to beat
 him? Is it not even experience, which makes him answer to his name, and
 infer, from such an arbitrary sound, that you mean him rather than any
 of his fellows, and intend to call him, when you pronounce it in a
 certain manner, and with a certain tone and accent?
 
 In all these cases, we may observe, that the animal infers some fact
 beyond what immediately strikes his senses; and that this inference is
 altogether founded on past experience, while the creature expects from
 the present object the same consequences, which it has always found in
 its observation to result from similar objects.
 
 84. _Secondly_, It is impossible, that this inference of the animal can
 be founded on any process of argument or reasoning, by which he
 concludes, that like events must follow like objects, and that the
 course of nature will always be regular in its operations. For if there
 be in reality any arguments of this nature, they surely lie too abstruse
 for the observation of such imperfect understandings; since it may well
 employ the utmost care and attention of a philosophic genius to discover
 and observe them. Animals, therefore, are not guided in these inferences
 by reasoning: Neither are children: Neither are the generality of
 mankind, in their ordinary actions and conclusions: Neither are
 philosophers themselves, who, in all the active parts of life, are, in
 the main, the same with the vulgar, and are governed by the same maxims.
 Nature must have provided some other principle, of more ready, and more
 general use and application; nor can an operation of such immense
 consequence in life, as that of inferring effects from causes, be
 trusted to the uncertain process of reasoning and argumentation. Were
 this doubtful with regard to men, it seems to admit of no question with
 regard to the brute creation; and the conclusion being once firmly
 established in the one, we have a strong presumption, from all the rules
 of analogy, that it ought to be universally admitted, without any
 exception or reserve. It is custom alone, which engages animals, from
 every object, that strikes their senses, to infer its usual attendant,
 and carries their imagination, from the appearance of the one, to
 conceive the other, in that particular manner, which we denominate
 _belief_. No other explication can be given of this operation, in all
 the higher, as well as lower classes of sensitive beings, which fall
 under our notice and observation [19].
 
     [19] Since all reasonings concerning facts or causes is derived
     merely from custom, it may be asked how it happens, that men so
     much surpass animals in reasoning, and one man so much
     surpasses another? Has not the same custom the same
     influence on all?
 
     We shall here endeavour briefly to explain the great difference
     in human understandings: After which the reason of the
     difference between men and animals will easily be comprehended.
 
     1. When we have lived any time, and have been accustomed to the
     uniformity of nature, we acquire a general habit, by which we
     always transfer the known to the unknown, and conceive the
     latter to resemble the former. By means of this general
     habitual principle, we regard even one experiment as the
     foundation of reasoning, and expect a similar event with some
     degree of certainty, where the experiment has been made
     accurately, and free from all foreign circumstances. It is
     therefore considered as a matter of great importance to observe
     the consequences of things; and as one man may very much
     surpass another in attention and memory and observation, this
     will make a very great difference in their reasoning.
 
     2. Where there is a complication of causes to produce any
     effect, one mind may be much larger than another, and better
     able to comprehend the whole system of objects, and to infer
     justly their consequences.
 
     3. One man is able to carry on a chain of consequences to a
     greater length than another.
 
     4. Few men can think long without running into a confusion of
     ideas, and mistaking one for another; and there are various
     degrees of this infirmity.
 
     5. The circumstance, on which the effect depends, is frequently
     involved in other circumstances, which are foreign and
     extrinsic. The separation of it often requires great attention,
     accuracy, and subtilty.
 
     6. The forming of general maxims from particular observation is
     a very nice operation; and nothing is more usual, from haste or
     a narrowness of mind, which sees not on all sides, than to
     commit mistakes in this particular.
 
     7. When we reason from analogies, the man, who has the greater
     experience or the greater promptitude of suggesting analogies,
     will be the better reasoner.
 
     8. Byasses from prejudice, education, passion, party, &c. hang
     more upon one mind than another.
 
     9. After we have acquired a confidence in human testimony,
     books and conversation enlarge much more the sphere of one
     man's experience and thought than those of another.
 
     It would be easy to discover many other circumstances that make
     a difference in the understandings of men.
 
 85. But though animals learn many parts of their knowledge from
 observation, there are also many parts of it, which they derive from the
 original hand of nature; which much exceed the share of capacity they
 possess on ordinary occasions; and in which they improve, little or
 nothing, by the longest practice and experience. These we denominate
 Instincts, and are so apt to admire as something very extraordinary, and
 inexplicable by all the disquisitions of human understanding. But our
 wonder will, perhaps, cease or diminish, when we consider, that the
 experimental reasoning itself, which we possess in common with beasts,
 and on which the whole conduct of life depends, is nothing but a species
 of instinct or mechanical power, that acts in us unknown to ourselves;
 and in its chief operations, is not directed by any such relations or
 comparisons of ideas, as are the proper objects of our intellectual
 faculties. Though the instinct be different, yet still it is an
 instinct, which teaches a man to avoid the fire; as much as that, which
 teaches a bird, with such exactness, the art of incubation, and the
 whole economy and order of its nursery.
 
 
 
 SECTION X.
 
 OF MIRACLES.
 
 
 PART I.
 
 
 86. There is, in Dr. Tillotson's writings, an argument against the _real
 presence_, which is as concise, and elegant, and strong as any argument
 can possibly be supposed against a doctrine, so little worthy of a
 serious refutation. It is acknowledged on all hands, says that learned
 prelate, that the authority, either of the scripture or of tradition, is
 founded merely in the testimony of the apostles, who were eye-witnesses
 to those miracles of our Saviour, by which he proved his divine mission.
 Our evidence, then, for the truth of the _Christian_ religion is less
 than the evidence for the truth of our senses; because, even in the
 first authors of our religion, it was no greater; and it is evident it
 must diminish in passing from them to their disciples; nor can any one
 rest such confidence in their testimony, as in the immediate object of
 his senses. But a weaker evidence can never destroy a stronger; and
 therefore, were the doctrine of the real presence ever so clearly
 revealed in scripture, it were directly contrary to the rules of just
 reasoning to give our assent to it. It contradicts sense, though both
 the scripture and tradition, on which it is supposed to be built, carry
 not such evidence with them as sense; when they are considered merely as
 external evidences, and are not brought home to every one's breast, by
 the immediate operation of the Holy Spirit.
 
 Nothing is so convenient as a decisive argument of this kind, which
 must at least _silence_ the most arrogant bigotry and superstition, and
 free us from their impertinent solicitations. I flatter myself, that I
 have discovered an argument of a like nature, which, if just, will, with
 the wise and learned, be an everlasting check to all kinds of
 superstitious delusion, and consequently, will be useful as long as the
 world endures. For so long, I presume, will the accounts of miracles and
 prodigies be found in all history, sacred and profane.
 
 87. Though experience be our only guide in reasoning concerning matters
 of fact; it must be acknowledged, that this guide is not altogether
 infallible, but in some cases is apt to lead us into errors. One, who in
 our climate, should expect better weather in any week of June than in
 one of December, would reason justly, and conformably to experience; but
 it is certain, that he may happen, in the event, to find himself
 mistaken. However, we may observe, that, in such a case, he would have
 no cause to complain of experience; because it commonly informs us
 beforehand of the uncertainty, by that contrariety of events, which we
 may learn from a diligent observation. All effects follow not with like
 certainty from their supposed causes. Some events are found, in all
 countries and all ages, to have been constantly conjoined together:
 Others are found to have been more variable, and sometimes to disappoint
 our expectations; so that, in our reasonings concerning matter of fact,
 there are all imaginable degrees of assurance, from the highest
 certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence.
 
 A wise man, therefore, proportions his belief to the evidence. In such
 conclusions as are founded on an infallible experience, he expects the
 event with the last degree of assurance, and regards his past experience
 as a full _proof_ of the future existence of that event. In other
 cases, he proceeds with more caution: He weighs the opposite
 experiments: He considers which side is supported by the greater number
 of experiments: to that side he inclines, with doubt and hesitation; and
 when at last he fixes his judgement, the evidence exceeds not what we
 properly call _probability_. All probability, then, supposes an
 opposition of experiments and observations, where the one side is found
 to overbalance the other, and to produce a degree of evidence,
 proportioned to the superiority. A hundred instances or experiments on
 one side, and fifty on another, afford a doubtful expectation of any
 event; though a hundred uniform experiments, with only one that is
 contradictory, reasonably beget a pretty strong degree of assurance. In
 all cases, we must balance the opposite experiments, where they are
 opposite, and deduct the smaller number from the greater, in order to
 know the exact force of the superior evidence.
 
 88. To apply these principles to a particular instance; we may observe,
 that there is no species of reasoning more common, more useful, and even
 necessary to human life, than that which is derived from the testimony
 of men, and the reports of eye-witnesses and spectators. This species of
 reasoning, perhaps, one may deny to be founded on the relation of cause
 and effect. I shall not dispute about a word. It will be sufficient to
 observe that our assurance in any argument of this kind is derived from
 no other principle than our observation of the veracity of human
 testimony, and of the usual conformity of facts to the reports of
 witnesses. It being a general maxim, that no objects have any
 discoverable connexion together, and that all the inferences, which we
 can draw from one to another, are founded merely on our experience of
 their constant and regular conjunction; it is evident, that we ought not
 to make an exception to this maxim in favour of human testimony, whose
 connexion with any event seems, in itself, as little necessary as any
 other. Were not the memory tenacious to a certain degree, had not men
 commonly an inclination to truth and a principle of probity; were they
 not sensible to shame, when detected in a falsehood: Were not these, I
 say, discovered by experience to be qualities, inherent in human nature,
 we should never repose the least confidence in human testimony. A man
 delirious, or noted for falsehood and villany, has no manner of
 authority with us.
 
 And as the evidence, derived from witnesses and human testimony, is
 founded on past experience, so it varies with the experience, and is
 regarded either as a _proof_ or a _probability_, according as the
 conjunction between any particular kind of report and any kind of object
 has been found to be constant or variable. There are a number of
 circumstances to be taken into consideration in all judgements of this
 kind; and the ultimate standard, by which we determine all disputes,
 that may arise concerning them, is always derived from experience and
 observation. Where this experience is not entirely uniform on any side,
 it is attended with an unavoidable contrariety in our judgements, and
 with the same opposition and mutual destruction of argument as in every
 other kind of evidence. We frequently hesitate concerning the reports of
 others. We balance the opposite circumstances, which cause any doubt or
 uncertainty; and when we discover a superiority on any side, we incline
 to it; but still with a diminution of assurance, in proportion to the
 force of its antagonist.
 
 89. This contrariety of evidence, in the present case, may be derived
 from several different causes; from the opposition of contrary
 testimony; from the character or number of the witnesses; from the
 manner of their delivering their testimony; or from the union of all
 these circumstances. We entertain a suspicion concerning any matter of
 fact, when the witnesses contradict each other; when they are but few,
 or of a doubtful character; when they have an interest in what they
 affirm; when they deliver their testimony with hesitation, or on the
 contrary, with too violent asseverations. There are many other
 particulars of the same kind, which may diminish or destroy the force of
 any argument, derived from human testimony.
 
 Suppose, for instance, that the fact, which the testimony endeavours to
 establish, partakes of the extraordinary and the marvellous; in that
 case, the evidence, resulting from the testimony, admits of a
 diminution, greater or less, in proportion as the fact is more or less
 unusual. The reason why we place any credit in witnesses and historians,
 is not derived from any _connexion_, which we perceive _a priori_,
 between testimony and reality, but because we are accustomed to find a
 conformity between them. But when the fact attested is such a one as has
 seldom fallen under our observation, here is a contest of two opposite
 experiences; of which the one destroys the other, as far as its force
 goes, and the superior can only operate on the mind by the force, which
 remains. The very same principle of experience, which gives us a certain
 degree of assurance in the testimony of witnesses, gives us also, in
 this case, another degree of assurance against the fact, which they
 endeavour to establish; from which contradition there necessarily arises
 a counterpoize, and mutual destruction of belief and authority.
 
 _I should not believe such a story were it told me by Cato_, was a
 proverbial saying in Rome, even during the lifetime of that
 philosophical patriot.[20] The incredibility of a fact, it was allowed,
 might invalidate so great an authority.
 
     [20] Plutarch, in vita Catonis.
 
 The Indian prince, who refused to believe the first relations concerning
 the effects of frost, reasoned justly; and it naturally required very
 strong testimony to engage his assent to facts, that arose from a state
 of nature, with which he was unacquainted, and which bore so little
 analogy to those events, of which he had had constant and uniform
 experience. Though they were not contrary to his experience, they were
 not conformable to it.[21]
 
     [21] No Indian, it is evident, could have experience that water
     did not freeze in cold climates. This is placing nature in a
     situation quite unknown to him; and it is impossible for him to
     tell _a priori _what will result from it. It is making a new
     experiment, the consequence of which is always uncertain. One
     may sometimes conjecture from analogy what will follow; but
     still this is but conjecture. And it must be confessed, that,
     in the present case of freezing, the event follows contrary to
     the rules of analogy, and is such as a rational Indian would
     not look for. The operations of cold upon water are not
     gradual, according to the degrees of cold; but whenever it
     comes to the freezing point, the water passes in a moment, from
     the utmost liquidity to perfect hardness. Such an event,
     therefore, may be denominated _extraordinary_, and requires a
     pretty strong testimony, to render it credible to people in a
     warm climate: But still it is not _miraculous_, nor contrary to
     uniform experience of the course of nature in cases where all
     the circumstances are the same. The inhabitants of Sumatra
     have always seen water fluid in their own climate, and the
     freezing of their rivers ought to be deemed a prodigy: But they
     never saw water in Muscovy during the winter; and therefore
     they cannot reasonably be positive what would there be the
     consequence.
 
 90. But in order to encrease the probability against the testimony of
 witnesses, let us suppose, that the fact, which they affirm, instead of
 being only marvellous, is really miraculous; and suppose also, that the
 testimony considered apart and in itself, amounts to an entire proof; in
 that case, there is proof against proof, of which the strongest must
 prevail, but still with a diminution of its force, in proportion to that
 of its antagonist.
 
 A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature; and as a firm and
 unalterable experience has established these laws, the proof against a
 miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument
 from experience can possibly be imagined. Why is it more than probable,
 that all men must die; that lead cannot, of itself, remain suspended in
 the air; that fire consumes wood, and is extinguished by water; unless
 it be, that these events are found agreeable to the laws of nature, and
 there is required a violation of these laws, or in other words, a
 miracle to prevent them? Nothing is esteemed a miracle, if it ever
 happen in the common course of nature. It is no miracle that a man,
 seemingly in good health, should die on a sudden: because such a kind of
 death, though more unusual than any other, has yet been frequently
 observed to happen. But it is a miracle, that a dead man should come to
 life; because that has never been observed in any age or country. There
 must, therefore, be a uniform experience against every miraculous event,
 otherwise the event would not merit that appellation. And as a uniform
 experience amounts to a proof, there is here a direct and full _proof_,
 from the nature of the fact, against the existence of any miracle; nor
 can such a proof be destroyed, or the miracle rendered credible, but by
 an opposite proof, which is superior.[22]
 
     [22] Sometimes an event may not, _in itself_, seem to be
     contrary to the laws of nature, and yet, if it were real, it
     might, by reason of some circumstances, be denominated a
     miracle; because, in _fact_, it is contrary to these laws. Thus
     if a person, claiming a divine authority, should command a sick
     person to be well, a healthful man to fall down dead, the
     clouds to pour rain, the winds to blow, in short, should order
     many natural events, which immediately follow upon his command;
     these might justly be esteemed miracles, because they are
     really, in this case, contrary to the laws of nature. For if
     any suspicion remain, that the event and command concurred by
     accident, there is no miracle and no transgression of the laws
     of nature. If this suspicion be removed, there is evidently a
     miracle, and a transgression of these laws; because nothing can
     be more contrary to nature than that the voice or command of a
     man should have such an influence. A miracle may be accurately
     defined, _a transgression of a law of nature by a particular
     volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some
     invisible agent_. A miracle may either be discoverable by men
     or not. This alters not its nature and essence. The raising of
     a house or ship into the air is a visible miracle. The raising
     of a feather, when the wind wants ever so little of a force
     requisite for that purpose, is as real a miracle, though not so
     sensible with regard to us.
 
 91. The plain consequence is (and it is a general maxim worthy of our
 attention), 'That no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle,
 unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more
 miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavours to establish; and even in
 that case there is a mutual destruction of arguments, and the superior
 only gives us an assurance suitable to that degree of force, which
 remains, after deducting the inferior.' When anyone tells me, that he
 saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately consider with myself,
 whether it be more probable, that this person should either deceive or
 be deceived, or that the fact, which he relates, should really have
 happened. I weigh the one miracle against the other; and according to
 the superiority, which I discover, I pronounce my decision, and always
 reject the greater miracle. If the falsehood of his testimony would be
 more miraculous, than the event which he relates; then, and not till
 then, can he pretend to command my belief or opinion.
 
 
 PART II.
 
 
 92. In the foregoing reasoning we have supposed, that the testimony,
 upon which a miracle is founded, may possibly amount to an entire proof,
 and that the falsehood of that testimony would be a real prodigy: But it
 is easy to shew, that we have been a great deal too liberal in our
 concession, and that there never was a miraculous event established on
 so full an evidence.
 
 For _first_, there is not to be found, in all history, any miracle
 attested by a sufficient number of men, of such unquestioned good-sense,
 education, and learning, as to secure us against all delusion in
 themselves; of such undoubted integrity, as to place them beyond all
 suspicion of any design to deceive others; of such credit and reputation
 in the eyes of mankind, as to have a great deal to lose in case of their
 being detected in any falsehood; and at the same time, attesting facts
 performed in such a public manner and in so celebrated a part of the
 world, as to render the detection unavoidable: All which circumstances
 are requisite to give us a full assurance in the testimony of men.
 
 93. _Secondly_. We may observe in human nature a principle which, if
 strictly examined, will be found to diminish extremely the assurance,
 which we might, from human testimony, have, in any kind of prodigy. The
 maxim, by which we commonly conduct ourselves in our reasonings, is,
 that the objects, of which we have no experience, resembles those, of
 which we have; that what we have found to be most usual is always most
 probable; and that where there is an opposition of arguments, we ought
 to give the preference to such as are founded on the greatest number of
 past observations. But though, in proceeding by this rule, we readily
 reject any fact which is unusual and incredible in an ordinary degree;
 yet in advancing farther, the mind observes not always the same rule;
 but when anything is affirmed utterly absurd and miraculous, it rather
 the more readily admits of such a fact, upon account of that very
 circumstance, which ought to destroy all its authority. The passion of
 _surprise_ and _wonder_, arising from miracles, being an agreeable
 emotion, gives a sensible tendency towards the belief of those events,
 from which it is derived. And this goes so far, that even those who
 cannot enjoy this pleasure immediately, nor can believe those miraculous
 events, of which they are informed, yet love to partake of the
 satisfaction at second-hand or by rebound, and place a pride and delight
 in exciting the admiration of others.
 
 With what greediness are the miraculous accounts of travellers received,
 their descriptions of sea and land monsters, their relations of
 wonderful adventures, strange men, and uncouth manners? But if the
 spirit of religion join itself to the love of wonder, there is an end of
 common sense; and human testimony, in these circumstances, loses all
 pretensions to authority. A religionist may be an enthusiast, and
 imagine he sees what has no reality: he may know his narrative to be
 false, and yet persevere in it, with the best intentions in the world,
 for the sake of promoting so holy a cause: or even where this delusion
 has not place, vanity, excited by so strong a temptation, operates on
 him more powerfully than on the rest of mankind in any other
 circumstances; and self-interest with equal force. His auditors may not
 have, and commonly have not, sufficient judgement to canvass his
 evidence: what judgement they have, they renounce by principle, in these
 sublime and mysterious subjects: or if they were ever so willing to
 employ it, passion and a heated imagination disturb the regularity of
 its operations. Their credulity increases his impudence: and his
 impudence overpowers their credulity.
 
 Eloquence, when at its highest pitch, leaves little room for reason or
 reflection; but addressing itself entirely to the fancy or the
 affections, captivates the willing hearers, and subdues their
 understanding. Happily, this pitch it seldom attains. But what a Tully
 or a Demosthenes could scarcely effect over a Roman or Athenian
 audience, every _Capuchin_, every itinerant or stationary teacher can
 perform over the generality of mankind, and in a higher degree, by
 touching such gross and vulgar passions.
 
 The many instances of forged miracles, and prophecies, and supernatural
 events, which, in all ages, have either been detected by contrary
 evidence, or which detect themselves by their absurdity, prove
 sufficiently the strong propensity of mankind to the extraordinary and
 the marvellous, and ought reasonably to beget a suspicion against all
 relations of this kind. This is our natural way of thinking, even with
 regard to the most common and most credible events. For instance: There
 is no kind of report which rises so easily, and spreads so quickly,
 especially in country places and provincial towns, as those concerning
 marriages; insomuch that two young persons of equal condition never see
 each other twice, but the whole neighbourhood immediately join them
 together. The pleasure of telling a piece of news so interesting, of
 propagating it, and of being the first reporters of it, spreads the
 intelligence. And this is so well known, that no man of sense gives
 attention to these reports, till he find them confirmed by some greater
 evidence. Do not the same passions, and others still stronger, incline
 the generality of mankind to believe and report, with the greatest
 vehemence and assurance, all religious miracles?
 
 94. _Thirdly_. It forms a strong presumption against all supernatural
 and miraculous relations, that they are observed chiefly to abound among
 ignorant and barbarous nations; or if a civilized people has ever given
 admission to any of them, that people will be found to have received
 them from ignorant and barbarous ancestors, who transmitted them with
 that inviolable sanction and authority, which always attend received
 opinions. When we peruse the first histories of all nations, we are apt
 to imagine ourselves transported into some new world; where the whole
 frame of nature is disjointed, and every element performs its operations
 in a different manner, from what it does at present. Battles,
 revolutions, pestilence, famine and death, are never the effect of those
 natural causes, which we experience. Prodigies, omens, oracles,
 judgements, quite obscure the few natural events, that are intermingled
 with them. But as the former grow thinner every page, in proportion as
 we advance nearer the enlightened ages, we soon learn, that there is
 nothing mysterious or supernatural in the case, but that all proceeds
 from the usual propensity of mankind towards the marvellous, and that,
 though this inclination may at intervals receive a check from sense and
 learning, it can never be thoroughly extirpated from human nature.
 
 _It is strange_, a judicious reader is apt to say, upon the perusal of
 these wonderful historians, _that such prodigious_ _events never happen
 in our days_. But it is nothing strange, I hope, that men should lie in
 all ages. You must surely have seen instances enough of that frailty.
 You have yourself heard many such marvellous relations started, which,
 being treated with scorn by all the wise and judicious, have at last
 been abandoned even by the vulgar. Be assured, that those renowned lies,
 which have spread and flourished to such a monstrous height, arose from
 like beginnings; but being sown in a more proper soil, shot up at last
 into prodigies almost equal to those which they relate.
 
 It was a wise policy in that false prophet, Alexander, who though now
 forgotten, was once so famous, to lay the first scene of his impostures
 in Paphlagonia, where, as Lucian tells us, the people were extremely
 ignorant and stupid, and ready to swallow even the grossest delusion.
 People at a distance, who are weak enough to think the matter at all
 worth enquiry, have no opportunity of receiving better information. The
 stories come magnified to them by a hundred circumstances. Fools are
 industrious in propagating the imposture; while the wise and learned are
 contented, in general, to deride its absurdity, without informing
 themselves of the particular facts, by which it may be distinctly
 refuted. And thus the impostor above mentioned was enabled to proceed,
 from his ignorant Paphlagonians, to the enlisting of votaries, even
 among the Grecian philosophers, and men of the most eminent rank and
 distinction in Rome: nay, could engage the attention of that sage
 emperor Marcus Aurelius; so far as to make him trust the success of a
 military expedition to his delusive prophecies.
 
 The advantages are so great, of starting an imposture among an ignorant
 people, that, even though the delusion should be too gross to impose on
 the generality of them (_which, though seldom, is sometimes the case_)
 it has a much better chance for succeeding in remote countries, than if
 the first scene had been laid in a city renowned for arts and
 knowledge. The most ignorant and barbarous of these barbarians carry
 the report abroad. None of their countrymen have a large correspondence,
 or sufficient credit and authority to contradict and beat down the
 delusion. Men's inclination to the marvellous has full opportunity to
 display itself. And thus a story, which is universally exploded in the
 place where it was first started, shall pass for certain at a thousand
 miles distance. But had Alexander fixed his residence at Athens, the
 philosophers of that renowned mart of learning had immediately spread,
 throughout the whole Roman empire, their sense of the matter; which,
 being supported by so great authority, and displayed by all the force of
 reason and eloquence, had entirely opened the eyes of mankind. It is
 true; Lucian, passing by chance through Paphlagonia, had an opportunity
 of performing this good office. But, though much to be wished, it does
 not always happen, that every Alexander meets with a Lucian, ready to
 expose and detect his impostures.
 
 95. I may add as a _fourth_ reason, which diminishes the authority of
 prodigies, that there is no testimony for any, even those which have not
 been expressly detected, that is not opposed by an infinite number of
 witnesses; so that not only the miracle destroys the credit of
 testimony, but the testimony destroys itself. To make this the better
 understood, let us consider, that, in matters of religion, whatever is
 different is contrary; and that it is impossible the religions of
 ancient Rome, of Turkey, of Siam, and of China should, all of them, be
 established on any solid foundation. Every miracle, therefore, pretended
 to have been wrought in any of these religions (and all of them abound
 in miracles), as its direct scope is to establish the particular system
 to which it is attributed; so has it the same force, though more
 indirectly, to overthrow every other system. In destroying a rival
 system, it likewise destroys the credit of those miracles, on which that
 system was established; so that all the prodigies of different
 religions are to be regarded as contrary facts, and the evidences of
 these prodigies, whether weak or strong, as opposite to each other.
 According to this method of reasoning, when we believe any miracle of
 Mahomet or his successors, we have for our warrant the testimony of a
 few barbarous Arabians: And on the other hand, we are to regard the
 authority of Titus Livius, Plutarch, Tacitus, and, in short, of all the
 authors and witnesses, Grecian, Chinese, and Roman Catholic, who have
 related any miracle in their particular religion; I say, we are to
 regard their testimony in the same light as if they had mentioned that
 Mahometan miracle, and had in express terms contradicted it, with the
 same certainty as they have for the miracle they relate. This argument
 may appear over subtile and refined; but is not in reality different
 from the reasoning of a judge, who supposes, that the credit of two
 witnesses, maintaining a crime against any one, is destroyed by the
 testimony of two others, who affirm him to have been two hundred leagues
 distant, at the same instant when the crime is said to have been
 committed.
 
 96. One of the best attested miracles in all profane history, is that
 which Tacitus reports of Vespasian, who cured a blind man in Alexandria,
 by means of his spittle, and a lame man by the mere touch of his foot;
 in obedience to a vision of the god Serapis, who had enjoined them to
 have recourse to the Emperor, for these miraculous cures. The story may
 be seen in that fine historian[23]; where every circumstance seems to add
 weight to the testimony, and might be displayed at large with all the
 force of argument and eloquence, if any one were now concerned to
 enforce the evidence of that exploded and idolatrous superstition. The
 gravity, solidity, age, and probity of so great an emperor, who, through
 the whole course of his life, conversed in a familiar manner with his
 friends and courtiers, and never affected those extraordinary airs of
 divinity assumed by Alexander and Demetrius. The historian, a
 cotemporary writer, noted for candour and veracity, and withal, the
 greatest and most penetrating genius, perhaps, of all antiquity; and so
 free from any tendency to credulity, that he even lies under the
 contrary imputation, of atheism and profaneness: The persons, from whose
 authority he related the miracle, of established character for judgement
 and veracity, as we may well presume; eye-witnesses of the fact, and
 confirming their testimony, after the Flavian family was despoiled of
 the empire, and could no longer give any reward, as the price of a lie.
 _Utrumque, qui interfuere, nunc quoque memorant, postquam nullum
 mendacio pretium_. To which if we add the public nature of the facts, as
 related, it will appear, that no evidence can well be supposed stronger
 for so gross and so palpable a falsehood.
 
     [23] Hist. lib. iv. cap. 81. Suetonius gives nearly the same
     account _in vita_ Vesp.
 
 There is also a memorable story related by Cardinal de Retz, which may
 well deserve our consideration. When that intriguing politician fled
 into Spain, to avoid the persecution of his enemies, he passed through
 Saragossa, the capital of Arragon, where he was shewn, in the cathedral,
 a man, who had served seven years as a door-keeper, and was well known
 to every body in town, that had ever paid his devotions at that church.
 He had been seen, for so long a time, wanting a leg; but recovered that
 limb by the rubbing of holy oil upon the stump; and the cardinal assures
 us that he saw him with two legs. This miracle was vouched by all the
 canons of the church; and the whole company in town were appealed to for
 a confirmation of the fact; whom the cardinal found, by their zealous
 devotion, to be thorough believers of the miracle. Here the relater was
 also cotemporary to the supposed prodigy, of an incredulous and
 libertine character, as well as of great genius; the miracle of so
 _singular_ a nature as could scarcely admit of a counterfeit, and the
 witnesses very numerous, and all of them, in a manner, spectators of the
 fact, to which they gave their testimony. And what adds mightily to the
 force of the evidence, and may double our surprise on this occasion, is,
 that the cardinal himself, who relates the story, seems not to give any
 credit to it, and consequently cannot be suspected of any concurrence in
 the holy fraud. He considered justly, that it was not requisite, in
 order to reject a fact of this nature, to be able accurately to disprove
 the testimony, and to trace its falsehood, through all the circumstances
 of knavery and credulity which produced it. He knew, that, as this was
 commonly altogether impossible at any small distance of time and place;
 so was it extremely difficult, even where one was immediately present,
 by reason of the bigotry, ignorance, cunning, and roguery of a great
 part of mankind. He therefore concluded, like a just reasoner, that such
 an evidence carried falsehood upon the very face of it, and that a
 miracle, supported by any human testimony, was more properly a subject
 of derision than of argument.
 
 There surely never was a greater number of miracles ascribed to one
 person, than those, which were lately said to have been wrought in
 France upon the tomb of Abbe Paris, the famous Jansenist, with whose
 sanctity the people were so long deluded. The curing of the sick, giving
 hearing to the deaf, and sight to the blind, were every where talked of
 as the usual effects of that holy sepulchre. But what is more
 extraordinary; many of the miracles were immediately proved upon the
 spot, before judges of unquestioned integrity, attested by witnesses of
 credit and distinction, in a learned age, and on the most eminent
 theatre that is now in the world. Nor is this all: a relation of them
 was published and dispersed every where; nor were the _Jesuits_, though
 a learned body, supported by the civil magistrate, and determined
 enemies to those opinions, in whose favour the miracles were said to
 have been wrought, ever able distinctly to refute or detect them[24].
 Where shall we find such a number of circumstances, agreeing to the
 corroboration of one fact? And what have we to oppose to such a cloud of
 witnesses, but the absolute impossibility or miraculous nature of the
 events, which they relate? And this surely, in the eyes of all
 reasonable people, will alone be regarded as a sufficient refutation.
 
     [24] This book was writ by Mons. Montgeron, counsellor or judge
     of the parliament of Paris, a man of figure and character, who
     was also a martyr to the cause, and is now said to be somewhere
     in a dungeon on account of his book.
 
     There is another book in three volumes (called _Recueil des
     Miracles de l'Abbe_ Paris) giving an account of many of these
     miracles, and accompanied with prefatory discourses, which are
     very well written. There runs, however, through the whole of
     these a ridiculous comparison between the miracles of our
     Saviour and those of the Abbe; wherein it is asserted, that the
     evidence for the latter is equal to that for the former: As if
     the testimony of men could ever be put in the balance with that
     of God himself, who conducted the pen of the inspired writers.
     If these writers, indeed, were to be considered merely as human
     testimony, the French author is very moderate in his
     comparison; since he might, with some appearance of reason,
     pretend, that the Jansenist miracles much surpass the other in
     evidence and authority. The following circumstances are drawn
     from authentic papers, inserted in the above-mentioned book.
 
     Many of the miracles of Abbe Paris were proved immediately by
     witnesses before the officiality or bishop's court at Paris,
     under the eye of cardinal Noailles, whose character for
     integrity and capacity was never contested even by his enemies.
 
     His successor in the archbishopric was an enemy to the
     Jansenists, and for that reason promoted to the see by the
     court. Yet 22 rectors or cures of Paris, with infinite
     earnestness, press him to examine those miracles, which they
     assert to be known to the whole world, and undisputably
     certain: But he wisely forbore.
 
     The Molinist party had tried to discredit these miracles in one
     instance, that of Mademoiselle le Franc. But, besides that
     their proceedings were in many respects the most irregular in
     the world, particularly in citing only a few of the Jansenist
     witnesses, whom they tampered with: Besides this, I say, they
     soon found themselves overwhelmed by a cloud of new witnesses,
     one hundred and twenty in number, most of them persons of
     credit and substance in Paris, who gave oath for the miracle.
     This was accompanied with a solemn and earnest appeal to the
     parliament. But the parliament were forbidden by authority to
     meddle in the affair. It was at last observed, that where men
     are heated by zeal and enthusiasm, there is no degree of human
     testimony so strong as may not be procured for the greatest
     absurdity: And those who will be so silly as to examine the
     affair by that medium, and seek particular flaws in the
     testimony, are almost sure to be confounded. It must be a
     miserable imposture, indeed, that does not prevail in
     that contest.
 
     All who have been in France about that time have heard of the
     reputation of Mons. Heraut, the _lieutenant de Police_, whose
     vigilance, penetration, activity, and extensive intelligence
     have been much talked of. This magistrate, who by the nature of
     his office is almost absolute, was vested with full powers, on
     purpose to suppress or discredit these miracles; and he
     frequently seized immediately, and examined the witnesses and
     subjects of them: But never could reach any thing satisfactory
     against them.
 
     In the case of Mademoiselle Thibaut he sent the famous De Sylva
     to examine her; whose evidence is very curious. The physician
     declares, that it was impossible she could have been so ill as
     was proved by witnesses; because it was impossible she could,
     in so short a time, have recovered so perfectly as he found
     her. He reasoned, like a man of sense, from natural causes; but
     the opposite party told him, that the whole was a miracle, and
     that his evidence was the very best proof of it.
 
     The Molinists were in a sad dilemma. They durst not assert the
     absolute insufficiency of human evidence, to prove a miracle.
     They were obliged to say, that these miracles were wrought by
     witchcraft and the devil. But they were told, that this was the
     resource of the Jews of old.
 
     No Jansenist was ever embarrassed to account for the cessation
     of the miracles, when the church-yard was shut up by the king's
     edict. It was the touch of the tomb, which produced these
     extraordinary effects; and when no one could approach the tomb,
     no effects could be expected. God, indeed, could have thrown
     down the walls in a moment; but he is master of his own graces
     and works, and it belongs not to us to account for them. He did
     not throw down the walls of every city like those of Jericho,
     on the sounding of the rams horns, nor break up the prison of
     every apostle, like that of St. Paul.
 
     No less a man, than the Due de Chatillon, a duke and peer of
     France, of the highest rank and family, gives evidence of a
     miraculous cure, performed upon a servant of his, who had lived
     several years in his house with a visible and palpable
     infirmity. I shall conclude with observing, that no clergy are
     more celebrated for strictness of life and manners than the
     secular clergy of France, particularly the rectors or cures of
     Paris, who bear testimony to these impostures. The learning,
     genius, and probity of the gentlemen, and the austerity of the
     nuns of Port-Royal, have been much celebrated all over Europe.
     Yet they all give evidence for a miracle, wrought on the niece
     of the famous Pascal, whose sanctity of life, as well as
     extraordinary capacity, is well known. The famous Racine gives
     an account of this miracle in his famous history of Port-Royal,
     and fortifies it with all the proofs, which a multitude of
     nuns, priests, physicians, and men of the world, all of them of
     undoubted credit, could bestow upon it. Several men of letters,
     particularly the bishop of Tournay, thought this miracle so
     certain, as to employ it in the refutation of atheists and
     free-thinkers. The queen-regent of France, who was extremely
     prejudiced against the Port-Royal, sent her own physician to
     examine the miracle, who returned an absolute convert. In
     short, the supernatural cure was so uncontestable, that it
     saved, for a time, that famous monastery from the ruin with
     which it was threatened by the Jesuits. Had it been a cheat, it
     had certainly been detected by such sagacious and powerful
     antagonists, and must have hastened the ruin of the contrivers.
     Our divines, who can build up a formidable castle from such
     despicable materials; what a prodigious fabric could they have
     reared from these and many other circumstances, which I have
     not mentioned! How often would the great names of Pascal,
     Racine, Amaud, Nicole, have resounded in our ears? But if they
     be wise, they had better adopt the miracle, as being more
     worth, a thousand times, than all the rest of the collection.
     Besides, it may serve very much to their purpose. For that
     miracle was really performed by the touch of an authentic holy
     prickle of the holy thorn, which composed the holy crown,
     which, &c.
 
 97. Is the consequence just, because some human testimony has the utmost
 force and authority in some cases, when it relates the battle of
 Philippi or Pharsalia for instance; that therefore all kinds of
 testimony must, in all cases, have equal force and authority? Suppose
 that the Caesarean and Pompeian factions had, each of them, claimed the
 victory in these battles, and that the historians of each party had
 uniformly ascribed the advantage to their own side; how could mankind,
 at this distance, have been able to determine between them? The
 contrariety is equally strong between the miracles related by Herodotus
 or Plutarch, and those delivered by Mariana, Bede, or any monkish
 historian.
 
 The wise lend a very academic faith to every report which favours the
 passion of the reporter; whether it magnifies his country, his family,
 or himself, or in any other way strikes in with his natural inclinations
 and propensities. But what greater temptation than to appear a
 missionary, a prophet, an ambassador from heaven? Who would not
 encounter many dangers and difficulties, in order to attain so sublime a
 character? Or if, by the help of vanity and a heated imagination, a man
 has first made a convert of himself, and entered seriously into the
 delusion; who ever scruples to make use of pious frauds, in support of
 so holy and meritorious a cause?
 
 The smallest spark may here kindle into the greatest flame; because the
 materials are always prepared for it. The _avidum genus auricularum_[25],
 the gazing populace, receive greedily, without examination, whatever
 sooths superstition, and promotes wonder.
 
     [25] Lucret.
 
 How many stories of this nature have, in all ages, been detected and
 exploded in their infancy? How many more have been celebrated for a
 time, and have afterwards sunk into neglect and oblivion? Where such
 reports, therefore, fly about, the solution of the phenomenon is
 obvious; and we judge in conformity to regular experience and
 observation, when we account for it by the known and natural principles
 of credulity and delusion. And shall we, rather than have a recourse to
 so natural a solution, allow of a miraculous violation of the most
 established laws of nature?
 
 I need not mention the difficulty of detecting a falsehood in any
 private or even public history, at the place, where it is said to
 happen; much more when the scene is removed to ever so small a distance.
 Even a court of judicature, with all the authority, accuracy, and
 judgement, which they can employ, find themselves often at a loss to
 distinguish between truth and falsehood in the most recent actions. But
 the matter never comes to any issue, if trusted to the common method of
 altercations and debate and flying rumours; especially when men's
 passions have taken part on either side.
 
 In the infancy of new religions, the wise and learned commonly esteem
 the matter too inconsiderable to deserve their attention or regard. And
 when afterwards they would willingly detect the cheat, in order to
 undeceive the deluded multitude, the season is now past, and the records
 and witnesses, which might clear up the matter, have perished
 beyond recovery.
 
 No means of detection remain, but those which must be drawn from the
 very testimony itself of the reporters: and these, though always
 sufficient with the judicious and knowing, are commonly too fine to fall
 under the comprehension of the vulgar.
 
 98. Upon the whole, then, it appears, that no testimony for any kind of
 miracle has ever amounted to a probability, much less to a proof; and
 that, even supposing it amounted to a proof, it would be opposed by
 another proof; derived from the very nature of the fact, which it would
 endeavour to establish. It is experience only, which gives authority to
 human testimony; and it is the same experience, which assures us of the
 laws of nature. When, therefore, these two kinds of experience are
 contrary, we have nothing to do but substract the one from the other,
 and embrace an opinion, either on one side or the other, with that
 assurance which arises from the remainder. But according to the
 principle here explained, this substraction, with regard to all popular
 religions, amounts to an entire annihilation; and therefore we may
 establish it as a maxim, that no human testimony can have such force as
 to prove a miracle, and make it a just foundation for any such system
 of religion.
 
 99. I beg the limitations here made may be remarked, when I say, that a
 miracle can never be proved, so as to be the foundation of a system of
 religion. For I own, that otherwise, there may possibly be miracles, or
 violations of the usual course of nature, of such a kind as to admit of
 proof from human testimony; though, perhaps, it will be impossible to
 find any such in all the records of history. Thus, suppose, all authors,
 in all languages, agree, that, from the first of January 1600, there was
 a total darkness over the whole earth for eight days: suppose that the
 tradition of this extraordinary event is still strong and lively among
 the people: that all travellers, who return from foreign countries,
 bring us accounts of the same tradition, without the least variation or
 contradiction: it is evident, that our present philosophers, instead of
 doubting the fact, ought to receive it as certain, and ought to search
 for the causes whence it might be derived. The decay, corruption, and
 dissolution of nature, is an event rendered probable by so many
 analogies, that any phenomenon, which seems to have a tendency towards
 that catastrophe, comes within the reach of human testimony, if that
 testimony be very extensive and uniform.
 
 But suppose, that all the historians who treat of England, should agree,
 that, on the first of January 1600, Queen Elizabeth died; that both
 before and after her death she was seen by her physicians and the whole
 court, as is usual with persons of her rank; that her successor was
 acknowledged and proclaimed by the parliament; and that, after being
 interred a month, she again appeared, resumed the throne, and governed
 England for three years: I must confess that I should be surprised at
 the concurrence of so many odd circumstances, but should not have the
 least inclination to believe so miraculous an event. I should not doubt
 of her pretended death, and of those other public circumstances that
 followed it: I should only assert it to have been pretended, and that it
 neither was, nor possibly could be real. You would in vain object to me
 the difficulty, and almost impossibility of deceiving the world in an
 affair of such consequence; the wisdom and solid judgement of that
 renowned queen; with the little or no advantage which she could reap
 from so poor an artifice: All this might astonish me; but I would still
 reply, that the knavery and folly of men are such common phenomena, that
 I should rather believe the most extraordinary events to arise from
 their concurrence, than admit of so signal a violation of the laws
 of nature.
 
 But should this miracle be ascribed to any new system of religion; men,
 in all ages, have been so much imposed on by ridiculous stories of that
 kind, that this very circumstance would be a full proof of a cheat, and
 sufficient, with all men of sense, not only to make them reject the
 fact, but even reject it without farther examination. Though the Being
 to whom the miracle is ascribed, be, in this case, Almighty, it does
 not, upon that account, become a whit more probable; since it is
 impossible for us to know the attributes or actions of such a Being,
 otherwise than from the experience which we have of his productions, in
 the usual course of nature. This still reduces us to past observation,
 and obliges us to compare the instances of the violation of truth in the
 testimony of men, with those of the violation of the laws of nature by
 miracles, in order to judge which of them is most likely and probable.
 As the violations of truth are more common in the testimony concerning
 religious miracles, than in that concerning any other matter of fact;
 this must diminish very much the authority of the former testimony, and
 make us form a general resolution, never to lend any attention to it,
 with whatever specious pretence it may be covered.
 
 Lord Bacon seems to have embraced the same principles of reasoning. 'We
 ought,' says he, 'to make a collection or particular history of all
 monsters and prodigious births or productions, and in a word of every
 thing new, rare, and extraordinary in nature. But this must be done with
 the most severe scrutiny, lest we depart from truth. Above all, every
 relation must be considered as suspicious, which depends in any degree
 upon religion, as the prodigies of Livy: And no less so, every thing
 that is to be found in the writers of natural magic or alchimy, or such
 authors, who seem, all of them, to have an unconquerable appetite for
 falsehood and fable[26].'
 
     [26] Nov. Org. lib. ii. aph. 29.
 
 100. I am the better pleased with the method of reasoning here
 delivered, as I think it may serve to confound those dangerous friends
 or disguised enemies to the _Christian Religion_, who have undertaken to
 defend it by the principles of human reason. Our most holy religion is
 founded on _Faith_, not on reason; and it is a sure method of exposing
 it to put it to such a trial as it is, by no means, fitted to endure. To
 make this more evident, let us examine those miracles, related in
 scripture; and not to lose ourselves in too wide a field, let us confine
 ourselves to such as we find in the _Pentateuch_, which we shall
 examine, according to the principles of these pretended Christians, not
 as the word or testimony of God himself, but as the production of a mere
 human writer and historian. Here then we are first to consider a book,
 presented to us by a barbarous and ignorant people, written in an age
 when they were still more barbarous, and in all probability long after
 the facts which it relates, corroborated by no concurring testimony, and
 resembling those fabulous accounts, which every nation gives of its
 origin. Upon reading this book, we find it full of prodigies and
 miracles. It gives an account of a state of the world and of human
 nature entirely different from the present: Of our fall from that state:
 Of the age of man, extended to near a thousand years: Of the destruction
 of the world by a deluge: Of the arbitrary choice of one people, as the
 favourites of heaven; and that people the countrymen of the author: Of
 their deliverance from bondage by prodigies the most astonishing
 imaginable: I desire any one to lay his hand upon his heart, and after a
 serious consideration declare, whether he thinks that the falsehood of
 such a book, supported by such a testimony, would be more extraordinary
 and miraculous than all the miracles it relates; which is, however,
 necessary to make it be received, according to the measures of
 probability above established.
 
 101. What we have said of miracles may be applied, without any
 variation, to prophecies; and indeed, all prophecies are real miracles,
 and as such only, can be admitted as proofs of any revelation. If it did
 not exceed the capacity of human nature to foretell future events, it
 would be absurd to employ any prophecy as an argument for a divine
 mission or authority from heaven. So that, upon the whole, we may
 conclude, that the _Christian Religion_ not only was at first attended
 with miracles, but even at this day cannot be believed by any reasonable
 person without one. Mere reason is insufficient to convince us of its
 veracity: And whoever is moved by _Faith_ to assent to it, is conscious
 of a continued miracle in his own person, which subverts all the
 principles of his understanding, and gives him a determination to
 believe what is most contrary to custom and experience.
 
 
 
 SECTION XI.
 
 OF A PARTICULAR PROVIDENCE AND OF A FUTURE STATE.
 
 
 102. I was lately engaged in conversation with a friend who loves
 sceptical paradoxes; where, though he advanced many principles, of which
 I can by no means approve, yet as they seem to be curious, and to bear
 some relation to the chain of reasoning carried on throughout this
 enquiry, I shall here copy them from my memory as accurately as I can,
 in order to submit them to the judgement of the reader.
 
 Our conversation began with my admiring the singular good fortune of
 philosophy, which, as it requires entire liberty above all other
 privileges, and chiefly flourishes from the free opposition of
 sentiments and argumentation, received its first birth in an age and
 country of freedom and toleration, and was never cramped, even in its
 most extravagant principles, by any creeds, concessions, or penal
 statutes. For, except the banishment of Protagoras, and the death of
 Socrates, which last event proceeded partly from other motives, there
 are scarcely any instances to be met with, in ancient history, of this
 bigotted jealousy, with which the present age is so much infested.
 Epicurus lived at Athens to an advanced age, in peace and tranquillity:
 Epicureans[27] were even admitted to receive the sacerdotal character,
 and to officiate at the altar, in the most sacred rites of the
 established religion: And the public encouragement[28] of pensions and
 salaries was afforded equally, by the wisest of all the Roman
 emperors[29], to the professors of every sect of philosophy. How
 requisite such kind of treatment was to philosophy, in her early youth,
 will easily be conceived, if we reflect, that, even at present, when she
 may be supposed more hardy and robust, she bears with much difficulty
 the inclemency of the seasons, and those harsh winds of calumny and
 persecution, which blow upon her.
 
     [27] Luciani [Greek: symp. ae Lapithai].
 
     [28] Luciani [Greek: eunouchos].
 
     [29] Luciani and Dio.
 
 You admire, says my friend, as the singular good fortune of philosophy,
 what seems to result from the natural course of things, and to be
 unavoidable in every age and nation. This pertinacious bigotry, of which
 you complain, as so fatal to philosophy, is really her offspring, who,
 after allying with superstition, separates himself entirely from the
 interest of his parent, and becomes her most inveterate enemy and
 persecutor. Speculative dogmas of religion, the present occasions of
 such furious dispute, could not possibly be conceived or admitted in the
 early ages of the world; when mankind, being wholly illiterate, formed
 an idea of religion more suitable to their weak apprehension, and
 composed their sacred tenets of such tales chiefly as were the objects
 of traditional belief, more than of argument or disputation. After the
 first alarm, therefore, was over, which arose from the new paradoxes and
 principles of the philosophers; these teachers seem ever after, during
 the ages of antiquity, to have lived in great harmony with the
 established superstition, and to have made a fair partition of mankind
 between them; the former claiming all the learned and wise, the latter
 possessing all the vulgar and illiterate.
 
 103. It seems then, say I, that you leave politics entirely out of the
 question, and never suppose, that a wise magistrate can justly be
 jealous of certain tenets of philosophy, such as those of Epicurus,
 which, denying a divine existence, and consequently a providence and a
 future state, seem to loosen, in a great measure, the ties of morality,
 and may be supposed, for that reason, pernicious to the peace of
 civil society.
 
 I know, replied he, that in fact these persecutions never, in any age,
 proceeded from calm reason, or from experience of the pernicious
 consequences of philosophy; but arose entirely from passion and
 prejudice. But what if I should advance farther, and assert, that if
 Epicurus had been accused before the people, by any of the _sycophants_
 or informers of those days, he could easily have defended his cause, and
 proved his principles of philosophy to be as salutary as those of his
 adversaries, who endeavoured, with such zeal, to expose him to the
 public hatred and jealousy?
 
 I wish, said I, you would try your eloquence upon so extraordinary a
 topic, and make a speech for Epicurus, which might satisfy, not the mob
 of Athens, if you will allow that ancient and polite city to have
 contained any mob, but the more philosophical part of his audience, such
 as might be supposed capable of comprehending his arguments.
 
 The matter would not be difficult, upon such conditions, replied he: And
 if you please, I shall suppose myself Epicurus for a moment, and make
 you stand for the Athenian people, and shall deliver you such an
 harangue as will fill all the urn with white beans, and leave not a
 black one to gratify the malice of my adversaries.
 
 Very well: Pray proceed upon these suppositions.
 
 104. I come hither, O ye Athenians, to justify in your assembly what I
 maintained in my school, and I find myself impeached by furious
 antagonists, instead of reasoning with calm and dispassionate enquirers.
 Your deliberations, which of right should be directed to questions of
 public good, and the interest of the commonwealth, are diverted to the
 disquisitions of speculative philosophy; and these magnificent, but
 perhaps fruitless enquiries, take place of your more familiar but more
 useful occupations. But so far as in me lies, I will prevent this abuse.
 We shall not here dispute concerning the origin and government of
 worlds. We shall only enquire how far such questions concern the public
 interest. And if I can persuade you, that they are entirely indifferent
 to the peace of society and security of government, I hope that you will
 presently send us back to our schools, there to examine, at leisure, the
 question the most sublime, but at the same time, the most speculative of
 all philosophy.
 
 The religious philosophers, not satisfied with the tradition of your
 forefathers, and doctrine of your priests (in which I willingly
 acquiesce), indulge a rash curiosity, in trying how far they can
 establish religion upon the principles of reason; and they thereby
 excite, instead of satisfying, the doubts, which naturally arise from a
 diligent and scrutinous enquiry. They paint, in the most magnificent
 colours, the order, beauty, and wise arrangement of the universe; and
 then ask, if such a glorious display of intelligence could proceed from
 the fortuitous concourse of atoms, or if chance could produce what the
 greatest genius can never sufficiently admire. I shall not examine the
 justness of this argument. I shall allow it to be as solid as my
 antagonists and accusers can desire. It is sufficient, if I can prove,
 from this very reasoning, that the question is entirely speculative, and
 that, when, in my philosophical disquisitions, I deny a providence and a
 future state, I undermine not the foundations of society, but advance
 principles, which they themselves, upon their own topics, if they argue
 consistently, must allow to be solid and satisfactory.
 
 105. You then, who are my accusers, have acknowledged, that the chief or
 sole argument for a divine existence (which I never questioned) is
 derived from the order of nature; where there appear such marks of
 intelligence and design, that you think it extravagant to assign for its
 cause, either chance, or the blind and unguided force of matter. You
 allow, that this is an argument drawn from effects to causes. From the
 order of the work, you infer, that there must have been project and
 forethought in the workman. If you cannot make out this point, you
 allow, that your conclusion fails; and you pretend not to establish the
 conclusion in a greater latitude than the phenomena of nature will
 justify. These are your concessions. I desire you to mark the
 consequences.
 
 When we infer any particular cause from an effect, we must proportion
 the one to the other, and can never be allowed to ascribe to the cause
 any qualities, but what are exactly sufficient to produce the effect. A
 body of ten ounces raised in any scale may serve as a proof, that the
 counterbalancing weight exceeds ten ounces; but can never afford a
 reason that it exceeds a hundred. If the cause, assigned for any effect,
 be not sufficient to produce it, we must either reject that cause, or
 add to it such qualities as will give it a just proportion to the
 effect. But if we ascribe to it farther qualities, or affirm it capable
 of producing other effects, we can only indulge the licence of
 conjecture, and arbitrarily suppose the existence of qualities and
 energies, without reason or authority.
 
 The same rule holds, whether the cause assigned be brute unconscious
 matter, or a rational intelligent being. If the cause be known only by
 the effect, we never ought to ascribe to it any qualities, beyond what
 are precisely requisite to produce the effect: Nor can we, by any rules
 of just reasoning, return back from the cause, and infer other effects
 from it, beyond those by which alone it is known to us. No one, merely
 from the sight of one of Zeuxis's pictures, could know, that he was also
 a statuary or architect, and was an artist no less skilful in stone and
 marble than in colours. The talents and taste, displayed in the
 particular work before us; these we may safely conclude the workman to
 be possessed of. The cause must be proportioned to the effect; and if
 we exactly and precisely proportion it, we shall never find in it any
 qualities, that point farther, or afford an inference concerning any
 other design or performance. Such qualities must be somewhat beyond what
 is merely requisite for producing the effect, which we examine.
 
 106. Allowing, therefore, the gods to be the authors of the existence or
 order of the universe; it follows, that they possess that precise degree
 of power, intelligence, and benevolence, which appears in their
 workmanship; but nothing farther can ever be proved, except we call in
 the assistance of exaggeration and flattery to supply the defects of
 argument and reasoning. So far as the traces of any attributes, at
 present, appear, so far may we conclude these attributes to exist. The
 supposition of farther attributes is mere hypothesis; much more the
 supposition, that, in distant regions of space or periods of time, there
 has been, or will be, a more magnificent display of these attributes,
 and a scheme of administration more suitable to such imaginary virtues.
 We can never be allowed to mount up from the universe, the effect, to
 Jupiter, the cause; and then descend downwards, to infer any new effect
 from that cause; as if the present effects alone were not entirely
 worthy of the glorious attributes, which we ascribe to that deity. The
 knowledge of the cause being derived solely from the effect, they must
 be exactly adjusted to each other; and the one can never refer to
 anything farther, or be the foundation of any new inference and
 conclusion.
 
 You find certain phenomena in nature. You seek a cause or author. You
 imagine that you have found him. You afterwards become so enamoured of
 this offspring of your brain, that you imagine it impossible, but he
 must produce something greater and more perfect than the present scene
 of things, which is so full of ill and disorder. You forget, that this
 superlative intelligence and benevolence are entirely imaginary, or, at
 least, without any foundation in reason; and that you have no ground to
 ascribe to him any qualities, but what you see he has actually exerted
 and displayed in his productions. Let your gods, therefore, O
 philosophers, be suited to the present appearances of nature: and
 presume not to alter these appearances by arbitrary suppositions, in
 order to suit them to the attributes, which you so fondly ascribe to
 your deities.
 
 107. When priests and poets, supported by your authority, O Athenians,
 talk of a golden or silver age, which preceded the present state of vice
 and misery, I hear them with attention and with reverence. But when
 philosophers, who pretend to neglect authority, and to cultivate reason,
 hold the same discourse, I pay them not, I own, the same obsequious
 submission and pious deference. I ask; who carried them into the
 celestial regions, who admitted them into the councils of the gods, who
 opened to them the book of fate, that they thus rashly affirm, that
 their deities have executed, or will execute, any purpose beyond what
 has actually appeared? If they tell me, that they have mounted on the
 steps or by the gradual ascent of reason, and by drawing inferences from
 effects to causes, I still insist, that they have aided the ascent of
 reason by the wings of imagination; otherwise they could not thus change
 their manner of inference, and argue from causes to effects; presuming,
 that a more perfect production than the present world would be more
 suitable to such perfect beings as the gods, and forgetting that they
 have no reason to ascribe to these celestial beings any perfection or
 any attribute, but what can be found in the present world.
 
 Hence all the fruitless industry to account for the ill appearances of
 nature, and save the honour of the gods; while we must acknowledge the
 reality of that evil and disorder, with which the world so much abounds.
 The obstinate and intractable qualities of matter, we are told, or the
 observance of general laws, or some such reason, is the sole cause,
 which controlled the power and benevolence of Jupiter, and obliged him
 to create mankind and every sensible creature so imperfect and so
 unhappy. These attributes then, are, it seems, beforehand, taken for
 granted, in their greatest latitude. And upon that supposition, I own
 that such conjectures may, perhaps, be admitted as plausible solutions
 of the ill phenomena. But still I ask; Why take these attributes for
 granted, or why ascribe to the cause any qualities but what actually
 appear in the effect? Why torture your brain to justify the course of
 nature upon suppositions, which, for aught you know, may be entirely
 imaginary, and of which there are to be found no traces in the course
 of nature?
 
 The religious hypothesis, therefore, must be considered only as a
 particular method of accounting for the visible phenomena of the
 universe: but no just reasoner will ever presume to infer from it any
 single fact, and alter or add to the phenomena, in any single
 particular. If you think, that the appearances of things prove such
 causes, it is allowable for you to draw an inference concerning the
 existence of these causes. In such complicated and sublime subjects,
 every one should be indulged in the liberty of conjecture and argument.
 But here you ought to rest. If you come backward, and arguing from your
 inferred causes, conclude, that any other fact has existed, or will
 exist, in the course of nature, which may serve as a fuller display of
 particular attributes; I must admonish you, that you have departed from
 the method of reasoning, attached to the present subject, and have
 certainly added something to the attributes of the cause, beyond what
 appears in the effect; otherwise you could never, with tolerable sense
 or propriety, add anything to the effect, in order to render it more
 worthy of the cause.
 
 108. Where, then, is the odiousness of that doctrine, which I teach in
 my school, or rather, which I examine in my gardens? Or what do you find
 in this whole question, wherein the security of good morals, or the
 peace and order of society, is in the least concerned?
 
 I deny a providence, you say, and supreme governor of the world, who
 guides the course of events, and punishes the vicious with infamy and
 disappointment, and rewards the virtuous with honour and success, in all
 their undertakings. But surely, I deny not the course itself of events,
 which lies open to every one's inquiry and examination. I acknowledge,
 that, in the present order of things, virtue is attended with more peace
 of mind than vice, and meets with a more favourable reception from the
 world. I am sensible, that, according to the past experience of mankind,
 friendship is the chief joy of human life, and moderation the only
 source of tranquillity and happiness. I never balance between the
 virtuous and the vicious course of life; but am sensible, that, to a
 well-disposed mind, every advantage is on the side of the former. And
 what can you say more, allowing all your suppositions and reasonings?
 You tell me, indeed, that this disposition of things proceeds from
 intelligence and design. But whatever it proceeds from, the disposition
 itself, on which depends our happiness or misery, and consequently our
 conduct and deportment in life is still the same. It is still open for
 me, as well as you, to regulate my behaviour, by my experience of past
 events. And if you affirm, that, while a divine providence is allowed,
 and a supreme distributive justice in the universe, I ought to expect
 some more particular reward of the good, and punishment of the bad,
 beyond the ordinary course of events; I here find the same fallacy,
 which I have before endeavoured to detect. You persist in imagining,
 that, if we grant that divine existence, for which you so earnestly
 contend, you may safely infer consequences from it, and add something
 to the experienced order of nature, by arguing from the attributes which
 you ascribe to your gods. You seem not to remember, that all your
 reasonings on this subject can only be drawn from effects to causes; and
 that every argument, deducted from causes to effects, must of necessity
 be a gross sophism; since it is impossible for you to know anything of
 the cause, but what you have antecedently, not inferred, but discovered
 to the full, in the effect.
 
 109. But what must a philosopher think of those vain reasoners, who,
 instead of regarding the present scene of things as the sole object of
 their contemplation, so far reverse the whole course of nature, as to
 render this life merely a passage to something farther; a porch, which
 leads to a greater, and vastly different building; a prologue, which
 serves only to introduce the piece, and give it more grace and
 propriety? Whence, do you think, can such philosophers derive their idea
 of the gods? From their own conceit and imagination surely. For if they
 derived it from the present phenomena, it would never point to anything
 farther, but must be exactly adjusted to them. That the divinity may
 _possibly_ be endowed with attributes, which we have never seen exerted;
 may be governed by principles of action, which we cannot discover to be
 satisfied: all this will freely be allowed. But still this is mere
 _possibility_ and hypothesis. We never can have reason to _infer_ any
 attributes, or any principles of action in him, but so far as we know
 them to have been exerted and satisfied.
 
 _Are there any marks of a distributive justice in the world?_ If you
 answer in the affirmative, I conclude, that, since justice here exerts
 itself, it is satisfied. If you reply in the negative, I conclude, that
 you have then no reason to ascribe justice, in our sense of it, to the
 gods. If you hold a medium between affirmation and negation, by saying,
 that the justice of the gods, at present, exerts itself in part, but not
 in its full extent; I answer, that you have no reason to give it any
 particular extent, but only so far as you see it, _at present_,
 exert itself.
 
 110. Thus I bring the dispute, O Athenians, to a short issue with my
 antagonists. The course of nature lies open to my contemplation as well
 as to theirs. The experienced train of events is the great standard, by
 which we all regulate our conduct. Nothing else can be appealed to in
 the field, or in the senate. Nothing else ought ever to be heard of in
 the school, or in the closet. In vain would our limited understanding
 break through those boundaries, which are too narrow for our fond
 imagination. While we argue from the course of nature, and infer a
 particular intelligent cause, which first bestowed, and still preserves
 order in the universe, we embrace a principle, which is both uncertain
 and useless. It is uncertain; because the subject lies entirely beyond
 the reach of human experience. It is useless; because our knowledge of
 this cause being derived entirely from the course of nature, we can
 never, according to the rules of just reasoning, return back from the
 cause with any new inference, or making additions to the common and
 experienced course of nature, establish any new principles of conduct
 and behaviour.
 
 111. I observe (said I, finding he had finished his harangue) that you
 neglect not the artifice of the demagogues of old; and as you were
 pleased to make me stand for the people, you insinuate yourself into my
 favour by embracing those principles, to which, you know, I have always
 expressed a particular attachment. But allowing you to make experience
 (as indeed I think you ought) the only standard of our judgement
 concerning this, and all other questions of fact; I doubt not but, from
 the very same experience, to which you appeal, it may be possible to
 refute this reasoning, which you have put into the mouth of Epicurus.
 If you saw, for instance, a half-finished building, surrounded with
 heaps of brick and stone and mortar, and all the instruments of masonry;
 could you not _infer_ from the effect, that it was a work of design and
 contrivance? And could you not return again, from this inferred cause,
 to infer new additions to the effect, and conclude, that the building
 would soon be finished, and receive all the further improvements, which
 art could bestow upon it? If you saw upon the sea-shore the print of one
 human foot, you would conclude, that a man had passed that way, and that
 he had also left the traces of the other foot, though effaced by the
 rolling of the sands or inundation of the waters. Why then do you refuse
 to admit the same method of reasoning with regard to the order of
 nature? Consider the world and the present life only as an imperfect
 building, from which you can infer a superior intelligence; and arguing
 from that superior intelligence, which can leave nothing imperfect; why
 may you not infer a more finished scheme or plan, which will receive its
 completion in some distant point of space or time? Are not these methods
 of reasoning exactly similar? And under what pretence can you embrace
 the one, while you reject the other?
 
 112. The infinite difference of the subjects, replied he, is a
 sufficient foundation for this difference in my conclusions. In works of
 _human_ art and contrivance, it is allowable to advance from the effect
 to the cause, and returning back from the cause, to form new inferences
 concerning the effect, and examine the alterations, which it has
 probably undergone, or may still undergo. But what is the foundation of
 this method of reasoning? Plainly this; that man is a being, whom we
 know by experience, whose motives and designs we are acquainted with,
 and whose projects and inclinations have a certain connexion and
 coherence, according to the laws which nature has established for the
 government of such a creature. When, therefore, we find, that any work
 has proceeded from the skill and industry of man; as we are otherwise
 acquainted with the nature of the animal, we can draw a hundred
 inferences concerning what may be expected from him; and these
 inferences will all be founded in experience and observation. But did we
 know man only from the single work or production which we examine, it
 were impossible for us to argue in this manner; because our knowledge of
 all the qualities, which we ascribe to him, being in that case derived
 from the production, it is impossible they could point to anything
 farther, or be the foundation of any new inference. The print of a foot
 in the sand can only prove, when considered alone, that there was some
 figure adapted to it, by which it was produced: but the print of a human
 foot proves likewise, from our other experience, that there was probably
 another foot, which also left its impression, though effaced by time or
 other accidents. Here we mount from the effect to the cause; and
 descending again from the cause, infer alterations in the effect; but
 this is not a continuation of the same simple chain of reasoning. We
 comprehend in this case a hundred other experiences and observations,
 concerning the _usual_ figure and members of that species of animal,
 without which this method of argument must be considered as fallacious
 and sophistical.
 
 113. The case is not the same with our reasonings from the works of
 nature. The Deity is known to us only by his productions, and is a
 single being in the universe, not comprehended under any species or
 genus, from whose experienced attributes or qualities, we can, by
 analogy, infer any attribute or quality in him. As the universe shews
 wisdom and goodness, we infer wisdom and goodness. As it shews a
 particular degree of these perfections, we infer a particular degree of
 them, precisely adapted to the effect which we examine. But farther
 attributes or farther degrees of the same attributes, we can never be
 authorised to infer or suppose, by any rules of just reasoning. Now,
 without some such licence of supposition, it is impossible for us to
 argue from the cause, or infer any alteration in the effect, beyond what
 has immediately fallen under our observation. Greater good produced by
 this Being must still prove a greater degree of goodness: a more
 impartial distribution of rewards and punishments must proceed from a
 greater regard to justice and equity. Every supposed addition to the
 works of nature makes an addition to the attributes of the Author of
 nature; and consequently, being entirely unsupported by any reason or
 argument, can never be admitted but as mere conjecture and
 hypothesis[30].
 
     [30] In general, it may, I think, be established as a maxim,
     that where any cause is known only by its particular effects,
     it must be impossible to infer any new effects from that cause;
     since the qualities, which are requisite to produce these new
     effects along with the former, must either be different, or
     superior, or of more extensive operation, than those which
     simply produced the effect, whence alone the cause is supposed
     to be known to us. We can never, therefore, have any reason to
     suppose the existence of these qualities. To say, that the new
     effects proceed only from a continuation of the same energy,
     which is already known from the first effects, will not remove
     the difficulty. For even granting this to be the case (which
     can seldom be supposed), the very continuation and exertion of
     a like energy (for it is impossible it can be absolutely the
     same), I say, this exertion of a like energy, in a different
     period of space and time, is a very arbitrary supposition, and
     what there cannot possibly be any traces of in the effects,
     from which all our knowledge of the cause is originally
     derived. Let the _inferred_ cause be exactly proportioned (as
     it should be) to the known effect; and it is impossible that
     it can possess any qualities, from which new or different
     effects can be _inferred_.
 
 The great source of our mistake in this subject, and of the unbounded
 licence of conjecture, which we indulge, is, that we tacitly consider
 ourselves, as in the place of the Supreme Being, and conclude, that he
 will, on every occasion, observe the same conduct, which we ourselves,
 in his situation, would have embraced as reasonable and eligible. But,
 besides that the ordinary course of nature may convince us, that almost
 everything is regulated by principles and maxims very different from
 ours; besides this, I say, it must evidently appear contrary to all
 rules of analogy to reason, from the intentions and projects of men, to
 those of a Being so different, and so much superior. In human nature,
 there is a certain experienced coherence of designs and inclinations; so
 that when, from any fact, we have discovered one intention of any man,
 it may often be reasonable, from experience, to infer another, and draw
 a long chain of conclusions concerning his past or future conduct. But
 this method of reasoning can never have place with regard to a Being, so
 remote and incomprehensible, who bears much less analogy to any other
 being in the universe than the sun to a waxen taper, and who discovers
 himself only by some faint traces or outlines, beyond which we have no
 authority to ascribe to him any attribute or perfection. What we imagine
 to be a superior perfection, may really be a defect. Or were it ever so
 much a perfection, the ascribing of it to the Supreme Being, where it
 appears not to have been really exerted, to the full, in his works,
 savours more of flattery and panegyric, than of just reasoning and sound
 philosophy. All the philosophy, therefore, in the world, and all the
 religion, which is nothing but a species of philosophy, will never be
 able to carry us beyond the usual course of experience, or give us
 measures of conduct and behaviour different from those which are
 furnished by reflections on common life. No new fact can ever be
 inferred from the religious hypothesis; no event foreseen or foretold;
 no reward or punishment expected or dreaded, beyond what is already
 known by practice and observation. So that my apology for Epicurus will
 still appear solid and satisfactory; nor have the political interests
 of society any connexion with the philosophical disputes concerning
 metaphysics and religion.
 
 114. There is still one circumstance, replied I, which you seem to have
 overlooked. Though I should allow your premises, I must deny your
 conclusion. You conclude, that religious doctrines and reasonings _can_
 have no influence on life, because they _ought_ to have no influence;
 never considering, that men reason not in the same manner you do, but
 draw many consequences from the belief of a divine Existence, and
 suppose that the Deity will inflict punishments on vice, and bestow
 rewards on virtue, beyond what appear in the ordinary course of nature.
 Whether this reasoning of theirs be just or not, is no matter. Its
 influence on their life and conduct must still be the same. And, those,
 who attempt to disabuse them of such prejudices, may, for aught I know,
 be good reasoners, but I cannot allow them to be good citizens and
 politicians; since they free men from one restraint upon their passions,
 and make the infringement of the laws of society, in one respect, more
 easy and secure.
 
 After all, I may, perhaps, agree to your general conclusion in favour of
 liberty, though upon different premises from those, on which you
 endeavour to found it. I think, that the state ought to tolerate every
 principle of philosophy; nor is there an instance, that any government
 has suffered in its political interests by such indulgence. There is no
 enthusiasm among philosophers; their doctrines are not very alluring to
 the people; and no restraint can be put upon their reasonings, but what
 must be of dangerous consequence to the sciences, and even to the state,
 by paving the way for persecution and oppression in points, where the
 generality of mankind are more deeply interested and concerned.
 
 115. But there occurs to me (continued I) with regard to your main
 topic, a difficulty, which I shall just propose to you without insisting
 on it; lest it lead into reasonings of too nice and delicate a nature.
 In a word, I much doubt whether it be possible for a cause to be known
 only by its effect (as you have all along supposed) or to be of so
 singular and particular a nature as to have no parallel and no
 similarity with any other cause or object, that has ever fallen under
 our observation. It is only when two _species_ of objects are found to
 be constantly conjoined, that we can infer the one from the other; and
 were an effect presented, which was entirely singular, and could not be
 comprehended under any known _species_, I do not see, that we could form
 any conjecture or inference at all concerning its cause. If experience
 and observation and analogy be, indeed, the only guides which we can
 reasonably follow in inferences of this nature; both the effect and
 cause must bear a similarity and resemblance to other effects and
 causes, which we know, and which we have found, in many instances, to be
 conjoined with each other. I leave it to your own reflection to pursue
 the consequences of this principle. I shall just observe, that, as the
 antagonists of Epicurus always suppose the universe, an effect quite
 singular and unparalleled, to be the proof of a Deity, a cause no less
 singular and unparalleled; your reasonings, upon that supposition, seem,
 at least, to merit our attention. There is, I own, some difficulty, how
 we can ever return from the cause to the effect, and, reasoning from our
 ideas of the former, infer any alteration on the latter, or any
 addition to it.
 
 
 
 SECTION XII.
 
 OF THE ACADEMICAL OR SCEPTICAL PHILOSOPHY.
 
 
 PART I.
 
 
 116. There is not a greater number of philosophical reasonings,
 displayed upon any subject, than those, which prove the existence of a
 Deity, and refute the fallacies of _Atheists_; and yet the most
 religious philosophers still dispute whether any man can be so blinded
 as to be a speculative atheist. How shall we reconcile these
 contradictions? The knights-errant, who wandered about to clear the
 world of dragons and giants, never entertained the least doubt with
 regard to the existence of these monsters.
 
 The _Sceptic_ is another enemy of religion, who naturally provokes the
 indignation of all divines and graver philosophers; though it is
 certain, that no man ever met with any such absurd creature, or
 conversed with a man, who had no opinion or principle concerning any
 subject, either of action or speculation. This begets a very natural
 question; What is meant by a sceptic? And how far it is possible to push
 these philosophical principles of doubt and uncertainty?
 
 There is a species of scepticism, _antecedent_ to all study and
 philosophy, which is much inculcated by Des Cartes and others, as a
 sovereign preservative against error and precipitate judgement. It
 recommends an universal doubt, not only of all our former opinions and
 principles, but also of our very faculties; of whose veracity, say they,
 we must assure ourselves, by a chain of reasoning, deduced from some
 original principle, which cannot possibly be fallacious or deceitful.
 But neither is there any such original principle, which has a
 prerogative above others, that are self-evident and convincing: or if
 there were, could we advance a step beyond it, but by the use of those
 very faculties, of which we are supposed to be already diffident. The
 Cartesian doubt, therefore, were it ever possible to be attained by any
 human creature (as it plainly is not) would be entirely incurable; and
 no reasoning could ever bring us to a state of assurance and conviction
 upon any subject.
 
 It must, however, be confessed, that this species of scepticism, when
 more moderate, may be understood in a very reasonable sense, and is a
 necessary preparative to the study of philosophy, by preserving a proper
 impartiality in our judgements, and weaning our mind from all those
 prejudices, which we may have imbibed from education or rash opinion. To
 begin with clear and self-evident principles, to advance by timorous and
 sure steps, to review frequently our conclusions, and examine accurately
 all their consequences; though by these means we shall make both a slow
 and a short progress in our systems; are the only methods, by which we
 can ever hope to reach truth, and attain a proper stability and
 certainty in our determinations.
 
 117. There is another species of scepticism, _consequent_ to science and
 enquiry, when men are supposed to have discovered, either the absolute
 fallaciousness of their mental faculties, or their unfitness to reach
 any fixed determination in all those curious subjects of speculation,
 about which they are commonly employed. Even our very senses are brought
 into dispute, by a certain species of philosophers; and the maxims of
 common life are subjected to the same doubt as the most profound
 principles or conclusions of metaphysics and theology. As these
 paradoxical tenets (if they may be called tenets) are to be met with in
 some philosophers, and the refutation of them in several, they naturally
 excite our curiosity, and make us enquire into the arguments, on which
 they may be founded.
 
 I need not insist upon the more trite topics, employed by the sceptics
 in all ages, against the evidence of _sense_; such as those which are
 derived from the imperfection and fallaciousness of our organs, on
 numberless occasions; the crooked appearance of an oar in water; the
 various aspects of objects, according to their different distances; the
 double images which arise from the pressing one eye; with many other
 appearances of a like nature. These sceptical topics, indeed, are only
 sufficient to prove, that the senses alone are not implicitly to be
 depended on; but that we must correct their evidence by reason, and by
 considerations, derived from the nature of the medium, the distance of
 the object, and the disposition of the organ, in order to render them,
 within their sphere, the proper _criteria_ of truth and falsehood. There
 are other more profound arguments against the senses, which admit not of
 so easy a solution.
 
 118. It seems evident, that men are carried, by a natural instinct or
 prepossession, to repose faith in their senses; and that, without any
 reasoning, or even almost before the use of reason, we always suppose an
 external universe, which depends not on our perception, but would exist,
 though we and every sensible creature were absent or annihilated. Even
 the animal creation are governed by a like opinion, and preserve this
 belief of external objects, in all their thoughts, designs, and actions.
 
 It seems also evident, that, when men follow this blind and powerful
 instinct of nature, they always suppose the very images, presented by
 the senses, to be the external objects, and never entertain any
 suspicion, that the one are nothing but representations of the other.
 This very table, which we see white, and which we feel hard, is believed
 to exist, independent of our perception, and to be something external
 to our mind, which perceives it. Our presence bestows not being on it:
 our absence does not annihilate it. It preserves its existence uniform
 and entire, independent of the situation of intelligent beings, who
 perceive or contemplate it.
 
 But this universal and primary opinion of all men is soon destroyed by
 the slightest philosophy, which teaches us, that nothing can ever be
 present to the mind but an image or perception, and that the senses are
 only the inlets, through which these images are conveyed, without being
 able to produce any immediate intercourse between the mind and the
 object. The table, which we see, seems to diminish, as we remove farther
 from it: but the real table, which exists independent of us, suffers no
 alteration: it was, therefore, nothing but its image, which was present
 to the mind. These are the obvious dictates of reason; and no man, who
 reflects, ever doubted, that the existences, which we consider, when we
 say, _this house_ and _that tree_, are nothing but perceptions in the
 mind, and fleeting copies or representations of other existences, which
 remain uniform and independent.
 
 119. So far, then, are we necessitated by reasoning to contradict or
 depart from the primary instincts of nature, and to embrace a new system
 with regard to the evidence of our senses. But here philosophy finds
 herself extremely embarrassed, when she would justify this new system,
 and obviate the cavils and objections of the sceptics. She can no longer
 plead the infallible and irresistible instinct of nature: for that led
 us to a quite different system, which is acknowledged fallible and even
 erroneous. And to justify this pretended philosophical system, by a
 chain of clear and convincing argument, or even any appearance of
 argument, exceeds the power of all human capacity.
 
 By what argument can it be proved, that the perceptions of the mind
 must be caused by external objects, entirely different from them, though
 resembling them (if that be possible) and could not arise either from
 the energy of the mind itself, or from the suggestion of some invisible
 and unknown spirit, or from some other cause still more unknown to us?
 It is acknowledged, that, in fact, many of these perceptions arise not
 from anything external, as in dreams, madness, and other diseases. And
 nothing can be more inexplicable than the manner, in which body should
 so operate upon mind as ever to convey an image of itself to a
 substance, supposed of so different, and even contrary a nature.
 
 It is a question of fact, whether the perceptions of the senses be
 produced by external objects, resembling them: how shall this question
 be determined? By experience surely; as all other questions of a like
 nature. But here experience is, and must be entirely silent. The mind
 has never anything present to it but the perceptions, and cannot
 possibly reach any experience of their connexion with objects. The
 supposition of such a connexion is, therefore, without any foundation in
 reasoning.
 
 120. To have recourse to the veracity of the supreme Being, in order to
 prove the veracity of our senses, is surely making a very unexpected
 circuit. If his veracity were at all concerned in this matter, our
 senses would be entirely infallible; because it is not possible that he
 can ever deceive. Not to mention, that, if the external world be once
 called in question, we shall be at a loss to find arguments, by which we
 may prove the existence of that Being or any of his attributes.
 
 121. This is a topic, therefore, in which the profounder and more
 philosophical sceptics will always triumph, when they endeavour to
 introduce an universal doubt into all subjects of human knowledge and
 enquiry. Do you follow the instincts and propensities of nature, may
 they say, in assenting to the veracity of sense? But these lead you to
 believe that the very perception or sensible image is the external
 object. Do you disclaim this principle, in order to embrace a more
 rational opinion, that the perceptions are only representations of
 something external? You here depart from your natural propensities and
 more obvious sentiments; and yet are not able to satisfy your reason,
 which can never find any convincing argument from experience to prove,
 that the perceptions are connected with any external objects.
 
 122. There is another sceptical topic of a like nature, derived from the
 most profound philosophy; which might merit our attention, were it
 requisite to dive so deep, in order to discover arguments and
 reasonings, which can so little serve to any serious purpose. It is
 universally allowed by modern enquirers, that all the sensible qualities
 of objects, such as hard, soft, hot, cold, white, black, &c. are merely
 secondary, and exist not in the objects themselves, but are perceptions
 of the mind, without any external archetype or model, which they
 represent. If this be allowed, with regard to secondary qualities, it
 must also follow, with regard to the supposed primary qualities of
 extension and solidity; nor can the latter be any more entitled to that
 denomination than the former. The idea of extension is entirely acquired
 from the senses of sight and feeling; and if all the qualities,
 perceived by the senses, be in the mind, not in the object, the same
 conclusion must reach the idea of extension, which is wholly dependent
 on the sensible ideas or the ideas of secondary qualities. Nothing can
 save us from this conclusion, but the asserting, that the ideas of those
 primary qualities are attained by _Abstraction_, an opinion, which, if
 we examine it accurately, we shall find to be unintelligible, and even
 absurd. An extension, that is neither tangible nor visible, cannot
 possibly be conceived: and a tangible or visible extension, which is
 neither hard nor soft, black nor white, is equally beyond the reach of
 human conception. Let any man try to conceive a triangle in general,
 which is neither _Isosceles_ nor _Scalenum_, nor has any particular
 length or proportion of sides; and he will soon perceive the absurdity
 of all the scholastic notions with regard to abstraction and
 general ideas.[31]
 
     [31] This argument is drawn from Dr. Berkeley; and indeed most
     of the writings of that very ingenious author form the best
     lessons of scepticism, which are to be found either among
     the ancient or modern philosopher, Bayle not excepted. He
     professes, however, in his title-page (and undoubtedly with
     great truth) to have composed his book against the sceptics as
     well as against the atheists and free-thinkers. But that all
     his arguments, though otherwise intended, are, in reality,
     merely sceptical, appears from this, _that they admit of no
     answer and produce no conviction_. Their only effect is to
     cause that momentary amazement and irresolution and confusion,
     which is the result of scepticism.
 
 123. Thus the first philosophical objection to the evidence of sense or
 to the opinion of external existence consists in this, that such an
 opinion, if rested on natural instinct, is contrary to reason, and if
 referred to reason, is contrary to natural instinct, and at the same
 time carries no rational evidence with it, to convince an impartial
 enquirer. The second objection goes farther, and represents this opinion
 as contrary to reason: at least, if it be a principle of reason, that
 all sensible qualities are in the mind, not in the object. Bereave
 matter of all its intelligible qualities, both primary and secondary,
 you in a manner annihilate it, and leave only a certain unknown,
 inexplicable _something_, as the cause of our perceptions; a notion so
 imperfect, that no sceptic will think it worth while to contend
 against it.
 
 
 PART II.
 
 
 124. It may seem a very extravagant attempt of the sceptics to destroy
 _reason_ by argument and ratiocination; yet is this the grand scope of
 all their enquiries and disputes. They endeavour to find objections,
 both to our abstract reasonings, and to those which regard matter of
 fact and existence.
 
 The chief objection against all _abstract_ reasonings is derived from
 the ideas of space and time; ideas, which, in common life and to a
 careless view, are very clear and intelligible, but when they pass
 through the scrutiny of the profound sciences (and they are the chief
 object of these sciences) afford principles, which seem full of
 absurdity and contradiction. No priestly _dogmas_, invented on purpose
 to tame and subdue the rebellious reason of mankind, ever shocked common
 sense more than the doctrine of the infinitive divisibility of
 extension, with its consequences; as they are pompously displayed by all
 geometricians and metaphysicians, with a kind of triumph and exultation.
 A real quantity, infinitely less than any finite quantity, containing
 quantities infinitely less than itself, and so on _in infinitum_; this
 is an edifice so bold and prodigious, that it is too weighty for any
 pretended demonstration to support, because it shocks the clearest and
 most natural principles of human reason.[32] But what renders the matter
 more extraordinary, is, that these seemingly absurd opinions are
 supported by a chain of reasoning, the clearest and most natural; nor is
 it possible for us to allow the premises without admitting the
 consequences. Nothing can be more convincing and satisfactory than all
 the conclusions concerning the properties of circles and triangles; and
 yet, when these are once received, how can we deny, that the angle of
 contact between a circle and its tangent is infinitely less than any
 rectilineal angle, that as you may increase the diameter of the circle
 _in infinitum_, this angle of contact becomes still less, even _in
 infinitum_, and that the angle of contact between other curves and their
 tangents may be infinitely less than those between any circle and its
 tangent, and so on, _in infinitum_? The demonstration of these
 principles seems as unexceptionable as that which proves the three
 angles of a triangle to be equal to two right ones, though the latter
 opinion be natural and easy, and the former big with contradiction and
 absurdity. Reason here seems to be thrown into a kind of amazement and
 suspence, which, without the suggestions of any sceptic, gives her a
 diffidence of herself, and of the ground on which she treads. She sees a
 full light, which illuminates certain places; but that light borders
 upon the most profound darkness. And between these she is so dazzled and
 confounded, that she scarcely can pronounce with certainty and assurance
 concerning any one object.
 
     [32] Whatever disputes there may be about mathematical points,
     we must allow that there are physical points; that is, parts
     of extension, which cannot be divided or lessened, either by
     the eye or imagination. These images, then, which are present
     to the fancy or senses, are absolutely indivisible, and
     consequently must be allowed by mathematicians to be infinitely
     less than any real part of extension; and yet nothing appears
     more certain to reason, than that an infinite number of them
     composes an infinite extension. How much more an infinite
     number of those infinitely small parts of extension, which are
     still supposed infinitely divisible.
 
 125. The absurdity of these bold determinations of the abstract sciences
 seems to become, if possible, still more palpable with regard to time
 than extension. An infinite number of real parts of time, passing in
 succession, and exhausted one after another, appears so evident a
 contradiction, that no man, one should think, whose judgement is not
 corrupted, instead of being improved, by the sciences, would ever be
 able to admit of it.
 
 Yet still reason must remain restless, and unquiet, even with regard to
 that scepticism, to which she is driven by these seeming absurdities and
 contradictions. How any clear, distinct idea can contain circumstances,
 contradictory to itself, or to any other clear, distinct idea, is
 absolutely incomprehensible; and is, perhaps, as absurd as any
 proposition, which can be formed. So that nothing can be more
 sceptical, or more full of doubt and hesitation, than this scepticism
 itself, which arises from some of the paradoxical conclusions of
 geometry or the science of quantity.[33]
 
     [33] It seems to me not impossible to avoid these absurdities
     and contradictions, if it be admitted, that there is no such
     thing as abstract or general ideas, properly speaking; but that
     all general ideas are, in reality, particular ones, attached to
     a general term, which recalls, upon occasion, other particular
     ones, that resemble, in certain circumstances, the idea,
     present to the mind. Thus when the term Horse is pronounced, we
     immediately figure to ourselves the idea of a black or a white
     animal, of a particular size or figure: But as that term is
     also usually applied to animals of other colours, figures and
     sizes, these ideas, though not actually present to the imagination,
     are easily recalled; and our reasoning and conclusion proceed
     in the same way, as if they were actually present. If this be
     admitted (as seems reasonable) it follows that all the ideas of
     quantity, upon which mathematicians reason, are nothing but
     particular, and such as are suggested by the senses and
     imagination, and consequently, cannot be infinitely divisible.
     It is sufficient to have dropped this hint at present, without
     prosecuting it any farther. It certainly concerns all lovers
     of science not to expose themselves to the ridicule and
     contempt of the ignorant by their conclusions; and this seems
     the readiest solution of these difficulties.
 
 126. The sceptical objections to _moral_ evidence, or to the reasonings
 concerning matter of fact, are either _popular_ or _philosophical_. The
 popular objections are derived from the natural weakness of human
 understanding; the contradictory opinions, which have been entertained
 in different ages and nations; the variations of our judgement in
 sickness and health, youth and old age, prosperity and adversity; the
 perpetual contradiction of each particular man's opinions and
 sentiments; with many other topics of that kind. It is needless to
 insist farther on this head. These objections are but weak. For as, in
 common life, we reason every moment concerning fact and existence, and
 cannot possibly subsist, without continually employing this species of
 argument, any popular objections, derived from thence, must be
 insufficient to destroy that evidence. The great subverter of
 _Pyrrhonism_ or the excessive principles of scepticism is action, and
 employment, and the occupations of common life. These principles may
 flourish and triumph in the schools; where it is, indeed, difficult, if
 not impossible, to refute them. But as soon as they leave the shade, and
 by the presence of the real objects, which actuate our passions and
 sentiments, are put in opposition to the more powerful principles of our
 nature, they vanish like smoke, and leave the most determined sceptic in
 the same condition as other mortals.
 
 127. The sceptic, therefore, had better keep within his proper sphere,
 and display those _philosophical_ objections, which arise from more
 profound researches. Here he seems to have ample matter of triumph;
 while he justly insists, that all our evidence for any matter of fact,
 which lies beyond the testimony of sense or memory, is derived entirely
 from the relation of cause and effect; that we have no other idea of
 this relation than that of two objects, which have been frequently
 _conjoined_ together; that we have no argument to convince us, that
 objects, which have, in our experience, been frequently conjoined, will
 likewise, in other instances, be conjoined in the same manner; and that
 nothing leads us to this inference but custom or a certain instinct of
 our nature; which it is indeed difficult to resist, but which, like
 other instincts, may be fallacious and deceitful. While the sceptic
 insists upon these topics, he shows his force, or rather, indeed, his
 own and our weakness; and seems, for the time at least, to destroy all
 assurance and conviction. These arguments might be displayed at greater
 length, if any durable good or benefit to society could ever be expected
 to result from them.
 
 128. For here is the chief and most confounding objection to _excessive_
 scepticism, that no durable good can ever result from it; while it
 remains in its full force and vigour. We need only ask such a sceptic,
 _What his meaning is? And what he proposes by all these curious
 researches?_ He is immediately at a loss, and knows not what to answer.
 A Copernican or Ptolemaic, who supports each his different system of
 astronomy, may hope to produce a conviction, which will remain constant
 and durable, with his audience. A Stoic or Epicurean displays
 principles, which may not be durable, but which have an effect on
 conduct and behaviour. But a Pyrrhonian cannot expect, that his
 philosophy will have any constant influence on the mind: or if it had,
 that its influence would be beneficial to society. On the contrary, he
 must acknowledge, if he will acknowledge anything, that all human life
 must perish, were his principles universally and steadily to prevail.
 All discourse, all action would immediately cease; and men remain in a
 total lethargy, till the necessities of nature, unsatisfied, put an end
 to their miserable existence. It is true; so fatal an event is very
 little to be dreaded. Nature is always too strong for principle. And
 though a Pyrrhonian may throw himself or others into a momentary
 amazement and confusion by his profound reasonings; the first and most
 trivial event in life will put to flight all his doubts and scruples, and
 leave him the same, in every point of action and speculation, with the
 philosophers of every other sect, or with those who never concerned
 themselves in any philosophical researches. When he awakes from his
 dream, he will be the first to join in the laugh against himself, and to
 confess, that all his objections are mere amusement, and can have no
 other tendency than to show the whimsical condition of mankind, who must
 act and reason and believe; though they are not able, by their most
 diligent enquiry, to satisfy themselves concerning the foundation of
 these operations, or to remove the objections, which may be raised
 against them.
 
 
 PART III.
 
 
 129. There is, indeed, a more _mitigated_ scepticism or _academical_
 philosophy, which may be both durable and useful, and which may, in
 part, be the result of this Pyrrhonism, or _excessive_ scepticism, when
 its undistinguished doubts are, in some measure, corrected by common
 sense and reflection. The greater part of mankind are naturally apt to
 be affirmative and dogmatical in their opinions; and while they see
 objects only on one side, and have no idea of any counterpoising
 argument, they throw themselves precipitately into the principles, to
 which they are inclined; nor have they any indulgence for those who
 entertain opposite sentiments. To hesitate or balance perplexes their
 understanding, checks their passion, and suspends their action. They
 are, therefore, impatient till they escape from a state, which to them
 is so uneasy: and they think, that they could never remove themselves
 far enough from it, by the violence of their affirmations and obstinacy
 of their belief. But could such dogmatical reasoners become sensible of
 the strange infirmities of human understanding, even in its most perfect
 state, and when most accurate and cautious in its determinations; such a
 reflection would naturally inspire them with more modesty and reserve,
 and diminish their fond opinion of themselves, and their prejudice
 against antagonists. The illiterate may reflect on the disposition of
 the learned, who, amidst all the advantages of study and reflection, are
 commonly still diffident in their determinations: and if any of the
 learned be inclined, from their natural temper, to haughtiness and
 obstinacy, a small tincture of Pyrrhonism might abate their pride, by
 showing them, that the few advantages, which they may have attained over
 their fellows, are but inconsiderable, if compared with the universal
 perplexity and confusion, which is inherent in human nature. In
 general, there is a degree of doubt, and caution, and modesty, which,
 in all kinds of scrutiny and decision, ought for ever to accompany a
 just reasoner.
 
 130. Another species of _mitigated_ scepticism which may be of advantage
 to mankind, and which may be the natural result of the Pyrrhonian doubts
 and scruples, is the limitation of our enquiries to such subjects as are
 best adapted to the narrow capacity of human understanding. The
 _imagination_ of man is naturally sublime, delighted with whatever is
 remote and extraordinary, and running, without control, into the most
 distant parts of space and time in order to avoid the objects, which
 custom has rendered too familiar to it. A correct _Judgement_ observes a
 contrary method, and avoiding all distant and high enquiries, confines
 itself to common life, and to such subjects as fall under daily practice
 and experience; leaving the more sublime topics to the embellishment of
 poets and orators, or to the arts of priests and politicians. To bring
 us to so salutary a determination, nothing can be more serviceable, than
 to be once thoroughly convinced of the force of the Pyrrhonian doubt,
 and of the impossibility, that anything, but the strong power of natural
 instinct, could free us from it. Those who have a propensity to
 philosophy, will still continue their researches; because they reflect,
 that, besides the immediate pleasure, attending such an occupation,
 philosophical decisions are nothing but the reflections of common life,
 methodized and corrected. But they will never be tempted to go beyond
 common life, so long as they consider the imperfection of those
 faculties which they employ, their narrow reach, and their inaccurate
 operations. While we cannot give a satisfactory reason, why we believe,
 after a thousand experiments, that a stone will fall, or fire burn; can
 we ever satisfy ourselves concerning any determination, which we may
 form, with regard to the origin of worlds, and the situation of nature,
 from, and to eternity?
 
 This narrow limitation, indeed, of our enquiries, is, in every respect,
 so reasonable, that it suffices to make the slightest examination into
 the natural powers of the human mind and to compare them with their
 objects, in order to recommend it to us. We shall then find what are the
 proper subjects of science and enquiry.
 
 131. It seems to me, that the only objects of the abstract science or of
 demonstration are quantity and number, and that all attempts to extend
 this more perfect species of knowledge beyond these bounds are mere
 sophistry and illusion. As the component parts of quantity and number
 are entirely similar, their relations become intricate and involved; and
 nothing can be more curious, as well as useful, than to trace, by a
 variety of mediums, their equality or inequality, through their
 different appearances. But as all other ideas are clearly distinct and
 different from each other, we can never advance farther, by our utmost
 scrutiny, than to observe this diversity, and, by an obvious reflection,
 pronounce one thing not to be another. Or if there be any difficulty in
 these decisions, it proceeds entirely from the undeterminate meaning of
 words, which is corrected by juster definitions. That _the square of the
 hypothenuse is equal to the squares of the other two sides_, cannot be
 known, let the terms be ever so exactly defined, without a train of
 reasoning and enquiry. But to convince us of this proposition, _that
 where there is no property, there can be no injustice_, it is only
 necessary to define the terms, and explain injustice to be a violation
 of property. This proposition is, indeed, nothing but a more imperfect
 definition. It is the same case with all those pretended syllogistical
 reasonings, which may be found in every other branch of learning, except
 the sciences of quantity and number; and these may safely, I think, be
 pronounced the only proper objects of knowledge and demonstration.
 
 132. All other enquiries of men regard only matter of fact and
 existence; and these are evidently incapable of demonstration. Whatever
 _is_ may _not be_. No negation of a fact can involve a contradiction.
 The non-existence of any being, without exception, is as clear and
 distinct an idea as its existence. The proposition, which affirms it not
 to be, however false, is no less conceivable and intelligible, than that
 which affirms it to be. The case is different with the sciences,
 properly so called. Every proposition, which is not true, is there
 confused and unintelligible. That the cube root of 64 is equal to the
 half of 10, is a false proposition, and can never be distinctly
 conceived. But that Caesar, or the angel Gabriel, or any being never
 existed, may be a false proposition, but still is perfectly conceivable,
 and implies no contradiction.
 
 The existence, therefore, of any being can only be proved by arguments
 from its cause or its effect; and these arguments are founded entirely
 on experience. If we reason _a priori_, anything may appear able to
 produce anything. The falling of a pebble may, for aught we know,
 extinguish the sun; or the wish of a man control the planets in their
 orbits. It is only experience, which teaches us the nature and bounds of
 cause and effect, and enables us to infer the existence of one object
 from that of another[34]. Such is the foundation of moral reasoning,
 which forms the greater part of human knowledge, and is the source of
 all human action and behaviour.
 
     [34] That impious maxim of the ancient philosophy, _Ex nihilo,
     nihil fit_, by which the creation of matter was excluded,
     ceases to be a maxim, according to this philosophy. Not only the
     will of the supreme Being may create matter; but, for aught we
     know _a priori_, the will of any other being might create it,
     or any other cause, that the most whimsical imagination
     can assign.
 
 Moral reasonings are either concerning particular or general facts. All
 deliberations in life regard the former; as also all disquisitions in
 history, chronology, geography, and astronomy.
 
 The sciences, which treat of general facts, are politics, natural
 philosophy, physic, chemistry, &c. where the qualities, causes and
 effects of a whole species of objects are enquired into.
 
 Divinity or Theology, as it proves the existence of a Deity, and the
 immortality of souls, is composed partly of reasonings concerning
 particular, partly concerning general facts. It has a foundation in
 _reason_, so far as it is supported by experience. But its best and most
 solid foundation is _faith_ and divine revelation.
 
 Morals and criticism are not so properly objects of the understanding as
 of taste and sentiment. Beauty, whether moral or natural, is felt, more
 properly than perceived. Or if we reason concerning it, and endeavour to
 fix its standard, we regard a new fact, to wit, the general tastes of
 mankind, or some such fact, which may be the object of reasoning
 and enquiry.
 
 When we run over libraries, persuaded of these principles, what havoc
 must we make? If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school
 metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, _Does it contain any abstract
 reasoning concerning quantity or number?_ No. _Does it contain any
 experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence?_ No.
 Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry
 and illusion.

   sole foundation of reasonings about matter of fact or real existence,
           22.
 
   A. _Knowledge of Causes arises from experience not from Reason_,
           23-33.
 
   Reasonings _a priori_ give no knowledge of cause and effect,
           23 f.;
   impossible to see the effect in the cause since they are totally
           different, 25;
   natural philosophy never pretends to assign ultimate causes, but only
           to reduce causes to a few general causes, e.g. gravity, 26;
   geometry applies laws obtained by experience, 27.
 
   Conclusions from experience not based on any process of the
           understanding, 28;
   yet we infer in the future a similar connexion between known
           qualities of things and their secret powers, to that which
           we assumed in the past. On what is this inference based? 29;
   demonstrative reasoning has no place here, and all experimental
           reasoning assumes the resemblance of the future to the past,
           and so cannot prove it without being circular, 30, 32;
   if reasoning were the basis of this belief, there would be no need
           for the multiplication of instances or of long experience,
           31;
   yet conclusions about matter of fact are affected by experience even
           in beasts and children, so that they cannot be founded on
           abstruse reasoning, 33;
   to explain our inferences from experience a principle is required of
           equal weight and authority with reason, 34.
 
   B. _Custom enables us to infer existence of one object from the
           appearance of another_, 35-38.
 
   Experience enables us to ascribe a more than arbitrary connexion to
           objects, 35;
   we are determined to this by custom or habit which is the great guide
           of human life, 36;
   but our inference must be based on some fact present to the senses
           or memory, 37;
   the customary conjunction between such an object and some other
           object produces an operation of the soul which is as
           unavoidable as love, 38;
   animals also infer one event from another by custom, 82-84;
   and in man as in animals experimental reasoning depends on a species
           of instinct or mechanical power that acts in us unknown to
           ourselves, 85.
 
   C. _Belief_, 39-45.
   Belief differs from fiction or the loose reveries of the fancy by
           some feeling annexed to it, 39;
   belief cannot be defined, but may be described as a more lively,
           forcible, firm, steady conception of an object than can be
           attained by the imagination alone, 40;
   it is produced by the principles of association, viz. resemblance,
           41;
   contiguity, 42;
   causation, 43;
   by a kind of pre-established harmony between the course of nature
           and our ideas, 44;
   this operation of our minds necessary to our subsistence and so
           entrusted by nature to instinct rather than to reasoning, 45.
 
   _Probability_, 46-7.
 
   Belief produced by a majority of chances by an inexplicable
           contrivance of Nature, 46 (cf. 87-8);
   probability of causes: the failure of a cause ascribed to a secret
           counteracting cause, 47 (cf. 67);
   it is universally allowed that chance when strictly examined is a
           mere negative word, 74.
 
   D. _Power_, 49-57.
 
   Power, force, energy, necessary connexion must either be defined by
           analysis or explained by production of the impression from
           which they are copied, 49;
   from the first appearance of an object we cannot foretell its effect:
           we cannot see the power of a single body: we only see
           sequence, 50.
 
   Is the idea of power derived from an internal impression and is it an
           idea of reflection? 51;
   it is not derived, as Locke said, from reasoning about power of
           production in nature, 50 n;
   nor from consciousness of influence of will over bodily organs, 52;
   nor from effort to overcome resistance, 52 n (cf. 60 n);
   nor from influence of will over mind, 53;
   many philosophers appeal to an invisible intelligent principle, to a
           volition of the supreme being, and regard causes as only
           occasions and our mental conceptions as revelations, 54-5;
   thus diminishing the grandeur of God, 56;
   this theory too bold and beyond verification by our faculties, and
           is no explanation, 57;
   vis inertiae, 57 n.
 
   In single instances we only see sequence of loose events which are
           conjoined and never connected, 58;
   the idea of necessary connexion only arises from a number of similar
           instances, and the only difference between such a number and
           a single instance is that the former produces a habit of
           expecting the usual attendant, 59, 61.
   This customary transition is the impression from which we form the
           idea of necessary connexion.
 
   E. _Reasoning from effect to cause and conversely_, 105-115 (v.
           _Providence_).
 
   In arguing from effect to cause we must not infer more qualities in
           the cause than are required to produce the effect, nor reason
           backwards from an inferred cause to new effects, 105-8;
   we can reason back from cause to new effects in the case of human
           acts by analogy which rests on previous knowledge, 111-2;
   when the effect is entirely singular and does not belong to any
           species we cannot infer its cause at all, 115.

   doctrine of necessity either makes God the cause of evil or denies
           existence of evil as regards the whole, 78-81.

 God
   idea of, 14;
   no idea of except what we learn from reflection on our own
           faculties, 57;
   theory that God is cause of all motion and thought, causes being

   all ideas resolvable into simple ideas copied from precedent
           feelings, 14;

           and Cause or Effect, 19;

   production of belief by these principles, 41-43.
 
   C. Correspondence of ideas and course of nature, 44;
   relations of ideas one of two possible objects of enquiry, 20;
   such relations discoverable by the mere operation of thought, 20,

 Miracles.
   86-101.
 
   Belief in human evidence diminishes according as the event witnessed
           is unusual or extraordinary, 89;
   difference between extraordinary and miraculous, 89 n;
   if the evidence for a miracle amounted to proof we should have one
           proof opposed by another proof, for the proof against a
           miracle is as complete as possible;
   an event is not miraculous unless there is a uniform experience,
           that is a proof, against it, 90;
   definition of miracle, 90 n;
   hence no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle unless its
           falsehood would be more miraculous than the event it
           establishes, 91;
   as a fact the evidence for a miracle has never amounted to proof, 92;
   the passion for the wonderful in human nature, 93;
   prevalence of miracles in savage and early periods and their
           diminution with civilization, 94;
   the evidence for miracles in matters of religion opposed by the
           almost infinite number of witnesses for rival religions, 95;
   value of human testimony diminished by temptation to pose as a
           prophet or apostle, 97;
   no testimony for a miracle has ever amounted to a probability, much
           less to a proof, and if it did amount to a proof it would be
           opposed by another perfect proof, 98;
   so a miracle can never be proved so as to be the foundation of a
           system of religion, 99;
   a conclusion which confounds those who base the Christian religion
           on reason, not on faith, 100;
   the Christian religion cannot be believed without a miracle which
           will subvert the principle of a man's understanding and give
           him a determination to believe what is most contrary to
           custom and experience, 101.

 Necessary
   connexion (v. _Cause_).
 
 Necessity
   two definitions of, 75.
 
   A. _and Liberty_, 62-81;
   the controversy is based on ambiguity, and all mankind have always
           been of the same opinion on this subject, 63;
   our idea of the necessity of matter arises solely from observed
           uniformity and consequent inference, circumstances which are
           allowed by all men to exist in respect of human action, 64;
   history and knowledge of human nature assume such uniformity, 65,
   which does not exclude variety due to education and progress, 66;
   irregular actions to be explained by secret operation of contrary
           causes, 67;
   the inconstancy of human action, its constant character, as of winds
           and weather, 68;
   we all acknowledge and draw inferences from the regular conjunction
           of motives and actions, 69;
   history, politics, and morals show this, and the possibility of
           combining moral and natural evidence shows that they have a
           common origin, 70;
   the reluctance to acknowledge the necessity of actions due to a
           lingering belief that we can see real connexion behind mere
           conjunction, 71;
   we should begin with the examination not of the soul and will but of
           brute matter, 72;
   the prevalence of the liberty doctrine due to a false sensation of
           liberty and a false experiment, 72 n;
   though this question is the most contentious of all, mankind has
           always agreed in the doctrine of liberty, if we mean by it
           that hypothetical liberty which consists in a power of
           acting or not acting according to the determinations of our
           will, and which can be ascribed to every one who is not a
           prisoner, 73;
   liberty when opposed to necessity, and not merely to constraint, is
           the same as chance, 74.
 
   B. _Both necessity and liberty are necessary to morality_, this
           doctrine of necessity only alters our view of matter and so
           is at least innocent, 75;
   rewards and punishments imply the uniform influence of motives, and
           connexion of character and action: if necessity be denied,
           a man may commit any crime and be no worse for it, 76;
   liberty also essential to morality, 77.
 
   Objection that doctrine of necessity and of a regular chain of
           causes either makes God the cause of evil, or abolishes evil
           in actions, 78;
   Stoic answer, that the whole system is good, is specious but
           ineffectual in practice, 79;
   no speculative argument can counteract the impulse of our natural
           sentiments to blame certain actions, 80;
   how God can be the cause of all actions without being the author of
           moral evil is a mystery with which philosophy cannot deal,
           81.
 
 Negative
   inconceivability of, 132.

   between thought and course of nature, 44-5.
 
 Perception
   and external objects, 119 f. (v. _Scepticism_, _Impression_,
           _Idea_).
 
 Philosophy
   moral, two branches of, abstruse and practical, 1-5;
   gratifies innocent curiosity, 6;
   metaphysics tries to deal with matters inaccessible to human
           understanding, 6.
 
   True, must lay down limits of understanding, 7 (cf. 113);
   a large part of, consists in mental geography, 8;
   may hope to resolve principles of mind into still more general
           principles, 9.
 
   Natural, only staves off our ignorance a little longer, as moral or
           metaphysical philosophy serves only to discover larger
           portions of it, 26;
   academical, or sceptical, flatters no bias or passion except love of
           truth, and so has few partisans, 34;
   though it destroy speculation, cannot destroy action, for nature
           steps in and asserts her rights, 34;
   moral, inferior to mathematics in clearness of ideas, superior in
           shortness of arguments, 48.
 
   Controversies in, due to ambiguity of terms, 62.
 
   Disputes in, not be settled by appeal to dangerous consequences of a
           doctrine, 75.
 
   Speculative, entirely indifferent to the peace of society and
           security of government, 104 (cf. 114).
 
   All the philosophy in the world, and all the religion in the world,
           which is nothing but a species of philosophy, can never
           carry us beyond the usual course of experience, 113.
 
   Happiness of, to have originated in an age and country of freedom
           and toleration, 102.
 
 Points
   physical, indivisible, 124 n.
 
 Power
   50 f, 60 n. (v. _Cause_ D).
 
 Probability
   46 f. (v. _Cause_, B).
 
 Probable
   arguments, 38, 46 n.
 
 Production
   50 n.
 
 Promises
   not the foundation of justice, 257.
 
 Proof
   46 n, 86-101 (v. _Miracles_, _Demonstrative_).
 
 Providence
   102-115 (v. _God_).
 
   The sole argument for a divine existence is from the marks of design
           in nature; must not infer greater power in the cause than is
           necessary to produce the observed effects, nor argue from
           such an inferred cause to any new effects which have not
           been observed, 105;
   so must not infer in God more power, wisdom, and benevolence than
           appears in nature, 106;
   so it is unnecessary to try and save the honour of the Gods by
           assuming the intractability of matter or the observance of
           general laws, 107;
   to argue from effects to unknown causes, and then from these causes
           to unknown effects, is a gross sophism, 108.
 
   From imperfect exercise of justice in this world we cannot infer its
           perfect exercise in a future world, 109;
   we must regulate our conduct solely by the experienced train of
           events, 110;
   in case of human works of art we can infer the perfect from the
           imperfect, but that is because we know man by experience and
           also know other instances of his art, 111-112;
   but in the case of God we only know him by his productions, and do
           not know any class of beings to which he belongs, 113;
   and the universe, his production, is entirely singular and does not
           belong to a known species of things, 115.
 
 Punishment
   requires doctrines of necessity and liberty, 76 (v. _Necessity_).
 
 Pyrrhonism
   126.
 
 
 Qualities
   primary and secondary, 122.
 
 Quantity
   and number, the only objects of demonstration, the parts of them
           being entirely similar, 131.
 
 
 Real
   presence, 86.
 
 Reality
   and thought, 44.
 
 Realism
   of the vulgar, 118.
 
 Reason
   (a)  opp. intuition, 29;
   opp. experience, 28, 36 n.
 
   (b) Corrects sympathy and senses, 117.
   No match for nature, 34.
 
   Fallacious, compared with instinct, 45.
 
   Of men and animals, 84 n.
 
   (c) attempts to destroy, by reasoning, 124;
   objections to abstract reasoning, 124 f. (v. _Scepticism_).
 
   (d) _Reasoning_.
 
   Two kinds of, demonstrative and moral, 30, 46 n, 132;
   moral, divided into general and particular, 132;
   produces demonstrations, proofs, and probabilities, 46 n.
 
   Probable (v. _Cause_, 28-32).
 
 Relations
   of ideas, discoverable by the mere operation of thought,
           independently of the existence of any object, 20.
 
 Religion
   a kind of philosophy, 113 (v. _Miracles, Providence_).
 
 Resemblance
   19, 41 (v. _Similarity_).
 
 Resistance
   and idea of power, 53 n.
 
 
 Scepticism
   A. antecedent to study and philosophy, such as Descartes' universal
           doubt of our faculties, would be incurable: in a more
           moderate sense it is useful, 116 (cf. 129-30);
   extravagant attempts of, to destroy reason by reasoning, 124.
 
   No such absurd creature as a man who has no opinion about anything
           at all, 116;
   admits of no answer and produces no conviction, 122 n. (cf. 34, 126,
           128).
 
   B. _As to the Senses_, 117-123.
 
   The ordinary criticisms of our senses only show that they have to be
           corrected by Reason, 117;
   more profound arguments show that the vulgar belief in external
           objects is baseless, and that the objects we see are nothing
           but perceptions which are fleeting copies of other
           existences, 118;
   even this philosophy is hard to justify; it appeals neither to
           natural instinct, nor to experience, for experience tells
           nothing of objects which perceptions resemble, 119;
   the appeal to the _veracity of God_ is useless, 120;
   and scepticism is here triumphant, 121.
 
   _The distinction between primary and secondary qualities_ is useless,
           for the supposed primary qualities are only perceptions, 122;
   and Berkeley's theory that ideas of primary qualities are obtained by
           abstraction is impossible, 122, 122 n;
   if matter is deprived of both primary and secondary qualities there
           is nothing left except a mere something which is not worth
           arguing about, 123.
 
   C. _As to Reason_, 124-130.
 
   Attempt to destroy Reason by reasoning extravagant, 124;
   objection to _abstract reasoning_ because it asserts infinite
           divisibility of extension which is shocking to common sense,
           124,
   and infinite divisibility of time, 125;
   yet the ideas attacked are so clear and distinct that scepticism
           becomes sceptical about itself, 125.
 
   Popular objections to _moral reasoning_ about matter of fact, based
           on weakness of understanding, variation of judgement, and
           disagreement among men, confuted by action, 126;
   philosophical objections, that we only experience conjunction and
           that inference is based on custom, 127;
   excessive scepticism refuted by its uselessness and put to flight by
           the most trivial event in life, 128.
 
   Mitigated scepticism or academical philosophy useful as a corrective
           and as producing caution and modesty, 129;
   and as limiting understanding to proper objects, 130;
   all reasoning which is not either abstract, about quantity and
           number, or experimental, about matters of fact, is sophistry
           and illusion, 132.

 Will

           only of sequence of motions on will, 52;
   so with power of will over our minds in raising up new ideas, 53.
 
   Of God, cannot be used to explain motion, 57.
